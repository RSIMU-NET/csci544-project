The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), charged with administering the NPDES program, has issued national guidance and regulations to assist the states in establishing standards to protect the quality of their waters and in issuing permits to facilities to limit discharges of pollutants. Both the act and EPA\u2019s regulations give the states and EPA considerable flexibility in implementing the NPDES program.", "While the Clean Water Act requires all states to adopt water quality standards, EPA authorizes qualified states to issue NPDES permits. Currently, 40 states have obtained such authority; in the remaining 10 states, the cognizant EPA regional offices issue the permits. In issuing the permits, the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities may (1) impose limits on the discharges of specific pollutants, (2) require the facilities to monitor the levels of pollutants they discharge, or (3) determine that no controls are warranted.", "As agreed with your office, our objectives in this review were to (1) determine whether differences exist in whether and how the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities control pollutants in the discharge permits they issue, (2) identify the causes of any differences, and (3) obtain information on EPA\u2019s oversight of the states\u2019 water quality standards and policies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The objective of the Clean Water Act is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s waters. The Congress established a series of national goals and policies to achieve this objective, including what is referred to as \u201cfishable/swimmable\u201d water quality. That is, whenever attainable, the quality of the water should be such that it provides for the protection of fish, shellfish, wildlife, and recreation in and on the water. To help meet national water quality goals, the act established the NPDES program, which limits the discharge of pollutants through two basic approaches\u2014one based on technology and the other on water quality.", "Under the technology-based approach, facilities must stay within the discharge limits attainable under current technologies for treating water pollution. EPA has issued national minimum technology requirements for municipal facilities and 50 categories of industrial dischargers. The states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities use these requirements to establish discharge limits for specific pollutants. In contrast, under the water-quality-based approach, facilities must meet discharge limits derived from states\u2019 water quality standards, which generally consist of (1) \u201cdesignated uses\u201d for the water bodies (e.g., propagation of fish and wildlife, drinking water, and recreation) and (2) narrative or numeric criteria to protect the designated uses. Narrative criteria are generally statements that describe the desired water quality goal, such as \u201cno toxics in toxic amounts.\u201d Numeric criteria for specific pollutants are generally expressed as concentration levels and target certain toxic pollutants that EPA has designated as \u201cpriority pollutants.\u201d", "In addition to adopting water quality standards, the states may also establish policies concerning certain technical factors that affect the implementation of the standards in the discharge permits. For example, many states have adopted policies for (1) establishing mixing zones (limited areas where discharges mix with receiving waters and where the numeric criteria can be exceeded), (2) determining the amount of available dilution (the ratio of the low flow of the receiving waters to the flow of the discharge), and (3) considering background concentration (the levels of pollutants already present in the receiving waters).", "When the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities are deciding how extensively the pollutants should be controlled in a facility\u2019s permit, they first look to the technology-based standards. If the discharge limits derived by applying these standards are not low enough to protect the designated uses of the applicable water body, the permitting authorities turn to the state\u2019s water quality standards to develop more stringent limits. To achieve the tighter limits, a facility may have to install more advanced treatment technology or take measures to reduce the amounts of pollutants needing treatment. For additional information on the role of EPA\u2019s headquarters and regional offices and the state agencies in establishing standards and implementing them in permits, see appendix I.", "As agreed with your office, this report focuses on the water-quality-based approach to controlling pollution and the way the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities are implementing water quality standards in the NPDES permits issued to \u201cmajor\u201d facilities. As of July 1995, approximately 59,000 municipal and industrial facilities nationwide had received permits under the NPDES program, and about 6,800 of these permits were for major facilities, including about 4,000 municipal facilities and 2,800 industrial dischargers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 and EPA\u2019s Permitting Authorities Vary in Whether and How They Control Pollutants in Discharge Permits", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the data on municipal permits for five commonly discharged toxic pollutants disclosed that decisions about whether and how to control pollutants differed both from state to state and within states.

We found that when the permitting authorities decided that some type of control was warranted, some consistently established numeric discharge limits in their permits, and others imposed monitoring requirements in all or almost all cases.", "For example, North Carolina issued 93 permits during our review period and, whenever it determined that a pollutant warranted controls, it always established numeric discharge limits rather than impose monitoring requirements. Other states, such as New York and West Virginia, also consistently established numeric limits for controlling the five pollutants we examined. In contrast, New Jersey issued 44 permits during our review period and, except for 1 permit that contained a limit for copper, the state always imposed monitoring requirements instead of discharge limits when the state determined that controls were warranted. Oregon, among other states, made similar decisions, as did EPA\u2019s Region VI when it wrote permits for Louisiana, a state not authorized to issue NPDES permits.", "We also found that some states, such as Vermont and Arkansas, had not imposed discharge limits or monitoring requirements in the following instances in which EPA\u2019s regional officials said that such controls may be warranted.", "In Vermont, none of the discharge permits for major municipal facilities contained discharge limits or monitoring requirements for the five metals. However, at our request, the cognizant EPA regional staff (in Region I) reviewed 4 of the 15 municipal permits issued by Vermont and determined that for 2 of the facilities, limits or monitoring requirements would probably be appropriate. Vermont officials agreed to review the permits and consider additional requirements.", "Arkansas, with one exception, had not imposed either limits or monitoring requirements in its municipal permits for the toxic metals we examined.", "State officials are allowing these facilities to continue operating under \u201cold\u201d permits rather than reissuing them. The officials told us that if the permits were to be formally reopened, the state would be obligated to apply EPA-imposed water quality standards for the metals. Arkansas officials believe that these standards are too stringent and that the facilities would engage the state in a costly appeal process if limits were imposed. Officials from the cognizant EPA regional office (Region VI) said that the Arkansas permits should contain discharge limits but that EPA does not have the authority to impose such limits in a state authorized to issue permits when the state simply declines to reissue them. EPA\u2019s only recourse would be to take back responsibility for the program\u2014an unrealistic option.", "For facilities, both monitoring requirements and discharge limits can be costly to implement. According to officials in EPA\u2019s Permits Division, the costs of monitoring depend on the frequency of required sampling and on the types of pollutants that must be tested. The costs of installing advanced treatment equipment to meet discharge limits are usually much higher. These officials also said that because of these differences in cost, the facilities that are subject to monitoring requirements generally enjoy an economic advantage over the facilities that must meet discharge limits, all other things being equal. Furthermore, the facilities that are subject to neither type of control enjoy an economic advantage over the facilities that must comply with limits or monitoring requirements.", "Overall, our analysis disclosed that for each of the five pollutants, about 30 percent of the permits contained limits or monitoring requirements, while about 70 percent contained neither type of control. According to EPA\u2019s permitting regulations and guidance, there can be legitimate reasons for imposing no controls over some pollutants: Generally, either the facilities are not discharging the pollutants or their discharges are deemed too low to interfere with the designated uses of the applicable water bodies. See appendix II for a summary of the control decisions across the nation for the five toxic pollutants included in our analysis and for additional discussion of the reasons for not imposing limits or monitoring requirements on some pollutant discharges.

To illustrate these differences, we extracted data on numeric limits as part of our analysis of EPA\u2019s data on municipal permits. Specifically, from the 1,407 permits for municipal facilities issued nationwide between February 5, 1993, and March 21, 1995, we identified those facilities discharging into freshwater (1) whose permits contained discharge limits for one or more of the five toxic metals and (2) whose plant capacity, or design flow, was included in EPA\u2019s database.", "For each of the five pollutants, we found significant differences in the amounts that facilities were allowed to discharge across the nation\u2014even for facilities of similar capacity. In the case of zinc, both the highest and the lowest limits were established in the same state. Figure 1 shows the results of our analysis.", "As figure 1 indicates, differences in the numeric limits for the same pollutant can be significant\u2014in the case of mercury, about 775 times greater at one facility than at another facility of similar capacity. We discuss the causes of the differences in discharge limits later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in States\u2019 NPDES Programs Have Raised Concerns in Neighboring Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Variations in the discharge limits, or in the standards and procedures used to derive these limits, have been a source of concern, particularly when neighboring jurisdictions share water bodies and the differences are readily apparent to the permitting authorities and discharging facilities, as the following examples illustrate: In 1995, an industrial facility in Pennsylvania challenged a discharge limit for arsenic because Pennsylvania\u2019s numeric criterion was 2,500 times more stringent than that used by the neighboring state of New York, into which the discharge flowed. Among other things, the discharger argued that having to comply with the more stringent criterion created an economic disadvantage for the company. Eventually, Pennsylvania agreed to reissue the permit with a monitoring requirement for arsenic instead of a discharge limit. The state has also revised its water quality standards using the less stringent criterion.", "Oklahoma challenged the 1985 permit that EPA issued to an Arkansas municipal wastewater treatment facility that discharges into a tributary of the Illinois River. One of the key issues in the case was Oklahoma\u2019s contention that the facility\u2019s permit, which was based on Arkansas\u2019s water quality standards, contained limits that would violate Oklahoma\u2019s water quality standards when the facility\u2019s discharge moved downstream. As a result, Oklahoma officials maintained, the river would not achieve its designation as \u201coutstanding natural resource water,\u201d a special classification designed to protect high-quality waters. Although EPA has the authority to ensure that discharges in the states located upstream do not violate the water quality standards in the states located downstream, the agency determined that this case did not warrant such action, in part because the discharge allowed under the permit would not produce a detectable violation of Oklahoma\u2019s standards. In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA\u2019s issuance of the Arkansas permit was reasonable.", "Concerns among states about differences in water quality standards and the policies that affect their implementation may become more common in the future. According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey,many states receive more than half of their water pollution from neighboring states. While much of this pollution may be attributed to diffuse\u2014or \u201cnonpoint\u201d\u2014sources, such as agricultural runoff, according to an official from the U.S. Geological Survey, the discharges from municipal and industrial facilities allowed under permits also contribute to interstate pollution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Contribute to Differences in Controlling Pollutant Discharges", "paragraphs": ["Both the act and EPA\u2019s regulations give the states and EPA considerable flexibility in implementing the NPDES program. The permitting authorities differ considerably in how they assess the likelihood that states\u2019 water quality standards will be exceeded, as well as in how they decide what controls are warranted. If they decide that discharge limits are warranted, these limits can differ widely because of differences in the (1) states\u2019 water quality standards and (2) implementation policies that come into play when the permitting authorities \u201ctranslate\u201d general water quality standards into limits for specific facilities in specific locations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Permitting Authorities Differ in How They Decide on the Need for Controls Over Pollutant Discharges", "paragraphs": ["We found differences in how the permitting authorities determine that a pollutant has the \u201creasonable potential\u201d to violate a state\u2019s water quality standard and prevent the designated use of a water body from being achieved. In EPA\u2019s Region I, for example, the permitting officials believe that one or two samples indicating the potential for a violation may suffice to justify imposing a discharge limit. In contrast, given the same evidence, officials in EPA\u2019s Region VI generally impose requirements for monitoring in order to collect data over a longer period of time\u2014up to the 5-year life of the permit.", "Officials in the Permits Division at EPA headquarters agreed that there are differences in how the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities decide whether and how to impose controls over pollutant discharges. The officials said that a key element in these differences is the amount and type of data the authorities require to determine reasonable potential; some permitting authorities are comfortable with establishing discharge limits on the basis of limited information, while others want to collect more data and impose monitoring requirements. To assist the states and EPA\u2019s regional offices, EPA has issued national guidance, including a suggested methodology and other options for determining reasonable potential. However, Permits Division officials emphasized that the law and applicable regulations provide for flexibility in decisions on reasonable potential and other aspects of the NPDES program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Setting Discharge Limits Offers Many Opportunities for Permitting Authorities to Exercise Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["The states have exercised the flexibility available within the Clean Water Act and EPA\u2019s regulations to (1) adopt different water quality standards and (2) apply different policies in implementing these standards in permits.

For example, if a facility is discharging into a water body designated for recreational use, the discharge limits are likely to be less stringent than they would be if the water body were designated for use as a drinking water supply.", "Water quality standards also differ in terms of the numeric criteria the states adopt to ensure that the designated uses of the water will be achieved or maintained. EPA has provided guidance to the states on developing these criteria. Some states have adopted EPA\u2019s numeric criteria (e.g., a human health criterion for mercury that allows for no more than 0.144 micrograms per liter) as their own, and others have developed different criteria that reflect regional conditions and concerns. For example, Texas modified EPA\u2019s criteria to account for higher rates of fish consumption in the state.", "Another significant source of differences in the states\u2019 water quality standards is the cancer risk level that is selected for carcinogenic pollutants. For example, Connecticut typically bases its numeric criteria for these pollutants on a risk level of 1 excess cancer case per 1 million people, while Arkansas bases its criteria on a risk level of 1 excess cancer case per 100,000 people. Thus, Connecticut\u2019s criteria are 10 times more stringent than Arkansas\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Implementation Policies", "paragraphs": ["Many states have established implementation policies that can significantly affect the application of water quality standards in establishing the discharge limits for individual facilities. These policies address technical factors such as mixing zones, dilution, and background concentration.", "The states differ in their policies for mixing zones\u2014limited areas where the facilities\u2019 discharges mix with the receiving waters and numeric criteria can be exceeded. The states\u2019 policies can influence the stringency of the discharge limits by restricting where such zones are allowed and/or by defining their size and shape. In Texas, for instance, the size of mixing zones in streams is typically limited to an area 100 feet upstream and 300 feet downstream from the discharge point; other states apply different standards or do not allow mixing zones in some types of water bodies. In general, the discharge limits will be less stringent for a facility located in a state that allows mixing zones than for a facility in a state that requires facilities to meet numeric criteria at the end of the discharge pipe.", "The states\u2019 policies on dilution\u2014the ratio of the low flow of the receiving waters to the flow of the discharge\u2014can also influence the stringency of the discharge limits. In general, the larger the volume of the receiving waters available to dilute, or reduce the concentration of, the pollutants being discharged, the less stringent the discharge limit. Thus, all other things being equal, the discharge limit for a facility located on the Mississippi River will be less stringent than the limit for a similar facility located on a smaller river. The states also use different assumptions in computing the flow of a facility\u2019s discharge (e.g., the highest monthly average during the preceding 2 years or the highest 30-day average expected during the life of the permit) and the low flow of the receiving waters (e.g., the lowest average flow during 7 consecutive days within the past 10 years or the lowest 1-day flow that occurs within 3 years).", "The states also have different policies on background concentration\u2014the level of pollutants already present in the receiving waters as a result of naturally occurring pollutants, permitted discharges from upstream, spills, unregulated discharges, or some combination of these sources. In general, the higher the level of the background concentration, the more stringent the discharge limit will be because the extent of the existing pollution affects the amounts that facilities may discharge without violating the water quality standards. Connecticut, for example, assumes background concentrations of zero in deriving limits, while Colorado uses actual data. All other things being equal, the discharge limits established by Connecticut will be less stringent than those set by Colorado whenever the actual background concentration is greater than zero."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Oversight of Permitting Policies Is Limited, but New Initiatives May Promote Greater Consistency", "paragraphs": ["EPA, through its regional offices, periodically reviews the states\u2019 water quality standards; if it determines that the standards are inconsistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act\u2014because, for example, the standards do not adequately protect the designated uses of the water or are not scientifically defensible\u2014it disapproves them. However, EPA does not consistently review policies that could significantly affect the implementation of the standards in permits, either when a state submits its standards for approval or when an EPA regional office reviews individual permits before they are issued.", "As a result of an apparent inconsistency in EPA\u2019s regulations, some states are not including the relevant implementation policies when they submit their water quality standards to EPA for review and approval. According to the regulations, the states must submit to EPA for review information on the designated uses of their waters and the numeric or narrative criteria for specific pollutants as well as \u201cinformation on general policies\u201d that may affect the application or implementation of the standards. However, EPA\u2019s regulations also provide that the states may exercise discretion over what general policies they include in their standards. In EPA\u2019s regions I and VI, for example, program officials believe that (1) the states are under no obligation to submit their implementation policies, such as their policies on considering background concentration, for EPA\u2019s review and (2) EPA cannot require the states to do so. Officials at EPA\u2019s headquarters and regional offices acknowledge that there is some confusion about what information the states must submit for review.", "EPA officials maintain that even if the agency has not reviewed the states\u2019 implementation policies in the course of approving the standards, it can control the use of these policies when EPA\u2019s regional offices review individual permits and have the opportunity to disapprove those permits that do not adequately protect water quality. However, on average EPA\u2019s regional offices review only about 10 percent of the permits issued to major facilities by the 40 states authorized to issue permits. Moreover, EPA is considering a new initiative that will eliminate reviews of permits before issuance and will instead provide for postissuance reviews of a sample of permits. According to the Acting Director of EPA\u2019s Permits Division, such reviews are a better use of EPA\u2019s resources because they require less staff time and EPA\u2019s reviewers will not be pressured to meet deadlines for public comment. However, he said that, as a general rule, EPA will not reopen permits. Thus, identified problems may not be addressed until the permits come up for renewal, usually every 5 years. If EPA becomes aware of a significant problem, the regional office will work with the applicable state to attempt to remedy the situation.", "Because EPA relies on its regional offices to oversee the states\u2019 implementation policies, it does not maintain national information on these policies. Moreover, except for some efforts by its regional offices, EPA has not assessed the impact of the differences among the states. EPA headquarters officials told us that although such an assessment might be useful, they have no plans to conduct one, in part because they do not have the resources or a specific legislative requirement to do so. In some instances, EPA\u2019s regional offices have tried to identify and resolve differences in the states\u2019 implementation policies because they have been concerned about the extent of these differences. However, some states have resisted these initiatives on the basis that they should not be required to comply with policies that are not required nationwide.", "EPA is considering regulatory changes that could enhance the agency\u2019s ability to monitor the states\u2019 implementation policies. According to a March 1995 draft of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA plans to solicit comments on, among other things, the kind of information on implementation policies that the states should be required to submit for EPA\u2019s approval. In the case of mixing zones, for example, EPA is seeking comments on whether the states should be required to describe their methods for determining the location, size, shape, and other characteristics of the mixing zones that they will allow. The Chief of EPA\u2019s Water Quality Standards Branch told us that although other priorities could postpone the rulemaking, EPA has not revised the applicable regulations since 1983, and some changes are therefore needed.", "While potential regulatory changes are as yet undefined, the Office of Water has embarked on a strategy for watershed management that could, by itself, achieve greater consistency among the states\u2019 NPDES programs, including the standards and policies the states use to derive the discharge limits for the facilities within the same watershed. Watershed management means identifying all sources of pollution and integrating controls on pollution within hydrologically defined drainage basins, known as watersheds. Under this approach, all of the stakeholders in a watershed\u2019s area\u2014including federal, state, and local regulatory authorities; municipal and industrial dischargers; other potential sources of pollution; and interested citizens\u2014agree on how best to restore and maintain water quality within the watershed.", "In March 1994, the Permits Division of EPA\u2019s Office of Water published its NPDES Watershed Strategy to describe the division\u2019s plans for incorporating the NPDES program\u2019s functions into the broader watershed management approach. Although the strategy does not specifically discuss interstate watersheds, EPA officials believe that the states will identify such areas and, where reasonable, coordinate the issuance of NPDES permits.

This wastewater is likely to include toxic pollutants, primarily from industrial sources whose waste must be pretreated to reduce or eliminate such pollutants before it enters the municipal treatment facilities. According to officials in EPA\u2019s Permits Division, a major reason for the lack of discharge limits and monitoring requirements is the existence of effective pretreatment programs. These officials believe that because such programs play an important role in reducing the level of toxic pollutants entering municipal treatment facilities, the lack of controls disclosed in our analysis is not surprising. They consider our findings to be an indication that the pretreatment programs are working as intended.", "However, other factors suggest that additional controls may be warranted. First, officials from EPA\u2019s Permits Division acknowledge that in some cases, the permitting authorities have been slow to impose controls in municipal permits on the discharges of toxic metals or to adopt numeric criteria for such metals in their water quality standards. In addition, the pretreatment programs primarily focus on industrial customers and, as we reported in 1991, nonindustrial wastes from both commercial and residential sources can be a significant source of toxic pollutants entering municipal wastewater treatment facilities. According to the most comprehensive study cited in the report (a 1979 EPA survey of municipal treatment facilities in four major cities), nonindustrial sources contribute nearly 70 percent of the copper and over 30 percent of the lead, mercury, and zinc entering the municipal facilities. Our report also cited other, more recent studies that identified significant contributions of toxic metals from nonindustrial sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Decisions on Water-Quality-Based Controls for Five Metals", "paragraphs": ["The following table, based on data extracted from EPA\u2019s Permits Compliance System database, shows the types of controls, if any, imposed by the states\u2019 and EPA\u2019s permitting authorities for the five toxic metals in all of the permits issued to major municipal wastewater treatment facilities from February 5, 1993 through March 21, 1995.

We analyzed these data to determine the type of controls, if any, on five toxic metal pollutants typically discharged by municipal facilities (cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc). For the permits that contained discharge limits for the five selected pollutants, we obtained those limits to determine the range for each pollutant at facilities of similar capacity. For the permits that contained the highest and lowest limits, we verified the information in EPA\u2019s database with the applicable EPA regional office. As agreed with the requester\u2019s office, we did not attempt to determine the appropriateness of the differences in discharge limits because such an assessment would have been too complex and time-consuming.", "We confined our analysis of variations in the discharge limits to municipal facilities because EPA\u2019s Permits Compliance System database does not contain information that distinguishes between technology-based and water-quality-based discharge limits for industrial facilities. However, because EPA has not issued any technology-based standards for toxic pollutants that are applicable to municipal facilities, the discharge limits for such pollutants were derived from water-quality-based standards. According to EPA, water-quality-based controls are considered for virtually all major facilities, and an estimated 30 percent of the permits for these facilities nationwide actually contain limits based on water quality.", "To obtain information on the causes of the variations in the states\u2019 NPDES permits, we interviewed the EPA officials responsible for the NPDES and Water Quality Standards programs at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and regional offices in Boston, Massachusetts (Region I); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Region III); Chicago, Illinois (Region V); Dallas, Texas (Region VI); and Denver, Colorado (Region VIII). We reviewed the applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act, EPA\u2019s regulations, and guidance on NPDES permits and water quality standards. We also interviewed state officials in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Utah and reviewed documents on these states\u2019 water quality standards, implementation policies, and NPDES permitting activities.", "To obtain information on EPA\u2019s role in monitoring the policies and procedures that the states use in deriving discharge limits, we reviewed applicable regulations and guidance, including EPA\u2019s preliminary draft of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential revisions to the agency\u2019s regulation on water quality standards and EPA\u2019s NPDES Watershed Strategy. We also discussed EPA\u2019s oversight authority with officials from EPA\u2019s Permits Division, Water Quality Standards Branch, Office of General Counsel, and selected regional offices.
