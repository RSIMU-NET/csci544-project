Many of these entities targeted employers and policyholders in multiple states, and, of the seven states with 25 or more entities, five were located in the South. DOL and the states reported that the 144 unique entities (1) sold coverage to at least 15,000 employers, including many small employers; (2) covered more than 200,000 policyholders; and (3) left at least $252 million in unpaid medical claims, only about 21 percent of which had been recovered at the time of GAO's 2003 survey. States and DOL often identified these entities based on consumer complaints. DOL often relied on states to stop these entities within their borders while DOL focused its investigations on larger entities operating in multiple states and, in three cases, obtained court orders to stop these entities nationwide. Most of the states' prevention activities were geared to increasing public awareness and notifying the agents who sold this coverage, while DOL focused its efforts on alerting employer groups and small employers. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOL, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Florida, and Texas highlighted their efforts to increase public awareness, coordinate investigations, and take enforcement actions regarding these entities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As health insurance premiums in the private health insurance market  increased at double-digit rates over the past several years, some employers,  particularly small employers with fewer than 50 employees, have faced  difficulty in obtaining affordable coverage. Small employers cited cost as  the major obstacle they faced in providing health care coverage to their  employees. As they looked for affordable options, some employers and  individuals have purchased health care coverage from certain entities that  have not complied with state insurance law or with federal and state  requirements for coverage provided to multiple employers. These  unauthorized entities\u2014also sometimes referred to as bogus entities or as  scams or fraudulent insurers\u2014may price their products below market rates  but may not meet financial and benefit protections typically associated  with health insurance products that are authorized, licensed, and regulated  by the states. These entities collect premiums from individuals or  employers but may not pay some or all legitimate claims filed by the  policyholders or those covered by the policies.", "According to several media reports during the past few years, employers  and individuals may increasingly be targeted by entities not authorized to  sell health coverage. These entities were also particularly problematic in  two earlier periods during the past 30 years\u2014the mid-1970s to early 1980s  and the late 1980s to early 1990s. When these entities do not pay legitimate  claims, different parties can be harmed, including individual policyholders  who may be held responsible for their own medical bills, which can mean  owing thousands of dollars. Providers are also at increased risk of not  being paid for services already rendered. Concerned about this situation,  you asked us to determine the prevalence of these entities and their impact  on employers, especially small employers, and policyholders. Specifically,  we examined  1. the number and types of unauthorized entities selling health benefits  that federal and state governments identified from 2000 through 2002; 2. the number of employers, including small employers, and policyholders  covered by these entities, the amount of associated unpaid claims, and  the amounts recovered from these entities; and 3. the methods federal and state governments have employed to identify  such entities and to stop or prevent them from continuing to operate.", "To identify the number of unauthorized entities from 2000 through 2002, we  analyzed information we obtained from the federal and state governments.  We obtained federal-level data from the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL)  Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). EBSA conducts civil  and criminal investigations of employer-based health benefits plans, which  include entities that did not meet federal and state requirements. To obtain  state-level data, we surveyed and received responses from officials at  departments of insurance or equivalent offices in all 50 states and the  District of Columbia. Because multiple states and EBSA provided  information on some of the same entities, we relied on several different  sources, along with our judgment regarding similar entity names, to  consolidate the federal and state information and identify the number of  unique entities. Some states did not report on entities that they were still  investigating. Therefore, the number we report likely represents the  minimum number of unauthorized entities operating from 2000 through  2002. We also asked states to provide information on a related type of  problematic arrangement\u2014discount arrangements that may be  misrepresented as insurance. To determine the types of entities, the  number of employers and policyholders covered, the amount of unpaid  claims, and the amounts recovered from these entities, we analyzed the  data EBSA and the states reported to us. DOL and the states could not  provide comparable data on how many people in total were affected by  these entities. Therefore, we combined the data that states reported on the  number of policyholders with the data that DOL reported on the number of  participants and refer to them throughout this report as policyholders.  Most states and DOL reported to us from March through June 2003. The  data we report likely underestimate the total numbers of employers and  policyholders covered as well as the amounts of unpaid claims and  amounts recovered to pay for these claims because neither EBSA nor  states could provide this information for some entities. To identify the  methods that the federal and state governments employed to identify these  entities and to stop and prevent them from continuing to operate, we  analyzed information obtained from DOL, our state survey, state insurance  departments\u2019 Web sites, and other research, as well as through interviews  with federal and state officials; officials of several associations, including  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); and experts  on these entities. We interviewed federal officials at DOL headquarters and  at three EBSA regional offices\u2014Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco\u2014and  state officials at insurance departments in four states\u2014Colorado, Florida,  Georgia, and Texas. We selected the EBSA regional offices and states based  on recommendations from federal and state officials and others we  contacted who suggested that these regions and states had been affected  by relatively more of these entities. We also interviewed association  officials and several experts who had published research addressing  unauthorized or fraudulent entities. We also reviewed relevant literature.  While we obtained information on the methods that federal and state  governments employed to identify these entities and to stop and prevent  them from operating, we did not evaluate the effectiveness of these  methods.", "Appendix I provides more detailed information on our methodology.

They can  purchase coverage from health insurers, such as local Blue Cross and Blue  Shield plans; other private insurance carriers; or managed care plans, such  as health maintenance organizations.

When small employers offer health coverage, most tend to purchase  insurance rather than self-fund. Only about 12 percent of the  establishments at firms with fewer than 50 employees that offered  coverage in 2001 had a self-funded plan, compared with about 58 percent  of the establishments at firms with 50 or more employees. Moreover, about 76 percent of the establishments at the largest firms\u2014those with 500 or  more employees\u2014offered at least one self-funded plan.", "States regulate the insurance products that many employers purchase.  Each state\u2019s insurance department enforces the state\u2019s insurance statutes  and rules. Among the functions state insurance departments typically  perform are licensing insurance companies, managed care plans, and  agents who sell these products; regulating insurers\u2019 financial operations to  ensure that funds are adequate to pay policyholders\u2019 claims; reviewing  premium rates; reviewing and approving policies and marketing materials  to ensure that they are not vague and misleading; and implementing  consumer protections such as those relating to appeals of denied claims.", "The federal government regulates most private employer-sponsored  pension and welfare benefit plans (including health benefit plans) as  required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  (ERISA). These plans include those provided by an employer, an employee  organization (such as a union), or multiple employers through a multiple  employer welfare arrangement (MEWA). DOL is primarily responsible for  administering Title I of ERISA. Among other requirements, ERISA  establishes plan reporting and disclosure requirements and sets fiduciary standards for the persons who manage and administer the plans.  These requirements generally apply to all ERISA-covered employer- sponsored health plans, but certain requirements vary depending on the  size of the employer or whether the coverage is through an insurance  policy or a self-funded plan. In addition, ERISA generally preempts states  from directly regulating employer-sponsored health plans (while  maintaining states\u2019 ability to regulate insurers and insurance policies).  Therefore, under ERISA, self-funded employer group health plans generally  are not subject to the state oversight that applies to the insurance  companies and health insurance policies. Prior to 1983, a number of states  attempted to subject MEWAs to state insurance law requirements, but  MEWA sponsors often claimed ERISA-plan status and federal preemption.  A 1983 amendment to ERISA made it clear that health and welfare benefits  provided through MEWAs were subject to both federal and state  oversight. The federal and state governments now coordinate the  regulation of MEWAs, with states having the primary responsibility to  regulate the fiscal soundness of MEWAs and to license their operators and  DOL enforcing ERISA\u2019s requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL and States Identified 144 Unique Unauthorized Entities Operating from 2000 through 2002", "paragraphs": ["DOL and the states identified 144 unauthorized entities from 2000 through  2002.

They suggested that the pressure of rising premiums and  decreasing revenues may have increased employers\u2019 demand for more  affordable employee health benefits, particularly among small employers,  and thereby created an environment where unauthorized entities could  spread. From 2000 through 2002, firms with fewer than 50 workers  experienced an average annual increase in their workers\u2019 health benefits of  about 13.3 percent, whereas firms with 50 or more workers experienced an  average annual increase of 10.9 percent. The United States economy also  showed signs of weakness in the third quarter of 2000 when it experienced  growth of 0.6 percent, and suffered a recession in 2001. The economy\u2019s  subsequent recovery in 2002 was marked by moderate economic growth  but rising unemployment. Negative or weak growth in employers\u2019 revenues,  compounded by rising premiums particularly for small employers, created  an attractive environment for unauthorized entities, as small employers  and others sought cheaper employee health benefit options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Entities Characterized Themselves as One of Several Common Types of Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["About 80 percent of the unauthorized entities identified by DOL and the  states characterized themselves as associations, professional employer  organizations, unions, single-employer ERISA plans, or some combination  of these arrangements. The operators of these entities often characterized  the entities as one of these common types to give the appearance of being  exempt from state regulation, but often states found that they actually were  subject to state regulation as insurance arrangements or MEWAs. Under  ERISA, both states and the federal government regulate MEWAs, with  states focusing on regulating the fiscal soundness of MEWAs and licensing  their operators and DOL enforcing ERISA\u2019s requirements.", "Specifically, as shown in table 1, 27 percent of the entities identified by the  states and DOL characterized themselves as associations in which  employers or individuals bought health benefits through existing  associations, or through newly created associations established by the  unauthorized entities. For example, Employers Mutual, LLC, an entity that  operated in 2001, sold coverage through an existing association. Employers  Mutual also created 16 associations as vehicles for selling its products. (See  app. II for a more detailed discussion of Employers Mutual, LLC.) In  addition, 26 percent of the entities identified were professional employer  organizations, also known as employee leasing firms, which contracted  with employers to administer employee benefits and perform other  administrative services for contract employees. Another 9 percent of the  entities identified claimed to be union arrangements that would be exempt  from state regulation. However, they lacked legitimate collective  bargaining agreements and were therefore subject to state oversight. Eight  percent of the entities identified characterized themselves as single- employer ERISA plans and claimed to be administering a self-funded plan  for a single employer. Such plans, when administered with funds from one  employer for the benefit of that employer\u2019s workers, are exempt from state  insurance regulation under ERISA.

To help states increase public awareness, NAIC developed  a model consumer alert in the fall of 2001, which it distributed to all the  states and has available on its Web site. (See app. IV.) The four states\u2019  insurance departments also maintained Web sites that allow the public to  search for those companies authorized to conduct insurance business  within their borders. These states have also taken other actions to increase  public awareness. For example, in April 2002, Florida released a public  service announcement to television news markets throughout the state to  warn about these entities. In addition, in the spring of 2003, Florida placed  billboards throughout the state to warn the public through its \u201cVerify  Before You Buy\u201d campaign.

Using  bulletins, newsletters, and other methods, these states warned agents  about these entities, the implications associated with selling their products,  and the need to verify the legitimacy of all entities. Georgia, for example,  sent a warning to insurance agents in May 2002, which highlighted the  characteristics of these entities, reminded agents that they could lose their  licenses and be held liable for paying claims when the entities do not pay,  and noted that the state insurance department Web site contained a list of  all licensed entities. NAIC also developed a model agent alert to help agents  identify these entities. A national association representing agents and  brokers and many state insurance departments distributed this alert. The  Web sites for the four states\u2019 insurance departments contained information  on the enforcement actions they took against agents. The Texas insurance  department\u2019s Web site, for example, provided the disciplinary actions that  the state took as of August 2003 against individuals who acted as agents for  unauthorized insurers.

Although DOL also provided additional information on its criminal  enforcement actions, we did not include these data in the report because  these enforcement actions did not all relate to the investigations of the 69  entities DOL opened from 2000 through 2002 that were the focus of our  analysis.

Finally, NAIC commented that many entities  may be operating under multiple names, which makes it difficult to  precisely count the number of such entities.

In addition, Florida stressed how  unauthorized entities rely on associated entities and persons to succeed  and proliferate. For example, unauthorized entities used licensed and  unlicensed reinsurers, third-party administrators, and agents to help  defraud the public. Florida indicated that these structures made it difficult  for states to detect the entities.", "In its written comments, the Texas Department of Insurance suggested that  we further elaborate on legal actions states have taken against  unauthorized entities. In addition to issuing cease and desist orders, Texas  stressed that states have (1) used restraining orders and injunctions,  similar to DOL, to stop unauthorized entities, (2) assessed penalties against  operators of these entities, and (3) taken actions against agents who sold  unauthorized products. For example, in 2002, Texas placed a major entity  into receivership, seized its assets, and initiated actions to recover more  assets. In 2003, Texas finalized penalties against the operators of  Employers Mutual. In addition, Texas explained that states have devoted  significant resources to penalizing agents who have accepted commissions  from unauthorized entities. In addition to actions we reported, the Texas  Department of Insurance indicated that it has taken other steps to increase  consumer awareness of these entities. For example, Texas said that it had  issued a bulletin to all health insurance companies and claims  administrators warning about unauthorized entities and provided public  information to various news organizations, assisting them with their  reporting on these entities. Texas also highlighted the criminal  investigations the state has conducted and wrote that its insurance fraud  division has referred cases to DOL and others.
