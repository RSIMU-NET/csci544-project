The majority of DOD's space programs were beset by significant cost and schedule growth problems during their development. Most programs are now in production, however, and acquisition problems are not as widespread and significant as they were several years ago. In prior years, GAO has identified a number of actions DOD is taking to improve management and oversight of space program acquisitions.

A few other major space programs, however, have recently experienced setbacks. For example: the Missile Defense Agency's Precision Tracking Space System, which was intended to be a satellite system to track ballistic missiles, has been cancelled due to technical, programmatic and affordability concerns; the Air Force's Space Fence program, which is developing a ground-based radar to track Earth-orbiting objects, continues to experience delays in entering development; and the first launch of the new Global Positioning System satellites has been delayed by 21 months.", "Congress and DOD continue to take steps they believe will improve oversight and management of space systems acquisitions. In the past year, for example, DOD has updated its major acquisition policy with the goal of improving efficiency and productivity in defense spending. Among other things, the policy change adds a requirement for independent development testing for DOD acquisition programs, which officials believe will provide an independent voice on programs' development. However, DOD still faces significant oversight and management challenges, including (1) leadership of a space community that is comprised of a wide variety of users and stakeholders with diverse interests and (2) alignment of the delivery of satellites with corresponding ground systems and user terminals. For instance, in some cases, gaps in delivery can add up to years, meaning that a satellite is launched but not effectively used for years until ground systems become available. One reason DOD has been unable to align the delivery of space system components is because budgeting authority for the components is spread across the military services.", "While most DOD major space system acquisitions have overcome development challenges and are currently being produced and launched, past problems involving large, complicated systems, coupled with the recent fiscal climate of reduced funds, has led DOD to consider efforts that could signal significant changes to the way it acquires and conducts space activities. DOD is considering moving away from its current approach in satellite development\u2014building small numbers of large satellites over a decade or more that meet the needs of many missions and users\u2014toward a more disaggregated architecture involving less complex, smaller, and more numerous satellites. GAO has found that DOD does not yet have sufficient information to make decisions on whether to disaggregate, but it is in the process of gathering that information. In addition, in response to predictions of dramatic increases to the price of launching its satellites, coupled with restrained budgets, DOD has made changes to the way it procures launch vehicles, and is moving forward with plans to allow competition for launch services\u2014a significant shift from past ways of doing business.

Because these systems  can be highly complex, they require large investments of both money and  time to develop, produce and launch. Given the expensive nature of  space systems in today\u2019s constrained government budget environment, it  is essential that DOD manage the acquisition of these systems carefully  and continue to address problems that have plagued space systems  acquisitions in the past decade.", "In the past, DOD has seen program after program experience significant  cost increases coupled with schedule delays. However, in recent years  these problems have largely been overcome for the programs currently in  production, and additional satellites of the same design are now being  launched. With the worst of their acquisition problems behind them, DOD  is beginning to look at potential new directions for the national security  space community, including options for meeting program requirements  through the disaggregation of large space missions into multiple smaller  satellites as a means to increase satellite resiliency and reduce  acquisition costs and development time. In addition, DOD has been  introducing significant changes to the way it acquires space launch  services, by transitioning to a new acquisition approach with a longer- term commitment, and by taking steps to introduce competition to its  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program, a major change from the  last eight years of that program.

A long-standing problem for the department is that  program costs have tended to increase significantly from original cost  estimates. In recent years, DOD has overcome many of the problems that  had been hampering program development, and has begun to launch  many of these satellites. However, the large cost growth of these systems  continues to affect the department. Figure 1 compares the original cost  estimates with current cost estimates for some of the department\u2019s major  space acquisition programs.", "The gap between the estimates in figure 1 represents money that the  department was not planning to spend on these programs, and did not  have available to invest in other efforts. The gap in estimates is fairly  stable between fiscal years 2014-2018, a result of the fact that most  programs are mature and in a steady production phase. This figure does  not include programs that are still in the early stages of planning and  development.", "In past reports, we have identified a number of causes of acquisition  problems. For example, in past years, DOD has tended to start more  weapon programs than is affordable, creating a competition for funding  that focuses on advocacy at the expense of realism and sound  management. DOD has also tended to start its space programs before it  has the assurance that the capabilities it is pursuing can be achieved  within available resources and time constraints. There is no way to  accurately estimate how long it would take to design, develop, and build a  satellite system when key technologies planned for that system are still in  relatively early stages of discovery and invention. Finally, programs have  historically attempted to satisfy all requirements in a single step,  regardless of the design challenges or the maturity of the technologies  necessary to achieve the full capability. DOD\u2019s preference to make larger,  complex satellites that perform a multitude of missions has stretched  technology challenges beyond current capabilities in some cases.", "Our work has recommended numerous actions that can be taken to  address the problems we identified. Generally, we have recommended  that DOD separate technology discovery from acquisition, follow an  incremental path toward meeting user needs, match resources and  requirements at program start, and use quantifiable data and  demonstrable knowledge to make decisions to move to next phases. We  have also identified practices related to cost estimating, program  manager tenure, quality assurance, technology transition, and an array of  other aspects of acquisition program management that could benefit  space programs. DOD has generally concurred with our  recommendations, and has undertaken a number of actions to establish a  better foundation for acquisition success. For example, we reported in the  past that, among other actions, DOD created a new office within the  Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to  focus attention on oversight for space programs and it eliminated offices  considered to perform duplicative oversight functions.

The Space Fence  radar will emit radio frequencies upward to space, from ground-based  radar sites, to detect and track more and smaller Earth-orbiting  objects than is currently possible, and provide valuable space  situational awareness data to military and civilian users. The Air Force  had originally planned to award a contract for Space Fence systems  development in July 2012, but due to internal program reviews and  budget re-prioritizations, this date has been delayed to May 2014. In  addition, the number of radar sites planned has been reduced from  two to one, though DOD plans to have an option under the system  development contract to build a second site if needed.", "In April 2013, DOD proposed canceling the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s  Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) because of concerns with  the program\u2019s high-risk acquisition strategy and long-term  affordability.

The planned satellite system would consist of a  constellation of nine satellites in orbit around the earth\u2019s equator. We  reported in July 2013 that the decision to propose canceling the PTSS  program was based on an evaluation of the acquisition, technical, and  operational risks of the PTSS program. Specifically, DOD\u2019s evaluation  assessed the PTSS cost, schedule, technical design, and acquisition  strategy to identify whether risks could challenge the program\u2019s ability  to acquire, field, and sustain the system within planned cost and  schedule constraints. The evaluation also determined that the PTSS  program had significant technical, programmatic, and affordability  risks. The program officially ceased operations in October 2013.", "The Air Force has nearly completed its analysis of alternatives to  determine the direction for space based environmental monitoring,  which will be a follow-on program for the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program (DMSP). Through this analysis, the Air Force  analyzed various options that included, but were not limited to, a  traditional procurement of a weather satellite similar to the existing  DMSP satellites, or a disaggregated approach using small satellites  and hosted payload opportunities. According to the Air Force, the  study was completed in the fall of 2013 and is awaiting final approval.", "The MUOS program plans to launch a third satellite in January 2015,  which represents a delay of 6 months due to a production issue on the  third satellite.

The program is replacing  the component. According to the MUOS program office, the program  is on track to meet the launch schedule of subsequent satellites,  which is important because most of the communications satellites that  MUOS is replacing are past their design lives. Synchronizing  deliveries of MUOS satellites with compatible Army Handheld,  Manpack, Small Form Fit (HMS) terminals remains a challenge.  Currently over 90 percent of the first satellite\u2019s on-orbit capabilities are  being underutilized because of terminal program delays.  Consequently, military forces are relying on legacy communication  terminals and are not able to take advantage of the superior  capabilities offered by the MUOS satellites.

With this  update, DOD hoped to create an acquisition policy environment that will  achieve greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending. Air Force  officials noted that, for satellite programs, there are two major changes  that they believe will improve the acquisition process. First, the instruction  was changed to formally allow satellite programs to combine two major  program milestones, B and C, which mark the beginning of the  development and production phases, respectively.Force, satellite programs have typically seen a great deal of overlap in the  development and production phases, mainly because they are buying  small quantities of items. They are often not able to produce a prototype  to be fully tested because of the high costs of each article, so the first  satellite in a production is often used both for testing and operations. Air  Force officials believe that this change to the acquisition guidance will  allow for streamlining of satellite development and production processes,  and provide more efficient oversight without sacrificing program  requirements.

While development testing for DOD  programs is not new to this policy revision, now the testing organization  will be an independent organization outside the program office. For space  programs, this organization will be under the Program Executive Officer  for Space, and will report their findings directly to that office, providing  what the Air Force believes will be an independent voice on a program\u2019s  development status. The Air Force is confident that these changes will  provide benefits to program oversight, although because these are recent  changes, we have not yet assessed their potential for process  improvements.", "In addition, DOD is adopting new practices to reduce fragmentation of its  satellite ground control systems, which adds oversight to a major  development decision. Last year we reported that DOD\u2019s satellite ground  control systems were potentially fragmented, and that standalone  systems were being developed for new satellite programs without a  formal analysis of whether or not the satellite control needs could be met  with existing systems.

In addition, the Act directed  DOD to develop a DOD-wide long-term plan for satellite ground control  systems.", "Additionally, the Defense Space Council continues with its architecture  reviews in key space mission areas. According to Air Force officials, the  Council is the principal DOD forum for discussing space issues, and  brings together senior-level leaders to discuss these issues. These  architecture reviews are to inform DOD\u2019s programming, budgeting, and  prioritization for the space mission area. The Council has five reviews  underway or completed in areas such as overhead persistent infrared,  satellite communications, space situational awareness, and national  security space launches.

We have reported in the past that  fragmented leadership and lack of a single authority in overseeing the  acquisition of space programs have created challenges for optimally   Past studies  acquiring, developing, and deploying new space systems.and reviews have found that responsibilities for acquiring space systems  are diffused across various DOD organizations, even though many of the  larger programs, such as the Global Positioning System and those to  acquire imagery and environmental satellites, are integral to the execution  of multiple agencies\u2019 missions. This fragmentation is problematic because  the lack of coordination has led to delays in fielding systems, and also  because no one person or organization is held accountable for balancing  governmentwide needs against wants, resolving conflicts and ensuring  coordination among the many organizations involved with space systems  acquisitions, and ensuring that resources are directed where they are  most needed. Though changes to organizations and the creation of the  Defense Space Council have helped to improve oversight, our work  continues to find that DOD would benefit from increased coordination and  a single authority overseeing these programs.", "A program management challenge that GAO has identified, which stems  from a lack of oversight, is that DOD has not optimally aligned the  development of its satellites with associated components, including  ground control system and user terminal acquisitions. Satellites require  ground control systems to receive and process information from the  satellites, and user terminals to deliver that satellite\u2019s information to users.  All three elements are important for utilizing space-based data, but  development of satellites often outpaces the ground control systems and  the user terminals. Delays in these ground control systems and user  terminals lead to underutilized on-orbit satellite resources, and thus  delays in getting the new capabilities to the warfighters or other end- users. In addition, there are limits to satellites\u2019 operational life spans once  launched. When satellites are launched before their associated ground  and user segments are ready, they use up time in their operational lives  without their capabilities being utilized. Synchronization of space system  components will be an important issue for DOD in considering  disaggregating space architectures, as the potential for larger numbers  and novel configurations of satellites and ground systems will likely  require the components to be synchronized to allow them to work  together in the most effective way possible. As mentioned earlier, DOD is  taking steps in response to improvements mandated by the Congress.  But it will likely be difficult to better synchronize delivery of satellite  components without more focused leadership at a level above the  acquisitions\u2019 program offices. For example, budget authority for user  terminals, ground systems, and satellites is spread throughout the military  services, and no one is in charge of synchronizing all of the system  components, making it difficult to optimally line up programs\u2019 deliveries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Considering and Adopting Significant Changes to Space Systems Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal pressures, past development problems, and concerns about the  resiliency of satellites have spurred DOD to consider significant changes  in the way it acquires and launches national security satellites."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Changes to Acquiring New DOD Space Systems", "paragraphs": ["Significant fiscal constraints, coupled with growing threats to DOD space  systems\u2014including adversary attacks such as anti-satellite weapons and  communications jamming, and environmental hazards such as orbital  debris\u2014have called into question whether the complex and expensive  satellites DOD is fielding and operating are affordable and will meet future  needs. For example, a single launch failure, on-orbit anomaly, or  adversary attack on a large multi-mission satellite could result in the loss  of billions of dollars of investment and a significant loss of capability.  Additionally, some satellites, which have taken more than a decade to  develop, contain technologies that are already considered obsolete by the  time they are launched.", "To address these challenges, DOD is considering alternative approaches  to provide space-based capabilities, particularly for missile warning,  protected satellite communications, and environmental monitoring.  According to DOD, the primary considerations for studying these  approaches and making decisions on the best way forward relate to  finding the right balance of affordability, resiliency, and capability. These  decisions, to be made over the next 2 to 3 years, have the potential for  making sweeping changes to DOD\u2019s space architectures of the future.  For example, DOD could decide to build more disaggregated  architectures, including dispersing sensors onto separate platforms; using  multiple domains, including space, air, and ground, to provide full mission  capabilities; hosting payloads on other government or commercial  spacecraft; or some combination of these.", "Our past work has indicated that some of the approaches being  considered have the potential to reduce acquisition cost and time on a  single program. For instance, we have found that DOD\u2019s initial preference  to make fewer large and complex satellites that perform a multitude of  missions has stretched technology challenges beyond existing  capabilities, and in some cases vastly increased the complexities of  related software. In addition, developing extensive new designs and  custom-made spacecraft and payloads to meet the needs of multiple  users limits DOD\u2019s ability to provide capabilities sooner and contributes to  higher costs. Last year, we reported that one potential new approach,  hosted payload arrangements in which government instruments are  placed on commercial satellites, may provide opportunities for  government agencies to save money, especially in terms of launch and  operation costs, and gain access to space.", "As new approaches, such as disaggregation, are considered, the existing  management environment could pose barriers to success, including  fragmented leadership for space programs, the culture of the DOD space  community, fragmentation in satellite control stations, and disconnects  between the delivery of satellites and their corresponding user terminals.  For instance, disaggregation may well require substantial changes to  acquisition processes and requirements setting. But without a central  authority to implement these changes, there is likely to be resistance to  adopting new ways of doing business, particularly since responsibilities  for space acquisitions stretch across the military services and other  government agencies. Moreover, under a disaggregated approach, DOD  may need to effectively network and integrate a larger collection of  satellites\u2014some of which may even belong to commercial providers. We  have reported that ground systems generally only receive and process  data from the satellites for which they were developed. They generally do  not control and operate more than one type of satellite or share their data  with other ground systems. To date, however, DOD has had difficulty  adopting modern practices and technologies for controlling satellites as  well as difficulty in coordinating the delivery of satellites with the user  terminals that must be installed on thousands of ships, planes, and  ground-based assets. These are conditions that are difficult to change  without strong leadership to break down organizational stove-pipes and to  introduce technologies or techniques that could enable DOD to better  integrate and fuse data from a wider, potentially more disparate,  collection of satellites.", "In light of suggestions that disaggregation could potentially reduce cost  and increase survivability, the Senate Committee on Armed Services  mandated that we assess the potential benefits and limitations of  disaggregating key military space systems, including potential impacts on  total costs. To date, we have found that the potential effects of  disaggregation are conceptual and not yet quantified. DOD has taken  initial steps to assess alternative approaches, but it does not yet have the  knowledge it needs to quantify benefits and limitations and determine a  course of action. DOD officials we spoke with acknowledge the  department has not yet established sufficient knowledge on which to base  a decision. While DOD has conducted some studies that assessed  alternative approaches to the current programs of record, some within the  department do not consider these studies to be conclusive because they  were either not conducted with sufficient analytical rigor or did not  consider the capabilities, risks, and trades in a holistic manner. For  example, according to the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Office of  Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, a recent Air Force study that  assessed future satellite communications architectures contained  insufficient data to support the conclusion that one architectural approach  was more resilient than others, and the cost estimates it contained did not  consider important factors, such as ground control and terminal costs, in  calculating the implications of changing architectures.", "To build consensus in the department, and to conduct a more rigorous  analysis of options, DOD is currently in the process of conducting  additional studies that will consider future architectures. Included in these  studies are Analyses of Alternatives for future missile warning, protected  satellite communications, and space based environmental monitoring  capabilities.considering are approaches that keep the current system, evolve the  current system, and disaggregate the current system into more  numerous, but smaller and less complex, satellites.

DOD\u2019s Evolved  Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program is the primary provider of  launch vehicles for U.S. military and intelligence satellites. Since 2006,  the United Launch Alliance (ULA) has been the sole-source launch  provider for this program, with a record of 50 successful consecutive  government missions. From 2006 through 2013, DOD had two types of  contracts with ULA through which ULA provided launch services for  national security space launches. DOD utilized this dual-contract  structure to achieve flexibility in launch schedules and to avoid additional  costs associated with frequent launch delays.", "In the last few years, though the dual contract structure met DOD\u2019s needs  for unprecedented mission success and flexible launch capability,  predicted costs continued to rise for launch services. In response to these  cost predictions, DOD revised its acquisition strategy to allow for a \u201cblock  buy\u201d of launch vehicles, where DOD would commit to multiple years of  launch purchases from ULA, with the goal of stabilizing production and  decreasing prices. In addition, and partially in response to GAO  recommendations, DOD gathered large amounts of information on ULA\u2019s  cost drivers to allow DOD to negotiate significantly lower prices under the  contracting structure. In December 2013, DOD signed a contract  modification with ULA to purchase 35 launch vehicle booster cores over a  5-year period, 2013-2017, and the associated capability to launch them.  According to the Air Force, this contracting strategy saved $4.4 billion  over the predicted program cost in the fiscal year 2012 budget. We  recently reported on some of the changes included in this new contract  from the prior contracts.", "In addition to this change in the way DOD buys launch vehicles, DOD is  also in the process of introducing a method for other launch services  companies to compete with ULA for EELV launches. Since 2006, when  ULA began as a joint venture between then-competitors Boeing and  Lockheed Martin, the EELV program has been managed as a sole source  procurement, because there were no other domestic launch companies  that could meet the program\u2019s requirements. With the recent development  of new domestic launch vehicles that can meet at least some EELV  mission requirements, DOD plans to make available for competition up to  14 launches in fiscal years 2015-2017. Any launch company that has  been certified by DOD to launch national security space payloads will be  able to compete with ULA to launch these missions. DOD is currently  finalizing their plan for this competition, including what requirements will  be placed on the contractors and how they will compare proposals from  the contractors.", "Based on our discussions with DOD officials, they plan to use a best  value approach for this competition, in which price is not the only  consideration. DOD will likely consider several factors when comparing  proposals for launch services for the 14 booster core competition  between ULA and new entrants, including price, mission risk, and satellite  vehicle integration risks. DOD could require competitive proposals to be  structured in several ways. If DOD requires proposals to contain both  fixed-price and cost reimbursement features for launch services and  capability, respectively, similar to the way it currently contracts with ULA,  there could be benefits to DOD and ULA, but potential burdens to new  entrants. For example, DOD is familiar with this approach and has  experience negotiating under these terms, and ULA is familiar with DOD\u2019s  requirements given ULA\u2019s role as the EELV\u2019s sole launch provider. But  use of a cost type contract may negate efficient contractor business  practices and cost savings due to government data requirements under  this type of approach, and it may give ULA a price advantage because  DOD already funds launch capability for ULA. Alternatively, if DOD  implements a fixed-price commercial approach to launch proposals with  fewer data reporting requirements, DOD could lose insight into contractor  cost or pricing, but may receive lower prices from new entrants due to  these fewer data reporting requirements. DOD could also require a  combination of elements from each of these approaches, or develop new  contract requirements for this competition. We examined some of the  benefits and challenges of the first two approaches, either of which can   DOD  facilitate competitive launch contract awards, in a recent report.expects to issue a draft request for proposal for the first of the competitive  missions, where the method for evaluating and comparing proposals will  be explained, in the spring of 2014.", "The planned competition for launch services may have helped DOD  negotiate the lower prices it achieved in its December 2013 contract  modification, and DOD could see further savings if a robust domestic  launch market materializes. DOD noted in its 2014 President\u2019s Budget  submission for EELV that after the current contract with ULA has ended, it  plans to have a full and open competition for national security space  launches. Cost savings on launches, as long as they do not come with a  reduction in mission successes, would greatly benefit DOD, and allow the  department to put funding previously needed for launches into programs  in the development phases to ensure they are adequately resourced.", "In conclusion, DOD has made significant progress in solving past space  systems acquisition problems, and is seeing systems begin to launch  after years of development struggles. However, systemic problems  remain that need to be addressed as DOD considers changes to the way  it acquires new systems. This is particularly important if DOD decides to  pursue new approaches that could require changes in longstanding  processes, practices, and organizational structures. Even if DOD decides  not to pursue new approaches, these problems must still be tackled. In  addition, challenging budget situations will continue to require tradeoffs  and prioritization decisions across programs, though limited funds may  also provide the impetus for rethinking architectures. We look forward to  working with Congress and DOD in identifying the most effective and  efficient ways to sustain and develop space capabilities in this challenging  environment.", "Chairman Udall, Ranking Member Sessions, this completes my prepared  statement.
