Also, small firms, including MWO firms, are often unable to meet minimum requirements set by institutional investors, such as size (assets under management) and past experience (length of track record). State, local, and private retirement plans and foundations GAO interviewed addressed these challenges in a variety of ways, such as asking their consultants to include MWO firms in their searches. Many plans also lowered their minimum threshold requirements so that the requirements were proportional to the size of the firms while maintaining the same performance requirements for all asset managers in their selection processes.", "Federal retirement plans, the endowment, and the insurance program GAO reviewed invest in asset classes in which MWO asset managers have a market presence, but overall use of MWO firms varied.

Officials that administer these programs have identified  challenges these businesses may face in contracting with the federal  government and have taken actions, such as conducting outreach, to help  address them. Additionally, the Minority Business Development Agency in  the Department of Commerce was created to foster the growth of  minority-owned businesses of all sizes, and does this through, among  other things, programs and services that increase access to capital,  contracts, and markets. The agency has also identified challenges faced  by minority-owned businesses and taken steps to help address them.

However,  nonfederal plans and foundations with which we spoke used various  approaches to help address many of these challenges. These plans and  foundations cited several factors that led them to take steps to increase  opportunities for MWO firms. For example, some noted organizational  interest in diversity as the driving force behind more inclusive selection  practices for asset managers. Others cited potential benefits of using  MWO firms, such as helping to diversify risk in their portfolios.", "Investor and consultant brand bias. According to most asset  managers and industry associations we interviewed, institutional  investors and their consultants often prefer to contract with larger  asset managers with brand recognition or with whom they are familiar.  Furthermore, according to some asset managers and industry  associations, unless clients directly ask for MWO firms to be included  in asset manager searches, consultants generally will not include  them. For example, one industry association noted that consultants  generally exclude MWO asset managers due to an implicit bias that  their clients\u2019 investment portfolio performance could potentially suffer  if they use a MWO firm despite no information to indicate this would in  fact be the case.", "Having recognized brand bias as a challenge for MWO firms, some  nonfederal plans and foundations have asked their investment  consultants to maintain an inclusive process for sourcing, evaluating,  and recommending investment managers across race, ethnicity, and  gender. One of these plans and a local plan in Illinois told us that they  asked their investment staff or consultants to ensure that at least one  qualified MWO asset manager was invited to present to the  institutional investor\u2019s decision-making body. In addition, one  foundation ensured that its consultant was held accountable to more  inclusive processes by requiring its investment consultant to annually  report the number of diverse managers evaluated, recommended, and  hired across the consultant\u2019s client base.", "Perception of weaker performance. According to most MWO asset  managers and industry associations with whom we spoke, MWO firms  may face challenges because institutional investors generally have a  perception that MWO asset managers do not perform as well as non- MWO firms. However, a May 2017 study on diversity in the asset  management industry by an academic institution and a research  group found no differences in the performance of funds managed by  MWO firms and the performance of those managed by non-MWO  firms, among the firms they analyzed.", "Furthermore, all nonfederal plans and foundations we interviewed told  us that all firms managing assets in their respective portfolios,  including MWO asset managers, were selected based on track record  of performance and evaluated against the same performance  standards as other asset managers in their portfolios. In addition,  some nonfederal plans noted that these asset management firms may  provide certain benefits in generating profit for their clients. For  example, one plan noted that MWO firms offer more differentiated  investment strategies than larger firms.", "Size and infrastructure. The size and limited infrastructure of  smaller, newer MWO firms also may pose challenges. For example,  according to most asset managers and industry associations with  which we spoke, small MWO asset managers are frequently not able  to meet threshold requirements set by institutional investors, such as  minimum limits established for assets under management, liability  insurance, and length of track record. Moreover, an asset manager  and some nonfederal plans and foundations noted that back office  functions and operational costs, such as for accounting and  compliance, are high and make investments in these areas difficult for  smaller, newer firms (including many MWO firms).", "In light of these minimum threshold challenges for MWO firms and  smaller firms in general, many nonfederal plans adjusted  requirements to allow these firms to compete, while noting that they  maintained the same performance requirements for all asset  managers in their selection processes. Specifically, most nonfederal  plans and two foundations either lowered their minimum requirements  for assets under management, length of track record, or amount of  liability insurance to help ensure the requirements were proportional  to the size of the firms, or did not set any minimum or maximum  assets under management threshold levels. As we will discuss later,  the Federal Reserve System and Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation have made similar adjustments to increase opportunities  for MWO asset management firms. Representatives from most  nonfederal plans, foundations, the Federal Reserve System, and  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation stated that they have not  sacrificed performance or fallen short of their fiduciary responsibility in  increasing opportunities for MWO firms.", "Industry trends. In May 2016, we reported that defined contribution  plans have replaced defined benefit plans and become the dominant  form of retirement plan for U.S. workers over the past three  decades. According to some asset management firms and industry  associations, MWO firms face challenges due to this industry shift  from defined benefit plans toward defined contribution plans where  business opportunities for MWO firms may be too costly. The  marketplace shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans  also will likely drive up costs for asset managers and branding will be  more important for defined contribution plans because asset  managers will need to interact more directly with participants,  according to an industry association we interviewed.", "The industry shift from active management to passive management  may also be a challenge. According to some asset managers, industry  associations, and nonfederal plans we interviewed, MWO firms are  less able to compete at defined contribution plans with passive  management investment strategies because MWO firms lack the size  and resources that larger firms have to keep asset management fees  low for clients. Furthermore, because asset management fees for  passive management strategies are low, an asset management firm  must have a volume of business large enough to be profitable.", "In addition to adjusting minimum size and length of track record  requirements, the nonfederal plans and foundations with which we spoke  developed other strategies to help increase opportunities for MWO asset  management firms.", "Some nonfederal plans and one foundation allocated a target amount  of their investment portfolio to MWO asset managers. For example, to  help increase opportunities for MWO asset management firms, a local  plan in Texas developed a program that sets aside 10 percent of its  total assets across all asset classes to be managed by asset  management firms with $50 million or less in assets under  management and at least 30 percent ownership by minorities or  women. In addition, some nonfederal plans said they have  developed emerging manager programs. For example, a state  retirement plan in California has an emerging manager program\u2014 generally defined as a program geared towards newer, smaller asset  managers\u2014wherein each of the plan\u2019s asset classes has emerging  manager definitions based on assets under management, length of  track record, or both. In the plan\u2019s private equity class, emerging  managers do not have to meet a minimum track record requirement  and must have $1 billion or less in assets under management.", "Most of the nonfederal plans with whom we spoke used a fund-of- funds structure, in which a larger fund works as an intermediary for  multiple, smaller managers. Three of these nonfederal plans noted  that working with one firm to recruit, select, and manage underlying  firms was an efficient and effective means of working with smaller,  newer managers, including MWO firms. For example, a local  government retirement plan in Illinois noted that the fund-of-funds  manager they hired was able to hire MWO firms much more quickly  than they would have been able to directly. Similarly, a foundation that  sought to increase diversity told us that it specifically hired a fund-of- funds manager to help find MWO firms for its foundation. In addition,  three nonfederal plans noted that another benefit to hiring a fund-of- funds manager was that the firm could serve as a mentor (providing  guidance and coaching to the smaller asset management firms and  MWO firms), which can help build institutional relationships over the  long-term.", "Nonfederal plans and foundations also helped increase opportunities  for MWO firms by using outreach strategies to identify MWO  managers that could meet their investment needs. For example, many  nonfederal plans regularly participated in networking events, such as  conferences, with MWO asset managers or networked with asset  management trade associations that represent MWO firms. Many of  these nonfederal plans facilitated one-on-one interactions with MWO  firms so prospective asset managers could better understand their  selection processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Entities We Reviewed Invest in Asset Classes in Which Minority- and Women-Owned Asset Managers Have a Presence, but Use of these Firms Varied", "paragraphs": ["The federal entities we reviewed and the National Railroad Retirement  Investment Trust invested primarily in equity and fixed income, while  some also invested in alternative assets or maintained some level of cash  and cash equivalents.

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Thrift Plan contracted with six large asset  managers to offer the plan\u2019s 12 funds. Eight of these, accounting for  nearly three-quarters of participant investments, were passively  managed. The defined contribution plans\u2019 use of passively managed  funds may limit opportunities for MWO firms. As discussed earlier, the  shift toward defined contribution plans and passive management poses a  challenge for MWO firms. In particular, some asset managers and  industry associations with whom we spoke said MWO firms lack the size  and resources to compete with the low fees larger firms can offer through  passive management.", "The federal defined benefit plans we reviewed and the Smithsonian  Institution endowment generally invested more extensively in alternative  assets in addition to equity and fixed income. As shown in table 3, in 2015  the Smithsonian Institution invested more than half the endowment\u2019s  assets in alternative assets. Fiduciaries of four of the five defined benefit  plans in our review also invested substantially in alternative assets,  ranging from about one-quarter to about one-third of plan assets. The  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation generally does not invest in  alternative assets, but does hold a limited amount of these assets in line  with its investment policy.", "We determined that MWO asset managers operate in the asset classes in  which federal entities and the National Railroad Retirement Investment  Trust invest. To do so, we identified more than 180 asset management  firms designated through publicly available sources as having some level  of minority- or women-owned ownership. These MWO asset managers  operate in all four asset classes in which the entities in our review  invested or offered investment options to participants. MWO asset  managers we identified reported managing assets totaling more than  $529 billion. As shown in table 4, most operate in the equity, fixed  income, or alternative asset classes. The market presence of these  firms equaled less than 1 percent of all regulatory assets under  management. Two of the firms, with combined regulatory assets under management of about $42 billion, identified themselves as specializing in  passive management investment strategies.", "Although we identified MWO asset managers operating in each of the  four major asset classes, use of MWO asset managers in 2015 and 2016  by the federal entities we reviewed and the National Railroad Retirement  Investment Trust varied (see table 5). For example, in 2015, none of the  three defined contribution plans we reviewed used MWO asset  managers. Four of the five defined benefit plans we reviewed reported  using at least some MWO asset managers, but one of these plans did not  track this information and was unable to provide us with specific data on  its use. Finally, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation did not use  MWO asset managers in 2015, but did retain four MWO asset managers  in 2016.", "The Federal Reserve System\u2019s, National Railroad Retirement Investment  Trust\u2019s, and Smithsonian Institution\u2019s use of MWO asset managers for  their defined benefit plans and endowment was proportionately higher  than the market presence of such firms. In 2015, 5 of the Federal  Reserve System Retirement Plan\u2019s 32 asset management firms (16  percent) were MWO firms. These firms managed 2 percent of the plan\u2019s  total assets, totaling $253 million. Four of these asset managers were  private equity firms. The fifth handled a portion of the plan\u2019s fixed income  portfolio with two other asset managers handling much larger portions of  plan assets under a similar investment strategy. The MWO asset  manager achieved investment performance for the plan in 2015  comparable to that achieved by the two larger asset managers. In 2016,  10 of the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust\u2019s approximately  140 asset management firms (about 7 percent) were majority owned by  women and minorities. Collectively, these 10 firms managed about 5  percent of total plan assets. Additionally, another 46 of the plan\u2019s asset  management firms had some level of ownership by minorities and  women. Representatives of the Smithsonian Institution estimated 14  percent of their asset management firms\u2014equal to about 13 of the more  than 90 firms the endowment retained as of the end of 2016\u2014were  owned by women or minorities.", "In comparison, we identified a number of nonfederal entities that use  MWO asset managers. These include retirement plans in five states, one  of which set a goal of having 20 percent of its plan\u2019s assets managed by  MWO asset managers. We also identified three foundations that  increased opportunities for MWO asset managers, for example by  amending their investment policy or establishing a program to hire MWO  asset managers. Finally, we interviewed officials from two corporations,  one of which retains MWO firms for both its defined contribution and  defined benefit plans. Representatives of the other corporation told us  they retain almost 30 MWO firms to manage nearly $600 million, or about  4 percent, of the corporation\u2019s defined benefit plans and foundation.  Despite not having an explicit program in place to hire these firms, the  corporation cited two key actions that create opportunities for MWO firms  to compete.

The minimum size requirement for the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was $250 million in assets  under management for applicants in the smaller asset managers pilot  program (discussed later in the report), and ranged from $10 billion to  $50 billion for managers outside of the program. Minimum length of  track record requirements ranged from 3\u20135 years for two of the  defined benefit plans we reviewed, and ranged from 3\u201315 years for  the defined contribution plans. The minimum length of track record  requirement for all managers used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation was 5 years. In addition to performance, size, and length  of track record, the entities we reviewed used other criteria when  selecting asset managers, such as investment strategies,  diversification of portfolio, organization and resources, and best  value.", "Use of public solicitation process. The Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation and the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board use  full and open competition when selecting asset managers. Full and  open competition allows all prospective asset managers who meet  certain requirements to submit bids or competitive proposals. The  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and Federal Retirement Thrift  Investment Board seek competitive proposals from prospective asset  managers by issuing requests for proposals, which are published  publicly on the Federal Business Opportunities website. Asset  management opportunities for the other entities are not published  publicly. Instead, the entities use other avenues such as internal  investment staff or consultants to identify potential asset managers,  as discussed later in this report.", "Frequency of asset manager searches. The Federal Retirement  Thrift Investment Board solicits asset management services for its  four externally managed funds every 5 years. The Federal Reserve  System reviews its public markets asset manager arrangements at  least every 5 years and, based on the results of the review, may  search for new asset managers. Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation officials told us that their asset manager searches are  ongoing, with generally from one to three searches occurring each  year for varying asset classes. The rest of the entities we reviewed do  not have a set schedule for conducting asset manager searches.  Asset manager searches for these entities typically occur when an  asset manager underperforms and needs to be replaced, there is a  change in asset allocation that warrants a new asset manager, or  when a new investment opportunity arises.", "Almost all of the entities used consultants to some extent in their selection  processes, but some entities relied on consultants more than others.", "Three entities (Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Navy  Exchange Service Command, and Tennessee Valley Authority  Retirement System) work closely with consultants. While these  entities approve final asset manager selections, the consultants  primarily drive the search and evaluation process. Specifically, the  consultants identify potential asset managers from their proprietary  databases based on the entities\u2019 selection criteria. The consultants  then produce evaluation reports on candidates for the entities to  review and provide recommendations about which asset managers to  select.", "Three entities (Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and Smithsonian Institution) told us  they use consultants to help identify potential asset managers or  provide expertise on other areas, such as specific asset classes or  asset manager fees. However, evaluations to select asset managers  are conducted internally by the entities. As stated earlier, the Federal  Retirement Thrift Investment Board and the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation issue requests for proposals, which allow prospective  asset managers to submit proposals to be considered for asset  management opportunities. The entities evaluate the submissions and  then make final selections. The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s investment  staff prepare a memorandum after reviewing and vetting asset  managers. The memorandum is provided to the endowment\u2019s  Investment Committee, which makes final selections.", "Federal Reserve System representatives told us they primarily rely on  internal market searches to identify potential asset managers for both  of its retirement plans, but use consultants in limited instances.  Specifically, the Federal Reserve System uses a consultant for asset  classes in which it may be difficult to find asset managers, such as  real estate. After identifying potential asset managers, the Federal  Reserve System issues a request for proposal to potential candidates.  Candidate submissions are graded using a scoring matrix and the  results are used to identify from three to five firms, which then are  invited to interview. Final selections are made following the interviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some of the Federal Entities We Reviewed Made Limited or No Use of Key Practices", "paragraphs": ["We identified four key practices that can be used as part of investors\u2019  asset manager selection processes to help broaden the processes and  ensure that qualified MWO firms are considered (see table 6). We  identified the key practices based on a review of industry reports and  interviews with a sample of state, local, and private retirement plans and  foundations. We then validated the practices by obtaining feedback from  experts and industry stakeholders. The key practices are closely  related, and improvements or shortfalls in one practice may contribute to  improvements or shortfalls in another practice. The practices do not  require investors to develop targets or allocations for MWO asset  management firms or to change performance standards. In addition, we  identified examples of how some institutional investors have implemented  the key practices, which may provide insights to other investors as they  undertake or attempt to strengthen or improve their own initiatives related  to MWO firms. The examples are not exhaustive and each institutional  investor may implement the identified practices in its own way.", "As stated earlier, many nonfederal plans and foundations we interviewed  have implemented these practices to increase opportunities for MWO  firms and told us that using the practices does not conflict with their  fiduciary responsibilities. According to these plans and foundations, MWO  firms they used were selected based on track record of performance and  may provide certain benefits in generating profit for their clients.  Furthermore, according to plan representatives and other industry  stakeholders with whom we spoke, diversifying plan investments to  manage risk can be accomplished through the diversification of asset  managers. Industry reports and industry stakeholders, including plan  representatives with whom we spoke, also noted that implementing a  more inclusive selection process for asset managers can widen the pool  of candidates, which can help ensure that retirement plans and  foundations are identifying the best asset managers.", "Additionally, as stated earlier, the federal government has an interest in  helping increase opportunities for minority- and women-owned  businesses and addressing barriers they face. The key practices we  identified, which can broaden an investor\u2019s pool of asset manager  candidates to help ensure qualified MWO firms are considered for asset  management opportunities and increase opportunities for these firms, are  consistent with this interest.", "We found that three of the federal entities we reviewed used all the  practices, but the other four entities made partial, limited, or no use of  them (see table 7).", "Specifically, the Federal Reserve System and Smithsonian Institution  have developed inclusive policies and taken other steps to increase  opportunities for MWO asset managers, and the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation has developed a program to help increase  opportunities for smaller asset management firms, including smaller  MWO firms.", "Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve System\u2019s Office of  Employee Benefits (OEB) has documented top leadership  commitment by developing policies that support the inclusion of MWO  firms in its asset manager searches. For example, OEB\u2019s  procurement guidelines, which describe the process that staff should  follow when procuring goods and services, state that the office fully  supports equal opportunity in procurement. The guidelines also state  that prospective lists of vendors (including asset managers) to receive  requests for proposals should take into account OEB\u2019s policy that  qualified firms interested in doing business with the office, including  minority- and women-owned businesses, should be included in the  candidate pool as appropriate. Additionally, in 2014 the Federal  Reserve System\u2019s Committee on Investment Performance established  a policy requiring that each investment mandate for its two retirement  plans be reviewed at least every 5 years on a rolling basis, which has  provided additional opportunities to qualified MWO firms to compete  for all of OEB\u2019s investment mandates on a regular basis.", "The Federal Reserve System removed a potential barrier to MWO  firm participation by lowering its minimum requirement for assets  under management. According to Federal Reserve System  representatives, about 5 years ago OEB lowered the requirement  from $5 billion in assets under management to $1 billion in assets  under management for its defined benefit and defined contribution  plans. To conduct outreach, the Federal Reserve System has  participated in meetings and conferences organized by industry  associations that represent MWO firms and met with MWO firms  individually, according to Federal Reserve System representatives.  Federal Reserve System representatives have communicated their  priorities and expectations to investment staff by implementing  policies that have opened opportunities for MWO firms, as discussed  earlier. The entity has also tracked its use of MWO asset  management firms and the proposals it received from prospective  MWO asset managers.", "Federal Reserve System officials told us that their efforts to increase  opportunities for MWO asset managers were primarily driven by two  factors. First, the decision was driven by a desire to find the best  managers in the industry. Second, officials stated that they were  aware of the issues surrounding the lack of inclusion in the asset  management industry and made changes to help address these  issues. Federal Reserve System officials noted that actively including  MWO asset management firms in their searches was consistent with  prudent investor requirements and fiduciary obligations. Officials also  noted that some potential benefits could be gained by a more  inclusive selection process, such as helping manage risk by  diversifying the portfolio and mitigating manager concentration risk  through new MWO managers.", "Guaranty Corporation demonstrated top leadership commitment by  launching a Smaller Asset Managers pilot program in 2016. According  to the entity\u2019s 2016 annual report, the program was created to reduce  barriers that smaller investment firms face when competing for the  agency\u2019s business. As part of this program, the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation removed a potential barrier to entry faced by  smaller firms by lowering its minimum requirement for assets under  management. Specifically, its minimum, which representatives told us  typically ranges from $10 billion to $50 billion, was lowered to $250  million for program applicants. All other asset manager selection  requirements, including performance, remained the same.", "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation conducted outreach to  smaller asset managers to promote its pilot program. For example,  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation held a pre-bidding  conference designed to help applicants understand the selection  process. The entity also listed the request for proposal for its program  on the Federal Business Opportunities website and advertised the  program in industry publications. In addition, the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation communicated its priorities and expectations  regarding its program to its consultant by requesting the consultant  help identify prospective MWO firms for the pilot program, according  to officials.", "After completing the selection process for its pilot program, the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation selected five firms to  participate. Of the five firms, four were minority- or women-owned  firms or both. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation officials stated  that, moving forward, they will evaluate the firms on their performance  against the portfolio benchmark over a full market cycle.", "Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Institution has  demonstrated top leadership commitment by revising its investment  guidelines and asset manager questionnaire to reflect its commitment  to diversity. Specifically, in March 2017 the Smithsonian Institution  revised its investment guidelines by adding \u201cenvironmental, social,  and corporate governance considerations in the investment process\u201d  as one of its selection criteria. According to Smithsonian Institution  representatives, this change allows the Smithsonian Institution to  incorporate diversity as additional criteria for asset manager selection.  The Smithsonian Institution also included a statement in its annual  asset manager questionnaire stating that its Office of Investments  strives to promote diversity and inclusion among its manager hires.  Furthermore, representatives stated that the Board of Regents and  Investment Committee encourage them to look broadly at portfolio  diversification not only in terms of asset classes and investment  strategies, but also of the racial and gender diversity of asset  managers. In addition, the Smithsonian Institution does not have  minimum size or length of track record requirements, which has  allowed smaller asset managers, including small MWO firms, to  compete for asset management opportunities with the endowment.", "The Smithsonian Institution has also conducted outreach to MWO  firms. According to Smithsonian Institution representatives,  investment staff meet with MWO asset managers on an ongoing  basis. Staff have also participated in conferences focused on women- owned and emerging managers. Finally, the Smithsonian Institution  has communicated its priorities and expectations about inclusive  selection processes by asking its consultants for a list of diverse  managers, according to Smithsonian Institution representatives.  Representatives also told us that investment staff have been directed  to proactively identify MWO asset managers to add to this list based  on their capability and expertise.", "Smithsonian Institution representatives told us they have often found  investing with smaller asset managers (including smaller MWO firms)  to be attractive to them. According to the Smithsonian Institution,  small firms tend to be entrepreneurial and entrepreneurial firms are  more successful when dealing with changing market dynamics, which  can increase the chances of delivering superior investment returns.  Representatives also noted that even though the endowment has a  small staff and limited resources, they have not found it difficult to  identify MWO asset managers for the endowment.", "Three entities have used one or more of the practices, but have not fully  implemented all of them.", "Army and Air Force Exchange Service. The Army and Air Force  Exchange Service has used two of the key practices we identified  (outreach and communicating priorities and expectations) and partially  used (has started but has not completed actions related to) the other  two practices (top leadership commitment and removing potential  barriers). Specifically, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service has  taken several steps to conduct outreach to MWO asset managers. For  example, representatives told us that they have held face-to-face  interviews with many MWO firms and gathered information on these  firms for potential future investments. Army and Air Force Exchange  Service representatives have also attended conferences and  networking events with MWO asset managers, directed these firms to  their consultant to learn more about the Army and Air Force Exchange  Service\u2019s selection process, and accepted visitation requests from  MWO asset managers, according to representatives. The Army and  Air Force Exchange Service also has communicated its priorities and  expectations for a more inclusive asset manager selection process.  For example, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service has  instructed its investment staff to meet with representatives from MWO  trade groups. Additionally, the entity has requested that its consultant  include MWO asset managers who meet its portfolio needs in asset  manager searches.", "However, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service has not  completed actions related to top leadership commitment and  removing potential barriers. According to representatives, plan  trustees have had initial discussions about taking additional steps to  increase opportunities for MWO firms at trustee meetings, but have  not taken actions related to these initial discussions. In addition,  representatives told us they use some fund-of-funds investments,  which have allowed smaller firms, including some MWO firms, to  compete for opportunities with the Army and Air Force Exchange  Service and have started to review their policies and practices to  include more participation of MWO firms in asset manager searches,  but have not completed this review as of June 2017.", "Army and Air Force Exchange Service representatives told us they  consider the Army and Air Force Exchange Service to have used all of  the key practices we identified because they have taken at least some  action related to each of the practices.

The Navy Exchange Service  Command has used one key practice (removing potential barriers),  but has not used the other three practices (top leadership  commitment, outreach, and communicating priorities and  expectations). Specifically, the Navy Exchange Service Command  does not have minimum size or length of track record requirements for  its asset managers. According to officials, the Navy Exchange Service  Command does not use these two criteria to select asset managers in  part to help ensure asset manager searches are conducted as widely  as possible and include smaller asset managers, including smaller  MWO firms. However, the Navy Exchange Service Command has not  directly made efforts to reach out to MWO firms. Moreover, the entity  has not taken any actions to demonstrate top leadership commitment  and has not communicated its priorities and expectations to its  consultant because it has not specifically requested that its consultant  include qualified MWO asset managers in its searches for the Navy  Exchange Service Command.", "According to Navy Exchange Service Command representatives, they  have not taken steps to implement all of the key practices because  they rely on their consultant to take these actions. Navy Exchange  Service Command representatives told us that their consultant is  committed to conducting inclusive asset manager searches for all of  its clients, performs outreach to MWO asset managers, and regularly  reports to the Navy Exchange Service Command on its outreach  efforts. Navy Exchange Service Command representatives also noted  that it may not be practical for the Navy Exchange Service Command  to directly conduct outreach to MWO firms because the entity is small  and its consultant has the resources and practices in place for  performing outreach to MWO firms. However, Navy Exchange Service  Command representatives have not specifically directed their  consultant to be more inclusive in their asset manager searches or to  conduct outreach.", "Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement System. The Tennessee  Valley Authority Retirement System has used one key practice  (removing potential barriers).

Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement  System representatives also told us that limited staff and resources  make it difficult for them to conduct outreach to MWO firms. However,  the entity has not communicated its priorities or expectations to its  consultants because it has not directly requested or ensured that its  consultants include qualified MWO asset managers in searches  specifically conducted for the Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement  System, nor has the entity directed its consultants to conduct outreach  to MWO firms. Furthermore, the Tennessee Valley Authority  Retirement System has not taken any actions to demonstrate top  leadership commitment.", "The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board has not used any of the  key practices.

The Federal  Retirement Thrift Investment Board stated that this will allow the Thrift  Savings Plan to offer participants that wish to use the mutual fund window  the greatest amount of choice in a secure, seamless, and efficient  manner. The Board also noted that fiduciary rules make it difficult to make  guarantees about any fund that might be offered in a future mutual fund  window. However, as we discuss in our report, implementing a more  inclusive selection process could bring in a broad array of asset  managers with different investment strategies and products that can help  the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board provide participants with  more investment options. Further, our recommendation would not require  the use of MWO asset managers in the mutual fund window, but instead  would help broaden the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board\u2019s  selection processes and help ensure that qualified MWO firms are  considered.

In addition, we interviewed representatives from the entities  we reviewed to learn more about their selection processes and efforts  related to MWO asset managers.", "We assessed the extent to which federal entities used key practices to  increase opportunities for MWO firms. Specifically, we identified key  practices by examining the practices used by nonfederal plans and  foundations and by reviewing industry reports. We then validated the  practices by obtaining input from 10 industry stakeholders and experts  selected based on factors such as depth of experience working with  MWO firms and published research. The stakeholders and experts  generally agreed with the practices we identified, but one expressed a  concern about implementing two of the practices. We then assessed the  extent to which the federal entities we reviewed used each key practice  using three categories. \u201cUses\u201d indicates that the entity completed an  action or actions to implement the practice; \u201cpartially uses\u201d indicates that  the entity has started an action or actions to implement the practice, but  has not completed the action(s); and \u201cdoes not use,\u201d which indicates that  the entity has not started or completed any action(s) to implement the  practice. One analyst reviewed the entities\u2019 policies and practices and  made the initial assessment. A second analyst then verified these steps  to ensure consistent results.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to September 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust  (Trust) stated that trustees and investment staff have a fiduciary  obligation to invest the Trust\u2019s assets solely in the best interest of the  Trust and its beneficiaries. Representatives told us they do not believe  their asset manager selection process, described below, has precluded  the Trust from hiring smaller or minority- and women-owned (MWO) firms.", "Selection criteria and process. According to Trust representatives,  the Trust does not have minimum size or length of track record  requirements for its asset managers, but considers an asset  manager\u2019s size, as well as the appropriate size of a possible  allocation to the manager, when determining whether to hire the  manger. They also stated that it was important to hire managers that  have a demonstrable history of successfully investing and that  generally, track records that cover longer time periods are more  statistically significant than shorter-term track records because there  are more data points to analyze. Trust representatives emphasized  that considering these factors has not prevented the Trust from hiring  smaller firms, and that about half of their asset managers are small to  mid-size firms.", "According to Trust representatives, the Federal Acquisition Regulation  does not apply to the Trust\u2019s asset manager selection process. The  Trust uses internal investment staff to identify potential asset  managers. Trust representatives told us that searches for asset  managers in the public markets (for example, publicly traded stocks  and bonds) typically occur when an asset manager needs to be  replaced (due to a variety of reasons, such as personnel changes),  whereas searches for asset managers in private markets (for  example, alternative assets such as private equity and real estate)  occur on an ongoing basis.", "Use of Consultants. Trust representatives told us that they do not  use consultants; rather, in-house investment staff conduct the  research and evaluation process. Generally, investment staff identify  potential asset managers by researching commercial or internally  developed databases and then conduct an internal review, which  includes reviewing information on prospective firms\u2019 investment  strategies and meeting with the firms. Investment staff subsequently  develop a memorandum on the prospective asset managers and  conduct a final internal analysis before recommending asset  managers to trustees, who approve all final selections and the amount  of the planned investment.", "Key Practices. According to Trust representatives, the Trust has  taken steps to increase opportunities for MWO firms. Specifically, the  Trust\u2019s board has discussed the Trust\u2019s selection practices as they  relate to MWO firms on an ongoing basis during its quarterly meetings  and has analyzed its use of MWO firms. In addition, Trust  representatives told us they conducted outreach by meeting with trade  associations representing MWO firms. Further, according to Trust  representatives, the Trust does not have minimum size or length of  track record requirements for its asset managers, which has removed  potential barriers to smaller firms, including smaller MWO firms.  Finally, according to Trust representatives, the Trust has tentatively  approved revisions to its investment procedures manual that would  incorporate statements about valuing diversity and having an inclusive  asset manager selection process. Trust representatives told us that  the Trust\u2019s board intends to formally approve the revisions at its  upcoming board meeting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Minority- and Women-Owned Brokerage Firms", "paragraphs": ["The federal entities we reviewed and the National Railroad Retirement  Investment Trust do not directly hire brokerage firms. However, in  conducting our work on nonfederal plans, we identified challenges  minority- and women-owned (MWO) brokerage firms face that may limit  them from fully competing for opportunities with institutional investors,  including retirement plans and foundations, and the asset managers  these entities use.", "Brand bias. According to two MWO brokerage firms with which we  spoke, MWO brokers may have difficulty competing with larger  brokerage firms that are well known in the industry and have long- standing relationships with asset managers.", "Size. One brokerage firm with which we spoke noted that some  institutional investors and asset managers may have the  misconception that smaller broker dealers cannot execute trades as  effectively as large brokerage firms, and that using MWO brokers will  cost more. Another brokerage firm told us that net capital thresholds  were too high for newer, smaller MWO brokers to meet. As a result,  MWO brokers may have greater difficulty competing for opportunities.", "Track record. Shorter track records are also a hindrance, according  to brokerage firms we interviewed. For example, one brokerage firm  noted that although most brokers may have worked with large  corporations before starting their own companies, they may not get  the credit for the experience they have because they are a new firm.  As a result, they may be overlooked when investors search for  brokerage firms.", "Some state, local, and private plans have taken actions to address these  challenges and increase opportunities for MWO brokerage firms.", "Communicate expectations. Two nonfederal plans and one  foundation we interviewed directed their asset managers to use more  inclusive practices for sourcing and hiring qualified MWO brokerage  firms.", "Conduct outreach. A state plan also directly communicated with  MWO brokerage firms at networking events, and directed its asset  managers to do so as well.", "Report usage of MWO brokers. Some state and local retirement  plans have legislative mandates to promote the use of MWO firms,  including brokers, and require that their asset managers report on  their use of MWO brokerage firms. For example, a local plan in Illinois  sets MWO broker-dealer utilization percentage goals across asset  classes for its asset managers, and requires that asset managers  report monthly on MWO broker utilization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from Army and Air Force Exchange Service and Navy Exchange Service Command", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from Tennessee Valley Authority Retirement System", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Kay Kuhlman (Assistant  Director), Kimberley Granger (Assistant Director), Erika Navarro (Analyst  in Charge), Farah Angersola, Bethany Benitez, Raheem Hanifa, John  Karikari, Risto Laboski, Jill Lacey, Marc Molino, Tom Moscovitch, Barbara  Roesmann, Adam Wendel, and Amber Yancey-Carroll made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
