GAO's testimony provides preliminary findings related to (1) how VHA used miscellaneous obligations during fiscal year 2007, and (2) whether the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) policies and procedures were designed to provide adequate controls over their authorization and use. GAO recently provided its related draft report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for review and comment and plans to issue its final report as a follow-up to this testimony. GAO obtained and analyzed available VHA data on miscellaneous obligations, reviewed VA policies and procedures, and reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 42 miscellaneous obligations at three case study locations.

According to VHA officials, miscellaneous obligations were used to facilitate the payment for goods and services when the quantities and delivery dates are not known. According to VHA data, almost $3.8 billion (55.1 percent) of VHA's miscellaneous obligations was for fee-based medical services for veterans and another $1.4 billion (20.4 percent) was for drugs and medicines. The remainder funded, among other things, state homes for the care of disabled veterans, transportation of veterans to and from medical centers for treatment, and logistical support and facility maintenance for VHA medical centers nationwide. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agency management is responsible for developing detailed policies and procedures for internal control suitable for their agency's operations. However, based on GAO's preliminary results, VA policies and procedures were not designed to provide adequate controls over the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations with respect to oversight by contracting officials, segregation of duties, and supporting documentation for the obligation of funds. Collectively, these control design flaws increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse (including employees converting government assets to their own use without detection). These control design flaws were confirmed in the case studies at Pittsburgh, Cheyenne, and Kansas City. In May 2008, VA issued revised guidance concerning required procedures for authorizing and using miscellaneous obligations. GAO reviewed the revised guidance and found that while it offered some improvement, it did not fully address the specific control design flaws GAO identified.

When a purchase order is created, however, the  obligated amount cannot be changed without a modification of the  purchase order.

According to GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government, agency management is responsible  for developing detailed policies and procedures for internal control  suitable for their agency\u2019s operations and ensuring that they provide for  adequate monitoring by management, segregation of duties, and  supporting documentation for the need to acquire specific goods in the  quantities purchased. We identified control design flaws in each of these  oversight areas, and we confirmed that these weaknesses existed at the  three locations where we conducted case studies. Collectively, these  control design flaws increase the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse (including  employees converting government assets to their own use without  detection). New guidance for the use of miscellaneous obligations was  released in January 2008 and finalized in May 2008. We reviewed the new  guidance and found that while it offered some improvement, it did not  fully address the specific control design flaws we identified. Furthermore,  VA officials told us that this guidance was not subject to any legal review.  Such an analysis is essential to help ensure that the design of policies and  procedures comply with all applicable federal appropriations law and  internal control standards.", "We reviewed 42 miscellaneous obligations at the three case study  locations and developed illustrative, more detailed information on the  extent and nature of these control design flaws. Table 2 summarizes the  locations visited, the miscellaneous obligations reviewed at each location,  and the extent and nature of control design deficiencies found.", "To help minimize the use of miscellaneous obligations, VA policy stated  that miscellaneous obligations would not be used as obligation control  documents unless the contracting authority for a station had determined  that purchase orders or contracts would not be required. Furthermore, VA  policy required review of miscellaneous obligations by contracting  officials to help ensure proper use in accordance with federal acquisition  regulations, but did not address the intended extent and nature of these  reviews or how the reviews should be documented. Contracting officials  were unable to electronically document their review of miscellaneous  obligations and no manual documentation procedures had been  developed. Our review of 42 miscellaneous obligations prepared at three  VHA stations showed that contracting officers were at times familiar with  specific miscellaneous obligations at their facilities, but that they had no  documented approvals available for review. Furthermore, none of the  three sites we visited had procedures in place to document review of the  miscellaneous obligations by the appropriate contracting authorities.", "Effective oversight and review by trained, qualified officials is a key factor  in identifying a potential risk for fraud, waste, or abuse. Without control  procedures to help ensure that contracting personnel review and approve  miscellaneous obligations prior to their creation, VHA is at risk that  procurements will not have safeguards established through a contract  approach. For example, in our case study at the VA Pittsburgh Medical  Center, we found 12 miscellaneous obligations, totaling about $673,000,  used to pay for laboratory services provided by the University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The Chief of Acquisition and Materiel  Management for the VA Pittsburgh Medical Center stated that she was not  aware of the UPMC's laboratory testing service procurements and would  review these testing services to determine whether a contract should be  established for these procurements. Subsequently, she stated that VISN 4,  which includes the VA Pittsburgh Medical Center, was going to revise  procedures to procure laboratory testing services through purchase orders  backed by reviewed and competitively awarded contracts, instead of  funding them through miscellaneous obligations.", "Another Pittsburgh miscellaneous obligation for about $141,000 was used  to fund the procurement of livers for transplant patients. Local officials  said that there was a national contract for the services, and that livers  were provided at a standardized price of $21,800. However, officials could  not provide us with a copy of the contract, nor documentation of the  standardized pricing schedule. Therefore, we could not confirm that VHA  was properly billed for these services or that the procurement was  properly authorized.", "Furthermore, in the absence of review by contracting officials, controls  were not designed to prevent miscellaneous obligations from being used  for unauthorized purposes, or for assets that could be readily converted to  personal use. Our analysis of the IFCAP database for fiscal year 2007  identified 145 miscellaneous obligations for over $30.2 million that  appeared to be used in the procurement of such items as passenger  vehicles; furniture and fixtures; office equipment; and medical, dental, and  scientific equipment. Although the VA's miscellaneous obligation policy  did not address this issue, VA officials stated that acquisition of such  assets should be done by contracting officials and not through  miscellaneous obligations. Without adequate controls to review and  prevent miscellaneous obligations from being used for the acquisition of  such assets, it is possible that the VHA may be exposing the agency to  unnecessary risks by using miscellaneous obligations to fund the  acquisitions of goods or services that should have been obtained under  contract with conventional controls built in."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Guidance Does Not Address All Control Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["In January 2008, VA issued interim guidance effective for all miscellaneous  obligations created after January 30, 2008, concerning required procedures  for using miscellaneous obligations. The guidance provides that prior to  creating a miscellaneous obligation, fiscal service staff are required to  check with the contracting activity to ensure that a valid contract is  associated with the miscellaneous obligation, except in specific, itemized  cases. Under this guidance, the using service is to have the contracting  activity determine (1) if a valid procurement authority exists, (2) if a  procurement needs to be initiated, and (3) the appropriate method of  obligation. Also, this guidance requires that a copy of the head contracting  official\u2019s approval be kept with a copy of the miscellaneous obligation for  future audit purposes. In addition, the guidance provides that the fiscal  service may not create a miscellaneous obligation without appropriate  information recorded in the purpose, vendor, and contract number fields  on the document. The guidance specifically cites a number of invalid uses  for miscellaneous obligations, including contract ambulance, lab tests,  blood products, and construction, but did not always specify a  procurement process to be used for these items.", "In May 2008, VHA management finalized the interim guidance. This  guidance represents a step in the right direction. It includes a manual  process for documenting contracting approval of miscellaneous  obligations and specifically states that a miscellaneous obligation cannot  be created if the vendor, contract number, and purpose fields are  incomplete. However, the new guidance does not address the segregation  of duties issues we and others have identified and does not establish an  oversight mechanism to ensure that control procedures outlined are  properly implemented.", "In our view, VHA has missed an opportunity to obtain an important legal  perspective on this matter. According to VA officials, these policies have  not been subject to any legal review. Such a review is essential in ensuring  that the policies and procedures comply with federal funds control laws  and regulations and any other relevant VA policies or procedures dealing  with budgetary or procurement matters. For example, such a review  would help ensure that the guidance adequately addresses Federal  Acquisition Regulations, requiring that no contract shall be entered into  unless the contracting officer ensures that all requirements of law,  executive orders, regulations, and all other applicable procedures,  including clearances and approvals, have been met. In addition, a review  could help to ensure that this guidance (1) provides that all legal  obligations of VA are supported by adequate documentation to meet the  requirements of the recording statute 31 U.S.C. \u00a71501(a) and (2) prevents  any individual from committing the government for purchases of supplies,  equipment, or services without being delegated contracting authority as a  contracting officer, purchase card holder, or as a designated  representative of a contracting officer. The absence of a legal review to  determine the propriety of VA\u2019s miscellaneous obligations policies and  procedures places VA at risk of not complying with important laws and  regulations.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, without basic controls in place over billions  of dollars in miscellaneous obligations, VA is at significant risk of fraud,  waste, and abuse. Effectively designed internal controls serve as the first  line of defense for preventing and detecting fraud, and they help ensure  that an agency effectively and efficiently meets its missions, goals, and  objectives; complies with laws and regulations; and is able to provide  reliable financial and other information concerning its programs,  operations, and activities. Although miscellaneous obligations can  facilitate and streamline the procurement process, they require effectively  designed mitigating controls to avoid impairing full accountability and  transparency. In the absence of effectively designed key funds and  acquisition controls, VA has limited assurance that its use of  miscellaneous obligations is kept to a minimum, for bona fide needs, in the  correct amount, and to the correct vendor. Improved controls in the form  of detailed policies and procedures, along with a management oversight  mechanism, will be critical to reducing the government\u2019s risks from VA\u2019s  use of miscellaneous obligations.", "To that end, our draft report includes specific recommendations, including  a number of preventive actions that, if effectively implemented, should  reduce the risks associated with the use of miscellaneous obligations. We  are making recommendations to VA to modify its policies and procedures,  in conjunction with VA\u2019s Office of General Counsel, to better ensure  adequate oversight of miscellaneous obligations by contracting officials,  segregation of duties throughout the process, and sufficient supporting  documentation for miscellaneous obligations.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.

According to VA  officials, FMS cannot be used to identify the universe of miscellaneous  obligations at VHA in fiscal year 2007 because FMS does not identify the  procurement method used for transactions (i.e., miscellaneous obligations,  purchase card, purchase order). Furthermore, FMS does not capture the  contract number, requester, approving official, and obligating official for  obligations. However, according to senior agency officials, the IFCAP  database is the most complete record of miscellaneous obligations  available at VHA and can be used to provide an assessment of how  miscellaneous obligations were used during fiscal year 2007.", "IFCAP\u2019s data included information on the appropriation codes, vendors,  budget object codes (BOC), date and amount of obligations, obligation  numbers, approving officials, and VISN and VHA station for VHA  miscellaneous obligations.

Specifically, we reviewed the VA  Controller Policy, MP-4, Part V, Chapter 3, Section A, Paragraph 3A.02 \u2013  Estimated Miscellaneous Obligation or Change in Obligation (VA Form  4-1358); the VA Office of Finance Bulletin 06GA1.05, Revision to MP-4,  Part V, Chapter 3, Section A, Paragraph 3A.02 \u2013 Estimated  Miscellaneous Obligation or Change in Obligation (VA Form 4-1358),  dated September 29, 2006; VA Interim Guidance on Miscellaneous  Obligations, VA Form 1358, dated January 30, 2008; VHA Revised  Guidance for Processing of Miscellaneous Obligations, VA Form 1358,  dated May 18, 2008; and other VA and VHA directives, policies, and  procedures. We also used relevant sections of the Federal Acquisition  Regulations (FAR); VA\u2019s Acquisition Regulations; appropriation law; and  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government in  assessing the design of VA's policies and procedures, and we met with VA  and VHA officials in Washington, D.C., and coordinated with VHA\u2019s Office  of Inspector General staff to identify any previous audit findings relevant  to our audit work. We also interviewed representatives of VA\u2019s  independent public accounting firm and reviewed copies of their reports.", "In order to better understand the extent and nature of VA policy and  procedure design deficiencies related to miscellaneous obligations, we  conducted case studies at three VHA stations in Cheyenne, Wyoming;  Kansas City, Missouri; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The stations in  Kansas City and Pittsburgh were selected because they had a high volume  of miscellaneous obligation activity, and they were located in different  regions of the country. We conducted field work at the Cheyenne,  Wyoming, station during the design phase of our review to better  understand the extent and nature of miscellaneous obligation control  design deficiencies at a small medical center. Inclusion of the Cheyenne  facility in our review increased the geographic diversity of our analysis  and allowed us to compare the extent and nature of miscellaneous  obligation design deficiencies at medical centers in the eastern,  midwestern, and western portions of the United States.", "During the case studies, we met with senior medical center administrative,  procurement, and financial management officials to discuss how VA  policies and procedures were designed with regard to specific obligations,  and assess the control environment design for using miscellaneous  obligations at the local level. We discussed how miscellaneous obligations  were used as part of the procurement process and the effect of new VHA  guidance on medical center operations. We also reviewed the design of  local policies and procedures for executing miscellaneous obligations and  conducted walk-throughs of the processes.", "To provide more detailed information on the extent and nature of the  control design deficiencies we found at our case study locations, we  identified a nongeneralizable sample of obligations for further review at  each site. Through data mining techniques, we identified a total of 42  miscellaneous obligations for more detailed examination at our case  studies: 11 from Cheyenne, 17 from Kansas City, and 14 from Pittsburgh.  We based our selection on the nature, dollar amount, date, and other  identifying characteristics of the obligations. For each miscellaneous  obligation selected, we accumulated information on the extent and nature  of control design weaknesses concerning miscellaneous obligations:  review and documentation by contracting officials;     segregation of duties during the procurement process; and  the purpose, timing, and documentation for obligations.", "Concerning the adequacy of control design with respect to contracting  review, we reviewed miscellaneous obligations for evidence of review by  contracting officials and, for selected miscellaneous obligations, followed  up with contracting officials to discuss contracts in place for  miscellaneous obligations, whether review by contracting officials was  needed, and when and how this review could occur and be documented.", "Concerning the control design deficiencies with respect to segregation of  duties, we reviewed miscellaneous obligation documents to determine  which officials requested, approved, and obligated funds for the original  miscellaneous obligations and then which officials certified delivery of  goods and services and approved payment. We noted those instances  where control design deficiencies permitted one official to perform  multiple functions.", "With respect to control design deficiencies relating to the supporting  documentation for the miscellaneous obligations, we reviewed the  purpose, vendor, and contract number fields for each obligation. For the  purpose field, we assessed whether the required description was adequate  to determine the nature, timing, and extent of the goods and/or services  being procured and whether controls provided for an adequate  explanation for any estimated miscellaneous obligation amounts. For the  vendor and contract number fields, we assessed whether controls were  designed to ensure entered information was correct, and we identified  those instances where control deficiencies permitted fields to be left  blank.", "Because of time limitations, we did not review VHA\u2019s procurement or  service authorization processes. In addition, in our case study approach,  we were unable to analyze a sufficient number of obligations to allow us to  generalize our conclusions to the sites visited, nor to the universe of VHA  medical centers.
