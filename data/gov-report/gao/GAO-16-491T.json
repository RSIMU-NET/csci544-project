In 2014, about 181,000 employers claimed the credit, down somewhat from 2010 (see figure). These numbers are relatively low compared to the number of employers eligible for the credit. In 2012, GAO reported that selected estimates of the number of employers eligible ranged from about 1.4 million to 4 million. In 2010, claims totaled $468 million compared to initial estimates of $2 billion by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Actual claims for the credit in 2013 and 2014 increased slightly to about $511 million and $541 million, respectively.", "The small employer health tax credit has not been widely claimed for a variety of reasons, as GAO reported in May 2012. The maximum amount of the credit does not appear to be a large enough incentive for employers to offer or maintain insurance. Also, few small employers qualify for the maximum credit amount. For those employers who do claim the credit, the credit amount \u201cphases out\u201d to zero as employers employ up to 25 full time equivalent (FTE) employees at higher wages. The amount of the credit is also limited if premiums paid by an employer are more than the average premiums for the small group market in the employer's state. Furthermore, the credit can only be claimed for two consecutive years after 2013. GAO also found that the cost and complexity involved in claiming the tax credit was significant, deterring small employers from claiming it. Many small businesses have also reported that they were unaware of the credit. Even so, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had been taking steps since April 2010 to raise awareness about the credit and reduce the burden on taxpayers by offering tools to help taxpayers determine eligibility for the credit.", "Congress and the administration have proposed a number of changes to the credit. These include expanding the size of eligible employers, altering the phase out rules, and allowing the credit to be claimed in more than two consecutive years. Amending the eligibility requirements or increasing the amount of the credit may allow more businesses to claim the credit. However, these changes would increase its cost to the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this testimony statement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on small employers\u2019  use of the health tax credit. The Small Employer Health Insurance Tax  Credit was established as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA) to help eligible small employers\u2014businesses or tax- exempt entities\u2014provide health insurance for employees. This testimony  updates our work that showed seemingly low usage of the credit and  some of the reasons for this low usage.", "The Small Employer Health Insurance Tax Credit is generally available to  eligible small employers and tax-exempt employers who have fewer than  25 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees with average annual wages that  fall below a statutorily-specified cap. For tax year 2016, the wage cap is  $51,800. These small employers must cover at least 50 percent of the  cost of each of their employees\u2019 self-only health insurance coverage. The  credit amount is a percentage of the employer\u2019s contributions to  employees\u2019 health insurance premiums. The percentage varies according  to the number of FTEs, average wage paid by the employer, and whether  the employer is a for-profit or tax-exempt employer. The larger the  average annual wage and the greater the number of FTEs, the lower the  credit percentage the small employer can claim, until the credit is entirely  phased out. Beginning in 2014, small employers who qualify for the credit  generally must purchase coverage through a Small Business Health  Options Program (SHOP) exchange. SHOP exchanges, as established  under PPACA, are marketplaces where small employers can shop for and  purchase health coverage for their employees. All health plans available  through SHOP exchanges must meet certain federally required criteria,  such as providing plans that offer minimum essential health benefits. Our  2014 report noted that a primary incentive for small employers to use  SHOPs has been this tax credit.", "The vast majority of small employers do not offer health insurance to their  employees. The Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) estimates  that 83 percent of employers who may be eligible for the full credit did not  offer health insurance in 2010 and that 67 percent who could be eligible  for a partial credit did not offer insurance. As we discussed in our 2012  report, various factors have explained why small, low-wage employers  historically tend not to offer health insurance. For example:", "For very low-wage employees, health insurance drives up total  compensation costs.", "Low-wage employees generally prefer wages over insurance benefits.", "While employees pay income and employment taxes on wages,  employees do not pay these taxes on premiums that employers pay  for health insurance. However, the income tax exclusion is worth less  to low-wage employees\u2014being in a lower-income tax bracket\u2014 compared to those with higher wages.  Insurers of small employers face higher-average fixed costs for billing  and marketing and are less able to pool risk across many employees.", "As a result, plans for small employers are likely to have higher  premiums, less coverage, and higher costs than plans for large  employers.", "This statement (1) describes the extent to which the credit is being  claimed by smaller employers (2) describes the reasons, if any, limiting  employer claims, and (3) summarizes legislative proposals on the credit.

Much of this statement discusses  findings from our May 2012 report. For that report, we reviewed Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) data on credit claims for tax year 2010. We  interviewed IRS officials and subject-matter specialists from government,  academia, research foundations, and think tanks.

To assess the reliability of  the data, we reviewed the data and supporting documentation for obvious  errors, reviewed our prior use of the data, and interviewed IRS officials  about the data. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.

While seasonal workers are excluded from FTE counts, insurance  premiums paid on their behalf count toward the tax credit. In determining  premiums paid by the employer, the rules exclude employer contributions  to health reimbursement arrangements, health flexible spending  accounts, or health savings accounts. Similarly, an employer\u2019s premium  payments exclude tobacco surcharges if an issuer charges higher  premiums for tobacco users.", "As for the complexity of the worksheets and paperwork to be completed  to claim the credit, in 2012, tax preparers told us that they thought that  IRS did the best it could with the Form 8941 given the credit\u2019s  complexity. IRS officials said they did not receive criticism about Form  8941 itself but did hear that the instructions and its seven worksheets  were too long and cumbersome for some claimants and tax preparers. On  its website, as of 2012, IRS tried to reduce the burden on taxpayers by  offering \u201c3 Simple Steps\u201d as a screening tool to help taxpayers determine  whether they might be eligible for the credit.

However, we also noted in 2012 that this would not reduce the  complication of finding all the documentation needed to file Form 8941.

The extent to which the lack of awareness prevented  eligible employers from claiming the credit is unknown, particularly given  other reasons for not claiming the credit. Further, a number of small  business employers would not be eligible for the credit regardless of their  awareness.

Many offered ways to expand usage  of the credit. For example, the bills sought to increase the number of  eligible small employers (e.g., allowing an employer to have 50 FTEs);  changing the phase out formula; allowing the credit to be claimed in more  than two consecutive years; increasing the average annual wage  limitation; eliminating the requirement that employers contribute the same  percentage of cost of each employee\u2019s health insurance; eliminating the  cap limiting the credit amount to average premiums paid to a state health  insurance exchange; and allowing a partial credit for health insurance  purchased outside of SHOP exchanges.
