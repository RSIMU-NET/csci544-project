Designation as an FTO introduces the possibility of a range of civil  penalties for the FTO or its members, as well as criminal liability for  individuals engaged in certain prohibited activities, such as individuals  who knowingly provide, or attempt or conspire to provide, \u201cmaterial  support or resources\u201d to a designated FTO. We reviewed Justice data of  only public/unsealed convictions from January 1, 2009, to December 31,  2013. For the purposes of our report, we analyzed the Justice data on the  convictions and sentencing associated with individuals who were  convicted of knowingly providing, or attempting or conspiring to provide,  \u201cmaterial support or resources\u201d to a designated FTO. We also reviewed  the data to identify the individuals who were convicted of knowingly  receiving military-type training from or on behalf of an organization  designated as an FTO at the time of the training. The data did not include  defendants who were charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses  but had not been convicted either at trial or by guilty plea, as of December  31, 2013. The data included defendants who were determined by  prosecutors in Justice\u2019s National Security Division Counterterrorism  Section to have a connection to international terrorism, even if they were  not charged with a terrorism offense. To assess the reliability of the  convictions data, we performed basic reasonableness checks on the data  and interviewed relevant agency officials to discuss the convictions and  sentencing data. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report.", "To identify the immigration restrictions and penalties imposed on  individuals associated with or who provided material support to a  designated foreign terrorist organization, we analyzed available data from  State Bureau of Consular Affairs reports on visa denials between fiscal  years 2009 and 2013, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  enforcement system database on arrival inadmissibility determinations  between fiscal years 2009 and 2014, and information from the U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement on deportations between fiscal  years 2013 and 2014. The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended,  establishes the types of visas available for travel to the United States and  what conditions must be met before an applicant can be issued a  particular type of visa and granted admission to the United States. For the  purposes of this report, we primarily included the applicants deemed  inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality  Act, which includes ineligibility based on terrorism grounds. We did not  include the national security inadmissibility codes that were not relevant  to terrorism. In each instance, we analyzed the data provided by the  agencies and performed basic checks to determine the reasonableness  of the data. We also spoke with relevant agency officials to discuss the  data to confirm the reasonableness of the totals presented for individuals  denied visas, denied entry into the United States, or deported from the  United States for association with a designated foreign terrorist  organization. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our report.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to June 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Agencies and Their Roles in the Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) Designation Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, as of December 31, 2014", "paragraphs": ["Appendix III: Designated Foreign Terrorist  Organizations, as of December 31, 2014 1.", "Organization  Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)", "2.", "Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)", "3.", "Aum Shinrikyo (AUM)", "4.", "Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA)  5.
