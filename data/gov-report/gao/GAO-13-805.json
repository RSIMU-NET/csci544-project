The OSP was reauthorized by Congress in 2011 by the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act, and has garnered national attention as the first federally-funded voucher program. Since the program's inception in 2004, Congress has provided almost $152 million for the program benefitting almost 5,000 students, currently providing scholarships of about $8,000 for grades K-8 and about $12,000 for grades 9-12. As requested, GAO examined (1) the extent to which the Trust provides information that enables families to make informed school choices, (2) whether the Trust's internal controls ensure accountability for OSP, and (3) how Education and District agencies responsible for overseeing OSP have performed their stated roles and responsibilities.", "To conduct this work, GAO visited 10 participating schools; interviewed school officials; conducted discussion groups with 14 parents of scholarship students; analyzed key program documents; reviewed generally accepted guiding documents for internal controls; and interviewed officials at Education, relevant District agencies, and the Trust."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The DC Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation (the Trust) provides information to prospective and current families of children participating in the District of Columbia (the District) Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) through a variety of outreach activities. To reach prospective OSP families, the Trust advertises through print, radio, and bus ads, as well as in newspapers and flyers posted in neighborhood libraries, recreation centers, and local government service centers. However, the Trust provides incomplete and untimely information about participating schools to OSP families. The participating school directory, which is published by the Trust, lacks key information about tuition, fees, and accreditation. The Trust published the directory 9 months after the start of the 2012-13 school year, too late to assist families in selecting a school for that year. Without such information, parents cannot make fully informed school choices. Additionally, the Trust awarded scholarships to students several months after many schools completed their admissions and enrollment processes, limiting the amount of time and choice in selecting schools. Most families GAO spoke with were generally happy with OSP but some were concerned about the availability of program information.", "The Trust's internal controls do not ensure effective implementation and oversight of OSP. Adequate policies and procedures can provide reasonable assurance of effective, efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws. However, the Trust's policies and procedures do not include a process for verifying eligibility information that schools selfreport. As a result, the Trust cannot ensure that schools are eligible to participate in the program and, therefore, risks providing federal dollars to students to attend schools that do not meet standards required by law. Furthermore, the Trust's database is not well structured and hampers the effectiveness of program implementation. For example, the Trust lacks written documentation for the database, and staff must rely on institutional memory to ensure processes such as data entry are conducted properly, which could contribute to errors in the database. As required by law, the Trust groups eligible applicants into three priority categories by which scholarships are then awarded by lottery; however, weaknesses in the database's structure puts into question the Trust's ability to provide accurate priority categories. Additionally, the Trust has not submitted its mandatory financial reports on time, despite a legal requirement that these reports be filed within 9 months of the end of the entity's fiscal year. The Trust's fiscal year 2010 financial report was almost 2 years late, and the Trust's fiscal year 2011 and 2012 reports had not yet been submitted as of August 2013. In August 2013, the Trust also made amendments to its policies and procedures in three areas GAO identified. However, these amendments do not address all weaknesses identified in this report, and have not yet been fully implemented.", "The Department of Education (Education) has provided limited assistance to the Trust in certain areas outlined in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the District and in the cooperative agreement with the Trust. Specifically, Education is responsible for helping the Trust make improvements to its financial system, enhance its site visit policies and procedures, and improve the accuracy of information provided to parents. Trust officials acknowledged that Education has provided general assistance regarding administrative and operational functions, but it has not assisted with specific improvements in these areas. Although the MOU is a written agreement between Education and the District, it holds the Trust, as the grantee, responsible for notifying District agencies to conduct required building, zoning, health, and safety inspections of participating schools\u0097a requirement that is not detailed in the cooperative agreement signed by Education and the Trust\u0097but would assist the Trust in providing continued oversight of schools participating in OSP.

The District\u2019s program is known as  the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), and it was reauthorized  in 2011 for 5 years under new legislation, the Scholarships for  Opportunity and Results Act (SOAR Act).Congress has provided more than $152 million for OSP, which has, in  turn, provided expanded school choice to low-income students by  awarding almost 5,000 scholarships to students who would unlikely have  otherwise been able to attend private school. Questions have been  raised, however, about whether students have as broad a choice as  intended. In the 2011-2012 school year, for example, over half of OSP  students were enrolled in only 15 percent of private schools that have  agreed to accept students from this program (participating schools).", "Since the program\u2019s inception,  In 2007, we reviewed OSP and found a need for increased accountability  from the program administrator. Specifically, we found that the  administrator at the time of our review\u2014the Washington Scholarship  Fund\u2014did not have the capacity to oversee participating private schools  and administer a growing scholarship program funded with federal  dollars. We also found that because of inadequate accountability  mechanisms, the program administrator could not provide key information  to low-income families about school performance, quality indicators, or  conformance with local safety and health regulations.", "In 2010, the Washington Scholarship Fund withdrew as the administrator  of OSP and the Department of Education (Education) transferred the  grant to run the program to the DC Children and Youth Investment Trust  Corporation (the Trust).

To assess the  extent to which scholarship recipients are able to make informed school  choices, we analyzed key documents regarding participating schools and  the OSP program that are available to parents. We also conducted site  visits to 10 participating schools and interviewed key school officials. In  selecting the schools we visited, we chose the 5 schools with the highest  absolute number of OSP students and the 5 schools with the highest  concentration of OSP students given the total enrollment at the school in  the 2011-2012 school year. In addition, we used information from the  2011-2012 OSP Participating School Directory (the Directory) as well as  OSP enrollment information for the 2011-2012 school year from the  Trust\u2019s database to better understand the characteristics of participating  schools. We also interviewed officials at the Trust and Education. To  assess the reliability of the enrollment data from school year 2004-2005  to school year 2011- 2012 from the Trust\u2019s database, we performed  electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We found  substantial problems with the data, including missing fields or partially  entered applications. However, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of determining characteristics of OSP  schools and students in school year 2011-2012. Lastly, to obtain  information about the experiences of families in the program, we  conducted two discussion groups\u2014one in English and one in Spanish\u2014 with parents and guardians of students who received and used an OSP  scholarship in the 2012-2013 school year.", "To assess the extent to which the Trust\u2019s internal controls ensure  accountability for OSP, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations,  internal documents such as the Trust\u2019s policies and procedures manual,  as well as generally accepted guiding documents for internal controls  including those published by GAO and the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We also analyzed  the Trust\u2019s database for administering OSP.

The Directory also excluded information about  parental involvement or fundraising fees. Some schools can  reimburse at least part of these fees if parents volunteer a certain  number of hours, according to four school officials. If a family cannot  fulfill these volunteer hours, then it must pay these fees out of pocket  because these fees are not covered under the OSP scholarship. Most  OSP students attend schools where the maximum OSP scholarship  amount would cover the estimated total cost of attendance (see  sidebar). But without having this information, it is difficult for families to  know the full cost of attendance, and they may be responsible for  paying fees that they were unaware of. This may be difficult, given this  program\u2019s target population.", "Accreditation: The Directory also offers families incomplete  information about schools\u2019 accreditation status.

The Directory indicates which accrediting organizations are  recognized by the District. However, the Directory lists some schools\u2019  affiliated memberships as an accreditation organization. For example,  one school was listed as having the National Association of Episcopal  Schools as an accrediting organization, but this organization does not  accredit schools. Three schools were listed as being accredited by  Nativity Miguel, which is a network of schools serving low-income  communities, not an accrediting organization.", "Some families we spoke with told us that they did not receive the  Directory or tuition information, and therefore, they were not aware of  which costs would not be covered by OSP or which schools were  participating in the program. Instead, they communicated directly with  schools about whether they were participating in the program. Although  the Directory is publicly available on the Trust\u2019s website, not all program  participants may have computer or Internet access. In addition, even if  families have Internet access through smart phones, this does not  necessarily mean that program participants can use them to access  everything they need, according to one school official. Trust officials told  us they provide direct assistance to families to help them select schools  and discern their total cost of attendance, but not all families may be  receiving this assistance.", "In addition to having incomplete information, the Directory has also been  published too late to truly assist families in selecting a school. Families  need to select schools for their students before the school year starts in  August or September. However, the Trust published the Directory for the  2012-2013 school year in May 2013, about 9 months after the start of that  school year. According to Trust officials, the Directory was published late  because the school site visits\u2014during which Trust officials confirm and  update key school data for the Directory\u2014occurred later in the year than  in previous years due to substantial staff changes. Trust officials also told  us that these directories are primarily meant to inform families selecting  schools for the upcoming school year.

For  example, officials at two schools we visited told us that as a result of the  scholarship lottery and school fair being held in July and August 2012,  respectively, they did not know how many students would be enrolled at  their schools until just a few weeks before the school year started in  August.

Trust officials  noted that some schools use prior year income information to determine  provisional financial aid awards, reconcile these awards with the current  year\u2019s tax information once that is available, and rescind financial aid  awards if the incomes exceed a certain level. Trust officials expressed  concerns about having to potentially rescind any scholarships, even  though the chance that incomes will change so substantially among  program participants is low. Trust officials are currently exploring ways to  use prior year income information to determine eligibility earlier in the  year and enable them to award scholarships earlier.

If a school cannot reasonably meet  its financial obligations, it could be monitored more closely before and  after being accepted into the program. If a school is overly reliant on OSP  funds, which would be determined by the Trust, further review or  increased monitoring could be warranted.

While the Trust\u2019s policy manual does provide guidance for tracking  employee time that should be billed to the program, it does not provide  guidance for other expenses such as rent, telephone, printing, or office  supplies, which could possibly be counted as administrative expenses for  purposes of seeking reimbursement. The cost of administering OSP could  be higher or lower than the 3 percent designated for administrative costs.  Because these expenses were not tracked prior to October 2012, the true  cost of administering the OSP program is unknown.

According  to Education officials, grantees do not typically document why they have  not drawn down funds. In addition, they explained that Education\u2019s grants  management system automatically flags funds that have not been drawn  down within a particular time frame and the system has not flagged the  Trust since funds had been drawn for the scholarships.

For example,  in OSP, it is important that Trust officials have access to accurate, up-to- date student application information in order to meet program objectives,  such as determining eligibility and awarding OSP scholarships in an  efficient and timely manner. Similarly, families of OSP scholarship award  recipients, as consumers, need complete and timely information about  participating schools to make informed decisions about what school is  best for the student. The Trust\u2019s database has several deficiencies  including a lack of documentation and automated checks, and a deficient  structure, which leaves the database open to errors and slows the Trust\u2019s  ability to manage the program on a day-to-day basis, and communicate  information about the program to families and Education.", "The Trust (including the contractor that created and maintains the  database) does not have any documentation for this database. For  example, there is no user guide or data dictionary, and potential users of  the database must rely on the institutional memory of select users who  have had more experience with the database to understand how to  properly use the database or the definitions of key data fields. When we  attempted to follow various verbal or informal written instructions for using  the database, we found flaws in these instructions that necessitated  several rounds of follow-up to successfully perform key functions and  basic data manipulation. It is not known what specifically caused this  condition, but Trust officials have noted financial constraints in requesting  more support from the contractor.", "In addition to lacking documentation, the database does not have key  automated checks built into the system to ensure accuracy and efficient  data entry. Automated checks help maintain integrity in a database  reducing the risk that a significant mistake could occur and remain  undetected and uncorrected. For example, the Trust\u2019s database does not  have checks to determine if a student\u2019s application information has  already been entered. When a student submits an application, before his  or her information is entered into the system, a Trust staff person must  run searches in the database for his or her name, the guardian\u2019s name,  both persons\u2019 Social Security numbers and address to ensure the  applicant is not already in the system. These checks are necessary  because the system allows duplicate entry of the same student  information, potentially rendering the data unreliable, even with the  searches described above. To ensure data are accurate given the lack of  automated checks, the Trust stated that one of their officials runs several  queries and creates tables in Microsoft Excel to check for errors by hand  on a weekly or more frequent basis during key periods for the program.", "The database\u2019s current structure hampers an administrator\u2019s ability to  look at historical trends and use them as an effective management tool.  When the Trust inherited the database from the Washington Scholarship  Fund, the older data in the system were not cleaned, and thus there are  many records in the database with missing fields, or applications that are  only partially entered, suggesting they are not valid records. The Trust  has stated they cannot attest to the accuracy of these older data. Yet, the  Trust is using these older data in reports without an explanation of the  potential issues of inaccuracy.", "The weaknesses in the database\u2019s structure also affect key activities for  the Trust, such as determining the priority groups of applications for the  OSP lottery. As stated earlier in this report, the SOAR Act states that if  more students apply to OSP than the program can accommodate, the  grantee (the Trust) must ensure that applicants are selected for awards  through a random selection process that gives weight to three priority  groups (which the Trust has implemented through a lottery). The groups  of applicants that have a priority status as defined in the SOAR Act are:  (1) applicants who are currently attending a school that has been  identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the  Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965, as amended; (2) applicants who  have a sibling currently participating in OSP; and (3) applicants who  received an OSP scholarship award in a previous year but did not use it.  Using the Trust\u2019s database, we employed our own methodology to  replicate the process to determine the number of students in each  applicant priority group for the 2011-2012 school year because no  documentation exists for these queries. However, we were unable to  determine which students belonged in the third priority category of  students for the 2011-2012 school year because a key variable necessary  for this calculation appears to be unreliably populated. In other words, it  does not appear possible to use the Trust\u2019s database to derive this  priority category and puts in question the Trust\u2019s ability to provide  accurate priority categories for the OSP lottery.", "Lastly, data entry of application information is also problematic. In  addition to basic eligibility information, OSP applications also include  important information needed for the third-party evaluation of the OSP  program. According to Education officials, the evaluation timelines have  been negatively affected for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years  because data entry was not completed in a timely manner. In one  instance the Trust had to retrieve hard copies of the applications from  storage and send relevant application data to the officials involved in the  evaluation because they were so behind in data entry.

For example, Education could require the Trust to develop and  implement a plan for how it will address its timeliness in mandatory  financial reporting.", "Conduct activities to ensure that the Trust: publishes the school Directory prior to participating schools\u2019  application deadlines with more complete information. more closely aligns its scholarship timeframes with schools\u2019  admissions and enrollment schedules. Education could find ways  to assist the Trust in executing the OSP lottery earlier in the  school year, for example, by allowing the Trust to use the prior  year\u2019s income information to make preliminary determinations  regarding eligibility.  improves its OSP database by creating and maintaining  documentation for the use of the database, adding automated  checks to the system, creating flags and/or variables for the key  priority categories called for in the SOAR Act, and streamlining the  data entry process for new applications in order to ensure there is  sufficiently reliable data regarding the operation of the program.", "Require the Trust to update its policies and procedures in several key  respects, and monitor the Trust\u2019s activities to ensure that these  updates are made.

Education officials  provided technical comments, which were incorporated into the final  report as appropriate. Written comments from Education and the Trust  are reproduced in appendices V and VI, respectively, and are also  summarized below. The District did not provide written comments on the  draft report. In its comments, Education did not indicate agreement or  disagreement with our recommendations. The Trust generally agreed with  our recommendations, but disagreed with some of the findings. Both  Education and the Trust provided additional information on issues raised  in the report.", "In its letter, Education stated that it took the issues raised in the GAO  report seriously and would continue to consider them carefully, but noted  that the report did not fully reflect the Trust\u2019s efforts to provide complete  and timely information about participating schools to OSP families.  However, in our final report, we discuss a number of different ways in  which the Trust provides information and assistance to current and  prospective OSP families, and we believe we adequately reflected the  Trust\u2019s efforts. Education also noted that the report does not fully  recognize the significant staff turnover in leadership at the Trust, which  affected several aspects of the Trust\u2019s implementation of the program in  school year 2012-2013. We recognize that the Trust faced a number of  challenges as it assumed responsibility for the program. However, several  issues that we identified in the report are not new, but rather contribute to  long-standing weaknesses in internal controls and oversight of the  program. Therefore, we believe that if Education had provided more  effective oversight of the program and more timely technical assistance to  the Trust, many of the challenges identified in the report could have been  addressed sooner. In addition, more effective internal controls, including  robust policies and procedures for program administration and school  oversight, could have helped to smooth the difficulties associated with the  transition in leadership and program administration.", "The Trust disagreed with our finding that its Participating School Directory  provided incomplete and untimely information. More specifically, in its  comments, the Trust emphasized that this condition does not exist under  the current management and administration of OSP and that the Trust  provides information through a comprehensive array of tools, events, and  individualized assistance. We acknowledge the substantial change in staff  that occurred at the Trust and discuss in our report the number of ways in  which the Trust provides assistance to families through channels other  than the Directory. However, the most recent Directory\u2014a key source of  school information for families\u2014was still published too late and contained  incomplete information about tuition, fees, and accreditation. Education\u2019s  written comments focus on the Trust making a deliberate decision to  maintain a reasonably sized, user-friendly directory with straightforward  information on average tuition and fees and on the efforts of the Trust to  provide individualized ongoing assistance to families and assistance  through school placement fairs. We agree that the Directory must be  prepared for a non-technical audience, but continue to believe that for a  program predicated on choice, it is imperative that the Trust provide  families with complete and timely information needed to make informed  decisions, especially with respect to tuition and fees. The Trust could  accomplish this without overburdening families with excessive information  by using a general notation for schools that have discounted or different  tuition rates, as the Trust noted in its written comments, or providing a  range of the potential total cost of attendance for families. As the Trust  indicated in its letter, it could also include more accurate notation of  school-accrediting bodies. We support the Trust\u2019s efforts to update the  Directory for future school years by including more complete information  for OSP families.", "In addition, in its comments, Education noted that substantial changes in  the Trust\u2019s staff and leadership transition affected the timing of the Trust\u2019s  site visits at participating schools. As we discuss in our report, these  circumstances resulted in site visits occurring later in the year, which in  turn affected the timeliness of the Directory\u2019s publication. We  acknowledge that this is not a routine practice of the Trust and encourage  the Trust to continue to work toward conducting these site visits earlier in  the school year and publishing the Directory earlier. We also support  Education\u2019s plans to work with the Trust to provide the Directory prior to  participating schools\u2019 application deadlines. The plan to publish the  Directory by December 2013 for the 2013-2014 school year, and by  November in future school years, represents a marked improvement in  the timeliness of the school directories. However, we maintain that  families need to have information about schools prior to participating  schools\u2019 application deadlines. We encourage Education and the Trust to  consider publishing the Directory earlier than November or December to  help families start making school decisions as early as possible in the  scholarship application process, ensuring that families have the full range  of school options available to them.", "In response to GAO\u2019s finding regarding the misalignment of scholarship  awards with participating schools\u2019 admissions and enrollment schedules,  Education expressed concern that an earlier scholarship lottery date  could, among other things, result in the Trust conducting less outreach to  potential applicants. We acknowledge the steps that Education identified  the Trust needs to take prior to the lottery, such as screening applications  for eligibility, conducting multiple rounds of baseline testing, and ensuring  that the lottery pool of eligible applicants is sufficient so that the  evaluation can proceed with the necessary sample size. Education stated  that the Trust would need to submit a proposal to Education if it wanted to  use a different approach for screening student eligibility, such as using a  different year\u2019s income information, that could help expedite the steps  leading up to the lottery. We support Education\u2019s consideration of any  proposal to use a different approach that would ultimately enable the  Trust to award scholarships earlier and ensure that OSP families have the  widest range of choice possible, and we would encourage the Trust to  fully consider the issues, and if it deems it appropriate, develop such a  proposal for Education\u2019s consideration.", "The Trust also disagreed with our finding regarding its lack of policies and  procedures for implementing and overseeing OSP, stating that its policies  and procedures manual clearly and accurately reflects the policies and  procedures governing the program. Further, the Trust stated that although  amendments to the policies and procedures regarding allocation of costs  and reconciliation were codified in August 2013, these policies were in  practice prior to that date. GAO applauds the Trust\u2019s efforts to increase  oversight of participating schools and update their policies and  procedures accordingly. Despite the Trust\u2019s claims that these policies and  procedures were already in practice, GAO does not consider these  policies and procedures fully implemented until these activities take place  on a regular basis. In addition, the Trust\u2019s revised policies and procedures  do not address all of the weaknesses for which GAO recommended  action, such as developing a process for addressing schools that are  noncompliant with program requirements. Education commented that the  Trust\u2019s proposed revisions to the letter of agreement with participating  schools reserves the Trust\u2019s right to limit or suspend a school\u2019s  participation in OSP and that any OSP schools that require further  discussion about compliance would be handled on a case-by-case basis.  However, we continue to believe that the Trust needs to develop a more  clearly defined, comprehensive written policy to address schools that are  noncompliant.", "With regard to weaknesses GAO identified in the structure of the Trust\u2019s  database, the Trust stated they would take GAO\u2019s comments under  advisement and consider key changes and improvements. The Trust  stated that the database is proficient in areas such as determining student  eligibility, student invoicing, school oversight documentation tracking, and  notation of communication with individual families and schools. The Trust  also noted that they must use outside spreadsheets to complete any  reporting on historical information about the program, and that automated  checks do not exist, but the database does not impede data collection or  identification of student sub-groups for inclusion in the scholarship lottery  (referred to in this report as \u201cpriority categories\u201d). Based on our review,  we continue to believe that the Trust\u2019s ability to determine the third priority  category described in the SOAR Act\u2014applicants who received an OSP  scholarship award in a previous year but did not use it\u2014is questionable  because, according to GAO\u2019s analysis, a key variable in the database  used to determine this priority category is not reliable.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  issue date.

It is  the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing  discipline and structure. Control environment factors include the  integrity, ethical values and competence of the entity\u2019s people;  management\u2019s philosophy and operating style; the way management  assigns authority and responsibility, and organizes and develops its  people; and the attention and direction provided by the board of  directors. The control environment has a pervasive influence on the  way business activities are structured, objectives established and  risks assessed. It also influences control activities, information and  communication systems, and monitoring activities. This is true not  only of their design, but also the way they work day to day. The  control environment is influenced by the entity\u2019s history and culture. It  influences the control consciousness of its people. Effectively  controlled entities strive to have competent people, instill an  enterprise-wide attitude of integrity and control consciousness, and  set a positive \u201ctone at the top.\u201d They establish appropriate policies and  procedures, often including a written code of conduct, which foster  shared values and teamwork in pursuit of the entity\u2019s objectives.", "Risk Assessment: Every entity faces a variety of risks from external  and internal sources that must be assessed. A precondition to risk  assessment is establishment of objectives, linked at different levels  and internally consistent. Risk assessment is the identification and  analysis of relevant risks to achievement of the objectives, forming a  basis for determining how the risks should be managed. Because  economic, industry, regulatory and operating conditions will continue  to change, mechanisms are needed to identify and deal with the  special risks associated with change. All entities, regardless of size,  structure, nature or industry, encounter risks at all levels within their  organizations. Risks affect each entity\u2019s ability to survive; successfully  compete within its industry; maintain its financial strength and positive  public image; and maintain the overall quality of its products, services  and people. There is no practical way to reduce risk to zero. Indeed,  the decision to be in business creates risk. Management must  determine how much risk is to be prudently accepted, and strive to  maintain risk within these levels. Objective setting is a precondition to  risk assessment. There must first be objectives before management  can identify risks to their achievement and take necessary actions to  manage the risks. Objective setting, then, is a key part of the  management process. While not an internal control component, it is a  prerequisite to and enabler of internal control. This chapter first  discusses objectives, followed by the discussion of risks.", "Control Activities: Control activities are policies and procedures,  which are the actions of people to implement the policies, to help  ensure that management directives identified as necessary to address  risks are carried out. They help ensure that necessary actions are  taken to address risks to achievement of the entity\u2019s objectives.  Control activities occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in  all functions. They include a range of activities including approvals,  authorizations, verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating  performance, security of assets and segregation of duties. Control  activities can be divided into three categories, based on the nature of  the entity\u2019s objectives to which they relate: operations, financial  reporting, or compliance. Although some controls relate solely to one  area, there is often overlap. Depending on circumstances, a particular  control activity could help satisfy entity objectives in more than one of  the three categories. For example, operations controls also can help  ensure reliable financial reporting and financial reporting controls can  serve to effect compliance. Although these categories are helpful in  discussing internal control, the particular category in which a control  happens to be placed is not as important as the role it plays in  achieving a particular activity\u2019s objectives.", "Information and Communication: Pertinent information must be  identified, captured and communicated in a form and time frame that  enables people to carry out their responsibilities. Information systems  produce reports, containing operational, financial and compliance- related information, that make it possible to run and control the  business. They deal not only with internally generated data, but also  information about external events, activities and conditions necessary  to informed business decision-making and external reporting.  Effective communication also must occur in a broader sense, flowing  down, across and up the organization. All personnel must receive a  clear message from top management that control responsibilities must  be taken seriously. They must understand their own role in the  internal control system, as well as how individual activities relate to  the work of others. They must have a means of communicating  significant information upstream. There also needs to be effective  communication with external parties, such as customers, suppliers,  regulators and shareholders. Every enterprise must capture pertinent  information, financial and non-financial, relating to external as well as  internal events and activities. The information must be identified by  management as relevant to managing the business. It must be  delivered to people who need it in a form and timeframe that enables  them to carry out their control and other responsibilities.", "Monitoring: Internal control systems need to be monitored, a process  that assesses the quality of the system\u2019s performance over time. This  is accomplished through ongoing monitoring activities, separate  evaluations or a combination of the two. Ongoing monitoring occurs in  the course of operations. It includes regular management and  supervisory activities, and other actions personnel take in performing  their duties. The scope and frequency of separate evaluations will  depend primarily on an assessment of risks and the effectiveness of  ongoing monitoring procedures. Internal control deficiencies should be  reported upstream, with serious matters reported to top management  and the board. Internal control systems change over time. The way  controls are applied may evolve. Once-effective procedures can  become less effective, or perhaps are no longer performed. This can  be due to the arrival of new personnel, the varying effectiveness of  training and supervision, time and resource constraints or additional  pressures. Furthermore, circumstances for which the internal control  system originally was designed also may change, causing it to be less  able to warn of the risks brought by new conditions. Accordingly,  management needs to determine whether the internal control system  continues to be relevant and able to address new risks. Monitoring  ensures that internal control continues to operate effectively. This  process involves assessment by appropriate personnel of the design  and operation of controls on a suitably timely basis, and the taking of  necessary actions. It applies to all activities within an organization,  and sometimes to outside contractors as well. For example, with  outsourcing of health claims processing to a third-party administrator,  and such processing directly affects benefits\u2019 costs, the entity will  want to monitor the functioning of the administrator\u2019s activities and  controls.", "GAO Standards for Internal Controlthe five standards of internal control:   for federal agencies also comprise", "Control Environment: Management and employees should establish  and maintain an environment throughout the organization that sets a  positive and supportive attitude toward internal controls and  conscientious management. A positive control environment is the  foundation for all other standards. Several key factors affect the  control environment including the integrity and ethical values  maintained and demonstrated by management and staff,  management\u2019s commitment to competence, and philosophy and  operating style. In addition, the agency\u2019s organizational structure and  the manner in which the agency delegates authority and responsibility  throughout the organization affect the control environment. Good  human capital policies and practices are another critical  environmental factor. A final factor affecting the control environment is  the agency\u2019s relationship with Congress and central oversight  agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget. Congress  mandates the programs that agencies undertake and monitors their  progress and central agencies provide policy and guidance on many  different matters. In addition, Inspectors General and internal senior  management councils can contribute to a good overall control  environment.", "Risk Assessment: Internal control should provide for an assessment  of the risks the agency faces from both external and internal sources.  A precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of clear,  consistent agency objectives. Risk assessment is the identification  and analysis of relevant risks associated with achieving the  objectives, such as those defined in strategic and annual performance  plans developed under the Government Performance and Results  Act, and forming a basis for determining how risks should be  managed. Management needs to comprehensively identify risks using  methods such as qualitative and quantitative ranking activities,  management conferences, forecasting and strategic planning, and  consideration of findings from audits and other assessments. Once  risks have been identified, they should be analyzed for their possible  effect. Because governmental, economic, industry, regulatory, and  operating conditions continually change, mechanisms should be  provided to identify and deal with any special risks prompted by such  changes.", "Control Activities: Internal control activities help ensure that  management\u2019s directives are carried out. The control activities should  be effective and efficient in accomplishing the agency\u2019s control  objectives. Control activities are policies, procedures, techniques, and  mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s directives, such as the  process of adhering to requirements for budget development and  execution. They help ensure that actions are taken to address risks.  Control activities are an integral part of an entity\u2019s planning,  implementing, reviewing, and accountability for stewardship of  government resources and achieving effective results. Control  activities occur at all levels and functions of the entity. They include a  wide range of diverse activities such as approvals, authorizations,  verifications, reconciliations, performance reviews, maintenance of  security, and the creation and maintenance of related records which  provide evidence of execution of these activities as well as  appropriate documentation. Control activities may be applied in a  computerized information system environment or though manual  processes. Activities may be classified by specific control objectives,  such as ensuring completeness and accuracy of information  processing. Examples of control activities include top level reviews of  actual performance, reviews by management at the functional or  activity level, management of human capital, controls over information  processing, physical control over vulnerable assets, establishment  and review of performance measures and indictors, segregation of  duties, proper execution of transactions and events, accurate and  timely recording of transactions and events, access restrictions to and  accountability for resources and records, and appropriate  documentation of transactions and internal control.", "Information and Communications: Information should be recorded  and communicated to management and others within the entity who  need it and in a form and within a time frame that enables them to  carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. For an entity  to run and control its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and  timely communications relating to internal as well as external events.  Information is needed throughout the agency to achieve all of its  objectives. Program managers need both operational and financial  data to determine whether they are meeting their agencies\u2019 strategic  and annual performance plans and meeting their goals for  accountability for effective and efficient use of resources. For  example, operating information is required for development of  financial reports. This covers a broad range of data from purchases,  subsidies, and other transactions to data on fixed assets, inventories,  and receivables. Operating information is also needed to determine  whether the agency is achieving its compliance requirements under  various laws and regulations. Financial information is needed for both  external and internal uses. It is required to develop financial  statements for periodic external reporting, and, on a day-to-day basis,  to make operating decisions, monitor performance, and allocate  resources. Pertinent information should be identified, captured, and  distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to perform  their duties efficiently. Effective communications should occur in a  broad sense with information flowing down, across, and up the  organization. In addition to internal communications, management  should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and  obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have a  significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. Moreover,  effective information technology management is critical to achieving  useful, reliable, and continuous recording and communication of  information.", "Monitoring: Internal control monitoring should assess the quality of  performance over time and ensure that the findings of audits and  other reviews are promptly resolved. Internal control should generally  be designed to assure that ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of  normal operations. It is performed continually and is ingrained in the  agency\u2019s operations. It includes regular management and supervisory  activities, comparisons, reconciliations, and other actions people take  in performing their duties. Separate evaluations of control can also be  useful by focusing directly on the controls\u2019 effectiveness at a specific  time. The scope and frequency of separate evaluations should  depend primarily on the assessment of risks and the effectiveness of  ongoing monitoring procedures. Separate evaluations may take the  form of self-assessments as well as review of control design and  direct testing of internal control. Separate evaluations also may be  performed by the agency Inspector General or an external auditor.  Deficiencies found during ongoing monitoring or through separate  evaluations should be communicated to the individual responsible for  the function and also to at least one level of management above that  individual. Serious matters should be reported to top management.  Monitoring of internal control should include policies and procedures  for ensuring that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly  resolved. Managers are to (1) promptly evaluate findings from audits  and other reviews, including those showing deficiencies and  recommendations reported by auditors and others who evaluate  agencies\u2019 operations, (2) determine proper actions in response to  findings and recommendations from audits and reviews, and (3)  complete, within established time frames, all actions that correct or  otherwise resolve the matters brought to management\u2019s attention. The  resolution process begins when audit or other review results are  reported to management, and is completed only after action has been  taken that (1) corrects identified deficiencies, (2) produces  improvements, or (3) demonstrates the findings and  recommendations do not warrant management action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the District of Columbia Children and Youth Investment Trust Corporation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Gretta L.
