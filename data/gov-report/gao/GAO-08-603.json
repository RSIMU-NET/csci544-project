Despite much variation, all of these laws require covered agencies to assign overall responsibility for privacy protection and compliance to a senior agency official. In addition, Office of Management and Budget guidance directs agencies to designate a senior agency official for privacy with specific responsibilities. The specific privacy responsibilities defined in these laws and guidance can be grouped into six broad categories: (1) conducting privacy impact assessments (which are intended to ensure that privacy requirements are addressed when personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system), (2) complying with the Privacy Act, (3) reviewing and evaluating the privacy implications of agency policies, (4) producing reports on the status of privacy protections, (5) ensuring that redress procedures to handle privacy inquiries and complaints are in place, and (6) ensuring that employees and contractors receive appropriate training. The laws and guidance vary in how they frame requirements in these categories and which agencies must adhere to them. Agencies also have varying organizational structures to address privacy responsibilities. For example, of the 12 agencies we reviewed, 2 had statutorily designated chief privacy officers who also served as senior agency officials for privacy, 5 designated their agency chief information officers as their senior privacy officials, and the others designated a variety of other officials, such as the general counsel or assistant secretary for management. Further, not all of the agencies we reviewed had given their designated senior officials full oversight over all privacy-related functions. While 6 agencies had these officials overseeing all key privacy functions, 6 others relied on other organizational units not overseen by the designated senior official to perform certain key privacy functions. The fragmented way in which privacy functions were assigned to organizational units in these agencies is at least partly the result of evolving requirements in law and guidance. However, without oversight of all key privacy functions, designated senior officials may be unable to effectively serve as agency central focal points for information privacy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As you know, government agencies have long-standing obligations to  protect the privacy of individuals about whom they collect personal  information.

To address our second objective, we analyzed  policies and procedures at these agencies, and interviewed senior agency  privacy officials to identify the privacy management structures used at  each of these agencies and the roles and responsibilities of senior privacy  officials. The agencies included in this review (Departments of Commerce,  Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor,  State, Treasury, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Social  Security Administration and the U.S. Agency for International  Development) are major agencies with statutorily designated privacy  officers, have a central mission for which the collection of personally  identifiable information is a critical component, or have implemented a  unique organizational privacy structure. We examined and compared  agency management structures for fulfilling privacy responsibilities and  assessed the differences in roles and responsibilities of privacy officers  based on the differences in agencies\u2019 organizational structures. We  conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to May 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Recent data breaches of  personal information at government agencies, such as the data breach at  the Department of Veterans Affairs, which exposed the personal  information of 26.5 million veterans and active duty members of the  military in May 2006, have raised concerns about identity theft. In  addition, increasingly sophisticated analytical techniques employed by  federal agencies, such as data mining, also raise concerns about how  personally identifiable information is used and what controls are placed  on its use. Concerns such as these have focused attention on the  structures agencies have instituted to ensure privacy protections are in  place.", "The major requirements for privacy protection by federal agencies come  from two laws, the Privacy Act of 1974 and the E-Gov Act of 2002.", "The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and  use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act  describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information  about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her  name or another personal identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as  a group of records under the control of any agency from which  information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual  identifier. The Privacy Act requires that when agencies maintain a system  of records, they must notify the public by a system-of-records notice: that  is, a notice in the Federal Register identifying, among other things, the  type of data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is  collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d use of the data, and procedures that  individuals can use to review and correct personal information. The act  also requires agencies to define and limit their use of covered personal  information. In addition, the act requires that to the greatest extent  practicable, personal information should be collected directly from the  subject individual when it may affect an individual\u2019s rights or benefits  under a federal program.", "The E-Gov Act of 2002 also assigns agencies significant responsibilities  relating to privacy. The E-Gov Act strives to enhance protection for  personal information in government information systems or information  collections by requiring that agencies conduct PIAs. A PIA is an analysis of  how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a  federal system. Furthermore, according to OMB guidance, a PIA is an  analysis of how information is handled. Specifically, a PIA is to (1) ensure  that handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy  requirements regarding privacy; (2) determine the risks and effects of  collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form  in an electronic information system; and (3) examine and evaluate  protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate  potential privacy risks.", "Agencies must conduct PIAs (1) before developing or procuring  information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in a personally identifiable form or (2) before initiating  any new data collections involving personal information that will be  collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology if the  same questions are asked of 10 or more people. To the extent that PIAs are  made publicly available, they provide explanations to the public about  such things as the information that will be collected, why it is being  collected, how it is to be used, and how the system and data will be  maintained and protected.", "OMB is tasked with providing guidance to agencies on how to implement  the provisions of these two acts and has done so, beginning with guidance  on the Privacy Act, issued in 1975. The guidance provides explanations for  the various provisions of the law as well as detailed instructions on how to  comply. OMB\u2019s guidance on implementing the privacy provisions of the E- Gov Act of 2002 identifies circumstances under which agencies must  conduct PIAs and explains how to conduct them.", "We have previously reported on the role of senior privacy officials in the  federal government. In 2006, we testified that the elevation of privacy  officers to senior positions reflected the growing demands that these  individuals faced in addressing privacy challenges on a day-to-day basis.  The challenges we identified included ensuring compliance with relevant  privacy laws, such as the Privacy Act and the E-Gov Act, and controlling  the collection and use of personal information obtained from commercial  sources. Additionally, in 2007 we reported that the DHS Privacy Office had  made significant progress in carrying out its statutory responsibilities  under the Homeland Security Act and its related role in ensuring E-Gov  Act compliance, but noted that more work remained to be accomplished.  We recommended that DHS designate privacy officers at key DHS  components, implement a department wide process for reviewing Privacy  Act notices, establish a schedule for the timely issuance of privacy reports,  and ensure that the Privacy Office\u2019s annual reports to Congress contain a  specific discussion of complaints of privacy violations.

Relevant  laws include the following:    The Homeland Security Act of 2002 directed the secretary of DHS to  designate a senior official with primary responsibility for privacy policy.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required  the Director of National Intelligence to appoint a Civil Liberties Protection  Officer and assigned this individual specific privacy responsibilities.", "The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization  Act of 2005 instructed the Attorney General to designate a senior official  with primary responsibility for privacy policy.", "The Transportation, Treasury, Independent Agencies and General  Government Appropriations Act of 2005 directed each agency whose  appropriations were provided by the act, including the Departments of  Transportation and Treasury, to designate a CPO with primary  responsibility for privacy and data protection policy.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  instructed the heads of Defense, DHS, Justice, Treasury, Health and  Human Services, and State, as well as the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency to designate no  less than one senior officer to serve as a privacy and civil liberties officer.  Specific privacy provisions of these laws are summarized in appendix II.", "A number of OMB memorandums have also addressed the roles and  responsibilities of senior privacy officials. In 1999, OMB required agencies  to designate a senior official to assume primary responsibility for privacy  policy. OMB later reiterated this requirement in its guidance on  compliance with the E-Gov Act, in which it directed agency heads to  designate an appropriate senior official with responsibility for the  coordination and implementation of OMB Web and privacy policy and to  serve as the agency\u2019s principal contact for privacy policies. Most recently,  in 2005, OMB directed agencies to designate an SAOP with agency wide  responsibility for information privacy issues and with responsibility for  specific privacy functions, including ensuring agency compliance with all  federal privacy laws, playing a central policy-making role in the  development of policy proposals that implicate privacy issues, and  ensuring that contractors and employees are provided with adequate  privacy training.", "Beginning in 2005, OMB has also issued guidance significantly enhancing  longstanding requirements for agencies to report on their compliance with  privacy laws. OMB\u2019s 2005 guidance directed agencies to add a new  section addressing privacy to their annual reports under the Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA). SAOPs were assigned  responsibility for completion of this section, in which they were to report  on such things as agency policies and procedures for the conduct of PIAs,  agency policies for ensuring adequate privacy training, as well as their  own involvement in agency regulatory and policy decisions. In 2006, OMB  issued further guidance requiring agencies to include as part of their  FISMA reports a section addressing measures for protecting personally  identifiable information. This guidance also required that agencies provide  OMB with quarterly privacy updates and report all incidents relating to the  loss of or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information.  Most recently, OMB directed agencies in 2007 to include in their FISMA  reports additional items, such as their breach notification policies, plans to  eliminate unnecessary use of Social Security numbers, and plans for  reviewing and reducing their holdings of personally identifiable  information.", "These laws and guidance set a variety of requirements for senior officials  to carry out specific privacy responsibilities. These responsibilities can be  grouped into the following six key functions:    Conduct of PIAs: A PIA is an analysis of how personal information is  collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system, and is required  before developing or procuring information technology that collects,  maintains, or disseminates information that is in a personally identifiable  form. Several laws assign privacy officials at covered agencies  responsibilities that are met in part by performing PIAs on systems that  collect, process, or store personally identifiable information. This includes  the requirements for several agencies to ensure that \u201ctechnologies sustain  and do not erode privacy protections.\u201d Furthermore, OMB guidance  requires agency SAOPs to ensure compliance with federal laws,  regulations, and policies relating to information privacy, such as the E-Gov  Act, which spells out agency PIA requirements.", "Privacy Act compliance: As previously discussed, the Privacy Act sets a  variety of requirements for all federal agencies regarding privacy  protection. For example, the act requires that when agencies establish or  make changes to a system of records, they must notify the public by a  notice in the Federal Register , identifying, among other things, the type of  data collected, the types of individuals about whom information is  collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d use of the data, and procedures that  individuals can use to review and correct personal information. Several  other laws explicitly direct agency privacy officials to ensure that the  personal information contained in their Privacy Act systems of records is  handled in compliance with fair information practices as set out in the act.  Further, OMB guidance assigns agency SAOPs with responsibility for  ensuring Privacy Act compliance.", "Policy consultation: Relevant laws direct senior privacy officials to  actively participate in the development and evaluation of privacy-sensitive  agency policy decisions. Several specifically task the SAOP with  evaluating legislative and regulatory proposals or periodically reviewing  agency actions affecting privacy. As agencies develop new policies, senior  officials responsible for privacy issues play a key role in identifying and  mitigating potential privacy risks prior to finalizing a particular policy  decision. Moreover, OMB directed agency SAOPs to undertake a central  role in the development of policy proposals that implicate privacy issues.", "Privacy reporting: Agency senior privacy officials are often required to  prepare periodic reports to ensure transparency about their activities and  compliance with the law. Many laws reviewed required agencies to  produce periodic privacy reports to agency stakeholders and Congress.  OMB also requires agency SAOPs to report on their privacy activities as  part of their annual FISMA reports, including such measures as their total  numbers of systems of records, the number of written privacy complaints  they have received, and whether a senior official has responsibility for all  privacy-related activities.", "Redress: With regard to federal agencies, the term \u201credress\u201d generally  refers to an agency\u2019s complaint resolution process, whereby individuals  may seek resolution of their concerns about an agency action. Specifically,  in the privacy context, redress refers to processes for handling privacy  inquiries and complaints as well as for allowing citizens who believe that  agencies are storing and using incorrect information about them to gain  access to and correct that information. The Privacy Act requires that all  agencies, with certain exceptions, allow individuals access to their records  and the ability to have inaccurate information corrected. Several recent  laws also direct senior privacy officials at specific agencies to provide  redress by ensuring that they have adequate procedures for investigating  and addressing privacy complaints by individuals. Several laws also  provide for attention to privacy in a broader context of civil liberties  protection.", "Privacy training: Privacy training is critical to ensuring that agency  employees and contractor personnel follow appropriate procedures and  take proper precautions when handling personally identifiable  information. For example, The Transportation, Treasury, Independent  Agencies and General Appropriations Act of 2005 requires senior privacy  officials at covered agencies to ensure that employees have adequate  privacy training. OMB also requires agency SAOPs to ensure that  employees and contractors receive privacy training.", "In addition to performing key privacy functions, requirements in laws  include responsibilities to ensure adequate security safeguards to protect  against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and destruction of sensitive  personal information. Generally, this is provided through agency  information security programs established under FISMA, and overseen by  agency CIOs and chief information security officers (CISO). Moreover,  OMB has issued guidance instructing agency heads to establish  appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure  the security and confidentiality of records.", "Figure 1 shows the extent to which laws have requirements that  specifically address each privacy function and to which agencies these  requirements apply."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Varying Privacy Management Structures, and Senior Agency Officials for Privacy Do Not Consistently Have Oversight of All Key Functions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have varying organizational structures to address privacy  responsibilities.

For two agencies\u2014Justice and Treasury\u2014the SAOP had oversight over all  key functions except for redress, which was handled by individual  component organizations. For the other four agencies, key functions were  divided among two or more organizations, and the senior privacy official  did not have oversight of all of them. For example, key privacy functions  at Labor were being performed not only by the office of the CIO (who is  also the SAOP) but also by the Office of the Solicitor, who is independent  of the CIO. Likewise, the senior official at Commerce was responsible for  overseeing conduct of PIAs, policy consultation, and privacy training,  while a separate Privacy Act Officer was responsible for Privacy Act  compliance.

However, Treasury disagreed with a statement  in our draft report that it had realigned its organization in order to ensure  that the SAOP had oversight of privacy functions. We recognize that  privacy functions, with the exception of redress, were under the oversight  of the SAOP prior to the reorganization and accordingly have deleted this  statement from the final report. Treasury also disagreed that its SAOP did  not have full oversight of agency redress processes, stating that the  department has longstanding regulations that provide departmentwide and  bureau-specific policies and procedures relating to redress. While we  agree that such redress policies are in place, they do not establish a role  for the SAOP. Clearly defining the role of the SAOP in the departmental  redress procedures would help ensure that the SAOP has oversight of this  key privacy function.

We did not evaluate agency compliance with these laws and  guidance.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed and analyzed relevant laws  and guidance to determine privacy responsibilities for privacy officials at  agencies. We reviewed relevant laws, including the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, and others (see app. II for a full listing), which  designate senior privacy officials and assign them privacy responsibilities.  We also analyzed the Paperwork Reduction Act, which has long-standing  privacy requirements assigned to agency chief information officers (CIO),  and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance relating to the  designation of senior agency officials with privacy responsibilities, such as  Memorandum M-05-08. We also analyzed the specific privacy  responsibilities identified in these laws and guidance and categorized the  key privacy functions they represented.", "To address our second objective, we identified 12 agencies (Departments  of Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security,  Justice, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs; the  Social Security Administration, and the U.S. Agency for International  Development) that either have a statutorily designated privacy officer,  have a central mission for which privacy protection is a critical  component, or have implemented a unique organizational privacy  structure. We analyzed policies and procedures at these agencies, and  interviewed senior agency privacy officials to identify the privacy  management structures used at each of these agencies and the roles and  responsibilities of senior privacy officials. We also compared the varying  management structures at these agencies to identify the differences and  similarities across agencies in their implementation of these structures.  Further, we analyzed agency management structures to determine  whether senior privacy officials at each of these agencies had full  oversight over all key functions.", "We conducted our work from September 2007 to May 2008, in Washington,  D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
