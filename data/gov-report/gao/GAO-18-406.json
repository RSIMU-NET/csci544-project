AOUSC officials are working with the filers to ensure these reports will be filed.", "The Judicial Conference established procedures for responding to requests for copies of financial disclosure reports, and the number of reports released has varied. From 2012 through 2016, AOUSC annually received, on average, about 70 requests for copies of judicial officials' reports and released approximately 16,000 reports during this time. Each request can vary\u2014from a request for a single judicial official's report to a request for multiple judicial officials' reports.", "From 2012 through 2016, a small percentage of judicial officials requested redactions from their financial disclosure reports. On average, 3.2 percent of financial disclosure reports filed included a redaction request and about 85 percent of those requests were granted. Of the information requested to be redacted, about 76 percent was related to the unsecured location of a judicial official's spouse, child, or residence. AOUSC is required by federal law to submit annual reports to Congress on use of the judicial redaction authority, such as the number of reports with redactions and types of information redacted, but AOUSC has not consistently submitted the reports on an annual basis in recent years.

Specific threats could include the  potential for kidnapping or extortion, or a threat of violence against a  judge by a former defendant or litigant. For example, in 2012, a federal  judge requested that certain information be redacted from his financial  disclosure report after an inmate convicted of threatening to kill the judge  was released from prison and requested a copy of the judge\u2019s report, as  well as information on the judge\u2019s home security system. The law that  authorizes the judiciary to redact financial disclosure reports also requires  it to submit annual reports on the operation of its redaction authority to  specified congressional committees.

In light of the importance of  balancing these goals, you asked us to review the process for filing  financial disclosure reports and requesting redactions of information from  those reports, and to provide data on the numbers and types of  information being redacted. This report addresses the following  questions:  (1) What actions has the Judicial Conference taken to ensure that judicial  officials are complying with the requirement to file financial disclosure  reports and how many reports have been filed each year from 2012  through 2016?  (2) Is the judiciary complying with procedures for responding to requests  for judicial officials\u2019 financial disclosure reports and how many reports has  the judiciary released each year from 2012 through 2016?

We  reviewed key policy and guidance documents related to these processes,  including Guide to Judiciary Policy, Filing Instructions for Judicial Officers  and Employees, and a Step by Step Guide for the Preparation and  Electronic Filing of Financial Disclosure Reports; and we reviewed  relevant laws related to financial disclosure reports, such as the Ethics in  Government Act of 1978 and the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.

We also interviewed USMS officials on the  security consultation process and how they coordinate with AOUSC on  redaction requests. Additionally, we requested documentation for all  redaction requests made by judicial officials during the two months of  September and October for each year from 2012 through 2016, of which  there were 45 such requests. In return, AOUSC provided us with all  relevant documentation for these 45 redaction requests that were made during this time period. We also requested and received the AOUSC  database that contains data on all redaction requests received from  calendar years 2012 through 2016. We reviewed and analyzed the 45  redaction requests and compared the data in these case files to the  information contained in AOUSC\u2019s redaction database and we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting  purposes. We then analyzed data from the AOUSC database on  redaction requests to determine the number of redaction requests that  were granted (in whole or in part) or denied; as well as the type of  information that judicial officials requested be redacted from their financial  disclosure reports from calendar years 2012 through 2016. In order to  categorize the type of information requested to be redacted from judicial  officials\u2019 financial disclosure reports, two GAO analysts independently  reviewed the description of the redaction requests and the related section  of the financial disclosure reports as contained in the AOUSC database  and reached consensus on which of seven different categories to place  the redaction requests\u2014full report; unsecured location of spouse, child, or  residence; asset names; asset value; gifts; reimbursement; or other. In  those cases where the description of the information redacted was too  vague, or did not easily fit into one of the remaining categories, we placed  it in the \u201cother\u201d category. Using the AOUSC redaction request database  and data provided on the total number of reports required to be filed, we  also determined the percentage of judges and other judicial employees  who had requested redactions from their financial disclosure reports each  year, as well as the types of information requested to be redacted, by  percent. Finally, to determine whether the judiciary consistently reported  results of judicial officials\u2019 redaction requests to Congress in a timely  manner, we interviewed relevant AOUSC staff, reviewed available  guidance on the procedures for gathering information and producing the  annual reports, and requested copies of the annual redaction reports for  2012 through 2016.

This is  particularly important given that Congress recently passed an extension  to the judiciary\u2019s redaction authority through the end of 2027."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Director of AOUSC should develop and implement a formal process,  with specified steps and associated time frames, to better ensure that  required annual redaction reports are completed and submitted to  Congress within the following year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In April 2018, we requested comments on a draft of this report from DOJ,  USMS, and AOUSC.

In addition to its technical  comments, AOUSC provided an official letter for inclusion in the report,  which can be seen in appendix III. In its letter, AOUSC stated it concurred  with the recommendation and will determine how best to implement a  more formalized process to better ensure it can submit annual redaction  reports to Congress in a timely manner.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Administrative Office of the  U.S. Courts, the Attorney General, the United States Marshals Service,  selected congressional committees, and other interested parties.
