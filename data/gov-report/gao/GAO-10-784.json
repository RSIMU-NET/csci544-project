The Department of Energy (DOE) receives annual appropriations of $6 billion to support the cleanup of radioactive and hazardous wastes resulting from decades of nuclear weapons research and production. GAO was asked to examine (1) how DOE selected projects for funding and developed cost and schedule targets, (2) project status and extent to which projects are achieving these targets, and (3) key challenges faced and efforts to address them. GAO reviewed Recovery Act project documentation, including cost, schedule, and performance data for 84 projects at 17 sites; visited the 4 sites receiving most of the funding; and interviewed headquarters and site officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE's Office of Environmental Management generally chose to use Recovery Act funds for cleanup projects that could be quickly started and finished. Most projects also had existing contracts, which allowed DOE to update and validate cost and schedule targets within a short time. DOE generally funded four types of projects: decontaminating or demolishing facilities, removing contamination from soil and groundwater, packaging and disposing of transuranic and other wastes, and supporting the maintenance and treatment of liquid tank wastes. In all, DOE selected 84 projects at 17 DOE sites in 12 states for Recovery Act funding, with 4 sites receiving most of the money. As of May 2010, DOE had begun work on all Recovery Act projects and reported creating about 5,600 full-time equivalent jobs at the 17 sites during the first quarter of 2010. Spending on Recovery Act projects has been slower than planned. DOE had obligated about $5.5 billion of the $6 billion in Recovery Act cleanup funding and spent about $1.9 billion of those funds. This sum is less than the $2.3 billion DOE had expected to spend by that time. DOE reported that most Recovery Act projects were achieving cost and schedule targets, although a third of projects were not. DOE has faced familiar challenges in both managing Recovery Act projects and measuring how Recovery Act funding has affected cleanup and other goals. According to DOE officials, a third of projects did not meet cost and schedule targets for some of the same reasons that have plagued DOE in the past: technical, regulatory, safety, and contracting issues. DOE has taken steps aimed at strengthening project management and oversight for Recovery Act projects, such as increasing project reporting requirements and placing tighter controls on when funds are disbursed to sites, but it is uncertain how these steps will ultimately affect Recovery Act project performance, or whether they hold the potential to be useful for cleanup work funded under annual appropriations. Measuring the impact of Recovery Act funding on job creation and DOE's cleanup goals has also been a challenge for DOE, in particular, providing an accurate assessment of the act's impact on jobs, environmental risk reduction, and the life-cycle costs of its cleanup program. DOE has used three different methodologies to assess and report jobs created, which provide very different and potentially misleading, pictures of jobs created. For example, the calculations ranged from about 5,700 jobs to 20,200, depending on the methodology used. Also, DOE has not developed a clear means of measuring how cleanup work funded by the act will affect environmental risk or reduce its footprint--the land and facilities requiring DOE cleanup. Further, it is unclear to what extent Recovery Act funding will reduce the costs of cleaning up the DOE complex over the long term. DOE's estimate of $4 billion in life cycle cost savings resulting from Recovery Act funding was not calculated in accordance with federal guidance. GAO's analysis indicates that those savings could be 80 percent less than DOE estimated. Without clear and consistent measures, it will be difficult to say whether or how Recovery Act funding has affected DOE's cleanup goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends four actions for DOE to improve project management and reporting: (1) determine whether project management and oversight steps adopted for Recovery Act projects would benefit other cleanup projects, (2) clarify the methodology used to calculate jobs created, (3) develop clear and quantifiable measures for determining the impact of Recovery Act funding, and (4) ensure that cost savings are calculated according to federal guidance. DOE agreed with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to what is generally reported to be the most serious economic  crisis since the Great Depression, the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) was enacted on February 17,  2009. The purposes of the act, among other aims, are to preserve and  create jobs, to promote economic recovery, and to provide investments to  increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in  science and health. Initially estimated to cost $787 billion, the Recovery  Act includes an estimated $580 billion in spending, including for  environmental protection. One of the departments the act directs funds  to\u2014the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014received appropriations of  $6 billion to expand and accelerate its efforts to clean up numerous  contaminated sites across the country, where decades of nuclear weapons  research, development, and production left a legacy of dangerously  radioactive, chemical, and other hazardous wastes.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management directs the cleanup of this  contamination across the DOE complex. The sites contain nuclear  reactors; chemical processing buildings; and plants, laboratories, and  maintenance facilities once used to manufacture thousands of nuclear  warheads. Cleanup activities include treating and permanently disposing  of millions of gallons of radioactive and chemical waste stored in large  underground tanks; disposing of spent nuclear fuel; removing  contaminated soil; treating contaminated groundwater; packaging and  shipping solid wastes infused with synthetic radioactive elements like  plutonium and americium for permanent disposal to a deep geologic  repository; and eliminating excess facilities, which may include  decontaminating, decommissioning, deactivating, and demolishing  obsolete structures or a combination of these activities. DOE has  estimated that the cost of this cleanup may approach $300 billion over the  next several decades.", "Recovery Act funding, which DOE intends to spend over 2.5 years,  substantially boosts the Office of Environmental Management\u2019s annual  appropriation for cleanup, of between $6 and $7 billion. DOE designated  the bulk of this new funding\u2014almost 80 percent\u2014to speed cleanup  activities at four large sites: the Hanford Site in Washington State; Idaho  National Laboratory in Idaho; the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee;  and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

To determine how DOE selected projects and developed cost and  schedule targets, we reviewed relevant project documentation, including  project operating plans, DOE assessments of proposed cost and schedule  targets, and project risk assessments. We obtained data on costs,  schedules, and jobs created as of March 2010, the most recent data  available, from DOE\u2019s Environmental Management Recovery Act Program  office. We also interviewed DOE headquarters and federal project and  contractor officials at each of the 17 sites receiving Recovery Act funding.  We interviewed officials at 13 sites by phone and visited the 4 DOE  cleanup sites receiving the bulk of the $6 billion in Recovery Act funding  for environmental cleanup: (1) the Hanford Site, (2) Idaho National  Laboratory, (3) the Oak Ridge Reservation, and (4) the Savannah River  Site. At each site, we reviewed project documentation, interviewed  officials, and observed Recovery Act work under way. In addition, at the  Hanford and Savannah River sites, we also selected a nonrandom sample  of four of the costliest projects\u2014two projects involving demolition of  facilities, a project to remediate soil and groundwater, and a project to  package and dispose of waste\u2014to better understand how cost and  schedule estimates were developed and to assess the reliability of  estimates for these projects. Two projects were located at the Hanford Site  and two at the Savannah River Site. To assess to what extent projects were  meeting cost and schedule targets, we reviewed March 2010 data, the most  recent available, from DOE\u2019s system for tracking project performance,  called an earned value management system, and also reviewed data on  project-related performance measures that refer to specific cleanup  activities. To determine what key challenges DOE faced and the steps  officials took to address these challenges, we reviewed pertinent Recovery  Act project guidance and DOE project documents and reports, and  interviewed headquarters officials and federal and contractor officials at  all 17 sites. We also conferred with staff from DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector  General. To assess the reliability of data we reviewed, we sent out  questionnaires to DOE headquarters and site officials regarding the steps  taken to ensure the accuracy of data related to measuring progress toward  cost and schedule targets, jobs created, and other project outcomes.

DOE also  conducts research in energy and sciences ranging from harnessing  geothermal power as a renewable resource to the behavior of subatomic  particles colliding at nearly the speed of light. Organizationally, DOE  supports this broad range of activities with a diverse group of mission- based program elements. These include the Office of Science, charged  with conducting basic science and technology research; the National  Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons stockpile; and the Office of Environmental Management, which  leads the department\u2019s often complex and challenging effort to clean up  nuclear, chemical, and other hazardous wastes. Environmental  Management carries out its work at numerous DOE sites and facilities  around the country, primarily through private entities that manage the  facilities and work under contract to DOE. About 90 percent of DOE\u2019s  annual budget (which totaled about $27 billion in fiscal year 2010) goes to  contracts with private firms. An extensive network of site offices directly  oversees the work of these contractors.", "In 1990, GAO designated DOE\u2019s contract management, including both  contract administration and project management, at high risk for fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In the following two decades,  continued ineffective oversight and poor contract management led to  substantial cost overruns and lengthy delays on many projects overseen by  DOE, in particular, the Office of Environmental Management. DOE has  faced difficulties in developing realistic cost and schedule targets and then  achieving them, in part because of challenges addressing complex  technical issues, negotiating contracts, complying with regulatory issues,  and ensuring safety. Recently, for example, factors such as these have  delayed completion of Hanford\u2019s Waste Treatment and Immobilization  Plant in Washington State. The project has been delayed by 8 years, while  costs have escalated, more than doubling the initial estimate, from $4.3 to  $12.2 billion. The treatment plant was one of nine major DOE construction  projects, collectively valued at about $14 billion, that as of 2009 had  exceeded both their original cost and schedule estimates. As we recently  reported, DOE has taken steps to improve its contract and management  activities, including in 2000 issuing its order 413.3A, which established a  process for managing projects, from beginning to end. The order  established five major milestones\u2014or \u201ccritical decision points\u201d\u2014that span  a project\u2019s life, beginning with approval of need and ending with project  completion. Order 413.3A specifies the requirements that must be met,  along with the documentation necessary, to move past each milestone,  including when a variety of independent reviews should occur to assess  progress. Other steps DOE has taken include developing a root-cause  analysis, a corrective action plan, and performance measures intended to  help assess progress. Nevertheless, Environmental Management\u2019s contract  and project management activities remain on GAO\u2019s list of programs or  agencies at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.", "The Recovery Act is intended to promote economic recovery, make  investments, and minimize or avert reductions in state and local  government services. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the  Recovery Act would increase employment by about 1.2 million to  3.6 million jobs by the end of 2010.

DOE officials said they had planning efforts under way since  2006, which were aimed at identifying relatively low-risk cleanup projects  that could reduce DOE\u2019s cleanup footprint and speed overall site  remediation. Such projects included, for example, facility demolition,  groundwater or soil remediation, or finishing work that could help  accelerate site closure. These projects generally had contracts, including  cost and schedule targets, in place; they used proven technologies, had  secured needed regulatory approvals, and were therefore considered  \u201cshovel-ready.\u201d (According to DOE officials, this focus on discrete, low- risk projects stemmed in part from lessons learned during a 2002 cleanup  acceleration attempt, which ultimately did not work well for complex and  costly projects.) In addition to its internal deadline to expend all  Recovery Act funds and complete work by the end of fiscal year 20 other criteria\u2014including job creation and reducing environmental risk\u2014 ese  also influenced DOE\u2019s selection. DOE officials said that in selecting th projects, they had to balance competing goals. For example, to begin and  complete work quickly, they chose a portfolio of cleanup projects that  may ultimately reduce DOE\u2019s footprint\u2014its physical presence\u2014on the  national landscape by 372 square miles (approximately 40 percent) but  would not address the most dangerously radioactive and hazardous wastes  and the environmental risks these wastes present.", "In all, DOE selected 84 projects at 17 DOE sites in 12 states for Recovery  Act funding (see fig.1) with the majority of the money going to four sites\u2014 Hanford, Idaho National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge Reservation, and  Savannah River (see app. III).", "The vast majority of projects had been included in the sites\u2019 own work  plans, such as groundwater remediation at Los Alamos National  Laboratory, but some projects also represented work newly transferred  from other program offices, such as remediation and demolition of a  former weapons facility at Oak Ridge Reservation. In general, projects  chosen for Recovery Act funding fell into four main categories of work:    Decontaminating and demolishing facilities: for example,  decontaminating and demolishing the K-33 building at the Oak Ridge  Reservation. A two-level structure that covers 32 acres (see fig. 2) was  constructed in 1954 to process and enrich uranium for use in nuclear  weapons. Although uranium enrichment operations ceased in 1985, the  building\u2019s piping and other equipment were not removed completely until  2005, and radiological and chemical contamination remains throughout the  building. DOE had initially selected a different building for demolition, K- 27, which was also used to process and enrich uranium, but it found  unexpectedly high levels of mercury contamination, complicating that  cleanup. So in February 2010, DOE decided to instead demolish the K-33  building\u2014a much larger building but a less-contaminated and less- complex cleanup project\u2014at a cost of $65 million. Work began in April  2010. Given the delay in starting the project, site officials expect the  project to be completed in 2012.", "Removing contamination from soil and groundwater: for example,  removing and disposing of radioactive and hazardous contaminants from  soil and groundwater at the Mound Site, a former production site for  explosives and other weapons\u2019 components. Production at the site ceased  in 1995. The site\u2019s contractor declared the physical completion of  environmental cleanup of the site in July 2006, although a landfill  remained, which DOE planned to monitor for contamination. Congress,  however, directed further remediation of the landfill at the site. The  project includes excavating and disposing of contaminated soils and  backfilling the site. Although work began with base funding, the funding  was insufficient to complete removal of the contamination. Recovery Act  funding of $19.7 million was applied to the project to complete remaining  work, with an expected site closure date of September 2010.", "Packaging and disposing of transuranic and other wastes: for example,  characterizing and packaging transuranic wastes at multiple DOE sites for  shipment to the department\u2019s deep geologic repository for permanent  disposal. (See fig. 3.) Transuranic wastes are typically discarded rags,  tools, equipment, soils, or other solid materials that have been  contaminated by radioactive elements, such as plutonium or americium.  About 110,000 cubic meters of these wastes were generated mostly after  1970 and then stored at various DOE sites. Because these wastes remain  radioactive for extremely long periods\u2014hundreds of thousands of years in  some cases\u2014most are headed for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant, a deep geologic repository near Carlsbad, New Mexico, designed for  transuranic waste disposal. Idaho National Laboratory plans to ship 160  transuranic waste containers\u2014those containers that because of their high  radioactivity, must be handled remotely\u2014to the Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant.", "Supporting the maintenance and treatment of liquid tank waste: for  example, upgrading the infrastructure used to stabilize and maintain the  tanks that store chemical and radioactive waste at the Hanford Site.  Projects funded through the Recovery Act are accelerating specific  upgrades, such as installing new ventilation systems to prevent the buildup  of hazardous and volatile gases produced in the tanks.

Once these targets  were established, DOE followed the process established by order 413.3A  for reviewing and assessing the targets\u2019 validity and the reasonableness of  the price of the associated contract. Reviews fell into two general  categories:    Program reviews: Performed by DOE officials with no vested interest in a  project, such reviews are to determine if a project\u2019s scope, cost and  schedules, safety, and technology are valid and appropriate. Program  reviews for projects estimated to cost no more than $100 million are  known as independent project reviews. Program reviews for projects  estimated to cost $100 million or more are known as external independent  reviews.", "Cost reviews: These reviews verify that the contractors\u2019 price estimates  adequately reflect the programs\u2019 scope and are reasonable for the work to  be accomplished. Cost reviews for projects valued at $100,000 or more are  known as independent government cost estimates. Cost reviews for  projects valued at $5 million or more are known as independent reviews  and validations.", "Both of these categories of reviews serve to highlight any potential issues  or problems with contracts, as well as offer an opportunity for DOE and its  contractors to define and perform any needed corrective action. For  example, the Savannah River Site\u2019s external independent review to assess  cost and schedule estimates and readiness to begin construction found  that the contractor had not produced sound cost and schedule estimates  or risk management plans nor clearly defined the scope of Recovery Act  work to decommission certain buildings. The site\u2019s contractor responded  with a corrective action plan that spelled out actions to remedy these  shortcomings. Reviews have also found contracts where information was  missing. At Hanford, for example, the external independent review found  that some of the Recovery Act projects had not fully defined the scope of  their work or established cost and schedule targets at the time of the  review. In other cases, the reviews found contracts that lacked sufficient  \u201ccontingencies,\u201d that is, sufficient cushions built into the cost and  schedule estimates in case of unforeseen technical or programmatic  problems. For example, Idaho National Laboratory did not initially include  a contingency estimate in its schedule for the site\u2019s Recovery Act  activities. Reviews also uncovered concerns about project  implementation, such as contractors\u2019 inability to start work as quickly as  planned. For instance, at the Moab Site, Utah, an initial program review  found that the contractor\u2019s procurement office was unable to acquire  needed equipment to operate at full capacity, slowing work at the site.", "In addition, DOE decided to disburse funding for Recovery Act cleanup  projects in phases, requiring site officials to complete a series of steps  before releasing the funds.

More recently, however, DOE  headquarters officials said that at least nine projects would not be  completed before the September 2011 deadline. These projects include    a project at Savannah River to clean up transuranic waste, which was  delayed as the site awaited approval to ship its waste to the Waste  Isolation Pilot Plant for permanent disposal, according to DOE;   a project to demolish a uranium enrichment and processing facility at the  Oak Ridge Reservation, which began late, according to DOE; and   a facility-decommissioning project at Idaho National Laboratory, which  was delayed because of technical difficulties.", "In March 2010, DOE reported that Recovery Act cleanup work had  resulted in more than 5,600 full-time-equivalent jobs at all 17 sites in 12  states. Over 80 percent of these jobs were located at the four sites\u2014 Hanford, Idaho National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge Reservation, and  Savannah River\u2014that together received 80 percent of Recovery Act  funding. The number of full-time jobs created varied from site to site. For  example, DOE reported that 5 jobs were created at the Energy Technology  Engineering Center in California, a 90-acre site currently engaged in  deactivation and decommissioning activities to clean up the nuclear waste  generated during years of nuclear research, and nearly 1,400 jobs were  created at Savannah River, a 310-square-mile site where a number of DOE  cleanup activities are taking place, including the stabilization, treatment,  and disposal of nuclear waste generated during decades of development  and production of nuclear weapons and materials.", "DOE\u2019s spending on Recovery Act projects has been slower than the  department had planned. As of May 2010, a little over a year into the  program, DOE had obligated about $5.5 billion (92 percent) of the  $6 billion in Recovery Act cleanup funding and had spent about $1.9 billion  of those funds\u2014slightly less than the $2.3 billion DOE had expected to  spend through May 2010. Spending rates varied across sites, from  76 percent of obligated funds spent at the Energy Technology Engineering  Center in California to 23 percent at Argonne National Laboratory in  Illinois. On a project-by-project basis, as of March 2010, amounts spent  ranged from less than 1 percent of total estimated project cost (a  $142 million project to decommission a reactor at Savannah River) to  84 percent of estimated project cost (a $17 million project to  decommission a reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory). In some  cases, according to DOE officials, the slower spending at a site or on a  given project resulted from technical and management challenges that  may have slowed progress. In other cases, however, DOE had planned to  spend less money early on: for example, DOE estimated slower spending  during the first several months of a project to remediate contaminated soil  and groundwater at Hanford because fewer workers were needed for the  work\u2019s first, less complex phase, according to a site official. DOE\u2019s plans  for that project show an increase in the rate of spending Recovery Act  funds beginning in May 2010, once excavating the contaminated soil is  under way. Table 1 shows Recovery Act spending on DOE cleanup  projects through May 2010. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE  stated that the initial project spend plans for the Recovery Act were  developed prior to finalizing the contracts for the work. Now, with the  exception of nine projects for which the scope of work changed, DOE  officials expect to spend over 95 percent of project funds by the end of  fiscal year 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Majority of Recovery Act-Funded Projects Appear to Be Meeting Cost and Schedule Targets, Although Inconsistencies Exist between Some Targets and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["A key set of metrics DOE uses to determine whether projects, including  those funded by the Recovery Act, are meeting their cost and schedule  targets comes from DOE contractors\u2019 earned value management system.  Earned value is a project management tool that combines measurements  of scope, schedule, and cost in a single integrated system that can be used  by DOE contractors to manage programs. According to DOE  headquarters and site officials, DOE monitors this earned value  information monthly from headquarters, as well as weekly or daily at some  sites. Using these data, DOE reported that, as of March 2010, 57 of the 84  Recovery Act projects\u2014about two-thirds\u2014were meeting both cost and  schedule targets. About 20 percent of projects were meeting either their  cost or schedule target, but not both, and the remaining 11 percent had  missed both targets altogether. Projects meeting and missing targets  spanned the range of project types, including facility demolitions,  groundwater remediation, and infrastructure upgrades. Appendix IV  provides performance information by project number for Recovery Act  projects.", "In addition to tracking earned value metrics, DOE also evaluates project  performance by reviewing project-specific performance measures. As of  March 2010, DOE reported that across the complex, progress on five of  seven selected performance measures was meeting or exceeding targets  (see fig. 4). These measures relate to the specific cleanup activities under  way at a given site, such as cubic meters of waste disposed of or the  number of radioactive facilities decommissioned. Historically, DOE has  used such measures to track cleanup progress complexwide. DOE  developed several new performance measures specific to Recovery Act  projects. These include, for example, cubic meters of transuranic waste  that have been prepared and certified for shipment to the Waste Isolation  Pilot Plant, a measure that supplements existing measures tracking only  the amount of transuranic waste actually disposed of. Some sites have also  developed site- or project-specific cleanup measures, such as the  Savannah River Site, which is measuring cubic yards of grout (a  cementlike material) poured into decommissioned reactor facilities, and  the Hanford Site, which is measuring the number of waste tank systems  that are upgraded.", "While DOE is using performance measures to track progress on most of its  84 Recovery Act projects, progress on 31 projects has not been tracked  using any performance measures, for two main reasons. First, 18 of the 31  projects do not yet have any corresponding performance measures  assigned. According to a DOE Recovery Act Program official, performance  measures are being developed for most of these 18 projects. Five of the 18  projects will not be assigned any performance measures, however,  because the work does not lend itself to meaningful performance  measures, the work is almost complete, or earned value data are deemed  sufficient to track the projects\u2019 progress, according to DOE. For example,  DOE will rely primarily on earned value measures to track progress on a  project to maintain and monitor the physical condition of inactive facilities  at the Savannah River Site. Second, the remaining 13 of 31 projects  currently have performance measures assigned for tracking progress, but  the planned work associated with those measures has not begun. For  example, for a particular project at the Hanford Site to identify and  dispose of contaminated soil, the performance measure is cubic meters of  soil disposed of. But because work during the project\u2019s first several  months involved identifying the extent of the contamination (before  beginning actual excavation of contaminated soil), this particular  performance measure will not be useful for tracking progress until the first  planned disposal of contaminated soil in October 2010.", "For the remaining 53 projects that had performance measures in place as  of March 2010, results were mixed. Of these projects, DOE reported in its  monthly reports that 38 were meeting all their performance measure  targets, and 15 were missing some or all of their targets (see fig 5). For  example, a project at the Savannah River Site to treat and dispose of  several types of solid waste had five performance measures tracking  progress, as of March 2010, including metric tons of depleted uranium  packaged for disposal, number of waste drums disposed of, and cubic  meters of debris and soil disposed of. As of March 2010, the project was  falling short on three of its five performance measures. Among other aims,  the project was supposed to prepare about 11,600 metric tons of depleted  uranium for disposal, but only about 4,000 metric tons had actually been  prepared because of a delayed start on the project, according to site  officials.", "In reviewing projects\u2019 earned value cost and schedule target data and  projects\u2019 associated performance measures, we found that the results as  assessed by performance measures were sometimes inconsistent with the  results shown by earned value data for cost and schedule targets. A given  project might have met cost and schedule targets but have nevertheless  fallen short in meeting performance measure targets. For example, at the  Hanford Site, a project to dispose of contaminated soil and debris met or  bettered its cost and schedule targets, but a related performance measure  showed that none of the contaminated material had been disposed of as  planned. Conversely, earned value data for a project to demolish  contaminated buildings at Idaho National Laboratory showed that the  project was not meeting its cost and schedule targets but was meeting all  of its performance measures, such as square footage of facilities  demolished. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE officials stated  that earned value scores and other project performance information are  intended to provide complementary insights into overall performance.  Officials said that when differences among the indicators arise,  headquarters officials follow up with federal and contractor officials at the  site to determine the reasons for these differences."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Taken Steps to Help Address Potential Problems but Continues to Face Key Challenges in Managing Projects and Measuring Their Impact", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s Recovery Act work is well into its second year, and the department  faces familiar challenges. While DOE has taken steps to strengthen project  management activities, as of March 2010, about one-third of projects did  not achieve cost or schedule targets, or both. According to DOE officials,  many schedule delays and cost problems could be traced to the same  types of issues that have troubled DOE in the past\u2014technical challenges,  regulatory issues, and contracting delays. In addition, it is unclear how  Recovery Act funding has affected job creation and the department\u2019s  environmental cleanup goals or, in particular, to what degree this  additional funding will reduce DOE\u2019s footprint, related environmental  risks, and future cleanup costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Has Taken Steps to Help Projects Achieve Cost and Schedule Targets, Although Some Project Management Issues Remain", "paragraphs": ["To help Recovery Act projects achieve their cost and schedule targets,  DOE has taken steps to strengthen project management and oversight,  such as adding federal oversight staff, increasing project reporting  requirements, and placing tighter controls on when and how funds are  disbursed to cleanup sites. First, DOE created a management structure to  oversee Recovery Act projects separately from its cleanup projects funded  by annual appropriations. At the headquarters level, DOE created an  Environmental Management Recovery Act program office, where  experienced DOE staff oversee site reporting and project review  requirements for Recovery Act work. In addition, DOE assigned a certified  on-site federal project director to oversee each Recovery Act project. All  federal project directors for Recovery Act projects are senior managers  certified by the Project Management Career Development Program  Certification Review Board. DOE also created a new position for cleanup  sites\u2014a Recovery Act site representative\u2014who reports project status to  DOE\u2019s headquarters\u2019 Recovery Act program office and the Office of  Environmental Management\u2019s Consolidated Business Center. Recovery  Act site representatives are expected to monitor and report to the  Recovery Act program office on technical, programmatic, regulatory,  environmental, safety and health, and fiscal issues and concerns. The  business center provides project management support, such as assistance  in cost estimating and analysis.", "Second, DOE increased oversight via new and more frequent reporting  requirements for Recovery Act work. In addition to reporting the number  of jobs funded by the act, sites report to Environmental Management\u2019s  Recovery Act program office\u2014on a monthly, rather than quarterly, basis\u2014 projects\u2019 progress toward cost and schedule targets, as well as progress on  performance measures. Sites also are to report whether contractors are  completing certain tasks (milestones) on time, or whether contractors  have missed their targets. Third, DOE has disbursed Recovery Act funding  to sites in phases and required site officials to complete and document a  series of tasks before funding can be released at each phase. For those  cases where a site does not satisfactorily complete these tasks, DOE  officials said they are prepared to withhold additional funding until the site  has complied with the requirements. For example, one of the requirements  for receiving funding is that a project receives a favorable project review,  which involves an assessment of cost and schedule targets and project  management plans. At the Savannah River Site, because a July 2009  external independent review of a decontamination and decommission  project found that the contractor had failed to produce sound cost and  schedule estimates or risk management plans as required, DOE shifted  $200 million it had intended to allocate to that contractor to a different  project managed by a second contractor at the site. DOE subsequently  implemented corrective actions at the site, including management  changes. DOE has not taken similar steps to increase oversight of projects  within its broader environmental cleanup program, and it is uncertain how  or whether the actions taken to strengthen project management and  oversight of Recovery Act projects will benefit management of DOE\u2019s  larger portfolio of cleanup projects.", "As of March 2010, nearly one-third of Recovery Act projects were facing  cost or schedule difficulties or both\u2014despite DOE\u2019s efforts to choose low- risk, straightforward, shovel-ready projects for funding and to increase  oversight\u2014and overall spending was somewhat slower than expected.  About halfway through DOE\u2019s planned Recovery Act program, slightly less  than one-third of the department\u2019s $6 billion allocation had been spent.  Officials attributed these difficulties to technical, regulatory, safety, and  contracting problems\u2014some of the same issues that have challenged  DOE\u2019s project management in the past. For instance:    Technical challenges: Some Recovery Act projects faced technical  problems, such as the discovery of unanticipated wastes that require  additional time and effort to remediate or an inability to obtain necessary  materials or equipment in a timely manner. For example, unexpected  levels of contamination\u2014discovered after cost and schedule targets under  the Recovery Act had been established\u2014have delayed the  decommissioning and demolition of the former Experimental Breeder  Reactor II (one of 52 nuclear reactors at Idaho National Laboratory). In  determining the extent of contamination at the facility and planning the  decommissioning effort, DOE discovered that a portion of the reactor  contained a layer of asbestos insulation between the reactor\u2019s outer steel  shell and its inner concrete lining and that the concrete lining was also  filled with asbestos. As of May 2010, according to DOE officials, the  contractor had to slow the work to figure out how to best address this  unexpected contamination, and as a result, this $118 million project is not  expected to be completed by September 2011. At the Savannah River Site,  a $304 million project to accelerate disposal of 5,000 cubic meters of  transuranic waste cannot be completed until 2012 because of problems  obtaining the proper containers for shipping the waste to the Waste  Isolation Pilot Plant. When the site could not obtain large containers in a  timely manner, workers instead packaged the waste into smaller  containers\u2014a process that was time-consuming and costly, officials said.  In early June 2010, DOE officials said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  issued a certification of compliance for the large containers. According to  a Savannah River Site official, the new containers will enable workers to  package the waste more efficiently and at lower cost. Still, as a result of  this delay, the project is expected to be completed in 2012, later than  planned.", "Regulatory issues: Some sites have also faced regulatory issues that  require additional time to address. For example, DOE is working on a  $38 million Recovery Act cleanup project at the Energy Technology  Engineering Center\u2014which was once involved in nuclear reactor  development and testing\u2014in partnership with the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Under an interagency agreement between EPA  and DOE, EPA has responsibility for conducting a comprehensive  characterization of radioactivity at the site, in accordance with  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act  (CERCLA) processes. When this CERCLA characterization is completed,  DOE can develop an environmental impact statement and proceed with  facility demolition and groundwater and soil cleanup. According to site  officials, however, EPA\u2019s characterization activities are taking longer than  expected.", "Safety issues: Safety concerns also affected project progress. For  example, a project at the West Valley Demonstration Project in New York  to process transuranic wastes for disposal is not meeting either cost or  schedule expectations, according to site officials, because of safety issues  that have slowed progress. DOE site officials said that after work started  on the project, air monitors showed that contamination in the work area  exceeded allowable limits. Although the workers were already wearing  respirators, the air monitors\u2019 warning prompted site officials to require  workers to wear additional protective gear to complete the work. This  additional gear, which includes bubble suits, is more cumbersome and  contributed to slower-than-expected progress. Nevertheless, DOE expects  the $4.2 million effort to be completed by December 2010 as planned.", "Contracting delays: Delays in finalizing new contracts or contract  modifications have also led to cost and schedule difficulties. For example,  three of the four indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts at the  Oak Ridge site in Tennessee have not been finalized. (Such contracts  constitute standing arrangements for goods and services and introduce  greater flexibility into the contracting process.) The four projects involve  cleaning up contaminated soil and decontaminating or demolishing excess  facilities, including demolishing a radioisotope development laboratory, a  wooden building originally constructed in the 1940s for a variety of  processing and research activities. Unoccupied since 1998, the dilapidated  building contains both radioactive and hazardous materials. The contract  has not been finalized for this project and, as a result, work cannot begin.  Site officials at Oak Ridge Reservation said that finalizing this type of  contract often takes longer than they expect or plan for. In addition, one of  the contracts for the Oak Ridge site was protested by prospective  contractors, also delaying the projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recovery Act Impact on Job Creation and Environmental Cleanup Goals Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["In reporting the number of jobs created as a result of Recovery Act  spending, DOE has reported three substantially different figures, which  can be confusing and potentially misleading.

Recovery Act reporting requirements direct agencies to count  hours worked under a prime contractor\u2014the nonfederal entity that  receives Recovery Act funding directly from the federal government.  OMB guidance states that agencies are to report jobs created as full-time  equivalents (FTE) calculated by totaling the number of hours charged by  workers to Recovery Act projects in a given quarter and dividing the sum  by the total number of work hours representing a full work schedule.", "While DOE has used this required figure, it has also chosen to calculate  and publicize two additional figures that represent jobs created: (1) the  sum of both prime contractor and subcontractor FTEs and (2) the number  of people who have charged time to Recovery Act activities\u2014without  regard to the number of hours worked\u2014which DOE refers to as \u201chead  count\u201d or \u201clives touched.\u201d DOE officials stated that because the  department relies largely on subcontractors to carry out the cleanup work,  reporting only prime contractor FTEs substantially understates the  employment impact of DOE\u2019s Recovery Act program. The number of prime  contractor FTEs DOE reported to OMB as of March 2010 was 5,655, while  the sum for both prime contractors and subcontractors for the same  period was nearly twice that, at 10,018. The head count, or number of  workers engaged for any length of time in Recovery Act work, was  substantially higher still (see table 2).", "DOE\u2019s job creation calculations are problematic because they are  confusing and potentially misleading. DOE frequently publicizes all three  figures to represent the employment impact of Recovery Act funding on  communities near DOE cleanup sites, without explaining how the figures  were calculated. But only FTEs for prime contractors are counted in a  manner that can be compared with other federal recipients of Recovery  Act funds. It is this number that DOE reports on the federal Web site  FederalReporting.gov. DOE officials said they had tried to gain permission  from OMB to include subcontractor FTEs in this official count, but OMB  has not changed its guidance. In commenting on a draft of this report,  however, DOE stated that federal acquisition regulations have changed  and, effective with the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, DOE will report  both prime contractor and subcontractor FTEs. Further, DOE\u2019s  calculation of head count is potentially misleading for two reasons. First,  counting the number of people carrying out Recovery Act work, rather  than the time they have actually spent in such work, implies that one  person engaged in 2 hours of work per week is equivalent to one person  engaged in 40 hours of work per week. The economic benefits to the  worker, however, differ significantly. Second, the estimate includes a  count of those people who contributed to the manufacture of materials or  equipment purchased by prime contractors and subcontractors to support  Recovery Act work, an estimate that is difficult to verify, according to site  officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Impact of Recovery Act Spending on Cleanup and Other Goals Remains Unclear", "paragraphs": ["In addition to inconsistencies in how the department measures job  creation, DOE has no clear means of determining how cleanup work  funded by the act will reduce environmental risk, if at all. While a key  departmental goal for the funding is to reduce DOE\u2019s footprint, or area of  ongoing cleanup activity, just what this goal entails is unclear. DOE is  using a comprehensive list of existing measures to assess environmental  cleanup performance, including additional measures developed under its  Recovery Act program. Existing measures include such metrics as amount  of hazardous material packaged or disposed of, number of facilities  demolished, number of sites for which remediation has been completed,  and number of sites closed. Recovery Act project-specific measures are  similar to department measures, although more specific, such as number  of groundwater wells installed or square feet of facilities demolished.  These project-specific performance measures, however, focus on outputs  and are not directly linked to long-term outcomes such as reducing risks.  For example, the performance measures do not indicate what impact  installing groundwater wells or demolishing facilities will have on  reducing risks to human health and the environment. Moreover, the way  progress is measured is sometimes inconsistent, and many projects have  no performance measures established to date. As a result, project-specific  performance measures reveal very little about the outcomes DOE intends  to achieve with Recovery Act funding, in particular, how DOE will  measure the impact that Recovery Act funding will have on the long-term  condition of large tracts of land under DOE management or on DOE\u2019s  footprint. Headquarters officials defined footprint reduction as \u201cphysical  completion of activities with petition for regulatory approval to follow.\u201d  Some federal cleanup site officials, however, said they were confused by  DOE\u2019s footprint reduction goal and uncertain how they are to take credit  for having achieved it. For example, it is not clear whether footprint  reduction includes total square footage of facilities owned by DOE, acres  of land surrounding those facilities and owned or controlled by DOE,  contaminated soil and groundwater beneath the facilities, some  combination of all of these things, or something else entirely. Without a  clearly defined and consistent measure of its footprint, it will be difficult  for DOE to report whether or how Recovery Act funding has affected  progress toward this key DOE cleanup goal.", "Furthermore, it is also uncertain how much DOE can expect to save in life- cycle costs of its environmental cleanup program as a result of Recovery  Act funding. DOE Recovery Act program officials estimated that as much  as $4 billion in life-cycle savings would be realized by doing the work  under Recovery Act funding sooner rather than later, as originally  planned. Officials stated that savings are to be achieved by avoiding costs  such as those for long-term maintenance, security, and waste monitoring.  DOE\u2019s $4 billion estimate, however, includes an estimate for savings that  could be achieved because of inflation\u2014by avoiding the higher costs of  materials and labor in the future. In addition, DOE\u2019s estimates do not take  into account the time value of money. That is, they do not account for the  fact that costs incurred in the future are worth less than costs incurred  sooner. According to standard economic analysis, OMB guidance on  benefit-cost analysis, as well as DOE\u2019s guidance on life-cycle cost analysis,  life-cycle analyses should be based on cost adjusted for both inflation and  the time value of money\u2014that is, on cost in present-value dollars. In  contrast, DOE\u2019s comparison of its base program life-cycle cost estimate  and its Recovery Act program estimate is based on current dollars and  does not correct for either the effect of inflation on prices or the time  value of money. Our analysis of DOE\u2019s cost savings, taking the appropriate  factors into account, found that DOE\u2019s $4 billion savings estimate may be  overstated by as much as 80 percent. GAO has previously taken issue with  DOE\u2019s method of calculating savings in life-cycle costs. DOE officials  have said that when estimating life-cycle cost savings from Recovery Act  work, they prefer to use current dollars, which take into account  increasing costs due to inflation. An official said that using current dollars  provides for a more direct comparison with DOE\u2019s budget submission to  Congress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE expected that Recovery Act funding would help it achieve several  goals, including accelerating the cleanup effort and reducing the footprint  of facilities and contamination at 17 of its sites, creating jobs, and reducing  total remaining cleanup costs. As the halfway mark in DOE\u2019s Recovery Act  work approaches, the department has made progress toward completing  cleanup projects and the majority, although not all, of these projects  appear to be meeting cost and schedule targets. In carrying out its  Recovery Act work, DOE has implemented additional steps to address  familiar contract and project management challenges, by providing stricter  controls over how and when funds are disbursed to cleanup sites,  increasing reporting requirements, and paying greater attention to project  oversight. Although we do not yet know what effects each of these  additional steps to improve project management and increase oversight of  Recovery Act projects will ultimately have on DOE\u2019s ability to meet  projects\u2019 cost and schedule targets, some of the steps could be found  useful for Recovery Act cleanup work, as well as carry the potential to be  beneficial for projects funded under annual appropriations. The  department has been less successful in implementing steps to better  assess the results of its Recovery Act work. Specifically, DOE faces  challenges in accurately assessing the effects of Recovery Act spending on  job creation, environmental risk, footprint reduction, and long-term  cleanup costs. Regarding jobs created, OMB requires that job creation  figures be calculated and reported using a standard methodology. DOE,  however, has chosen to also use two additional methodologies to calculate  and publicly report job creation figures, which potentially provides a  misleading picture of actual jobs created. DOE sites also do not have a  means of determining how cleanup funded by the act will reduce  environmental risk, if at all, or how DOE will measure progress toward its  goals for footprint reduction. Further, DOE is not following OMB\u2019s or its  own internal guidance in calculating cost savings that might accrue from  completing cleanup projects sooner using Recovery Act funding. The  methodology chosen by the department appears to significantly overstate  savings from Recovery Act spending.

These include requiring more frequent  reviews of projects. DOE stated it is still evaluating the potential benefit to  the base program of other steps taken to manage Recovery Act projects. In  responding to the second recommendation on the methods used to  calculate job creation figures, DOE stated that a recent change to federal  acquisition regulations, which will result in the reporting of both prime  contractor and subcontractor jobs in FederalReporting.gov, will negate  GAO\u2019s concern on the matter. Our concern, however, centered on ensuring  that users of DOE\u2019s three job creation figures\u2014prime contractor FTEs,  prime contractor and subcontractor FTEs, and head count\u2014understand  exactly what the figures represent. The head count figure is not reported  into FederalReporting.gov and, as we note in our report, was a  significantly higher figure than prime contractor or subcontractor job  figures. In its detailed comments, DOE stated that it has posted guidance  on its Web site regarding the methodologies used to calculate job creation  figures and will also include a one-page explanation sheet with job  numbers presented to stakeholders or the public. We have reworded this  recommendation to enhance its clarity. Third, DOE stated that it agreed  with GAO\u2019s recommendation to have clear, quantifiable, and consistent  measures of footprint reduction and has taken steps to better define this  concept and communicate the definition to all its sites. While we agree  that DOE has made progress on defining footprint reduction, the focus of  our recommendation was broader, emphasizing the development of clear,  quantifiable, and consistent measures for determining the impact of  Recovery Act funding on environmental risk. While we recognize that DOE  collects information related to project risks, as it stated in its response, the  information collected concerns risks associated with successfully carrying  out a project, not quantifying the reduction in environmental risks  themselves. DOE went on to point out that its performance measures are  focused on outputs that are directly tied to cleanup of the site. Outputs,  such as cubic meters of soil remediated, do provide a measure of work  performed, but they may not easily translate into the outcome in terms of  environmental risk reduction due to Recovery Act funds spent at each site.  We maintain that DOE needs to continue to develop measures for  determining the impact of Recovery Act funding on reducing  environmental risks. DOE also expressed concern over the method we  used to determine project performance, as well as our assessment that  inconsistencies exist between some projects\u2019 cost and schedule  performance and other measures.

While DOE carried out many best practices for developing its estimates, in  some instances, it did not. For example, when preparing estimates for both  of these projects, DOE did not create a plan to ensure that the estimates  were developed by people with expertise in cost and schedule estimating  and did not test the reasonableness of its estimates against known costs  for similar activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Savannah River", "paragraphs": ["The Savannah River Site was constructed in the early 1950s to produce  tritium and plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. Historically the site has  supported five nuclear reactors, two chemical separation plants, a heavy- water extraction plant, a nuclear fuel and target fabrication facility, a  tritium extraction facility, and waste management facilities. Although the  site no longer produces plutonium, some of its missions continue, such as  the extraction of tritium for nuclear warheads. The site received $1.6  billion under the Recovery Act, which is funding 14 projects. Overall,  Recovery Act projects at Savannah River are expected to accelerate  transuranic waste disposal by 4 years, and the decommissioning of the  nuclear facilities by at least 5 years. We selected two of Savannah River\u2019s  Recovery Act projects for in-depth cost and schedule estimate and  reliability review:    Accelerated transuranic waste disposition: The purpose of this project is  to accelerate the characterization, packaging, and disposal of 4,200 cubic  meters of transuranic waste from the site\u2019s former production of nuclear  weapons. The waste will then be shipped to DOE\u2019s Waste Isolation Pilot  Plant for permanent disposal. In addition, the project\u2019s current scope  includes repackaging of 800 cubic meters of transuranic waste into smaller  containers in preparation for shipment. The project is expected to be  completed in September 2012, at a cost of $304 million.", "P&R Area completion general plant projects and operations: \u201cP&R Area\u201d  refers to the P and R reactors, two of the site\u2019s first nuclear production  reactors, which started operating in 1953 and 1954, respectively. The  buildings and associated infrastructure, such as railroad tracks used to  transfer radioactive material from the reactors to other site facilities, have  remained unused since the facilities ceased operations in 1964 (R reactor)  and 1988 (P reactor). The scope of the Recovery Act project includes  decommissioning the two reactors, as well as removing the railroad tracks.  The project also includes remediation of contaminated soil under the  tracks. The project is expected to advance completion of the P and R area  cleanup by 5 to 6 years.", "On the basis of our in-depth reviews of these two projects, DOE partially  met best practices for ensuring that the estimates were credible,  comprehensive, and well documented and minimally met best practices  associated with ensuring that the estimates were accurate. For example,  DOE did not compare its cost and schedule estimates to an independent  cost estimate, a step that helps ensure accuracy. Instead, the department  relied on internal project reviews, which were not as rigorous."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Recovery Act Project Cost Data through March 2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Project description", "paragraphs": ["(percentage of total cost)", "1.
