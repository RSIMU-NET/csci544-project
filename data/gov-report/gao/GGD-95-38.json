The conduct of bank regulation and supervision in the United Kingdom has evolved significantly since the Bank of England (the Bank), was given statutory responsibility for bank regulation and supervision in 1979. This evolution has largely been in response to a series of banking crises that reflected the changing nature and increasing complexity of banking in the United Kingdom."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of U.K. Banking Industry", "paragraphs": ["As of February 28, 1994, there were 518 banks operating in the United Kingdom with total assets of approximately \u00a31.2 trillion (see table 1.1).Approximately half of these assets\u2014\u00a3593 billion\u2014were held by eight of the larger British banks.", "More than half of the banks in the United Kingdom, 286, were incorporated outside the United Kingdom. Of those banks, 129 were European-authorized institutions\u2014banks licensed in the European Union (EU) or European Free Trade Area (EFTA) member nations who have chosen to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).", "Any authorized bank in the United Kingdom\u2014including subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks\u2014may conduct securities and insurance activities, as long as the latter are carried out in bank subsidiaries. This, in effect, permits banks to conduct a universal banking business. In principle, insurance and securities firms may also own banks\u2014as may commercial firms\u2014provided that they are considered to be \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners by the bank\u2019s supervisor. In practice, however, such ownership arrangements are not widespread.", "Another major class of deposit-taking financial institutions in the United Kingdom is building societies. They are mutual deposit-taking institutions owned by the depositors of the institutions, which lend predominantly for house purchases. Only 25 percent of their assets may be in commercial or unsecured lending. As of March 31, 1993, there were 87 building societies authorized to take deposits of which the top 10 held 90 percent of the industry\u2019s assets. Building societies are supervised by the Building Societies Commission, rather than by the Bank (see app. III for additional details)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of Bank Regulation and Supervision in the United Kingdom", "paragraphs": ["Bank regulation and supervision was first recognized in statute as a government function in the Banking Act of 1979 (1979 Act) in which supervisory and regulatory responsibilities were vested in the Bank of England, the U.K. central bank. Banks in the United Kingdom are regulated and supervised almost exclusively to ensure the safety and soundness of individual banks and of the system as a whole. For example, U.K. banking laws do not address issues such as fair lending practices or community reinvestment requirements.", "Until that time, no government agency had either formal powers to grant or refuse authorization to conduct banking business in the United Kingdom or any statutory supervisory role. Nonetheless, the longstanding position of the Bank as arguably the most influential financial institution in the United Kingdom resulted in its assuming an informal supervisory role as early as the mid-nineteenth century.", "As a result of its primary role in the financial markets, the Bank was concerned about the creditworthiness of its counterparties\u2014a relatively concentrated number of larger banks with whom it did business. It was also concerned about the prevention of market disruption, which could result from the failure of a market participant. Because of these concerns, the Bank assumed some informal supervisory responsibilities for these banks that involved (1) undertaking surveillance; (2) advising banks to take certain steps to resolve perceived problems; and (3) providing short-term financial support when needed. These actions on the part of the Bank were informal and nonstatutory and were based solely on the Bank\u2019s influence in the markets and the willingness of other banks to accept this supervision to further their business interests.", "The Bank of England Act of 1946, which nationalized the Bank by giving ownership of the Bank to Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury (the Treasury), did not clarify or significantly bolster the Bank\u2019s informal supervisory role. It gave the Bank the power to \u201crequest information,\u201d \u201cmake recommendations\u201d to bankers, or \u201cissue directions\u201d to bankers with the Treasury\u2019s consent, but of these none was considered to be a supervisory power, and the Bank never made use of its authority to issue directions. However, the act did not prohibit the Bank from continuing in its informal supervisory role, thus implicitly acknowledging the Bank\u2019s status as the principal supervisory force. This informality of bank regulation is consistent with British reliance on common law and a common understanding of government authority and its limits.", "Thus, the Bank was able to continue exercising strong influence over the group of discount houses and accepting houses with which it did business. Its informal supervision was based on cooperation and trust and carried out via requests rather than directives. The Bank\u2019s influence resulted from its role as the arm of the government in the city (i.e. London financial center), its power in the market, and respect from other market participants, and it was dependent on mutual trust and cooperation. However, it was harder for the Bank to achieve this trust and cooperation with newer and foreign-owned banks that were established in the 1960s and 1970s.", "The 1946 Act clearly establishes the subordination of the Bank to the Chancellor of the Exchequer who heads the Treasury, as well as the Bank\u2019s accountability to Parliament through the Treasury. For example, under the act, the Chancellor has the power to issue directions to the Bank after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, a provision that was designed to ensure that, in the event of disagreement, the government would have the final say. However, the Chancellor has never used this power, since policy has been actively coordinated between the Treasury and the Bank\u2014the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank meet at least twice a month, according to Bank officials\u2014and the Bank has openly acknowledged the Treasury\u2019s policymaking preeminence.", "The Treasury has no formal role under the Banking Act in banking supervision, although it would expect to be consulted on any major regulatory or supervisory decision, particularly when there are political, economic, or legislative implications or public expenditure consequences. Furthermore, although the Treasury generally defers to the Bank in such matters, it is not required to do so, and a future change in Treasury policy toward the Bank under a different government cannot be ruled out.", "The bank regulatory and supervisory role of the Bank was not codified until the so-called \u201csecondary banking crisis\u201d of 1973 through 1974exposed weaknesses in the supervisory system. The crisis revealed that many smaller banks\u2014called secondary banks\u2014were outside even the informal surveillance of the Bank. The 1979 Act that evolved from this crisis, as well as the requirement to implement the First Banking Directive passed by the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1977, recognized the need for a more formal framework for the supervision of all banks. The 1979 Act (1) codified the Bank\u2019s existing informal supervisory relationships, (2) brought all banks under the Bank\u2019s supervision, (3) required banks and deposit-taking institutions to meet certain criteria, (4) enacted a deposit protection system, and (5) was explicitly designed to provide a degree of protection for bank depositors.", "Another banking crisis occurred in 1984, when Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB) was rescued by the Bank and a group of other banks. According to a 1992 report to Parliament, bank management had suffered lapses that had not been recognized or addressed by Bank supervisors: controls and systems had been inadequate, the monitoring of credit had been defective, insufficient attention had been given to concentrations of risk, proper security measures had not been taken, and provisions for bad and doubtful debts had not been assessed with appropriate care. Concerns about the role inadequate bank supervision had played in this crisis led to a review of the system of bank supervision, which resulted in the passage of the Banking Act of 1987 (1987 Act).", "The deregulation of financial markets in the United Kingdom in October 1986, commonly known as the \u201cBig Bang,\u201d was another financial market milestone in the United Kingdom, as was the relaxation or abolition of exchange controls, mortgage lending guidance, and consumer credit controls. The Big Bang eliminated fixed commissions on stock and bond purchases; removed the separation among the underwriting, sales, and trading functions; and allowed foreign firms to buy U.K. securities firms. The heightened competition that followed resulted in a focus on capturing market share. Although securities firms were primarily affected, banks were also involved in the competitive shakeout that followed the Big Bang.", "The 1987 Act confirmed the role of the Bank as supervisor, expanded its formal responsibilities, and eliminated the distinction between banks and nonbank deposit-taking institutions. Among other things, the act (1) revised the minimum criteria for authorizing a bank; (2) established an advisory board, the Board of Banking Supervision, to advise the Bank on its actions; (3) amended the grounds on which the Bank might or was required to revoke authorization; (4) gave the Bank the power to restrict an authorization and set up an appeals process; (5) required banks to report their large exposures to the Bank; and (6) enhanced the Bank\u2019s authority to obtain information from a bank. These supervisory responsibilities are discussed in greater detail in chapter 3.", "In addition, the act gave bank accountants and auditors a legal responsibility to provide information to the Bank when requested to do so. In conjunction, the act relaxed the ordinary duty of confidentiality owed by an auditor or accountant to its client in certain circumstances.", "Further, the fraud uncovered in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and its closure in 1991, led to additional concerns about bank supervision in the United Kingdom and questions about the Bank\u2019s continuing role in bank supervision. To date, major changes in the structure of bank supervision have not been made as a result of these concerns; however, changes have been made in the legislation and organization of bank supervision in the Bank. These changes were intended to improve the information available to the Bank, encourage a more proactive philosophy on the part of the Bank, and strengthen bank supervision in general. These changes included (1) establishing new Special Investigations and Legal units; (2) strengthening the involvement of the Board of Banking Supervision; (3) more intensely training supervisors in issues of fraud; (4) improving communication within the Bank, and between the Bank, the Treasury, and other government departments; and (5) requiring bank accountants and auditors to report material breaches of the authorization criteria by the banks they audit to the Bank.", "Overlaying these events has been the development of a unified financial services market in the EU, which has also affected U.K. bank regulation and supervision. Central to the liberalization of financial services under the Single Market Program is the concept of a \u201csingle passport.\u201d Once a financial firm is established and licensed in one member state, its home country, that firm can use a single passport to offer financial services in any other member state, or host country. Underlying the Single Market Program is an understanding that a minimum level of harmonization in regulation is necessary among the member countries to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. For instance, the EU Second Banking Directive requires all EU banks to have a minimum capital base and a minimum level of shareholder disclosure and limits equity participation in nonfinancial firms. Consequently, all EU member countries, including the United Kingdom, have had to change their banking laws and regulations as necessary to meet the minimum requirements imposed by EU financial services directives. To date, however, the structure of bank regulation in the United Kingdom has not been changed as a result of EU directives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulation of Banks\u2019 Nonbank Activities", "paragraphs": ["In the United Kingdom, securities activities are conducted either in bank subsidiaries or within the bank itself.

Thus, when a bank owns nonbank subsidiaries, the Bank remains the lead regulator and retains responsibility for monitoring the capital levels of the banking entity as a whole, even though the nonbank subsidiaries may be regulated by the SIB or DTI.

One of these executive directors is responsible for bank supervisory responsibilities within the Bank as well as payment, settlement, and clearing systems.

It may do this in a number of ways. First, the Bank is required under the 1987 Act to publish a statement of the principles in accordance with which it will (1) interpret the criteria for authorization and the grounds for revocation of a bank\u2019s authorization established in the act and (2) exercise its power to grant, revoke, or restrict an authorization. The Bank\u2019s Statements of Principles are legally binding on the banks it supervises. For example, the Statements of Principles discuss the Bank\u2019s expectations on capital adequacy or liquidity which, therefore, must be adhered to by banks.", "The Bank also issues \u201csupervisory notices\u201d and \u201cguidance notes\u201d\u2014which also have the force of law\u2014when, for example, amending its Statements of Principles or updating previous notices. In fiscal year 1994, the Bank issued five such notices on large exposures, on-balance-sheet netting and cash collateral, the Bank\u2019s relationship with auditors and reporting accountants, reporting accountants\u2019 reports, and subordinated loan capital.", "Supervisory guidance may also include the issuance of a \u201crecommendation\u201d on a certain issue by the Bank. There is an expectation on the part of the Bank and the banks it regulates that banks will make every effort to comply with Bank recommendations. These recommendations do not directly carry the force of law, although noncompliance could in certain circumstances call into question whether a bank met the general criterion in the act requiring institutions to conduct their business in a prudent manner. This allows the Bank to be flexible in enforcing such recommendations: it can take account of special circumstances which may be discussed with individual institutions. For example, in April 1993 the Bank recommended that banks active in derivatives activities have at least two board members knowledgeable about derivatives, of whom one should be the Finance Director. This caused a problem for some banks whose finance directors were not expert in derivatives, even though at least two other Board members were. The Bank accepted that it was reasonable to make an exception for such cases.", "Before issuing supervisory notes or making recommendations, the Bank will\u2014as a practical matter rather than because it is required to do so\u2014get advice from and consult with interested parties such as the British Bankers Association or the Auditing Practices Board. It is also likely to request comment from the Treasury. Finally, the Bank consults with the Board of Banking Supervision before issuing notices or recommendations.", "The Bank will also issue interpretive letters on its policies in response to questions that it receives from individual banks.

This kind of interpretation is viewed as binding on the bank.", "Although the Bank is very involved in the drafting of banking legislation and may be asked to testify before Parliament on bank-related issues, the Treasury has the primary responsibility for bank legislation.

The Bank has a great deal of discretion to decide whether to take formal action or seek remedial action by some other informal means\u2014through persuasion and encouragement, for instance. If, for example, \u201cthe Bank considers that adequate and speedy remedial steps are likely to be taken by an authorized institution,\u201d then it \u201cwould generally be reluctant to revoke or restrict the authorization\u201d and would be more likely to \u201crecommend\u201d that certain actions be taken by a bank. Indeed, in the Statements of Principles, the Bank further asserts that \u201cwhere appropriate  will seek remedial action by [informal means such as] persuasion and encouragement.\u201d This language reflects the Bank\u2019s preference for informal over formal enforcement actions.", "Informal enforcement actions are normally the Bank\u2019s first choice because they are easier to put into effect, and provide for flexibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken by the banks. Furthermore, banks fully understand that if they do not comply with informal actions and recommendations, then a strong formal action, which the Bank has clear discretion to choose, is sure to follow. Informal actions are, therefore, more effective than might otherwise be assumed since banks recognize the formal authority which underlies informal actions.", "According to the Bank, such a system of supervision also works because bank managers understand that if they notify the Bank of a problem, Bank supervisors will help them find solutions and will not discipline a bank for a problem that is being resolved. As a result, many potential problems are brought to the attention of the Bank by the banks themselves. Smaller banks in particular may not have the expertise in-house to resolve certain problems and can turn to the Bank for advice.", "Nevertheless, the banking statute provides the Bank with powers to take formal enforcement action against authorized institutions on a number of grounds, particularly if the criteria for a bank to receive approval to take deposits discussed above have been breached. Such formal action can include revoking a bank\u2019s authorization; removing bank managers or directors; or imposing conditions on the bank such as limiting deposit taking to current depositors, restricting the bank\u2019s scope of business, and prohibiting the bank from entering into certain transactions.", "Despite its preference for taking informal action, the Bank, in its Statements of Principles, says that if it is necessary for the Bank to take formal actions \u201cin order to ensure compliance with the standards or to protect the interests of depositors and potential depositors  it will move to revoke or restrict authorization.\u201d The Bank\u2019s Statements of Principles acknowledges that the threshold for being authorized to take formal action under the Banking Act is relatively low. For example, the Bank can take formal enforcement actions to restrict or revoke a license \u201cbefore the deterioration in the institution\u2019s condition is such that there is a serious likelihood that depositors will suffer a loss.\u201d It would, for example, revoke an institution\u2019s license even if the institution had adequate capital and liquidity if \u201cthere was no reasonable prospect of speedy and comprehensive remedial action.\u201d", "Both formal and informal actions are subject to judicial review. In addition, formal enforcement actions are subject to review by the Banking Appeal Tribunal, as provided for in the Banking Act, and the Board of Banking Supervision is informed by Supervision and Surveillance of prospective formal actions that are being considered. Appeals before the Tribunal are rare, however, and all but one case\u2014which was decided in favor of the Bank\u2014have been withdrawn by the appealing bank before a full hearing could take place. This fact reflects the authority the Bank has over the banks it supervises and, according to the Bank, the potential for appeal does not affect its decisions to take formal action. Nevertheless, some banking industry representatives have speculated that the Bank postponed decisions to close BCCI because of the evidence that was deemed necessary to forestall the possibility of an appeal to the courts.", "In the 11-year period from March 1, 1983 through February 28, 1994, the Bank used its powers to revoke bank authorizations 35 times and its power to restrict bank authorizations 47 times. In most cases, such action is taken when the minimum criteria for authorization are not being met.", "While the Bank has sole authority to withdraw a bank\u2019s authorization, the U.K. courts must be petitioned to close a bank, and the courts officially decide whether an institution should be placed into administration, receivership, or liquidation under the Insolvency Act of 1986. Furthermore, in a majority of the cases where banks have experienced sufficient solvency problems to warrant their closing, the banks\u2019 directors or stockholders, not the Bank, have petitioned the courts for an order closing the bank because this allows them to play a role in determining who is appointed administrator of the bank. Nevertheless, the Bank remains the driving force in determining when and how a bank gets closed.

The Board\u2019s sole function is to administer the deposit protection system. It has no regulatory or oversight function, nor does it assist in problem bank situations; it only steps in when a bank becomes insolvent and depositors are due funds.", "The Deposit Protection Board is an independent body legally separate from the Bank, even though four of the Board\u2019s seven members are Bank officials, including the Board\u2019s chairman, who is the Governor of the Bank of England. The other three Bank officials on the Deposit Protection Board are the Bank\u2019s Deputy Governor, its executive director in charge of banking supervision, and its chief cashier. The three non-Bank Board members are bank representatives.", "The Fund is maintained through contributions made by banks to the Fund. It is required by law to maintain a level of \u00a35 million to \u00a36 million\u2014a small fraction of the approximately \u00a3550 billion in sterling deposits held by U.K. banks as of March 1994\u2014and banks may be required to make three types of contributions to maintain this level of funding: (1) initial contributions of \u00a310,000 when a bank is first authorized; (2) further contributions, if the Fund falls below \u00a33 million, not exceeding \u00a3300,000 per bank based on the insured deposit base of the banks involved; and (3) special contributions, again based on the insured deposit base of the banks involved, but with no contribution limit. Since the largest six banks in the United Kingdom hold 55 percent of the insured deposits in the United Kingdom, they would cover 55 percent of these special contributions. Special contributions of \u00a380 million were necessary to fund expenditures after the BCCI failure.", "If necessary, the Fund may borrow from the Bank\u2014which it did after BCCI was closed in 1992. The limit of this line of credit is set by the Treasury and is subject to annual review. The line of credit was increased to \u00a3125 million in 1992 then reduced to \u00a350 million in 1993. The line of credit is intended for short-term, liquidity purposes until the Deposit Protection Board can raise the funds from its member banks to repay the Bank loan. The Fund receives no direct financial backing from the Bank or the U.K. taxpayer.

For example, after the 1987 market break, the Bank announced its intention of providing liquidity to the market, thereby giving its unofficial endorsement to the view that the banks at the center of the system would be able to meet their obligations in any event.", "The Bank has, with greater and lesser degrees of success, also persuaded major U.K. banks to support rescue operations of individual or groups of banks. In the early 1970s, for example, a number of relatively unsupervised secondary banks experienced severe financial problems, primarily as a result of real estate speculation. The secondary bank crisis threatened serious repercussions on the major primary sector banks, and the Bank therefore organized a \u201clifeboat\u201d of clearing banks to provide liquidity for secondary banks suffering runs. In most cases the risk of loss was borne by the clearing banks, although the Bank agreed to cover losses over the exposure limits, thereby exposing itself to significant risk as well. In the end, several of the banks failed, and the Bank bore losses under agreed-upon indemnities, even though significant recoveries were made over subsequent years as some of the failed banks\u2019 loans were repaid or sold.", "Another example of the Bank as organizer of a bank rescue occurred in 1984 in the case of JMB, a major participant in gold bullion and commodity trading and one of the five London gold price fixers. As a result of large exposures that it failed to report to the Bank, JMB\u2019s capital was all but eradicated. The Bank feared for London\u2019s position as the leading international gold bullion market and, after the JMB parent company could not provide enough capital to save the bank and potential purchasers who were approached by the Bank withdrew, the Bank itself provided support for JMB. After considerable pressure from the Bank, the four London clearing banks agreed to provide \u00a335 million; the members of the gold market, \u00a330 million; and the other members of the accepting houses committee, \u00a310 million to support JMB. Neither the Bank nor any of the participating banks bore any losses in the JMB rescue.", "Since the establishment of the Deposit Protection Fund in 1979, which limits the losses of small depositors, banks might be less inclined to participate in rescue attempts on the scale of the early 1970s, according to a Bank official. Nevertheless, in 1991, the Bank provided an indemnity to support a \u00a3200 million liquidity facility provided by a group of large U.K. banks to the banking subsidiary of a major mortgage lender and subsequently took over the direct funding.

It is, however, a member of APACS and of the individual clearing companies with the right to appoint a director to the board of each of the clearing companies. Consequently, the Bank has a voice in APACS decisions, and its special interest is generally recognized on questions of public policy.", "There is no statutory supervision or regulation of the payment systems operating in the United Kingdom, though the Bank has implicit responsibility for oversight of the payment systems by virtue of its core responsibilities as a central bank.

According to the Bank, its responsibility consists of supporting banks whose failure would initiate a loss of confidence in the U.K. financial system as a whole. The Bank admits that size is an important factor in considering systemic effects, but that no bank should consider Bank assistance automatic or without penalty. Furthermore, before committing its own funds, the Bank will encourage a bank to find a buyer, attempt to persuade bank creditors to provide support to protect their own positions, or try to find a group of banks with an interest in an orderly resolution. If all else fails, the Bank may consider committing its own funds, but only if the bank\u2019s problem is one of liquidity, not of solvency. Nevertheless, the Bank does not mandate that its lending be collateralized.", "At the time of any lender of last resort action, the lending is generally not made public, although the Bank will obtain the Treasury\u2019s approval for the proposed action. The lending is also generally made without a government guarantee, and the deposit protection system does not play a role in providing or guaranteeing funds. This means that the Bank is subject to losses if banks to which it has lent money on an uncollateralized basis are unable to repay the funds.", "The most recent example of lender of last resort action made public by the Bank was when it provided liquidity support to a few small banks in 1991. During 1990 and 1991, a number of small banks had experienced difficulties due to the depressed real estate market and increasing defaults on consumer credit. The resulting failure of several smaller banks and the closing of BCCI in 1991 contributed to the small bank sector\u2019s experiencing wholesale funding difficulties as local authorities and public corporations in particular withdrew deposits on maturity. In order to avert a possible systemic disturbance that could result from multiple small bank failures, the Bank provided liquidity support with the government\u2019s knowledge, but without a government guarantee. As a result of its lending to small banks in 1991, the Bank made provisions in 1993 of \u00a3115 million against possible losses from the failure of some of these banks, although exact losses have not been published. If any of these banks were to fail and losses were to ensue, the Bank would be treated as an unsecured creditor and would participate in distributions by a liquidator.
