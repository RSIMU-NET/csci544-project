These nine issuers represented 85 percent of the credit card market.

Debt protection products have largely displaced credit insurance in the credit card market, although the two products are similar from a consumer's perspective. Issuers market debt protection products when consumers call their customer services lines, by direct mail, e-mail, and telemarketing, and with new credit card applications, and market the products broadly rather than to specific subpopulations. Debt protection products are banking products that are largely federally regulated, while credit insurance is an insurance product regulated by the states. Unlike state oversight of credit insurance, federal banking oversight of debt protection products does not directly address the relative financial benefits and costs of the products to consumers; instead, it focuses on compliance with disclosure requirements and prohibitions of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will soon assume supervisory and enforcement authority for financial products, including credit card debt protection products. Ensuring that these products represent a fair value to consumers would be consistent with the new agency's mission. Debt protection products and credit insurance can offer consumers several advantages. The products can protect a cardholder's credit rating in times of financial distress, can provide peace of mind, and are widely available and easy to purchase. Regulators have reported relatively few consumer complaints and have cited few formal violations related to debt protection products. However, fees for these products can be substantial, with the annual cost often exceeding 10 percent of the cardholder's average monthly balance. In the aggregate, cardholders received 21 cents in tangible financial benefits for every dollar spent in debt protection product fees among the nine largest issuers in 2009. These products can be difficult for consumers to understand, but federal agencies offer few educational resources to aid consumers in assessing them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (1) factor into its oversight of credit card debt protection products, including its rulemaking and examination process, a consideration of the financial benefits and costs to consumers, and (2) incorporate into its financial education efforts ways to improve consumers' ability to understand and assess these products.

Representatives of regulators and one  consumer group noted that debt protection products offer more potential  for earnings than credit insurance. This may be in part because of the  absence of price controls that states generally impose on credit insurance  rates and the nonuniformity of state regulation.

These  benefits may cancel the total credit card balance if the cardholder dies or  may cancel the minimum monthly payment for a specific time during a  period of unemployment, for example. As a result, debt cancellation  benefits reduce the cardholder\u2019s account balance by the amount of debt  being canceled.", "Suspension benefits allow a cardholder to skip the minimum monthly  payment without penalty and without accruing interest for a specified time  period. Debt suspension does not reduce the cardholder\u2019s account  balance.", "These cancellation and suspension benefits are triggered by certain events.  Benefits vary among products, with most debt protection products  covering loss of life, disability, involuntary unemployment, and leave of  absence from employment. Some products also cover other events, such  as the birth or adoption of a child, marriage, relocation, divorce,  hospitalization, call to active U.S. military duty, retirement, loss of a  spouse or child, or natural disaster. At least one issuer also includes an  emergency payment benefit, which cancels the minimum monthly  payment once per year for any reason. Another issuer includes a benefit  that allows cardholders to suspend one monthly payment per year in  months that include specific federal holidays. Each product offered by the  nine issuers covers a different number of events, ranging from 4 to 21  events. Some products allow benefits to be triggered by events affecting  individuals other than the primary cardholder, such as the cardholder\u2019s  spouse or domestic partner, other authorized users of the card, or the  highest wage earner in the cardholder\u2019s household. For example, benefits  could be triggered by the involuntary unemployment of the cardholder\u2019s  spouse.", "Debt protection product fees are generally charged monthly and are based  on the cardholder\u2019s outstanding balance. Fees for the nine largest credit  card issuers\u2019 debt protection products range from $0.85 to $1.35 per month  for every $100 of the outstanding balance.

Because the fee  depends on the card balance, the fee for the product can vary from month  to month (see fig. 2).

According to data from the  nine largest issuers, approximately 70 percent of all benefit requests were  approved in 2009, while about 24 percent were denied. More than half of  these denials occurred because the cardholder did not provide adequate  documentation of the triggering event. The remainder of requests were  still pending at the end of 2009. Issuers sometimes contract with a third- party administrator to manage their debt protection programs, and in  these cases the administrators interact with cardholders to approve and  process benefits.", "The terms and conditions of debt protection products include various  eligibility requirements and may include certain exclusions or restrictions,  which may differ based on the triggering event. For example, some  products restrict hospitalization or disability benefits for customers with  preexisting health conditions. They may also exclude from unemployment  coverage cardholders who are employed part time or seasonally. None of  the debt protection products that we reviewed had maximum age limits. A  few debt protection products require a general waiting period, such as 30  days after enrollment, before customers can request any type of benefit.  Some triggering events may also have specific waiting periods\u2014for  example, a cardholder may need to be unemployed for 30 days before  applying for an unemployment benefit, although the benefit may be  applied retroactively.

For example, three of the largest nine issuers limited their loss-of-life  balance cancellation benefit to $10,000 and three limited it to $25,000; the  remaining three had no limit. The products may also place caps on the  duration of the benefit. For example, one issuer\u2019s product suspends  payments for up to 24 billing periods for involuntary unemployment and  temporary disability and for up to 1 billing period for other events, such as  marriage. Three issuers restricted how much cardholders could charge  and the type of transactions they could make during benefit periods, but  the other six large issuers did not.

Issuers indicated that  they sometimes focus marketing efforts on cardholders with certain  characteristics that might make them more likely to enroll in the product,  such as consumers who routinely carry a balance.

Customer service representatives responding to  inquiries or requests via issuers\u2019 toll-free telephone numbers often also  promote ancillary credit card products, and such calls accounted for  nearly half of the nine largest issuers\u2019 debt protection product sales in  2009. Most issuers also market debt protection products at bank branches,  through telemarketing, and via direct mail, methods that collectively  accounted for more than 40 percent of product enrollments that year.  Telemarketing calls can be conducted by the issuers themselves or by  third-party contractors. Mail marketing can include mailings aimed solely  at marketing debt protection products or promotional inserts included  with cardholders\u2019 statements or new credit cards. Internet marketing  accounted for another 4 percent of product sales in 2009, according to  issuer data. Our review of marketing materials found that they typically  highlighted the products\u2019 ability to potentially protect a cardholder\u2019s credit  rating and provide relief during life-changing events. Some issuers also  offered a gift card or cash-back certificate to customers as an incentive for  enrolling in debt protection products. Purchasers receive a packet of  product information, known as a welcome or fulfillment kit, which usually  includes a letter to the consumer, the product\u2019s terms and conditions,  instructions on how to request benefits, and cancellation information  stating that cardholders can cancel the debt protection product at any  time.

For voluntary debt protection products,  creditors must    disclose in writing that the protection is optional;    disclose in writing the fee for the initial term of coverage, and thereafter  on the periodic statement;    explain, if the product includes debt suspension benefits, that interest will  continue to accrue during the suspension period; and    obtain the consumer\u2019s initials or signature on a written affirmative request  for the product after providing the required disclosures.", "The regulation does not require that fees for voluntary debt protection  products be included with the credit card application or account-opening  documents, although some issuers do include fee information within these  documents.

The examinations also seek  to determine whether the institution may be engaging in prohibited  practices, such as requiring consumers to purchase the products. Further,  OCC examiners review the adequacy of issuers\u2019 internal policies and  processes for offering and administering the debt protection products to  consumers. Examiners may sample canceled accounts to ensure that banks  correctly follow their own internal policies in refunding fees to consumers.  In addition, examiners look at any potential impact of the products on  institutional safety and soundness, including whether issuers maintain  adequate reserves to cover potential losses associated with benefit payouts.  The examiners evaluate the accounting and profitability of debt protection  products compared with the banks\u2019 total income to evaluate the products\u2019  income sustainability in view of program volume, number of benefit  requests, and cancellation rates.", "Federal regulators\u2019 reviews have generally not addressed the  reasonableness of the pricing of debt protection products, although we did  identify two cases in which regulators commented on the price. In one  case, the regulator noted that debt protection product fees appeared high  and recommended that the bank continue reviewing the appropriateness  of the fees it charged. Because no regulatory guidance existed on the  appropriateness of prices, no formal violations could be cited. In the  second case, the regulator noted that the debt protection products\u2019 payout  rate to consumers was low compared with the fees collected, but no  formal violation was cited.", "Banking regulators noted to us that no laws or regulations set the price of  debt protection products or govern the costs relative to the benefits for  these products.

Our review of 24 completed examinations of debt protection  products confirmed that the products\u2019 price was generally considered in  relation to safety and soundness issues. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that  the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection\u2019s disclosure rules shall  contemplate consumer awareness and understanding of, and the risks,  costs, and benefits of, financial products and services.

As with other types of insurance, state insurance regulators  generally approve credit insurance products and premium rates and  examine insurance companies\u2019 financial solvency and market conduct.  Because state laws and regulations governing credit insurance differ, the  products vary across states. Most states include chapters in their  insurance codes devoted specifically to credit insurance. Many states have  adopted the Consumer Credit Insurance Model Act and the Consumer  Credit Insurance Model Regulation, both of which were initially adopted  by NAIC in 1958 and 1973, respectively. Additionally, according to NAIC,  state laws about disclosure requirements and laws prohibiting unfair or  deceptive acts or practices concerning insurance apply to credit  insurance. For example, many states have adopted some version of an  \u201cunfair trade practices act\u201d that addresses marketing abuses involved in  the sale of insurance products, including credit insurance. State insurance  regulators may carry out examinations to investigate complaints or review  insurance company practices, including credit insurance practices. As  with other insurance products, attorneys general may take action in cases  where insurance companies violate state laws and regulations regarding  credit insurance.", "Although credit insurance is primarily regulated at the state level, federal  laws and regulations also can apply. Creditors offering credit insurance  must comply with applicable federal regulations, such as Regulation Z. In  addition, the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2019s prohibition of unfair or  deceptive acts or practices also can apply to credit insurance. Further, as  part of their examination and oversight activities, federal banking  regulators can review credit insurance products that an institution may  offer in connection with credit cards.", "In contrast to requirements for debt protection products, state insurance  regulations establish a reasonable relationship between the premiums that  consumers pay and the benefits they receive and govern the design and  structure of the products. For instance, states set the premium rates by  law or regulation that insurance companies can charge for credit  insurance. Additionally, states can establish limits on components of  premium rates, such as compensation that insurers may pay third parties,  including credit card issuers, in exchange for services related to credit  insurance. Further, some states establish a loss ratio\u2014that is, the ratio of  benefits paid out divided by premiums collected. NAIC\u2019s Consumer Credit  Insurance Model Regulation specifies that benefits provided must be  reasonable in relation to the premiums charged and notes that the  requirement is met if the loss ratio is 60 percent or more. Because states  set rates, price components differently, and establish loss ratios, the  premiums consumers pay for credit insurance vary depending on their  state of residence. Additionally, NAIC\u2019s model regulation states that  companies offering credit insurance are required to submit \u201cexperience  reports\u201d documenting written and earned premiums. In contrast, federal  agencies do not routinely require credit card issuers to report detailed  information about debt protection products.", "In regulating credit insurance, some states take into account the potential  for a concept that has been referred to as \u201creverse competition.\u201d With  credit insurance, the credit card issuer, rather than the consumer, selects  the insurance company providing the insurance. The credit card company  receives a commission from the insurance company that may be based in  part on the premiums that consumers pay. According to representatives  from NAIC, the New York State Insurance Department, and three  consumer organizations, the result of this is that credit card issuers may  have an incentive to select insurance companies that charge consumers  higher prices for credit insurance in order to earn larger commissions.  Representatives of the credit insurance industry told us that they believe  that the concept of \u201creverse competition\u201d is speculative and is not a factor  in a credit card issuer\u2019s selection of a carrier for credit insurance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Debt Protection Products and Credit Insurance May Offer Some Advantages, but Fees Can Be Substantial", "paragraphs": ["Debt protection products and credit insurance may provide several  advantages, including protection of cardholders\u2019 credit ratings and peace  of mind.

The potential advantages of these  products include the following:    Credit rating protection. Missing credit card payments, making payments  late, or otherwise becoming delinquent on credit card debt can damage  consumers\u2019 credit ratings. Because debt protection products and credit  insurance may cover payments that consumers might not otherwise make,  these products can help avoid negative impact on their credit ratings.", "Peace of mind. The product may provide cardholders with a sense of  security and comfort because they know that the product can protect  them or their next of kin in the event of certain hardships, disability, or  death.

Debt protection products are easy for consumers to  purchase. For example, consumers can typically purchase them when  applying for a new credit card, with no separate application process.  Existing cardholders can readily enroll by telephone or via the issuer\u2019s  Web site. In contrast, purchasing a traditional term life or disability  insurance policy entails a more detailed application process, often  including a medical examination for large amounts of coverage.", "Availability to most cardholders. Debt protection products are generally  available to all consumers holding credit cards, according to industry  representatives. Credit card issuers generally do not exclude consumers  from purchasing these products based on their credit history, age, health,  or other criteria.", "Coverage of events not available in other products. Many credit card- related debt protection and some credit insurance products cover events  for which coverage is not available through traditional insurance  products\u2014for example, involuntary unemployment, hospitalization,  military duty, and life events such as marriage, divorce, or birth or  adoption of a child.

Debt protection products and credit  insurance cover a cardholder\u2019s credit card balance, no matter how small.  Cardholder balances in 2009 averaged about $2,500, and many were much  smaller.

About 40 percent of these complaints were from customers who  claimed they had not knowingly enrolled in the product and 29 percent  related to denial of benefits; the remaining complaints related to a variety  of other issues. The three insurance companies that provided us with data  reported 361 complaints related to credit insurance for credit cards out of  2.7 million accounts with this type of insurance.

Among the 24 bank examinations conducted by  federal banking regulators between 2006 and 2010 that included reviews of  debt protection products, three formal violations involving two banks were  reported. Two violations were related to inadequate disclosures. One  involved a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act\u2019s prohibition of  unfair or deceptive acts or practices. There, rather than automatically  refunding fees to consumers who canceled the product within their 30-day  trial period, the issuer required the customer to request the refund\u2014a  practice that contradicted the process set forth in the long-form disclosures  and that was deemed to be deceptive. In each of these three cases, the bank  was required to take action to remediate these violations.", "Regulators also have taken some informal enforcement actions after  identifying areas of concern related to credit card debt protection  products. For example, a federal banking regulator noted that consumers  complained that they were unaware they had purchased a debt protection  product, and the bank\u2019s files did not always properly document  consumers\u2019 authorization to purchase the product. The bank took action  by changing its telemarketing scripts and training materials to ensure that  consumers authorized the purchases.", "Our review of the 24 bank examinations that had addressed debt protection  products did not find evidence that issuers engaged in predatory practices  with regard to these products.

With this median fee, a  cardholder would pay, on an annual basis, more than 10 percent of his or  her average monthly balance in fees for the product. According to the  aggregated data we received from these issuers, the average monthly fee  paid for a debt protection product in 2009 among cardholders with a  nonzero balance was $16.49, and the median fee was $9.27.

Several credit  union industry representatives we spoke with said that because credit  unions are nonprofit entities, their prices are not set at levels intended to  maximize profits. Representatives of the large banks told us that credit  unions\u2019 debt protection product prices were lower because credit unions  have different business models, tax obligations, and customer bases than  banks.

One actuarial expert estimated that credit card credit insurance  premiums averaged roughly $0.65 to $0.75 per $100 of the monthly  outstanding balance for products that covered loss of life, disability, and  involuntary unemployment, which is somewhat lower than the cost of debt  protection products. However, this expert told us that comparing the costs  of the two products could be problematic because the products were not  fully comparable. For instance, the benefits offered could vary, with debt  protection products typically covering a wider range of events than credit  insurance.

As seen in figure 4, in 2009 the largest nine issuers reported that  they collected $2.4 billion in fees for debt protection products and  provided back to consumers $518 million in monetary benefits. Thus,  consumers received 21 cents in tangible financial benefits for every dollar  paid in fees\u2014that is, a payout ratio of 21 percent. These issuers reported  that the administrative costs and reserves associated with these products  were $574 million, accounting for 24 cents for every dollar in fees  collected. The issuers reported that pretax earnings in 2009 for debt  protection products totaled $1.3 billion, or 55 cents of every dollar in fees  paid.

A credit card\u2019s minimum  monthly payment is typically between 1 and 2 percent of the outstanding  credit card balance. As a result, canceling the minimum payment on a  $2,500 balance would save the cardholder only between $25 and $50.  Further, the cardholder\u2019s remaining card balance continues to accrue  interest during the benefit period.", "Suspension of minimum monthly payment. Allowing cardholders to skip  payments can serve to protect their credit ratings and alleviate a cash flow  crisis, but may have limited direct monetary value because it does not pay  down any of the cardholder\u2019s balance. Suspension benefits waive accrual  of interest during the benefit period, and the monetary value of the benefit  in this case varies depending on the cardholder\u2019s balance and interest rate.", "Duration of benefits. Most benefits have time limitations. For example,  benefits triggered by involuntary unemployment are usually limited to  between 6 and 24 months, and benefits triggered by life events such as the  birth or adoption of a child, or marriage, typically allow suspension or  cancellation of between one and four minimum monthly payments.", "Two issuers\u2019 debt protection products cap the amount of debt that is  canceled but do not cap the fee accordingly. For example, one product  caps loss-of-life coverage at $10,000, but the fees charged for the product  ($0.85 per $100 in outstanding monthly balance) are not similarly capped.  As a result, a cardholder with a balance of $20,000 would pay the fee based  on that amount even though only $10,000 would be canceled in the event  of the cardholder\u2019s death. Four other issuers cap their fees according to  the maximum amount of debt that is canceled by the product. Two issuers  do not cap benefits or fees and one issuer did not provide us information  on whether it caps fees.", "Further, the \u201cbundling\u201d that is characteristic of debt protection products\u2014 wrapping together in one product coverage for multiple events\u2014can result  in cardholders purchasing coverage not always applicable or valuable to  them. For example, when a cardholder dies and leaves no net assets, the  cardholder\u2019s heirs do not automatically become personally liable for any  outstanding credit card debt. Thus, the loss-of-life benefit of a debt  protection product may be of limited value to cardholders with no net  assets. Similarly, cardholders with certain disabilities would not benefit  from the disability coverage bundled into a product because of the  exclusions in most products\u2019 terms and conditions. Industry  representatives told us they believe consumers can benefit from bundled  products because they cover some events not covered by other products,  are offered to a wider range of customers, and can be priced less than  unbundled products because of economies of scale and reduced  administrative expenses.", "Credit card credit insurance typically has lower loss ratios\u2014that is, the  benefits paid out to consumers divided by the premiums collected\u2014than  more traditional forms of insurance, such as group life or individual  disability insurance. In 2009, the aggregate loss ratios for credit card credit  life and credit disability insurance were 61 percent and 24 percent,  respectively, for the three insurance companies that provided us with data.  In contrast, the 2009 aggregate loss ratios for group life insurance and  individual disability insurance among U.S. insurance companies overall  were 83 percent and 51 percent in 2009, according to SNL Financial and  NAIC, respectively. However, there can be significant limitations to  making such comparisons. First, credit insurance and other forms of  insurance are not fully comparable products because their benefit  amounts and coverage terms may differ significantly. Second, the cost of  administering these products may vary, and may be proportionally higher  for credit insurance, which typically covers relatively small loan amounts.  Finally, loss ratios do not incorporate the nonquantifiable benefits of an  insurance product, such as peace of mind.", "Representatives from consumer organizations and some government  agencies have advised consumers to consider alternatives to purchasing  debt protection products or credit insurance. They note that consumers  considering purchasing these products might be better off using the  amount they would pay in monthly fees toward paying down their credit  card balance, particularly if they are accruing significant interest. Another  alternative to paying a debt protection product fee can be to accumulate  personal savings that could be used to make credit card payments in the  event of job loss or other unforeseen circumstances. Some consumer and  insurance experts also advise that, in general, insurance is intended to  provide broad financial protection, while these products just cover a single  credit card debt. NAIC representatives told us that term life insurance was  a more cost-effective way to protect one\u2019s heirs because the cost per unit  of coverage for term life insurance is generally much lower than the cost  per unit of coverage for debt protection products or credit insurance.

Representatives of the credit card  companies provided a variety of reasons for declining to provide the full  terms and conditions to consumers until after consumers purchased the  product. One issuer stated that providing the full terms and conditions was  impractical in connection with certain marketing channels, such as  telephone calls, and another stated that it could be confusing to provide  the information in advance because consumers might believe they had  already purchased the product.

The  questionnaires collected information on product sales, fees, financial  benefits, administrative expenses, earnings, complaints, cancellatio incentives and commissions, the marketing of these products, and  characteristics of consumers who purchase them. We received com ments  and technical corrections on drafts of the questionnaires from the  companies that would be completing them, as well as representatives of  the Debt Cancellation Coalition, Argus, and an actuarial firm, and  incorporated changes as appropriate. The third-party provider, Argus,  distributed the questionnaires we developed and asked the companies to  submit their responses within approximately 3 weeks. We discussed wit h  Argus and with representatives of the companies steps that were being taken to ensure that the data were accurate and complete, and Argus  provided us with documentation of these steps. However, we did not have access to the issuers\u2019 or insurance companies\u2019 systems to fully assess t he  reliability of the data they provided or the systems themselves, which  house the data. Therefore, we present these data  in our report only as  representations made to us by these companies.", "Additionally, we gathered information on the characteristics of the  issuers\u2019 primary debt protection products by having three analy sts  independently review the products\u2019 terms and conditions. Any  discrepancies among the three analysts about the products\u2019 features,  terms, or conditions were identified, discussed, and resolved by referring  to the source documents provided by the nine issuers. In some instances,  we contacted issuers to confirm or clarify certain aspects of the products.  In coordination with the Debt Cancellation Coalition, the nine issuer s and  three insurance companies also provided us with sample marketing  materials, including telephone scripts used by their representatives to se the products, product brochures, promotional e-mail messages, screen  shots of product Web sites, direct mail materials sent to consumers, and  new card applications that include the option to purchase the products.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed applicable federal laws an regulations related to debt protection products, including Regulation Z,  which implements the Truth in Lending Act, Section 5 of the Federal T Commission Act, and a rule from the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC) that specifically addresses debt protection products. We reviewed the compliance examination handbooks and procedures of the  on  five federal banking regulators\u2013\u2013Federal Deposit Insurance Corporati (FDIC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal  Reserve), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), OCC, and  Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)\u2014and identified procedures and  activities specific to debt protection products.

In addition, we conducted interviews with the fed banking regulators and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on their  roles in overseeing debt protection products.", "We also reviewed model laws and regulations developed by NAIC related  to credit insurance, as well as summaries of credit insurance case law in  various states. Additionally, we interviewed representatives of NAIC, th credit insurance companies, and two consumer organizations for their  perspectives on state regulatory oversight of credit insurance. In addition we obtained more detailed information on credit insurance regulation in  s  three states\u2014California, Maine, and New York. We selected these state because they represented a range of market sizes for open-end credit  insurance, use different regulatory models, and have taken a proactive  regulatory oversight approach to credit insurance, according to insurancexperts and consumer advocates. For each of these states, we reviewed the state laws and regulations related to credit insurance and obtained  information from representatives of the state\u2019s insurance department.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed reports and studies by  consumer organizations and trade groups that addressed the advantages  e. We  and disadvantages of debt protection products and credit insuranc also addressed these issues in interviews with representatives of  individual credit card and credit insurance companies, as well as with th American Bankers Association, Consumer Credit Industry Association,  Debt Cancellation Coalition, Center for Economic Justice, and Consumer  Federation of America. We also interviewed staff at and received materials  from CreditRe and Hause Actuarial Solutions, Inc., independent actuarial  firms with expertise in credit insurance and debt protection products,  . In  spoke with representatives of the American Academy of Actuaries addition, we evaluated the terms and conditions of selected debt  protection and credit insurance products and analyzed aggregated data  that we received from the nine largest issuers and three credit insurance  companies. For comparative purposes, we also gathered data on the deb protection products offered by credit unions. We obtained pricing data from CUNA Mutual, a provider of financial products and insurance to  credit unions, for 179 credit unions offering debt protection products in 2009. According to CUNA Mutual, these 179 credit unions represented  roughly 51 percent of the credit union debt protection market for credit  t  cards (as measured by number of credit unions). We analyzed aggregated  loss ratio data from three credit insurance companies and, for comparative  purposes, reviewed comparable ratios for group life insurance and  individual disability insurance in 2009. We obtained average group life  insurance loss ratios from SNL Financial, a data source that collects,  standardizes, and disseminates corporate, financial, and market data. The  average group life insurance loss ratio data covered all companies offering  group life insurance in the United States in 2009. We obtained average  disability insurance loss ratios from NAIC, which covered the top 125  insurance companies that offered accident and health insurance in the  United States in 2009. We determined that these data from SNL Financial  and NAIC were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our study.", "In addition, we collected consumer complaint data for calendar years 2005  through 2009 from FDIC\u2019s Specialized Tracking and Reporting System, the  Federal Reserve\u2019s CAESAR consumer complaint database, FTC\u2019s  Consumer Sentinel database, OCC\u2019s Remedy consumer complaint  database, and OTS\u2019s consumer complaint database. To assess the  reliability of data from the regulators\u2019 databases, we reviewed  documentation about these databases and interviewed agency staff who  managed them. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for use in our report. We also reviewed data on consumer complaints  obtained, in aggregated form, from our questionnaires to the nine issuers  and three insurance companies. We obtained information from each of the  federal banking regulators on violations and enforcement actions related  to debt protection products that resulted from examinations conducted  between 2006 and 2010.
