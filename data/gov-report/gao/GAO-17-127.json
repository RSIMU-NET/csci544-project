This is because OPM has not taken the steps necessary to make the data widely available for use by other agencies and researchers. EHRI payroll data are intended to provide a centralized, standardized, and comprehensive source of pay and leave related data across the federal government. In this capacity, these data have the potential to provide a more efficient, cost effective, and precise data source for federal agencies and researchers who wish to assess human resources and policy decision making across the federal government. Because these data are not widely available, federal agencies and researchers must rely on other proxy sources for payroll data, which are more limited in the scope of analysis they can provide or the level of detail needed for data-driven human capital studies.", "Although some elements of the data are sufficiently reliable for general use, weaknesses in OPM's internal controls for the EHRI payroll data will need to be addressed to enhance the reliability of other data elements. As shown in the table below, GAO's assessment of key internal control activities that are critical to ensuring the reliability of the EHRI payroll data found a number of areas where there is insufficient assurance that the control objective will be achieved. These weaknesses increase the risk of data errors, incomplete data fields, and ineffective monitoring of the EHRI payroll data. Unless OPM takes steps to correct these internal control weaknesses, it will be unable to fully leverage these data to meet its mission and allow others to make full use of these data for their research needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that OPM improve the availability of its payroll data and implement additional internal control activities to better ensure data reliability.", "OPM agreed with all of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Data are essential for understanding the effectiveness and efficiency of  government operations.

Recognizing the  importance of available and reliable data to government operations and  accountability, we have made several recommendations in prior reports  for data quality improvements across a wide range of federal programs.", "These reports have highlighted the costs and risks of failing to collect  accurate data to manage and evaluate agency programs.", "One particularly important type of data for ensuring effective and efficient  government operations, as well as government accountability, is human  resources data, or information on the federal workforce itself. As we have  previously noted, agencies must monitor workforce data to avoid serious  human capital shortfalls, such as critical skills gaps, which can erode their  ability to carry out their missions. In addition, Congress, audit  organizations, policy groups, and others regularly use federal workforce  data to evaluate federal employment policies, practices, and costs.

One of OPM\u2019s strategic goals is to be  the federal leader in data-driven human resources analytics. To that end,  OPM collects a variety of human capital data from federal agencies. The  Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) system is the primary  data warehouse to support these efforts. OPM designed EHRI to leverage  its existing IT infrastructure, staff, and tools to integrate federal personnel,  payroll, training, and retirement databases.", "The payroll database\u2014one of the four databases of the EHRI system\u2014 became operational in 2009. Payroll data provide information on how  federal employees allocate their time\u2014reflected in hours charged to  specific categories of work and use of leave. Every two weeks,  information for over two million federal civilian employees is transmitted to  OPM from four payroll service centers and other, individual payroll  providers responsible for processing payroll transactions for federal  agencies. Service centers standardize and collate certain fields in  agencies\u2019 time and attendance data in order to report specified fields to  the EHRI payroll database. These fields include unique identifiers, such  as an EHRI ID number, to link individual records to other personnel data  in EHRI, as well as data elements such as agency, time charge  categories, and pay rates.

To assess the extent to  which EHRI payroll data have supported OPM\u2019s strategic and open data  goals, which involve making human resources data available to support  government accountability and workforce analytics, we conducted a  literature search to identify (1) studies specifically relying on EHRI payroll  data and (2) studies using pay, payroll, and other time and attendance  related data from sources other than the EHRI payroll system. We  included studies with variables corresponding to fields available in the  EHRI payroll database, such as telework or annual leave, to identify  potential uses of EHRI payroll data. We limited our search to articles and  reports published after 2008 because the EHRI payroll database became  operational in 2009. We reviewed literature from peer-reviewed journal  articles, agency publications, including GAO reports, and other  publications from policy organizations. Lastly, we reviewed OPM  documentation on its strategic plans and information technology  initiatives, interviewed OPM officials about their actual and potential uses  of EHRI payroll data, and conducted searches of OPM and other federal  websites that support government data transparency initiatives, such as  Data.gov and itdashboard.gov, to determine whether the EHRI payroll  database was included in published documentation of existing databases.", "To determine the extent to which EHRI payroll system controls ensure the  reliability of the data for its intended purpose, we compared OPM\u2019s  documentation and process for EHRI quality assurance to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. According to these  standards, internal control systems consist of five components: (1) the  control environment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4)  information and communication, and (5) monitoring. Of these five  elements, we determined that control activities and monitoring were the  most relevant for ensuring reliable payroll data, and focused on these in  our assessment of the EHRI payroll data system. To provide a more  detailed methodology for examining the broad controls outlined in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, we relied on  specific \u201clook for\u201d indicators for Information System controls outlined in  the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM). The  FISCAM contains guidance for reviewing information system controls that  affect the confidentiality, reliability, and availability of computerized  information, which are aligned with the broader controls outlined in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. We evaluated  controls by (1) reviewing OPM\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and  standards for EHRI payroll data quality to determine whether guidance  was documented and up-to-date; (2) analyzing OPM and service center  documentation to determine if the effectiveness of quality controls had  been periodically assessed, actions had been taken to correct  weaknesses or previously identified control deficiencies, and whether  specific edit and access controls were in place; (3) interviewing OPM and  service center officials to determine whether OPM was performing certain  internal controls processes outlined in its documentation; and (4) testing  the reliability of key fields in the EHRI payroll database to identify missing  data, obvious errors, and outliers. We did not assess whether an  individual\u2019s hours charged to a particular time code actually reflected the  hours spent on those activities. As each agency is responsible for data  quality, this type of validity is managed by agencies\u2019 time and attendance  policies and review processes.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to October 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Enterprise  Human Resources Integration (EHRI) system is OPM\u2019s primary repository  for human capital data to support these efforts.", "OPM developed EHRI to (1) provide for comprehensive knowledge  management and workforce analysis, forecasting, and reporting to further  strategic management of human capital across the executive branch; (2)  facilitate the electronic exchange of standardized human resources data  within and across agencies and systems and the associated benefits and  cost savings; and (3) provide unification and consistency in human capital  data across the executive branch. In addition, OPM\u2019s updated system and  integrated data were expected to accrue savings to the federal  government, reduce redundancy among agency systems, streamline the  various processes involved in tracking and managing federal  employment, and facilitate human capital management activities by  providing storage, access, and exchange of standard electronic  information through a data repository of standardized core human capital  data for most executive branch employees.", "While the personnel database predated the EHRI Data Warehouse, the  payroll database was newly developed for OPM\u2019s e-payroll initiative to  consolidate agency payroll processes.

Payroll service  centers receive employees\u2019 bi-weekly time sheets which come from a  variety of time and attendance (TA) systems from the agencies they  service. Generally, TA systems allow employees to specify time spent on  different work and leave categories, such as the number of regular or  overtime hours worked or the number of annual leave or sick leave hours  taken in a given pay period (PP). However, the level of detail regarding  the exact nature of the work or leave time varies depending on agency  policies and systems for recording employee work time. While the service  centers have consolidated payroll reporting, there are still variations  among the centers and the TA systems agencies use to submit employee  time sheets. Some systems are maintained by the service center and  employees from various agencies access those systems to record their  hours. For example, GSA has only one TA system that agencies use to  record work and leave hours. Other systems are maintained by the  agency and may reflect specific TA accounting needs of the agency. For  example, NFC processes time sheets from several different TA systems,  some of which are agency specific, and DFAS processes payroll for the  Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and others through systems  including the Business Management Redesign (e-Biz) TA system and the  Automated Time, Attendance, and Production System (ATAAPS) (see  figure 1).", "In light of the significant variation in TA systems and service centers  involved in processing TA information into payroll records, OPM  established core standards for consistency in reporting and recording  certain types of work and leave hours. These standards apply at the  agency level as well as the service center level. Some of these standards  are based on official leave authorized in statute. For example, federal  employees are authorized to be absent from duty without a loss in pay or  charge to leave for legal holidays and for activities such as jury duty,  attendance at a military funeral, bone-marrow or organ donation, and  certain union activities. Other standards are based on OPM guidance  for excused absences due to inclement weather or blood donation,  among others, charged as administrative leave. Agencies follow common  recording practices for annual leave and sick leave. These core standards  at the agency level are an important part of the process for reporting to  OPM because they allow the service centers to collapse certain fields in a  consistent way. While agencies may have specific time codes and time  keeping practices to meet their needs, core standards for service center  reporting dictate how these codes should be collapsed for reporting to  OPM. For example, agencies may have detailed categories for various  types of administrative leave, but segments of those charge codes apply  generally to the category of administrative leave, enabling service centers  to aggregate these data from TA systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Controls and Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["OPM relies on agencies and service centers to ensure that the data they  submit are timely, accurate, complete, and compiled in accordance with  OPM standards.

This is in contrast to other OPM data, such as the  EHRI personnel data, which has been widely used since OPM made it  available. OPM has taken specific steps to make these other human  resources-related data available, but has not taken any of these steps for  the EHRI payroll database. For example, OPM has made the EHRI  personnel database available by (1) cleaning it and preparing it for  statistical analysis; (2) integrating it with other data in a repository known  as the EHRI Statistical Data Mart; (3) making deidentified data\u2014that is,  data without personally identifiable information\u2014accessible through  FedScope, an online data analytics tool that draws on data in the  Statistical Data Mart; (4) listing data that are available (either by  download or by request) on the OPM website and on Data.gov; and (5)  sharing requested data with other parties, such as think tanks and  academic researchers.", "Data in the EHRI Statistical Data Mart are also processed and  repackaged to make them more available and usable. Specifically, data  received by OPM from agencies and stored in the EHRI Data Warehouse  are further processed and cleaned and placed into a format better suited  for analysis. This process involves additional corrections and generates  additional data elements likely to be useful for statistical analysis.

Established in 2009, Data.gov is administered by the General  Services Administration (GSA) as a public portal for government data in  accordance with the government-wide open data policy. It includes  information about and links to datasets from executive branch agencies.  As of September 2016, users are able to find references to the EHRI  personnel and retirement data on Data.gov. From Data.gov, users can  follow links to the personnel data in FedScope and request access to the  retirement data. OPM also offers a suite of analytic tools for agencies to  perform workforce analyses and forecasting on the data in the EHRI Data  Warehouse.", "Unlike the EHRI personnel and retirement data, the EHRI payroll data  have not been made available in any of these ways. The documentation  that accompanies the EHRI Statistical Data Mart specifically notes the  absence of payroll data as a limitation, warning users that the data  elements related to pay reflect only annualized rates of pay, and that  employees\u2019 actual pay may be lower or higher due to such factors as  overtime or leave without pay, which would be addressed if the payroll  data were integrated into the Statistical Data Mart. The four databases  within the EHRI Data Warehouse were designed with linking identifiers to  enable such integration. Even though this capability exists, for the past  seven years, the payroll database has not been linked with other EHRI  databases, is not incorporated into the Statistical Data Mart, and has  been left largely unchecked and unused. Until the payroll data are made  available, such as by incorporating them into the Statistical Data Mart and  linking them to the other EHRI databases as designed, OPM will not be  able to crosscheck data across the databases for accuracy, and the data  will not benefit from the processing and preparation for statistical analysis  that is performed for data in the Statistical Data Mart.", "Because reliability issues are often identified during use of the data,  greater use of the EHRI payroll data by other parties would also have the  benefit of helping to improve and establish the data\u2019s reliability.

For example, the Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD  IG) used agency payroll data to conduct an audit of the Defense Finance  and Accounting Service (DFAS), DOD\u2019s payroll provider. Specifically, by  using agency payroll data, the DOD IG was able to identify improper  payments to federal civilian employees. Improper payments occur when  funds go to the wrong recipient, the recipient receives an incorrect  amount of funds, or the recipient uses the funds in an improper manner.  DFAS determined that payments were being made to accounts with  invalid social security numbers, to employees under the legal employment  age, and to multiple employees into the same bank account. These  improper payments amounted to more than $15 million over a six-year  period. We identified similar audits for improper payments conducted by  the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Social Security  Administration Office of Inspector General (SSA IG).", "Agency-specific payroll data have also supported audits of the use of  retention incentives. For example, in 2011, the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) Office of Inspector General examined retention incentives  paid to VA employees in fiscal year 2010. Using agency payroll data, it  found that officials responsible for reviewing and approving retention  incentives did not adequately justify and document awards in accordance  with VA policy. Also, VA officials did not always terminate retention  incentives at the end of set payment periods.

We identified studies that could have benefitted from the  availability of the EHRI payroll data to examine (1) the relationship  between demographic characteristics and pay disparities and costs of  compensation; (2) the use of flexibilities, such as telework, on employee  retention and motivation; and (3) the use of various types of leave.  Because the EHRI payroll data were unavailable, the studies we identified  tended to make use of data that were less precise, less directly relevant,  or less comprehensive than the EHRI payroll data.

For example, a 2015 article in the Journal of Public  Administration Research and Theory compared long-term professional  mobility between federal employees who received veterans\u2019 preferences  and those who did not. To measure mobility, the study relied on  employees\u2019 General Schedule (GS) grade levels from OPM\u2019s Personnel  data system. A 2012 study in the Internal Review on Public and Non- Profit Marketing examined the relationship between performance-based  pay initiatives and discrimination complaints in selected federal agencies  using agency data related to equal employment opportunity records. A  2009 study in the American Review of Public Administration examined  potential drivers of the narrowing pay gap between men and women in  the federal government, including changes in seniority, differences in  fields of study, and women\u2019s migration into traditionally male fields. To  measure the pay gap, these researchers relied on data on employees\u2019  self-reported annual salary.", "Although these studies of disparities provide insight into the impact of  human capital decisions concerning hiring and pay, they had to rely upon  GS grade levels, administrative data, or average annual salary levels to  assess outcomes. Each of these measures has limitations that could  have been addressed if EHRI payroll data had been available. This is  because the EHRI payroll data were designed to provide standardized,  governmentwide information by pay period regarding actual pay, incentive  pay, telework and leave hours, and numerous other data elements related  to federal work activities and compensation. The data used in the three  studies, however, did not provide precise measures of compensation  because pay ranges overlap grade levels in the GS system and  individuals with different grades can receive similar pay rates. In addition,  approximately 30 percent of federal employees are not covered by the  GS system and would be excluded from such assessments by default.  Available measures of annualized salary used in these studies are also  imprecise. An employee\u2019s actual earnings may include other forms of pay  (for example, overtime or shift differentials) not included in adjusted basic  pay, or may be less than the annualized rate because of the employee\u2019s  work schedule (for example, less than full time non-seasonal) or  individual circumstances (for example, leave without pay). Also,  incorporating administrative records of pay into analyses can be  challenging because methods of collecting and reporting otherwise similar  payroll information varies significantly across federal agencies. In  contrast, if EHRI payroll data had been available for these studies, they  could have addressed some of these limitations because the data are  designed to reflect actual pay, including any special pay, overtime pay, or  other incentives and awards an individual might receive each pay period.  They are also centralized and designed to be consistent across agencies.", "Studies of the impact of workforce flexibilities, such as telework, on  employee retention and motivation also demonstrate potential uses of the  EHRI payroll database. A 2010 article in Public Manager described how  agencies, such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have used  telework to improve retention of employees with critical skills. Similarly,  a 2013 study published in the American Review of Public Administration  found that federal employees who engaged in frequent or infrequent  telework were no more likely than their counterparts who do not telework  to express an intention to leave, while a 2012 study in the same journal  concluded that employees at the Department of Health and Human  Services who telework were not significantly more motivated than those  who choose not to telework. Instead of using time spent teleworking  drawn from time and attendance records, both of these studies relied on  data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, in which federal  employees self-report whether they engage in telework \u201cfrequently\u201d or  \u201cinfrequently.\u201d These studies would have benefitted from EHRI payroll  data, which include telework fields that, if reliable, could yield more  precise findings by allowing researchers to use the actual number of  hours or days employees teleworked per pay period, rather than  employees\u2019 generalized descriptions of their telework frequency.", "The telework fields in the EHRI payroll data could also help OPM to meet  statutory requirements to monitor and report on governmentwide use of  telework, and OPM has recently issued a memo to agencies indicating  that it will start using the payroll data to do so. In our 2012 report on  OPM\u2019s ability to meet this requirement, we found that estimates of  telework among federal employees were limited to data calls to agencies  because some agencies did not track telework in their time and  attendance systems. In that report, we concluded that the accuracy of  telework participation and frequency data for some agencies was  questionable. The EHRI payroll reporting requirements now include data  elements for continuous and episodic telework. The availability and use of  these data elements for analysis would allow for more accurate and  efficient assessments to meet statutory reporting requirements, and  would be of use to policymakers.", "Our review of literature also indicates that the EHRI payroll data are  potentially useful for analyzing the use of leave. OPM officials told us that  they would use the data to analyze use of sick leave and annual leave  across the federal government if they had sufficient resources. In the  past, officials conducted such analyses by requesting data on an ad hoc  basis from agencies, but, according to OPM officials, that process was  too resource-intensive to continue. Our review of recent studies suggests  that researchers share OPM\u2019s interest in these topics. For example, a  2015 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine  used time and attendance records from an unidentified federal agency to  examine sick leave use among different demographic groups. Using  survey data, another study examined the impact of different office designs  on sick leave use among Swedish workers, finding that open office plans  were associated with significantly higher reported rates of sick leave  use. However, research on trends in leave use and impacts of certain  policies on leave use across the federal government has been limited in  the past by a lack of comprehensive and standardized leave use data,  which could be addressed if EHRI payroll data were made available to  agencies and researchers.", "Collectively, these studies demonstrate the value of fields within the EHRI  payroll database\u2014such as pay, telework, leave, and other compensation  data\u2014in assessing human capital outcomes. However, in all of the  studies we identified, researchers relied on proxy, annualized, or self- reported measures, as opposed to actual measures of pay, telework,  leave, and other key variables. Further, researchers typically relied upon  data covering a limited number of federal agencies or employees.  Compared to the EHRI payroll data, these sources do not provide  governmentwide data or the same level of precision or detail for  assessing policy outcomes among federal employees, which can affect  the results of analysis. Studies relying on annualized salary may over or  understate actual compensation given the timing of personnel actions,  such as hires, separations, promotions, and leave, which can affect the  actual amount of pay employees receive in a year. Studies relying on  information about a small subset of the federal workforce may not provide  reliable insights about overall federal human capital trends or policy  effects. We and others have noted the importance of appropriate methods  and data in comparing benefits and wages among federal employees and  their private-sector counterparts.", "Other data sources that have been used instead of the EHRI payroll  data\u2014such as OPM\u2019s EHRI personnel database and the Federal  Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS)\u2014also have limitations that could be  addressed if the payroll data were made available. For example, the  EHRI personnel database does not contain information on the amounts of  time spent on sick leave, annual leave, administrative leave, official time  activities, and telework, among other variables relevant to compensation  and time use studies. OPM\u2019s FEVS\u2014a governmentwide database of  federal employee perceptions on their agency\u2019s policies and practices\u2014 contains data elements related to pay, but limitations on the reliability of  these data elements have been identified.", "In addition to the specific studies we reviewed in detail, we identified  hundreds of articles on topics that correspond to EHRI payroll data  fields. For example, we identified 276 articles with the phrases  \u201cadministrative leave,\u201d \u201cannual leave,\u201d \u201ccourt leave,\u201d \u201cfamily leave,\u201d  \u201cmedical leave,\u201d \u201cmilitary leave,\u201d or \u201cunpaid leave\u201d in their titles that have  been published in peer-reviewed journals since 2009, when OPM  launched EHRI. In addition, we identified 37 peer-reviewed studies with  the term \u201ctelework\u201d in their titles and six with the phrase \u201cperformance- based pay\u201d in their titles. Although an in-depth assessment would be  necessary to determine the reliability of individual fields for any of the  specific purposes noted above, our basic reliability testing suggests that  several key fields in the EHRI payroll data are reasonably complete and  contain data within expected ranges\u2014and therefore would have potential  to support research on these topics if the EHRI payroll data were made  available. (See appendix I for more detailed results of our electronic tests  of EHRI payroll data reliability.)

According to EHRI documentation and OPM officials,  automated edit checks are performed by the data system software to  check the validity of individual data elements, the proper relationship of  values among associated data elements, and data format specifications.  The rules check the value and format of fields, including record identifying  fields, such as birthdate and agency, as well as non-record identifying  fields, such as hours of leave. Specifically, they check to make sure that  fields are formatted as numbers, dates, or text, depending on the  designed content of the field, and that all values in a field fall within a  defined range of possible values. Further, OPM applies three relational  edits to ensure (1) that actions taken to add an employee to the system  are not associated with an employee already in the system, (2) that  actions taken to correct a record are associated with an existing record,  and (3) that actions taken to delete a record are associated with an  existing record. See table 2 for a description of the fields that are  checked, the rule that is applied, and the action taken if the rule identifies  an error.", "Data that fail OPM\u2019s automated checks are considered errors, and the   edit rules for the EHRI payroll system specify that data with error rates  greater than 3 percent will not be accepted.

OPM officials noted that they intend to define additional edits  that could be applied to the payroll data during the data loading process.  Federal standards for internal control state that management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks.

Federal standards for internal  control state that management should evaluate information processing  objectives to meet the defined information requirements, such as for  completeness and accuracy. However, the EHRI payroll system accepted  multiple submissions of data that should have been rejected by this rule.

This was due, in part, to  inadequate monitoring controls, which are described in more detail below.  In addition, while OPM designed these control activities to meet  requirements for completeness and accuracy, the controls have not  always met their objective and therefore do not provide sufficient  assurance that completeness requirements will be achieved.

According to OPM officials,  biweekly EHRI data quality control reports and error files are made  available to payroll providers on the EHRI portal. This quality control  reporting is kept in the EHRI Data Warehouse indefinitely and the quality  control reports issued to providers can be reconstructed. The GHRR  directs payroll providers to monitor these reports for deviations from  previous norms and analyze them to identify potential issues in systems  that gather and send EHRI data from the agency to OPM. OPM officials  told us that they do not monitor these reports to identify and resolve  problems, and resource constraints prevent the agency from following up  with the payroll providers. While inconsistent implementation of control  activities allowed incomplete data to be accepted by the EHRI system,  this limitation in monitoring controls led these incomplete submissions to  remain undetected and unaddressed by OPM. In addition, without timely  review and correction of problems identified in these reports, OPM risks  errors compounding with each biweekly data submission, as the error  tolerance checks involve comparison of each new submission to the most  recent submission, which itself may have been incomplete. Further,  without timely identification and correction of such problems, missing data  may not be recoverable. For example, in response to the missing data  issue noted above, OPM contacted the relevant service centers to locate  the missing files. However, service centers only retain data for 18 months  from the original date of submission. If the controls were working as  designed, the service center would have been required to provide a  corrected submission before the end of this retention period, and OPM  would have reasonable assurance that the data for these pay periods  were complete.

For  example, we found that the EHRI payroll data includes records for six  entities that should not be in the system due to exemptions from OPM  reporting requirements, as shown in table 4.

As a result,  according to OPM officials, the amount of sick leave an employee used in  any given year was not accurate.

Although the EHRI payroll data was not  a part of the 2015 OPM data breach, agency officials told us that the  agency is evaluating its current security posture and making necessary  changes to protect the privacy and integrity of all the data they manage.  According to OPM officials, these plans include preparing to deploy a new  secure portal to applications and tools; improving use of encryption;  masking and redaction when appropriate and prudent; consolidating data  from multiple data sets into more secure databases; utilizing better and  more secure user management tools and audit trail logging; and providing  new forms of user authentication, among other potential security and  access measures.", "OPM officials also said they are planning to correct the issue they had  identified with the sick leave variable and that they were in the process of  testing other variables to see if they had the same problem.

Compounding these problems is OPM\u2019s failure to monitor ongoing  operations, for example, by reviewing system generated reports. Without  timely identification and correction, data quality problems will continue  undetected and remain uncorrected. While OPM officials noted their  intention to address these shortcomings, they do not have plans with  specific actions and time frames for doing so. Without a schedule  specifying when these planned changes will be made, OPM officials will  be unable to gauge progress, identify and resolve potential problems, or  determine the amount and timing of resource needs related to the desired  changes.

The results are grouped into three categories: (1) tests  for missing data, (2) tests for logical errors, and (3) tests for potentially  invalid values.  1.  Missing Data Tests  Incomplete data can limit both the ability to conduct desired analyses and  the usefulness of any analysis conducted. For example, if a large amount  of data is missing, as was the case with data missing for entire agencies  for some pay periods, it may not be possible to complete analysis of that  agency for the missing periods. If a smaller proportion of data is missing,  analysis may still be possible. However, any analysis completed using  these data will be limited in its accuracy and validity, which may increase  the risk of drawing inappropriate or invalid conclusions.", "Because the EHRI payroll data have been identified as potentially useful  for government-wide studies of telework behavior, we tested for missing  data in telework-related fields. As shown in table 6, we found data in  these fields to be missing entirely in 2011 and largely incomplete in 2012,  years for which reporting on this variable was not required by OPM. The  percentage missing is based on the number of records without values out  of all records within a fiscal year. As a result, estimates of  governmentwide telework participation, as shown in table 7, are likely to  be inaccurate for these years.  2.  Logical Error Tests  Logical testing can reveal data reliability issues among and within  individual records. For example, logical testing can assess whether there  are duplicates among records in the data system. Our electronic testing  assessed whether there were duplicate records in the EHRI payroll data.  We also looked for records with multiple payments, either from the same  agency or from different agencies, in a single pay period\u2014a form of  duplication that could also indicate problems with data reliability. As  shown in tables 8, 9, 10, and 11, we found no instances of a complete  duplicate records, few instances of EHRI IDs associated with more than  one social security number, and that generally less than 1 percent of  records were associated with multiple payments in a single pay period.", "Logical testing can also uncover data reliability issues within individual  records. As shown in table 12, we found a number of variables with  questionable values, given the values of other variables for the same  record. For example, we found instances where the amount of annual  leave used was greater than the amount available, and other instances  where the data indicate an agency contribution to Federal Employee  Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) for an employee who has not made a  contribution. In both cases, this should not be possible under typical  circumstances, and may indicate a data reliability issue.  3.  Outlier and Out of Range Tests  Tests for invalid formats and values can reveal obvious errors about data.  For example, as shown in table 13, we tested the format of the social  security numbers (SSN) in EHRI, which should all be nine digit numbers,  and found some cases where these numbers were not properly  formatted, indicating a potential data reliability issue that could prevent  analysis of individuals when attempting to match SSNs.", "We also tested the values of fields in the EHRI payroll data to determine  whether any records were outside of the expected ranges. As shown in  table 14, we found several variables where the minimum value was below  the expected possible floor or the maximum value was above the  expected ceiling. For example we found a maximum value for Student  Loan Repayments of $100,000, which is well above the expected ceiling  for such payments. We also found that the lowest minimum value for total  salary in a pay period was negative $99,140, while all salary values  should generally be positive for normal records (non \u201ccorrection\u201d records)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Standards and Methods for Data Reliability Assessment", "paragraphs": ["Data reliability assessments\u2014a process consistent with internal control  standards\u2014gather and evaluate the information needed to determine  whether data can be used to answer specific research questions. In this  context, reliability means that data are reasonably complete and accurate  to answer the intended questions that OPM, agencies, policy  organizations, and academics might have about the federal workforce.  Reliability assessments are specific to the context of the particular  characteristics of the research project and the risk associated with the  possibility of using insufficiently reliable data. Errors are considered  acceptable if the associated risk has been assessed and a conclusion  reached that the errors are not substantial enough to cause a reasonable  person, aware of the errors, to doubt a finding, conclusion, or  recommendation based on the data. To determine whether data are  sufficiently reliable for a specific research purpose, one must consider the  expected importance of the data in the final report; corroborating  evidence; level of risk of using the data; and the results of assessment  work conducted to date.", "Completeness, accuracy, and validity are all components of reliability.", "Completeness refers to the extent to which relevant records are  present and the fields in each record are populated appropriately. For  example, are the payroll records for all on-board employees at an  agency recorded for every pay period within the calendar year?", "Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reflect the actual  underlying information. For example, do the recorded hours of annual  leave in an employee\u2019s payroll record accurately reflect the number of  annual leave hours they reported in their time and attendance form?", "Validity, for the purposes of this report, refers to whether the data  actually represent what is being measured. For example, if we are  measuring the extent of overtime in the federal government and we  use a field that records a certain type of administratively  uncontrollable overtime, does that represent the extent of overtime  use or might there be other ways overtime is recorded?", "Data reliability assessments as a process include (1) reviewing existing  information about the data and conducting interviews with officials from  the entity or entities that collect the data, (2) reviewing selected system  controls, and (3) performing tests on the data, such as advanced  electronic analysis and tracing to and from source documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made  important contributions to this report: Sidney Schwartz, Director; Rebecca  Shea, Assistant Director; Russ Burnett; Steven Putansu; David Blanding,  Hiwotte Amare; Joanna Berry; Amy Bowser; Tim Carr; Melinda Cordero;  Sara Daleski; Lorraine Ettaro; Dani Greene; Donna Miller; Laura  Pacheco; and Jeffrey Schmerling."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
