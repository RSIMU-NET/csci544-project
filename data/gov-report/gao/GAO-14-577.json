Overall, the joint bases reported partially consolidating 80 percent of their installation-support functions, but the extent of consolidation varied across the bases and among the various functions. None of the joint bases have reported consolidating all functions. However, all 11 joint bases reported consolidating some portion of eight functions, such as custodial services and installation safety. The least consolidated functions were reported to be military service-specific or mission-specific, such as small-arms range management and port services. Also, joint base officials reported several challenges resulting from consolidation, such as multiple inspections and employees being potentially disadvantaged in competing for promotion opportunities due to military service-specific personnel policies. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and military service officials have not evaluated which functions are still suitable for consolidation or taken policy actions to address any challenges resulting from consolidation. Without an evaluation of the suitability of installation-support functions for consolidation and without actions to address any negative consequences that emerged from consolidation, the Department of Defense (DOD) may continue to experience challenges in its efforts to consolidate these functions.", "Note: Not all of the joint bases that GAO surveyed have small-arms range management or port services functions.", "Joint base officials reported that consolidation of support functions has resulted in some progress toward achieving the goals of joint basing (achieving efficiencies and cost savings), by reducing redundant positions and finding contracting efficiencies. However, as GAO reported in November 2012, DOD does not have a method to collect cost savings information achieved specifically from joint basing. Thus, GAO recommended that DOD develop a plan for doing so. DOD disagreed and has not yet taken action. GAO continues to believe this recommendation has merit and should be addressed. Also, officials said they are uncertain of the extent to which the goals of joint basing are still appropriate, and to what extent they are required to take actions to pursue them. OSD has not collaborated with the military services to evaluate whether the goals of joint basing remain appropriate and has not provided direction to the joint bases on future priorities. Without a collaborative evaluation of the joint basing program by OSD and military service officials to determine if the goals remain appropriate\u2014and without additional direction to help meet reporting requirements\u2014it will be difficult for DOD to determine the extent to which the joint basing initiative is achieving its intended goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing DOD to evaluate joint basing goals, provide direction on requirements to meet the goals, and determine next steps for joint basing.

In  DOD\u2019s justification for its recommendation to the BRAC Commission, the  Secretary of Defense noted, among other things, that because the  installations either shared a common boundary or were in proximity to at  least one other installation and performed common support functions,  there was a significant opportunity to reduce duplication of similar support  services, which could produce savings. DOD projected savings in various  areas, such as by paring unnecessary management personnel, achieving  greater efficiencies through economies of scale, and consolidating and  optimizing existing and future service contract requirements.

The 2005 BRAC recommendation on joint basing established  which military bases would receive installation-management functions  from one or more other bases in lieu of each base providing the same  services. On the basis of these realignments, the Office of the Secretary  of Defense (OSD) designated the military service responsible for  delivering installation support at each joint base as the lead service, and  in 2008 OSD issued further guidance for joint basing implementation.According to this guidance, the lead service is referred to as the  supporting component and the military services receiving installation  support are referred to as the supported components.", "GAO, Defense Infrastructure: DOD Needs to Periodically Review Support Standards and  Costs at Joint Bases and Better Inform Congress of Facility Sustainment Funding Uses,  GAO-09-336 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 30, 2009). basing was a relatively new initiative and implementation issues were still  being resolved.

During this time, we reported that DOD  faced challenges in three areas: (1) reducing excess and obsolete  infrastructure, (2) sustaining facilities, and (3) achieving cost savings and  efficiencies in base-support services. After DOD made significant  progress in addressing the issues regarding planning and funding to  sustain facilities, in 2011 we narrowed this high-risk area to focus on the  two remaining issues. DOD has cited its joint basing initiative as the  mechanism through which it could achieve greater economies of scale  and savings by consolidating and eliminating duplicative installation- support services.

Our analysis showed that  the joint bases reported that they have at least partially consolidated 350  (about 80 percent) of the 438 installation-support functional areas for  which the joint base commander had some responsibility. About 4 percent  of the installation-support functions that are included in the 80 percent  were consolidated prior to joint basing via agreements between the  military services.

Also, joint base  officials stated that limited opportunities exist to consolidate workforces  because of the differences in the original types of workforces\u2014military,  civilian, and contractor\u2014that were in place prior to joint basing.

Our analysis of  survey results and other supporting documentation, as illustrated in figure  4, showed that installation-support functions reported to be consolidated  at the fewest joint bases tended to have military service-specific or  mission-specific characteristics. According to officials, these functions  offered limited opportunities to consolidate because they were unique to  the missions of the individual military services. In most instances, these  functions either did not transfer to the supporting component as part of  joint basing because the function was considered to be mission-related  rather than part of installation support or did not have a counterpart in the  other military service. For example:", "Port services. We found that one, or 25 percent, of the four joint bases  that have a port and included port services as part of the joint base  commander\u2019s responsibility had reported consolidating this function.  The one base that did consolidate was a location where the Navy was  a supported component and did not have an operational mission. The  three bases that did not consolidate were locations where there was  only one service with the function (so there was not a need to  consolidate).", "Small-arms range management. We found that three, or 38 percent,  of the eight joint bases where the joint base commander had  responsibility for small-arms range management had reported  consolidating this function. For all three of the joint bases that had  consolidated this function, this function tended to be installation  support rather than directly tied to a mission requirement. Officials for  the other five joint bases that did not consolidate this function reported  that they had not done so because the Army was exempt at four of  the bases from consolidating this function and there was only one  service with this function at the other base (so there was not a need to  consolidate).", "Airfield operations. We found that four, or 44 percent, of the nine joint  bases where the joint base commander had some responsibility for  airfield operations had reported consolidating this function. The Air  Force was the supporting component for three of the joint bases while  the Navy was supporting for the other one. Officials for the other five  joint bases reported that they had not consolidated this function  because the Air Force had variances to consolidating the function at  two of the bases and there was only one service with this function at  the other three bases (so there was not a need to consolidate).", "Support functions managed by military service headquarters. Our  analyses of survey results and other supporting documentation found  some functions were limited in the amount of overlapping activities that  could be consolidated because the functions remained largely managed  by a military service headquarters, or officials executing these functions  were required to follow specific military service requirements or  procedures. In our survey, 45 percent of 438 joint base officials reported  that their consolidation efforts had been hindered by military service- specific requirements, practices, or policies. For example:  Information technology system management. Joint base officials  reported that opportunities to merge or consolidate information  technology systems were limited since the military services operate  separate information technology systems with distinct email and  operational requirements, as well as maintain service-specific  databases. According to our analysis, 34 percent of 438 functional  area respondents stated that they had not merged or consolidated  information technology systems. DOD has two department-wide  initiatives underway to standardize some information technology and  services, called the Joint Information Environment and Enterprise  Email service. As DOD implements these initiatives, opportunities  for further consolidation may emerge.", "Advisory services. Joint base officials reported that Equal Opportunity  Employment services offered limited opportunities for consolidation  beyond the intake of complaints. According to officials whom we  interviewed, equal opportunity complaints are filed against specific  military department Secretaries, and the formal grievance of any  complaint must follow the procedures of the particular military  department where the individual filing the complaint either works or  serves. For instance, these officials told us that an employee of the  supported component, such as a service member or civilian (a  position that did not transfer to the supporting component as part of  the installation-support workforce), would submit a complaint through  the local equal opportunity office, which is part of the supporting  component. However, these officials also indicated that the grievance  would then transfer back to the supported component since it must  follow that service\u2019s procedures. Therefore, in the officials\u2019 opinions,  responsibility for equal opportunity may not have been suitable for  transfer in joint basing.", "Legal support services. Joint base officials indicated that the level of  consolidation for this installation-support function is very limited, even  though nine of the 11 joint bases reported consolidating some portion  of the function. Joint base officials reported that each service must  adhere to the Uniform Code of Military Justice for courts-martial and  nonjudicial punishment, but the ways in which each service carries out  military justice are substantially different. For example, according to  these officials, it would be very difficult for Air Force personnel to  conduct an Army court-martial or nonjudicial punishment and vice  versa. As a result, in the opinion of these officials, this aspect of the  legal support services cannot be further consolidated at the joint  bases.", "Officials from Joint Region Marianas were not part of our survey, but we  interviewed them to discuss their efforts to consolidate support services.  Officials indicated that some functions were easier to consolidate than  others, and they stated that they have made some progress. However,  the officials reported that at times conflicting service practices have also  hindered their efforts. For example, the officials stated that they have not  been able to fully consolidate the chaplain services function because of  differences in how religious programs are managed by the Navy and Air  Force. The Navy requires that tithes and offerings be sent to charitable  organizations, whereas the Air Force allows tithes and offerings to be  reinvested in chapel facilities.", "Our survey also showed that 59 of 438 respondents (13 percent)\u2014in  comments about functions for which the joint base commander had some  responsibility\u2014reported that there were additional opportunities to  consolidate installation-support functions that have not been pursued.  The respondents who reported additional opportunities to consolidate  provided a varied range of response details. Of those respondents who  provided detailed responses, we found the following examples. Officials  from one joint base stated that additional consolidation could occur in the  pest-control function by expanding in-house capabilities and eliminating  contract services, but did not elaborate as to why further consolidation  had not been pursued at the time of the survey. In another example,  officials from a different joint base stated that additional consolidation  could occur in the pavement-clearance function by analyzing the function  and selecting the most cost-effective method between in-house and  contract work, as it would allow for completely centralized management of  resources. Furthermore, we asked survey respondents if they had any  additional comments pertaining to the consolidation of their installation- support functions. Our survey results showed that 70 out of 438  respondents (16 percent) provided comments. Generally, the comments  mirrored the issues raised throughout this report. For example, some  reported that certain support functions offered limited opportunities for  consolidation because of geography and others cited differences in  military service policies and procedures that hindered consolidation  efforts.", "We also found that, according to survey responses, in some instances  workforces used by the military services to provide installation-support  services prior to joint basing limited opportunities to consolidate some  installation-support functions. The military services can differ in which  workforce\u2014military, civilian, or contractor\u2014they employ to provide  installation support. In our survey, we asked to what extent, if any,  differences in installation-support workforces caused hindrances to  consolidation. In our survey results, 182 of 438 respondents  (approximately 42 percent) reported that differences in workforces used  by the individual military services hindered their ability to consolidate  installation-support functions. Figure 5 illustrates the percent of functions  in which officials reported hindrances in consolidating due to differences  in workforces.", "The seven joint bases with the highest percent of functions reporting  significant or moderate consolidation hindrances because of differences  in workforces are listed in table 3.", "In interviews and written responses to our survey, Air Force officials  stated that they may use a mix of military and civilian personnel to provide  a specific installation-support function, whereas the Army may have  outsourced the provision of the same support function to contractors.  Also, we found in interviews and in written responses to our survey that  the Navy at times, used a regionalized civilian workforce to provide some  installation-support services for stand-alone Navy bases in the region. In  the survey\u2019s written responses, we also found examples in which  respondents stated that some consolidation efforts were hindered by the  types of workforces used. For example,", "Officials at Air Force-led Joint Base Charleston reported that  consolidation efforts have been limited by personnel shortfalls in the  procurement services function. Prior to joint basing, the Navy provided  much of the procurement services for Naval Weapons Station  Charleston, through regional service centers rather than at the  installation. For this reason, according to these officials, no local  civilian workforce transferred to the Air Force. The joint base received  approval to hire more Air Force civilians to carry out the function.  However, many of the approved positions were eventually cut in 2012  as part of the military departments\u2019 response to the DOD effort to cap  the number of civilian positions department-wide.", "Officials at Air Force-led Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson reported  that they have not been able to consolidate the facility-sustainment  function because of how the Army and Air Force provided installation  support prior to joint basing. The Army outsourced delivery of this  function to contractors at Fort Richardson, whereas the Air Force  provided this function in-house at Elmendorf Air Force Base.  According to the officials, the Air Force will likely maintain the  contracts for the Richardson side of the base because of insufficient  military and civilian manpower available to insource the function.  These officials reported that, at the same time, the Air Force will  continue to provide the function in-house for the Elmendorf side of the  base as there is currently no authorization to conduct public-private  competitions, which are required before contracting out for functions  currently performed by DOD civilians.", "Officials at Air Force-led Joint Base Langley-Eustis reported that they  had not been able to consolidate the utilities function because of  privatization of some support services. The Army privatized water,  wastewater, electricity, and natural gas on the Fort Eustis side of the  base. These officials stated that because of privatization, when  responsibility for the utilities function transferred to the joint base, the  joint base officials could not consolidate the Fort Eustis side with the  in-house provision of utility services that occurred on the Langley Air  Force Base side of the base.", "In our survey, we also asked joint base officials about other hindrances to  consolidation. Our content analysis of survey data showed that the most- often cited hindrance was geography, with 111 out of 438 respondents  (25 percent) citing geography as a hindrance. The five joint bases with  the highest percent of functions in which officials that cited geography as  a hindrance are listed in table 4.", "According to respondents from Joint Base Langley-Eustis, opportunities  to consolidate support functions, such as information technology services  management, real property management and engineering services  functions are limited because of the geographical separation between  Langley Air Force Base and Fort Eustis\u2014approximately 18 miles. In  addition, some bases that may share some common fence line can also  be hindered by geography. For example, officials at Joint Base Lewis- McChord stated that Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base entrances  are separated by about 5 miles of interstate highway. Having to navigate  the interstate to travel between the two entrances can be a problem  because of traffic according to officials at both locations. The Army has  proposed constructing a gate on the joint base between the two locations,  but has not completed this action. In addition, McChord Airfield is  separated from the rest of the joint base by a public road, making it  necessary to clear security a second time when traveling from the base to  the airfield.", "Although cited to a much lesser extent than geography, 28 of the 438  respondents reported that personnel shortages (6 percent) and 19 of the  438 respondents reported budget or funding limitations (4 percent)  hindered consolidation efforts. For example, officials from Joint Base  Charleston reported that the base does not have enough personnel to  adequately provide services in the pest-control function, and that a  workforce study is needed to determine the appropriate size of the  function. In another example, officials from Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst reported that current fiscal limitations as well as a hiring freeze  have, in part, hindered the base\u2019s ability to consolidate the real property  management and engineering services function.", "OSD officials stated that there is currently not a process to evaluate  installation-support functions on a regular basis (annually or otherwise)  and that they have not systematically identified common limitations to  consolidation and what actions, if any, can be taken to address such  limitations. We found DOD has eliminated\u2014on a case-by-case basis\u2014 three installation-support functions from consolidation from the original list  of 47, but has not similarly comprehensively evaluated whether the  remaining functions are still suitable for consolidation. As noted above,  joint base officials have identified limited opportunities to consolidate  some areas of installation support. Furthermore, DOD has not  systematically identified how consolidation can be limited by, for example,  different types of workforces used to provide installation-support services  or geography, and what actions, if any, could potentially help facilitate  consolidation in these situations or any others that may be identified. Our  prior work on federal agency consolidation efforts found that consolidation  initiatives can be immensely complex, politically charged, and costly and  are not quick, easy, or automatic ways of producing desired change. In  addition, key federal practices for consolidation state that federal  agencies need to plan to evaluate and monitor efforts to identify areas for  improvement. Further, reporting on consolidation activities can help key  decision makers within the agencies to obtain feedback for improving   OSD and military service  both policy and operational effectiveness.officials discussed that their approach to date has been to give the  program time to mature but said they now believe a review would be  beneficial because some functions may not easily be consolidated and  there may be common limitations to consolidation that can be addressed  through policy improvements. However, they did not elaborate as to when  they would conduct such a review or provide specifics on how they  planned to do so.

For example:", "Multiple inspections. Officials whom we interviewed as well as those  who provided written survey responses reported that some functions  were subject to multiple inspections. For example, officials at Navy-led  Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam reported that Air Force officials  continue to inspect emergency management exercises although the  Navy, as the lead component, is responsible for emergency  management on the base and carries out similar inspections. In  addition, officials at Army-led Joint Base Lewis-McChord reported  confusion among Air Force military units about whether they had to  follow Air Force or Army environmental requirements, practices, and  policies while conducting inspections. Furthermore, officials whom we  interviewed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord stated that both the Army  and the Air Force are inspecting the joint base\u2019s child development  centers, though the Army, as the lead component, is responsible for  managing the centers, including inspections. However, Air Force  officials stated they are also conducting their own inspections  because of their concern that the centers meet Air Force standards of  service for providing child care, even though joint bases have agreed  to provide a common level of service for installation-support  functions.", "Multiple Data Requirements. Officials at Air Force-led Joint Base  Langley-Eustis reported that staff from the physical-security function  must use two distinct systems for processing personnel-security  investigations\u2014one for Army personnel and one for Air Force  personnel\u2014because of differences in the systems. In another  example, Army-led Joint Base Lewis-McChord reported that the lack  of transferring personnel files locally between the Army and Air Force  has caused the Army to rebuild employee files and submit criminal  background checks more than once for staff in the children and youth- services function, potentially wasting funds by recreating what already  exists.", "Our analysis of interview information found instances in which  respondents stated that challenges resulting from consolidation also  resulted in inequities. For example:", "Limited promotion opportunities. According to joint base officials, in  some instances the transfer of civilian personnel from one military  service to another may have created inequities, in that civilians  transferring from another military department may have lost some  benefits of seniority, which may have disadvantaged them in  competing for promotion opportunities. For example, former Army  civilian employees at the Air Force-led Joint Base San Antonio  reported limited career opportunities because their total service time  as DOD employees was not recognized by the Air Force, and their job  classifications, in some cases, were downgraded when their positions  were transferred to the joint base. The former Army employees  reported that the military departments do not credit years of  employment from another department. As a result, they cannot  compete for promotions or other Air Force positions that may require  a minimum number of years of service as eligibility criteria for  promotion. In addition, joint base officials whom we interviewed  commented that they believe military service practices of preferentially  hiring internal applicants in response to DOD\u2019s civilian hiring freeze  have prevented these former Army employees from qualifying or  being competitive for vacant Army positions because they are now Air  Force employees.", "Limited training opportunities. According to joint base officials,  consolidation has resulted in differences in training for some  installation-support personnel. For example, Air Force officials at the  Army-led Joint Base Lewis-McChord reported that consolidation has  eliminated some training opportunities for uniformed airmen, and  expressed concern that airmen at Joint Base Lewis-McChord are not  receiving training comparable to that which they would receive if they  were stationed at a stand-alone Air Force installation. This situation  is primarily because of the consolidation of installation-support  functions under Army processes\u2014which are largely civilian and  contractor driven\u2014whereas at a stand-alone Air Force base many  installation-support functions are performed by airmen.", "We found that neither OSD nor the military services have addressed  these consolidation challenges that may have resulted in inefficiencies  and inequities. Specifically, feedback on inefficiencies and inequities have  not been incorporated into policy improvements, such as additional  guidance, to help the joint bases resolve confusion about which service- specific guidance should be followed to avoid challenges such as multiple  inspections, multiple data requirements, and concerns about limited  promotion and training opportunities. Our survey results identified that  about 59 percent of respondents stated that they did not think additional  guidance from OSD or the military services would improve the level of  consolidation of their installation-support functions. However, officials  from the joint bases, military service headquarters, and OSD stated in  interviews that additional guidance is necessary to address consolidation  challenges.", "OSD and military service officials stated that they have not  comprehensively identified the extent to which the joint bases have  consolidated installation-support functions, including any common  challenges associated with consolidation that may have resulted in  negative consequences as described above. OSD and military service  officials stated that their approach to date has been to give the program  time to mature but said they now believe policy actions may be needed to  help address challenges resulting from consolidation. Without having  comprehensively identified any common challenges associated with  consolidation, OSD is unlikely to develop policy solutions, such as  guidance, to assist the joint bases in addressing them. In one instance in  which joint base officials identified a common challenge associated with  consolidation\u2014multiple inspections related to installation support\u2014OSD  officials acknowledged the issue and stated that they were taking action  to address it. Joint base officials stated in interviews that they have raised  concerns at OSD\u2019s annual joint base program-management meetings  about which service-specific guidance to follow when conducting  inspections of installation-support functions on joint bases. OSD officials  told us that while a policy solution is not currently available to resolve this  issue, they are working to update a DOD instruction for inspections that  will address the issue at joint bases. However, in the absence of policy  solutions, such as additional guidance to mitigate other common  challenges resulting from consolidation efforts, including multiple data  requirements for installation-support functions and concerns about limited  promotion and training opportunities for installation-support staff, joint  bases may be unable to avoid or reduce any inefficiencies and inequities  resulting from consolidating installation-support functions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Joint Basing Has Produced Some Benefits, but Officials Reported They Are Unable to Achieve Greater Efficiencies and Potential Cost Savings without Additional Direction", "paragraphs": ["results of their collaborative efforts.

In another example, officials from Joint Base Anacostia- Bolling reported that base was able to reduce two positions in the  physical security function.

They said that at Fort Eustis the Army had transitioned almost entirely to  private contracts for installation support, and had eliminated most of its  related civilian workforce. Therefore, in their view, there were no  opportunities to reduce redundant funded positions.

In a third example,  officials from Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall reported that  consolidation of the physical security function helped increase  awareness of activities affecting the base\u2019s control point because of  access and information that was not previously available to the  individual bases prior to joint basing.", "Joint base officials whom we interviewed also reported some benefits  from consolidating installation-support functions and additional benefits  from working closely with other military services.

The officials  reaffirmed they were taking this approach during the course of our review.  According to the Secretary of Defense\u2019s justification for joint basing  reproduced in the 2005 BRAC Commission Report, joint basing would  allow DOD to take advantage of opportunities to reduce duplication of  efforts. DOD stated that the resulting reduction of overall manpower and  facilities requirements would help generate savings by paring  unnecessary management personnel and achieving greater efficiencies  through economies of scale. However, as we found in prior work, OSD  did not have a developed method for accurately collecting information on  costs, savings, and efficiencies achieved specifically from joint basing,  and had not developed a plan to guide joint bases in achieving cost  savings and efficiencies. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the  progress that joint bases have made in achieving the goals for joint  basing.", "When asked about any challenges associated with consolidation of  installation-support functions, some survey respondents reported that  consolidation increased the need for additional resources in their  functional area. For example, Joint Base Charleston officials reported that  the size of the joint base and the diversity of missions have greatly  increased the need for additional resources for restoration and  modernization of facilities and has also resulted in decreased customer  satisfaction. In another example, Joint Base Little Creek-Fort Story  officials reported that an increase of unaccompanied housing facilities  was not met with a staff increase to help support the additional facilities.  Also, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam officials reported that the  requirements for the physical security function increased following the  joint base\u2019s establishment, but no additional personnel were gained, thus  increasing staff workload. However, OSD officials whom we interviewed  told us respondents may have attributed the consolidation of functions as  driving an increased need for resources, when other factors may have  been the reason. For instance, the OSD officials stated that higher  performance standards for installation support at joint bases may have  caused an increase in workload. Although OSD has provided joint bases  with a memo that acknowledges a reduced funding environment and  encourages Joint Base Commanders to ensure that mission partners  continue to collaboratively determine priorities for applying resources,  OSD officials told us that they have not modified the goals for the joint  base program in light of the current fiscal environment. They stated that  joint bases have been designed to look for efficiencies and cost savings  in providing installation support, and are therefore better positioned than  other installations to withstand budget cuts and operate with lower  budgeted resources.", "Our survey data showed that some progress had been made in the joint  bases\u2019 ability to reduce redundant funded positions; reduce redundant  contracts or find contract efficiencies; and merge or consolidate  redundant procedures to gain efficiencies and produce cost savings.  According to joint base and military service officials whom we interviewed,  the joint bases would benefit from more direction on how to pursue  initiatives in a systematic way to achieve these goals or to report on the  achievement of these goals. The officials said OSD has left it up to  individual joint base leadership to determine how to manage and operate  the joint bases, including the extent to which they pursue efficiencies. As  a result, joint base and military service headquarters officials whom we  interviewed stated that in an environment when priority is placed on  getting the mission done with fewer resources, the investment of  resources to pursue initiatives or conduct studies to determine the  feasibility of efforts to cut redundancies and gain efficiencies has not  always been a priority. The officials said that without more direction, the  extent to which joint basing commanders pursued these types of  initiatives was left to their discretion. Furthermore, the officials noted the  degree to which joint bases looked for opportunities to gain efficiencies  and cost savings depended on the commitment of the officials involved as  well as the level of support and commitment they received from their  service headquarters, rather than guided by overarching goals, plans,  milestones, and reporting requirements.", "OSD officials stated that they had not conducted a mid-program review  for joint basing and believe this type of review is a good management  practice and may be beneficial at this stage in the joint basing program, in  part because of concerns about the lack of understanding regarding the  goals for the program as well as direction on how to achieve such goals.

DOD has eliminated some functions from  consolidation on a case-by-case basis, but has not comprehensively  reviewed the entire list of functions to determine whether additional  functions should be removed from consolidation. Moreover, joint base  officials have reported challenges from consolidation of installation- support functions, such as multiple inspections and limited civilian  personnel promotion opportunities. OSD has not taken steps to address  the challenges that, according to joint base officials, have resulted in  inefficiencies and inequities.

The joint base officials,  in their responses to survey questions and during interviews, did not  report significant achievements in reaching these goals. DOD has data  that indicate the joint bases are obligating less funding than they would  have obligated as stand-alone bases, but it is not clear to what extent  these savings are attributable to the consolidation of installation support  functions. Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent savings and  efficiencies are still the goals of this program. Joint base officials indicated  that they are unclear to what extent these goals are still appropriate and  to what extent they are required to pursue additional opportunities to meet  these goals. DOD has not collaborated with the military services to  reevaluate whether the goals of joint basing are still appropriate or  provided direction to the joint bases for meeting program goals, including  milestones and reporting requirements for the achievement of these  goals. As a result, joint base commanders are responsible for determining  to what extent they will pursue initiatives to reduce redundancy and  achieve potential cost savings or efficiencies, and the extent to which  such initiatives have been pursued varies by joint base. Key practices  from efficiency initiatives state that a primary approach an agency can  take to determine whether a program is effectively and efficiently  achieving its goals is to periodically reexamine it.

DOD stated that it believes that although joint  bases involve added complexities from crossing traditional service lines,  they are ultimately service-run bases similar to all other installations.  Additionally, DOD noted that the military departments already have the  responsibility, as well as sufficient authority and incentives, to deliver  effective and efficient installation support across all their installations,  including joint bases. We believe that the report reflects an understanding  that the joint base management structure consists of shared responsibility  and authority between OSD and the military departments to manage the  joint base program. This point is highlighted by the fact that we designed  our audit work, including our survey and interviews, to focus on the  perspectives of joint base and military service officials. Nonetheless, the  Joint Basing Implementation Guidance assigns responsibilities to the  Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions, Technology, and Logistics to  establish overarching guidance, procedures, and policy, in coordination  with appropriate OSD organizations, and to mediate any support  agreement disputes between the components that are not resolved by the  Joint Management Oversight Structure.  We also cited an example in  the report where OSD indicated that it was working to issue policy to  resolve military service inconsistencies, identifying that OSD is providing  such oversight. Furthermore, DOD provided an example of OSD\u2019s  involvement in the management and oversight of the joint bases in its  written comments on the report, citing a Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Installation and Environment policy memo on the subject of  joint bases and the supply, storage, and distribution of munitions. As a  result, we continue to view the management of the joint bases as a  shared responsibility between OSD and the services, and believe the  recommendations directed to both are appropriate.", "DOD concurred with the first recommendation to evaluate the 44  installation-support functions identified in DOD\u2019s guidance for joint base  implementation to determine which functions are still suitable for  consolidation, and to subsequently identify and make any changes that  are appropriate to address limitations, such as workforce policies and  geography, reported by the joint bases in consolidating the support  functions. DOD also stated that it had already removed some installation- support functions from joint basing because they were not compelled for  inclusion as part of the BRAC recommendation, and otherwise did not  offer opportunities for savings or consolidation. We acknowledge in the  report that OSD has reviewed individual installation-support functions on  a case-by-case basis, and has removed three from the original list of 47  functions to be consolidated. However, during the course of our review,  and as stated in the report, OSD officials told us that there was no  process in place to evaluate the remaining 44 installation-support  functions on a regular basis. We discussed this with military service and  OSD officials in early April 2014. In its letter, DOD stated that in April  2014, the Senior Joint Base Working Group principals tasked their staffs  to identify which installation support functions and performance standards  were not providing value to the joint bases\u2019 various military missions, and  to explore whether these functions and standards should continue to be  included in joint basing. DOD did not provide time frames for completing  such actions. If implemented as intended, these actions should meet the  intent of the recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with the second recommendation to take policy  actions, as appropriate, such as issuing additional guidance, to address  challenges resulting in inefficiencies and inequities in consolidating  installation-support functions. DOD stated that it is mindful of challenges  in implementing and operating joint bases, and agreed that policy actions  can address some challenges. However, DOD stated that it does not  agree that these challenges require OSD-level policies, citing instead the  existing responsibilities and authorities already assigned to the military  departments and the Joint Management Oversight Structure. We  recognize the responsibilities and authorities of the military departments.  Accordingly, the recommendation is for OSD, in coordination with the  military services and joint bases, to take policy actions to help address  any challenges resulting in efficiencies and inequities from consolidation  of installation-support functions at the joint bases. As stated in the report,  and noted above, the Joint Basing Implementation Guidance assigns  responsibilities to OSD to mediate any support agreement disputes  between the components that are not resolved by the Joint Management  Oversight Structure. We also describe the responses of joint base officials  to our survey questions about any need for additional guidance from OSD  and the military services, as well as the interview statements from joint  base, military service headquarters, and OSD officials, who all stated that  there is a need for such guidance. The report also includes an example of  a challenge that required action from OSD to help resolve: OSD issued  guidance in May 2014 that was based on a concern raised more than 2  years earlier in February 2012 to resolve contradictions in military service- level guidance, which had created certain duplicative service-level  inspections on joint bases. DOD also stated in its letter that its Joint  Management Oversight Structure is the process by which the military  departments can formally request OSD assistance to change joint or  DOD policies. However, joint base officials expressed frustration about  the lack of progress and slowness of OSD and the Joint Management  Oversight Structure process to address challenges resulting from  consolidation, particularly regarding issues where the military  departments are unable to identify solutions on their own. Further, some  survey respondents and officials we interviewed at the joint bases and  military service headquarters stated that they wanted additional guidance  from OSD or the military services, or both, to resolve contradictions  between service-level policy where needed or, in some cases, to provide  clearer direction. As a result, we continue to believe that the  recommendation is valid and should be implemented.", "DOD did not concur with the third recommendation that OSD, in  collaboration with the military services, evaluate the purpose of the  program and determine whether DOD\u2019s current goals of achieving greater  efficiencies and generating cost savings for the joint basing program, as  stated in the 2005 BRAC Commission recommendation, are still  appropriate or should be revised, and to communicate these goals to the  military services and joint bases and then to adjust program activities  accordingly. DOD stated in its comments that the goal of joint basing  remains to increase the efficiency of delivering installation support at the  12 joint bases as described in the BRAC Commission\u2019s recommendation  number 146. However, as noted in the report, OSD has not evaluated the  joint basing program to determine this or whether the goals are  appropriate for the program today and looking forward.", "Further, DOD stated in its written comments that the 12 joint bases have  generated savings. Specifically, DOD stated that the joint bases had  obligated $255 million less in fiscal year 2012 compared to what these  previously stand-alone bases would have obligated, and did so with 1,600  fewer personnel. While we agree that DOD\u2019s estimates show that the joint  bases are obligating less, these reductions in obligations cannot be  attributed solely to the consolidation of installation-support functions at  the joint bases, as OSD acknowledges. We discussed these estimates  with OSD officials in July 2014 after we received their agency comments  on a draft of this report where these numbers were included. OSD  officials explained that their methodology for calculating savings from joint  bases consists of comparing the joint bases\u2019 current fiscal year  obligations with a baseline amount\u2014the cost to provide installation  support at the 26 previously stand-alone installations that constitute the  joint bases\u2014which is updated every fiscal year to reflect changes in  mission requirements and inflation, among other factors. However, this  approach is unable to distinguish savings from efficiencies obtained  through consolidation of installation-support services at the joint bases or  from other factors that also contributed to lower obligations. For instance,  OSD officials said fiscal year 2012 savings were also attributable to  factors such as the military departments\u2019 response to DOD\u2019s efforts to cap  the number of civilian positions. In addition, DOD stated in its letter that  the joint bases\u2019 fiscal year 2013 obligations were $830 million less than if  they were still separate installations. DOD stated that this was a  combination of savings and reduced expenditures caused by the Budget  Control Act and fiscal year 2013\u2019s sequestration actions, as well as from  joint basing. However, OSD cannot determine how much of the $830  million in reduced obligations in fiscal year 2013 is attributable to budget  cuts or efficiencies gained through the consolidation of installation support  functions at the joint bases. Further, OSD cannot explain how  sequestration-driven budget cuts have led to joint basing efficiencies.", "Also, as stated in the report, joint base officials told us they are unclear to  what extent achieving greater efficiencies and cost savings are still  appropriate for the goals of joint basing, and to what extent they are  required to pursue additional opportunities beyond the consolidation of  installation-support functions in the joint base memorandums of  agreement to achieve these goals. Joint base and military service  headquarters officials said that in an environment when priority is placed  on getting the mission done with fewer resources, the investment of  resources to pursue initiatives or conduct studies to determine the  feasibility of efforts to cut redundancies and gain efficiencies has not  always been a priority. We believe that the continued confusion at the  joint bases over the goals of the program, as well as cost savings  estimates that reflect uncertainty as to the extent consolidation of  installation-support functions drives savings as compared to simply  cutting the budget, indicate a continuing need to review the goals of the  program and communicate them to the military services and joint bases,  as recommended.", "DOD did not concur with the fourth recommendation that OSD, in  collaboration with the military services, provide direction to joint bases on  their requirements for meeting the joint base program\u2019s goals and work  with the military services to determine reporting requirements and  milestones to be put in place to increase support and commitment for the  program\u2019s goals. In its comments, DOD stated that the joint bases have  been fully operational since October 2010 and have proven they can  deliver measurable and tangible savings across the installation-support  portfolio. As such, DOD stated that it does not believe OSD should  establish program milestones. However, DOD\u2019s assertion that the joint  bases have proven they can deliver tangible savings is based on a  method of calculating savings that cannot distinguish savings attributable  to consolidation of installation-support functions at the joint bases from  savings attributable to other factors, including sequestration-driven  budget cuts, as noted above.", "DOD further stated that it does not agree OSD should provide additional  direction towards meeting the program\u2019s goals because the joint base  commanders and military departments are in the best position to balance  efficiency with effectiveness and that directing additional consolidations  circumvents their ability to make these decisions. In addition, DOD stated  that establishing milestones implies joint bases are still in an  implementation phase, and noted that OSD has transitioned from  managing joint base implementation to a steady-state oversight role.", "The report does not call for OSD to make additional consolidations;  rather, the recommendation states that OSD, in collaboration with the  military services, should provide additional direction to the joint bases on  how to achieve the goals of the program. Moreover, we agree that the  military services are in the best position to balance efficiency with  effectiveness when managing and operating installations, which is one  reason we sent our survey to the joint bases to solicit their views.  However, as stated in the report and noted above, joint base and military  service headquarters officials told us that in an environment when priority  is placed on getting the mission done with fewer resources, the  investment of resources to pursue initiatives or conduct studies to  determine the feasibility of efforts to cut redundancies and gain  efficiencies has not always been a priority. As such, the officials indicated  that the degree to which joint bases looked for opportunities to gain  efficiencies and cost savings depended on the commitment of the officials  involved as well as the level of support and commitment they received  from their service headquarters, because overarching goals, plans,  milestones, and reporting requirements have not been established.", "Without OSD establishing goals and milestones to be achieved across  the joint bases, there is a risk that emphasis or priority will not be given to  this pursuit.", "Furthermore, DOD stated that it advocates treating joint bases no  differently than other Army, Navy, and Air Force installations, and noted  the only unique quality of joint bases is the sizeable joint presence they  support. Although DOD indicated that joint bases are similar to all other  installations, as stated in the report, 64 percent of survey respondents  reported challenges stemming from consolidation of installation-support  functions\u2014consolidations unlikely to occur on stand-alone installations.  Moreover, joint bases are required to meet certain different installation- support standards that are, at times, higher than those on a stand-alone  installation. Meeting these standards can require additional resources or  prioritization that other installations may not face. DOD did not explain  how joint bases can have support standards and challenges that are  unique to joint basing while still being considered the same as all other  installations. Given (1) that joint bases face unique challenges, and (2)  that joint base and military service officials said it is unclear as to the  extent initial joint basing goals are still appropriate as well as the extent  they are required to pursue cost savings and efficiencies, additional  direction would help joint bases better understand the current and  ongoing goals of joint basing. Therefore, we believe the recommendation  is still warranted.", "For the reasons cited above, we continue to believe that OSD should  collaborate with the military services, especially in light of OSD\u2019s  assertions that joint bases have generated savings, to (1) evaluate the  purpose of the program and determine whether the current goals, as  stated in the 2005 BRAC Commission recommendation, are still  appropriate; (2) communicate the goals to the military services and joint  bases, and then adjust program activities accordingly; (3) provide  direction to the joint bases on requirements for meeting program goals,  including reporting requirements and milestones; and (4) determine any  next steps for joint basing, including whether to expand it to other  installations. If joint basing may result in savings, particularly at the level  that OSD asserts, then DOD may want to consider expanding joint basing  to other installations. Further, key change management practices state  that it is essential that top government and agency leaders are committed  to consolidation and play a lead role in executing it by setting the  direction, pace, and tone as well as providing a clear and consistent  rationale for doing so. These practices also state that establishing  implementation goals and milestone dates, and tracking progress toward  those goals, helps agency officials pinpoint performance shortfalls and  suggest midcourse corrections, including any needed adjustments to the  organization\u2019s future goals and milestones. Consequently, and given  DOD\u2019s disagreement with our recommendations that OSD collaborate  with the military services and joint bases to evaluate the purpose of the  program and determine whether DOD\u2019s current goals of achieving greater  efficiencies and generating cost savings for the joint basing program are  still appropriate and subsequently provide direction to joint bases on their  requirements for meeting the joint base program\u2019s goals, we have added  a matter for congressional consideration to this report. Our intent is to  help ensure DOD\u2019s approach to joint basing achieves the goals as  outlined by DOD in its justification for the 2005 BRAC recommendation  and leverages additional opportunities to reduce duplication of effort that  could in turn generate cost savings and increase efficiencies.", "We will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the  Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force,  and Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Office of Management  and Budget; and appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the  report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-4523 or leporeb@gao.gov.

We  selected these bases to ensure representation from each of the military  services, and to include bases that share and do not share a physical  boundary. Information collected during these site visits provided insight  about initiatives undertaken and outcomes experienced at these  locations. We also obtained and analyzed documents and conducted  interviews, as described later in this section. Furthermore, we conducted  a web-based survey of 11 of the 12 joint bases. Our web-based survey  did not include Joint Region Marianas because it is a joint region rather  than a joint base, and is subject to different expectations for the  consolidation of installation-support, but we interviewed officials from  Joint Region Marianas. Those surveyed at the 11 joint bases included  representatives affiliated with 462 installation-support functional areas (42  each at each of the joint bases) as well as the 11 Joint Base  Commanders (or their designated representative), and we obtained a  response rate of 100 percent.", "To conduct our web-based survey, we sent to each joint base the  electronic links to 43 questionnaires, one questionnaire for each of the 42  installation-support functions identified for consolidation per the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Joint Base Implementation Guidance  and one questionnaire asking a single open-ended question to capture  additional comments from each Joint Base Commander. In consultation  with DOD we excluded two installation-support functions from the survey  (facilities new footprint and real property leases) because DOD officials  indicated that they did not have performance management data and  survey participants may not be able to fully respond to the questions. For  the list of installation-support functions that we included in our survey, see  table 5 below. The survey contained 16 main questions and several  follow-up questions. It was designed to obtain information, using closed-  and open-ended responses, about progress in consolidating functions,  factors that hinder consolidation, and outcomes from consolidation such  as any benefits, challenges, or reductions in duplication (defined as  reductions in redundancy) in three areas\u2014personnel other than  contractors, base operating contracts, and procedures and policies. The  survey also asked about the need for additional or modified guidance  from one or more of the military services or Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD) and if there were any additional opportunities to  consolidate that had not yet been implemented. See appendix II for a  copy of the survey questions.", "To administer the survey, we provided unique survey log-in information  for each function to the Joint Base Commander\u2019s office. That office was  then responsible for disseminating the information to the appropriate lead  service component\u2019s subject-matter expert for each of the functional  areas. While the survey was provided to the lead component\u2019s subject- matter expert, each base had the opportunity to incorporate views and  comments from the supported component(s). For joint bases that did not  have a given function (e.g., port operations), the joint base representative  simply indicated that the function did not exist and no further questions  were asked or answered.", "Our analysis of the survey responses included descriptive statistics from  closed-ended responses and content analysis of open-ended responses.  We reviewed the closed-ended responses to ensure accuracy of  information for six key survey questions: (Q2) \u201cIs any part of this support  function currently the responsibility of the Joint Base Commander?\u201d, and  (Q3) \u201cSince your joint base established the terms of the Joint Base  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), has any part of this support function  been consolidated?\u201d, and questions 9 through 12 (see Appendix II for the  complete wording of these questions). For these questions, we compared  the closed-ended response to the open-ended elaborations to ensure that  the closed-ended response accurately represented the respondent\u2019s  meaning. When there was a mismatch we also checked the base\u2019s MOA  and supplemental Joint Base Implementation Guidance, if applicable. In  some cases, we modified the closed-ended response to match the  response in the open-ended elaboration or the MOA (e.g., if a respondent  answered \u201cyes\u201d to the closed-ended question about the function being  consolidated but then clearly indicated in the elaboration space \u201cthis  function has not been consolidated\u201d). For example, these cases related to  changing: (1) \u201cno\u201d responses to \u201cnot applicable\u201d when a function was not  present at the joint base; (2) \u201cnot applicable\u201d responses to \u201cno\u201d when the  Joint Base Implementation Guidance excepted the installation-support  function in some instances from being transferred to the Joint Base  Commander; and (3) \u201cno\u201d responses to \u201cyes\u201d when the installation- support function had been consolidated prior to joint basing. Inconsistent  responses were identified through a content analysis of the open-ended  survey questions, in which two GAO analysts independently reviewed the  responses and coded them into several categories, such as \u201cconsolidated  prior to joint basing\u201d, \u201creports no reduction\u201d, and \u201creductions but not  directly related to joint basing.\u201d", "When the coding was completed, both analysts reviewed every code  made by the other analyst and indicated whether they agreed or  disagreed with the code. Then, the analysts met to discuss their coding  determinations and reached agreement on any differences. Because we  made changes to the closed-ended survey responses for the key  questions above based on our analysis of the open-ended responses and  the base MOAs, the results for those questions are not the raw survey  responses; they are the combined result of the original survey responses  and our analyses of those survey responses. We have worded the  results in our report carefully to accurately represent that fact.  Additionally, two analysts independently summarized the responses to  open-ended questions that were not elaborations of closed-ended  questions (e.g., Question 6 regarding other factors that might have  hindered the ability of the base to consolidate a function) through the  same content analysis process described above. We believe the data  analyzed are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We sent e-mail notifications to base points of contact beginning on  January 13, 2014. We then sent a cover e-mail with the log-in information  for the questionnaire beginning on January 14, 2014, and asked the  bases to complete the questionnaire within one month. To encourage  respondents to complete the questionnaire, we sent e-mail message  reminders and log-in information approximately two weeks, three weeks,  and five weeks after the initial questionnaire was sent; we also extended  the deadline for completion. We also sent customized emails and made  follow-up phone calls to the base points of contact to maximize the  response rate from all functions and to clarify responses for key individual  questions. We closed the survey on March 19, 2014. We achieved a 100  percent response rate from all base functions and commanders.", "To minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  questions differently than we intended, we pretested the questionnaire  with knowledgeable representatives from four joint bases.pretests, we asked the officials to complete the questionnaire as we  observed the process and noted potential problems (two sessions were  conducted in-person and by phone, two were conducted only by phone).", "During these  We then discussed the questions and instructions with the officials to  check whether (1) the questions and instructions were clear and  unambiguous, (2) the terms used were accurate, (3) the questionnaire  was unbiased, (4) the questionnaire did not place an undue burden on the  officials completing it, and (5) to identify potential solutions to any  problems identified. We also submitted the questionnaire for review by an  independent GAO survey specialist, OSD officials, and senior staff from  one additional joint base. We modified the questionnaire based on  feedback from the pretests and reviews, as appropriate.", "Because we collected data from every joint base rather than a sample of  bases, there was no sampling error. However, the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, how  the responses were processed and analyzed, or the types of people who  do not respond can influence the accuracy of the survey results. We took  steps in the development of the survey, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors and to help ensure the  accuracy of the answers that were obtained. For example, a social  science survey specialist designed the questionnaire, in collaboration with  GAO staff with subject-matter expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft  questionnaire was pretested to ensure that questions were relevant,  clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. The questionnaire was also  reviewed by external experts and an additional GAO survey specialist.  From these pretests and reviews, we made revisions as necessary to  reduce the likelihood of nonresponse and reporting errors on our  questions. Our analysts answered respondent questions and resolved  difficulties that respondents had in answering our questions. We  examined the survey results and performed computer analyses to identify  inconsistencies and other indications of error and addressed such issues.  A second, independent analyst checked the accuracy of all computer  analyses to minimize the likelihood of errors in data processing. To obtain  additional narrative and supporting context, survey respondents were  given multiple opportunities to provide additional open-ended comments  throughout our survey. Data were electronically exported from the web  survey software into a statistical program for analyses. No manual data  entry was performed, thereby removing an additional potential source of  error. We examined the survey results and performed computer analyses  to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error (e.g., open-ended  responses conflicting with closed-ended responses), and addressed such  issues as necessary.", "To determine the extent to which officials have reported consolidating  their installation-support functions, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2008 Joint Basing  Implementation Guidance to identify DOD\u2019s expectations for  consolidation. Next, we analyzed data obtained through the survey and  information from interviews with officials from the Joint Region Marianas  and the joint bases and compared the results of our analysis to DOD\u2019s  expectations for consolidation. To determine why consolidation had or  had not occurred as intended and to identify any reported factors that  have hindered consolidation and challenges that have resulted from  consolidation efforts, we analyzed information obtained through our  survey and interviewed joint base officials. We evaluated DOD\u2019s efforts to  address reported hindrances to consolidation and challenges that have  resulted from consolidation efforts with key federal practices for  consolidation identified in our prior work on federal agency consolidation  efforts.
