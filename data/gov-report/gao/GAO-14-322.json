F-35 developmental flight testing comprises two key areas: mission systems and flight sciences. Mission systems testing verifies that the software-intensive systems that provide critical warfighting capabilities function properly and meet requirements, while flight sciences testing verifies the aircraft's basic flying capabilities. Challenges in development and testing of mission systems software continued through 2013, due largely to delays in software delivery, limited capability in the software when delivered, and the need to fix problems and retest multiple software versions. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) predicts delivery of warfighting capabilities could be delayed by as much as 13 months. Delays of this magnitude will likely limit the warfighting capabilities that are delivered to support the military services' initial operational capabilities\u2014the first of which is scheduled for July 2015\u2014and at this time it is not clear what those specific capabilities will be because testing is still ongoing. In addition, delays could increase the already significant concurrency between testing and aircraft procurement and result in additional cost growth. Without a clear understanding of the specific capabilities that will initially be delivered, Congress and the military services may not be able to make fully informed resource allocation decisions. Flight sciences testing has seen better progress, as the F-35 program has been able to accomplish nearly all of its planned test flights and test points. Testing of the aircraft's operational capabilities in a realistic threat environment is scheduled to begin in 2015. The program has continued to make progress in addressing some key technical risks.", "To execute the program as planned, the Department of Defense (DOD) will have to increase funds steeply over the next 5 years and sustain an average of $12.6 billion per year through 2037; for several years, funding requirements will peak at around $15 billion. Annual funding of this magnitude clearly poses long-term affordability risks given the current fiscal environment. The program has been directed to reduce unit costs to meet established affordability targets before full-rate production begins in 2019, but meeting those targets will be challenging as significant cost reductions are needed. Additionally, the most recent cost estimate for operating and supporting the F-35 fleet is more than $1 trillion, which DOD officials have deemed unaffordable. This estimate reflects assumptions about key cost drivers the program can control, like aircraft reliability, and those it cannot control, including fuel costs, labor costs, and inflation rates. Reliability is lower than expected for two variants, and DOT&E reports that the F-35 program has limited additional opportunities to improve reliability.", "Aircraft manufacturing continued to improve in 2013, and management of the supply chain is evolving. As the number of aircraft in production has increased, critical learning has taken place and manufacturing efficiency has improved. For example, the prime contractor has seen reductions in overall labor hours needed to manufacture the aircraft, as expected. In 2013, the contractor delivered 35 aircraft to the government, 5 more than it delivered in 2012 and 26 more than it delivered in 2011.

The F-35 program planned to fly  test points,329 mission systems test flights and accomplish 2,817 test points in  2013. The program actually flew 352 test flights, exceeding the goal, but  only accomplished 2,518 test points. According to program and contractor  officials, slow progress in developing, delivering, and testing mission  systems software continues to be the program\u2019s most significant risk  area. The F-35 program is developing and fielding mission systems  software capabilities in blocks: (1) Block 1, (2) Block 2A, (3) Block 2B, (4)  Block 3i, and (5) Block 3F. Each subsequent block builds on the  capabilities provided in the preceding blocks. Blocks 1 and 2A provide  training capabilities and are essentially complete, with some final  development and testing still underway. Blocks 2B and 3i provide initial  warfighting capabilities and are needed by the Marine Corps and Air  Force, respectively, to achieve initial operational capability. Block 3F is  expected to provide the full suite of warfighting capabilities, and is the  block the Navy expects to have to achieve its initial operational capability.", "Developmental testing of Block 2B software is behind schedule and will  likely delay the delivery of expected warfighting capabilities. The delivery  of this software capability is of high near-term importance because it  provides initial warfighting capability for the overall F-35 program, and is  needed by the Marine Corps to field its initial operational capability in July  2015. As of January 2014, the program planned to have verified the  functionality of 27 percent of the software\u2019s capability on-board the  aircraft, but had only been able to verify 13 percent. This leaves a  significant amount of work to be done before October 2014, which is  when the program expects to complete developmental flight testing of this  software block. According to DOT&E, Block 2B developmental testing will  not be completed as scheduled and could be delayed by as much as 13  months, as the program has had to devote time and resources to address  problems and completing development of prior software blocks. Delays of  this magnitude would mean that the Marine Corps will not likely have all  of the capabilities it expects in July 2015, its planned initial operational  capability date. At this time it is not clear exactly which of the expected  capabilities will be available as testing is still ongoing. The effects of these  delays compound as they also put the timely delivery of Air Force and  Navy initial operational capabilities at risk. The Air Force expects to field  its initial operational capability in August 2016 with Block 3i aircraft that  possess the same warfighting capabilities as the Marine Corps aircraft,  but have upgraded computer hardware. The Navy plans to achieve its  initial operational capability in August 2018 with Block 3F aircraft that  possess the full suite of F-35 warfighting capabilities.", "Program and contractor officials have stated that while they recognize  that the program faces software risks, they still expect to deliver all of the  planned F-35 software capabilities to the military services as currently  scheduled. However, given the uncertainty in mission systems software  testing and the significance of the F-35 to future force structure plans, it is  important that the military services have a clear understanding of the  specific capabilities that they can realistically expect to receive, and those  capabilities that are not likely to be delivered by their initial operational  capability dates\u2014the first of which is scheduled for July 2015. In addition,  because the F-35 is DOD\u2019s most costly and ambitious acquisition  program, it is important that DOD keep Congress informed about the  status of the program. Without a clear understanding of the specific  capabilities that will initially be delivered, Congress and the military  services may not be able to make fully informed resource allocation  decisions.", "Delays in mission systems software testing could also increase costs. As  currently planned, DOD expects to complete developmental flight testing  in 2017. If the flight test schedule is extended, the program may have to  retain testing and engineering personnel longer than currently expected,  which would increase development cost. DOD currently expects to have  invested $70.2 billion to procure 359 aircraft by 2017 when developmental  flight testing is scheduled to end. Our past reports have concluded that  purchasing aircraft while concurrently conducting developmental flight  testing increases the risk that problems will be discovered late in testing  and additional funding will be needed to rework aircraft that have already  been purchased. If F-35 procurement plans remain unchanged and  developmental testing continues into 2018, the cost risks associated with  concurrency will likely increase as DOD expects to have invested $83.4  billion in 459 aircraft by that point in time.", "The F-35 contractor recognizes that additional testing efficiencies are  important in order to deliver capabilities on schedule and cost. One way it  plans to gain efficiency is to use test results from one F-35 variant to  close out test points for the other two variants in instances in which the  variants have common functions. According to test officials, most mission  systems testing can be accomplished on any variant and only a limited  amount of variant-specific testing is required. Contractor officials pointed  out that this type of efficiency would help mitigate some testing risk, but  they also recognized that it will still be difficult to make up the lost time in  the test program.

As the number of aircraft in production has  increased, learning has taken place and manufacturing efficiency has  improved. For example, the prime contractor has seen reductions in  overall labor hours needed to manufacture the aircraft. The number of F- 35 aircraft produced and delivered annually by the prime contractor has  steadily increased since the first low rate production aircraft were  delivered in 2011. In 2013, the contractor delivered 35 aircraft to the  government, 5 more than it delivered in 2012 and 26 more than it  delivered in 2011. The prime contractor has put in place a supplier  management system to oversee key supplier performance allowing them  to identify poor performers and take appropriate action to address issues  such as part shortages and poor quality. According to contractor officials,  actions taken as a result of this system contributed to improvements in  supplier performance over the past year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Manufacturing Processes Continue to Show Improvement", "paragraphs": ["The prime contractor continues to gain efficiencies in the manufacturing  process as it learns more about manufacturing the aircraft. Reductions in  the amount of time spent on work completed out of its specific work  station have contributed to overall labor hour reductions. Aircraft delivered  in 2012 averaged about 93 hours of out of station work per aircraft, while  in 2013 about 8 hours of out of station work were expended per aircraft  on average. While these gains in efficiency have moved the program  closer to meeting its established labor hour goals, there is still a long way  to go. In 2013, the prime contractor was unable to reach labor hour goals  for both the CTOL and STOVL variants. By the end of 2014, the prime  contractor expects to significantly reduce the average labor hours to  produce the CTOL and STOVL variants. However, in order to meet its  goal, the program will have to reduce the average number of hours per  aircraft for CTOL production by nearly 20,000 and the average number of  hours per aircraft for STOVL production by more than 14,000 over the  next year. While challenging, this goal appears to be achievable given  that the program has been able to reduce the average labor hours for  CTOL and STOVL production by more than 20,000 hours annually since  2011.

The prime contractor expects more  suppliers to be added as production increases and the program  progresses.", "The prime contractor\u2019s insight into the performance of 52 of its key  suppliers through its Supplier Integration Management system has led to  actions that have improved supplier performance. The system tracks  supplier performance data in 23 areas including, but not limited to, cost  growth, parts shortage occurrences, and the number of corrective action  reports filed. That data is reviewed and scored on a monthly basis, with  each supplier receiving an overall score based on their performance.  According to the prime contractor, a score of 80 or above, out of 100, is  considered good performance. All 52 of the key suppliers tracked using  this system were considered good performers as of December 2013. In  addition, 15 showed improvement in performance over the last year.  According to contractor officials, the system identifies poor performers  who are counseled and corrective actions are identified and implemented.  For example, according to officials from the prime contractor, one supplier  was identified through this process as having a large number of parts that  did not conform to specifications. The prime contractor held meetings with  and provided direction to that supplier. As a result of the prime  contractor\u2019s actions, the supplier\u2019s performance has improved over the  last year.

However, persistent  software problems have slowed progress in mission systems flight  testing, which is critical to delivering the warfighting capabilities expected  by the military services. These persistent delays put the program\u2019s  development cost and schedule at risk. As a result, DOT&E now projects  that the warfighting capabilities expected by the Marine Corps in July  2015, will not likely be delivered on time, and could be delayed as much  as 13 months. This means that the Marine Corps may initially receive less  capable aircraft than it expects, and if progress in mission systems  software testing continues to be slower than planned, Air Force and Navy  initial operational capabilities may also be affected. The program may  also have to extend its overall developmental flight test schedule, which  would increase concurrency between testing and production and could  result in additional development cost growth. In addition to software  concerns, the current funding plans may be unaffordable, given current  budget constraints. This situation could worsen if unit cost targets are not  met. Finally, the estimated cost of operating and supporting the fleet over  its life-cycle continues to be high and could increase further if aircraft  reliability goals are not met.", "DOD has already made a number of difficult decisions to put the F-35 on  a more sound footing. More such decisions may lie ahead. For example,  if software testing continues to be delayed, if funding falls short of  expectations, or if unit cost targets cannot be met, DOD may have to  make decisions about whether to proceed with production as planned  with less capable aircraft or to alter the production rate. Also, if reliability  falls short of goals, DOD may have to make decisions about other ways  to reduce sustainment costs, such as reduced flying hours. Eventually,  DOD will have to make contingency plans for these and other issues. At  this point, we believe the most pressing issue is the effect software  testing delays are likely to have on the capabilities of the initial  operational aircraft that each military service will receive. In order to make  informed decisions about weapon system investments and future force  structure, it is important that Congress and the services have a clear  understanding of the capabilities that the initial operational F-35 aircraft  will possess."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Due to the uncertainty surrounding the delivery of F-35 software  capabilities, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense conduct an  assessment of the specific capabilities that realistically can be delivered  and those that will not likely be delivered to each of the services by their  established initial operational capability dates.
