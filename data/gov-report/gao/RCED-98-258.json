After we reported that indirect expenditures had nearly doubled in 5 years, legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 4149) to improve the fiscal accountability of the Forest Service through an improved financial accounting system. This legislation would first limit, and then eliminate, all indirect costs that could be charged to the funds. In addition, H.R. 4193, the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior and related agencies for fiscal year 1999, contains provisions that would limit indirect costs to 25 percent of total costs for the Salvage Sale Fund and eliminate them entirely for the K-V Fund.", "The Forest Service separates indirect costs into three main categories: line management, common services, and program support (see fig. 1). Within each of these categories, its accounting system further divides such costs into two subcategories, differentiated on the basis of whether the cost can readily be identified with a specific project or function. For example, personnel support provided to the timber program can be readily identified with a single program, while a management position providing leadership for many programs (e.g., a forest supervisor) cannot. Costs that can be readily identified with a project or program are called \u201cbenefiting function\u201d costs; costs that cannot be so identified are called \u201cgeneral administration\u201d costs.", "Line management: Covers costs  related to line officers and their  identified staff.

It was intended to increase the amount of salvage timber offered and sold by instituting an expedited sale process. As a result, regions with a large need for salvage sales (among the regions we reviewed, the Pacific Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions) experienced a sharp increase in both direct and indirect expenditures to the Salvage Sale Fund. The rider ended on December 31, 1996, but indirect expenditures continued to increase in two of the four regions we reviewed through fiscal year 1997. A regional official attributed this continued increase to the time lag between when the direct \u201con-the-ground\u201d work ended and when the work necessary to administer and close the contracts and finish other administrative tasks was completed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employee Buyouts", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (Pub.L. 103-226) authorized executive agencies, including the Forest Service, to conduct a buyout of employees who met certain criteria and wanted to leave the agency. A buyout incentive payment of up to $25,000 per employee was to be paid from appropriations or funds available to pay the employee. The act also required agencies to pay the Office of Personnel Management: (1) for fiscal years 1994 and 1995, 9 percent of the basic pay for each employee that left and (2) for fiscal years 1995 through 1998, $80 for each remaining permanent employee (termed a \u201chead tax\u201d). Consequently, Forest Service regions with large staffs in positions classified as indirect have experienced increases in indirect expenditures. For example, for the 5 years we reviewed, the Pacific Northwest Region had more employees\u2014some of them in indirect positions\u2014than any other region and accounted for almost half of the $2.5 million charged to the funds since fiscal year 1994 for the head tax in the offices we reviewed.", "Similarly, indirect expenditures for the Salvage Sale Fund at the Washington Office increased almost $1.1 million between fiscal year 1994 and 1995. Of this amount, the Forest Service\u2019s accounting records show that $211,423 was the result of the head tax. For fiscal year 1995, Forest Service officials stated that the National Finance Center requested that the agency account centrally for the head tax because the Center\u2019s computer system could not appropriately account for it.

For the funds reviewed, this license fee increased the Washington Office\u2019s indirect expenditures by $762,000 in fiscal year 1996 and $885,000 in fiscal year 1997. Regions are assessed for their share of the hardware and related technical support costs.

However, over our 5-year review period, the instructions explaining how to account for indirect costs changed several times. For example, agency officials stated that prior to fiscal year 1994, there was no central and specific policy on how rent, utilities, and communications costs were to be charged. While the majority of the cost for rent charged to the funds was classified as a direct cost, some offices classified rent as an indirect cost, and still others classified it as both. The Forest Service recognized that a better system was needed to track indirect costs. Towards this end, the Forest Service established the common services category for rent, utilities, and communications costs in that fiscal year.", "However, the impact of this new account cannot be clearly measured. For example, in fiscal year 1993, rent charged to the Salvage Sale Fund in the Southwestern Region included $12,000 classified as direct and $1,000 classified as indirect. In fiscal year 1994, the Salvage Sale Fund had no rent classified as direct and $23,000 classified as indirect. Although rent costs charged to this fund nearly doubled, it is unclear how much of this change was attributable to an actual increase in rent and how much was attributable to the use of the new common services account.", "Other changes were brought about by policy decisions. For example, in fiscal year 1993, indirect expenditures as a percentage of total expenditures were less than 1 percent for the Reforestation Trust Fund. After determining that not all regions were assessing this fund for general administration costs, the Washington Office directed that the fund be assessed starting in fiscal year 1994. After the Washington Office\u2019s request, national indirect expenditures for this fund jumped to 13 percent of its total expenditures in fiscal year 1994. However, a Washington Office official stated that the Office inadvertently excluded this fund from its own general administration assessments until fiscal year 1996.

This independence adversely impacted the Forest Service\u2019s ability to provide us with the specific amounts associated with the reasons given for cost increases. For example, although instructed to start assessing the Reforestation Trust Fund for general administration costs starting in fiscal year 1994, the Rocky Mountain and Southwestern regions did not start doing so until fiscal year 1995. Such choices produce inconsistencies that affect the comparability of data and the ability to isolate specific reasons for expenditure increases. To similar effect, individual offices make many of the decisions regarding how to assess and allocate indirect costs to the funds and whether to classify certain costs as direct or indirect, as these examples show:", "The Pacific Southwestern Region lets its forests decide how to allocate unemployment costs, according to an official there. Some forests consider these costs direct, and others consider them indirect. As a result, the expenditures reported by the region contain amounts that are classified differently from forest to forest. In the Rocky Mountain Region, almost no indirect expenditures are charged to the Cooperative Work\u2014Other Fund because, according to a regional official, some managers are reluctant to burden the fund\u2019s contributors\u2014such as commercial users of forest roads\u2014with indirect costs. The regional supplement to the Forest Service Manual supports this decision by saying that \u201cContributors do not need to be assessed for overhead charges if the contributors are unwilling to accept them.\u201d", "Since fiscal year 1995, the Rocky Mountain Region has classified rent charged to the Brush Disposal Fund entirely as an indirect cost, whereas the Southwestern Region has classified rent charged to the same fund both as a direct and an indirect cost. In the Pacific Southwest Region, an official stated that expenses for timber resource clerks in some forests are classified as a direct cost to the funds but in other forests are classified as an indirect cost.", "At the Washington Office, officials told us that the majority of the increase in the indirect expenditures to the Salvage Sale Fund in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 occurred to charge the correct amount and to compensate for what were determined to be underassessments for general administration during fiscal years 1993-95."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Impact of All Factors Cannot Be Quantified", "paragraphs": ["Although the Forest Service can trace some of the increases in indirect costs to the four major factors discussed above, changing definitions and inconsistent implementation of policies hamper the agency\u2019s efforts to explain all the increases. For example, in the Pacific Southwest Region, four indirect expenditure categories in the Salvage Sale Fund increased $2.5 million from fiscal year 1995 to 1996. Financial records show that indirect automated data processing (ADP) expenditures rose $221,000; rent by $103,000; salaries by $251,000; and materials, supplies, and other services by $1.9 million. While the increase in ADP expenditures might be explained by the additional expenditures associated with the modernization of the computer system, regional officials cannot specifically isolate the amount that rent or salaries rose because of factors such as the salvage sale rider from increases that may have resulted from policy changes.", "The explanation of why the region had such a sharp increase in materials, supplies, and other services illustrates another reason why indirect cost increases are so difficult to isolate. Agency officials explained that this increase occurred because it was the Salvage Sale Fund\u2019s turn to pay for the \u201cpooled\u201d general administration assessment for the Forest Service\u2019s contract with the National Finance Center. Forest Service regions often \u201cpool\u201d the assessment to simplify budgeting procedures. For example, instead of assessing each fund individually for its share of costs from the National Finance Center, each fund places its allotted share for general administration into a pool, with the entire cost then being shown as charged against one fund instead of five. In this case, it was the Salvage Sale Fund\u2019s year to bear the pooled amount for the National Finance Center.

However, this reduction did not result in a corresponding decrease in indirect costs. One way that the Forest Service has been able to comply with the reduction was by reclassifying costs previously considered general administration costs to other indirect cost categories. In doing so, the agency also implemented recommendations made by the National Forest System General Administration Task Force in a 1992 report that was provided to the appropriations committees, and the Forest Service described the reclassifications in the explanatory notes of its budget. Reclassifications included these: In fiscal year 1993, for each forest supervisor\u2019s office, the expenses for the forest supervisor, deputies, and their secretarial support were classified as general administration costs. By 1995, only the costs for the forest supervisor and one secretary could be charged as general administration. The other positions were reclassified and are now charged to other indirect cost categories. In fiscal year 1993, up to five district ranger positions were included in general administration. In fiscal year 1997, all such district support could not be included in general administration and was reclassified.", "The general administration budget line item cannot be used to fund general administration activities in the permanent and trust funds; therefore, the Forest Service has developed a method of assessing the funds for such charges. The method used results in a percentage reflecting the portion of the budget that general administration represents. If the general administration budget line item is 12 percent of the total budget to which it applies, then the Forest Service limits the general administration costs that may be assessed to the funds to 12 percent of each fund\u2019s annual program level. Amounts that can be charged for other indirect cost categories are limited by budget constraints. We were told by agency officials that, in practice, many forests have chosen not to separately identify general administration costs from other indirect costs charged to the funds.

However, these measures were not enough to keep indirect expenditures from almost doubling in 5 years. Because individual offices will often decide how to account for indirect costs, the accounting system will not yield the data necessary to measure the savings in indirect costs resulting from these actions. This condition is made worse by definitional and other shifts that allow costs simply to be reclassified. Only after consistent and reliable indirect cost data are produced can trends and comparisons be studied and informed decisions made. An essential first step for the Forest Service in controlling indirect costs is to know clearly what these costs are from year to year and office to office.", "A starting point for this effort involves establishing clear definitions for indirect costs and applying them consistently over time. In this regard, the Forest Service can be helped by a recent addition to the federal financial accounting standards. In July 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Board, the group that recommends accounting principles for the federal government, released Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard (SFFAS) No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government. Effective for federal agencies starting with fiscal year 1998, this standard is \u201caimed at providing reliable and timely information on the full cost of federal programs, their activities, and outputs.\u201d", "Although the Forest Service was required to use the principles set forth in SFFAS No. 4 on October 1, 1997, we were told by a Washington Office official that the agency currently has a team discussing the possibility of applying the principles to its existing accounting system. Properly implementing this standard will go a long way towards providing cost data upon which informed decisions about reducing costs can be based. Of necessity, this endeavor will mean some changes in the way the Forest Service classifies costs as direct or indirect, as the following examples show.", "Unemployment and Disability Costs. About 59 percent of the total unemployment and disability costs charged to the five funds we reviewed were indirect, totaling more than $16 million over the 5 years. If an employee normally charges his or her time directly, then we believe that SFFAS No. 4 requires that associated unemployment or disability costs should also be charged directly. Because 76 percent of all salary costs charged to the funds during the past 5 years were classified as direct, proper implementation of SFFAS No. 4 should result in a substantial lowering of the unemployment and disability costs classified as indirect.", "ADP Costs. In the regions we reviewed, 71 percent of the ADP costs charged to the five funds were classified as indirect\u2014a total of almost $10 million in 5 years. Again, under SFFAS No. 4, we believe such costs would be classified as direct to the degree that the employees associated with the ADP costs normally charge their time that way. As with the assignment of unemployment and disability costs, we would expect ADP costs to mirror those of salaries and to be classified as direct whenever people to whom they are assigned charge their time directly. Classifying these types of costs as indirect overstates indirect costs overall and understates direct costs.", "Just as important as clarifying how costs should be classified, however, is ensuring that Forest Service offices apply these classifications consistently. If individual offices continue to vary in their decisions about how, when, and whether to implement accounting policies and definitions, the data produced will continue to have limited validity, and the Forest Service will have little reliable information upon which to judge whether indirect costs are truly rising or falling, let alone why. Because centralization represents such a change in the Forest Service\u2019s approach of giving great latitude to local offices, oversight by Forest Service headquarters and regional officials will be crucial to this effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the 5-year period we reviewed, the Forest Service took many actions to reduce costs, but indirect expenditures charged to the five funds reviewed increased nonetheless. Thus far, congressional attempts to affect indirect costs (through appropriations committees\u2019 reducing the budget line item recommended for general administration) also appear to provide little assurance that such costs will actually be reduced. Instead, such costs have often been redefined into other indirect cost categories. However, incorporating the principles set forth in the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard No. 4 would go a long way towards producing cost data that are consistent and reliable. But even the best guidance will not produce consistent and reliable data if it is not uniformly implemented by all offices. Solving these accounting system problems is an essential first step in controlling indirect expenditures. Once these problems are solved and indirect costs from year to year and office to office are clearly known, there is the opportunity for informed decisions about indirect costs and how to reduce them.

This second phase has the three objectives of identifying (1) the reasons why indirect costs rose, (2) actions taken by the Forest Service and others to control these expenditures, and (3) other actions that may help the Forest Service control such expenditures in the future.", "As agreed, we concentrated our detailed review on four regions and the Washington Office. Because the five funds are mainly timber-related, we chose the Pacific Southwest and Pacific Northwest regions because they have large timber programs. We chose the Rocky Mountain Region because it had lower indirect expenditures than any other region. We selected the Southwestern Region because it is similar in size to the Rocky Mountain Region yet had much higher indirect costs. We selected the Washington Office because its indirect costs fluctuated widely and increased significantly in some funds. Table II.1 provides each region\u2019s location and the geographic area it covers.", "To obtain information on why indirect costs increased and what had been done to control them, we interviewed knowledgeable officials at each location visited.
