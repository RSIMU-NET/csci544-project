This report responds to your request and provides our (1) assessment of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) efforts to manage the Fund\u2019s cash and (2) recommendations to DOD which, if properly implemented, will provide additional management oversight of the Fund\u2019s cash operations.", "Since April 1991, we have reported and testified on the challenges and problems confronting DOD in the management of the Fund. One area of continuing concern has been DOD\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s cash. An enterprise that collects and disburses about $75 billion annually must have the mechanisms in place to ensure that it fulfills its responsibilities to DOD management, the Congress, and the American taxpayers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In October 1991, DOD implemented the Fund which consolidated the nine existing industrial and stock funds operated by DOD as well as DFAS, the Defense Industrial Plant Equipment Service, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, the Defense Commissary Agency, and the Defense Technical Information Service. The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense agencies industrial and stock funds have maintained their individual identities as part of the Fund. The Fund\u2019s estimated fiscal year 1996 revenue of $75 billion makes it equivalent to one of the world\u2019s largest corporations.", "Effective cash management is directly dependent on DOD managers receiving accurate and timely data on the Fund\u2019s cash balances, collections, and disbursements. According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11B, the Fund is to maintain the minimum cash balance necessary to meet both operational requirements and to meet disbursement requirements in support of the capital asset program. In essence, the Fund is to maintain a minimum cash balance which, at the same time, is sufficient to cover expenses, such as paying employees for repairing ships and aircraft and vendors for inventory items. Currently, DOD\u2019s policy requires the Fund to maintain cash levels to cover 7 to 10 days of operational costs ($1.5 billion to $2.1 billion) and 4 to 6 months of capital asset disbursements ($.5 to $.9 billion). The regulation further provides that if the overall cash level of the Fund falls below $1 billion, DFAS will take immediate actions to resolve cash shortages by advance billing customers.", "Cash generated from the sale of goods and services is the primary means of the Fund maintaining an adequate level of cash. The ability to generate cash consistent with DOD policy is dependent on (1) accurately setting prices to recover the full costs of producing goods and services, (2) accurately projecting workload, such as the number of aircraft to be repaired during the year, and (3) collecting funds in a timely manner from customers for work performed. To the extent that (1) the Fund is not paid for work performed in a timely manner or (2) DOD cannot produce accurate and timely information on the Fund\u2019s collections and disbursements, unanticipated fluctuations or, worse yet, cash shortages will occur.", "DOD has experienced continual difficulties in effectively implementing and operating the Fund. Since the concept of the Fund was first put forth in February 1991, we have monitored and evaluated its implementation and operations. From its inception, over 4 years ago, we have pointed out that DOD did not have the procedures and systems in place to operate the Fund. In March 1995, we further reported that DOD\u2019s ability to properly manage the Fund continued to be hindered in part because of its inability to adequately manage the Fund\u2019s cash.", "In May 1995, we testified that we continued to have concerns about DOD\u2019s management of the Fund\u2019s cash. When the Fund was established, the responsibility for managing cash was placed under the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). However, on February 1, 1995, cash management and related Antideficiency Act responsibilities were returned to the military service and DOD component level. This change was a major departure from the benefits of a single cash balance DOD cited in establishing the Fund. According to DOD officials, the policy was changed to better align accountability and responsibility for cash management. DOD pointed out that the operational control of actions taken by each Fund activity, which results in cash disbursements and collections, always has and continues to reside with the military services and DOD components.", "While this report focuses on cash management problems, they are symptomatic of the persistent weaknesses in DOD\u2019s and the Fund\u2019s financial management operations. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1995 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) report highlighted a number of serious weaknesses in DOD\u2019s financial management operations and systems. GAO\u2019s High-Risk Report Series also pointed out that DOD has serious, long-standing problems in providing reliable financial and cost information to those responsible for carrying out and overseeing DOD\u2019s missions and programs. With regard to the Fund, the FMFIA report identified that it had inadequate accounting and reporting. Having systems and reports that provide timely and accurate information on the Fund\u2019s cash balances for individual business areas and on collections and disbursements is integral to having effective controls over cash management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The overall objective of this assignment was to evaluate the Fund\u2019s cash management practices with respect to the functions that impact on cash, such as billing customers and collecting receivables. To accomplish our objective, we (1) interviewed officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), DFAS, the military services, and Defense components regarding their reporting of monthly collection and disbursement information for the Fund, (2) reviewed DOD\u2019s cash management policies and procedures to obtain an understanding of the Fund\u2019s cash management practices, and (3) collected and analyzed for selected Fund business areas financial information related to collections, disbursements, accounts receivables, and accounts payable. In addition, through discussions with appropriate DOD officials and a review of pertinent documents, such as the Report on Budget Execution Defense Business Operation Fund (DD Form 1176) and the Defense Business Operations Fund Accounting Report (1307), we determined whether the Fund\u2019s systems provided managers with information conducive to managing cash.", "We performed our work at the headquarters, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; Defense Logistics Agency (DLA); Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS); the Cleveland, Columbus, Denver, and Indianapolis DFAS Finance Centers; DFAS operating locations in Norfolk and San Diego; and selected Fund business activities. Our review was performed from July 1995 through February 1996, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The quantitative financial information used in this report on the Fund\u2019s financial operations was produced from DOD\u2019s systems and was not independently verified by GAO. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1995 FMFIA report acknowledges inadequacies in the Fund\u2019s accounting and reporting. In addition, the DOD IG has cited system deficiencies as one of the major obstacles to the preparation of financial statements that fairly present the Fund\u2019s financial position.", "We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.

Effective cash management is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate information that impact the Fund\u2019s cash balance. The absence of this information could (1) result in an increase in the Fund\u2019s cash requirements to cover the day-to-day fluctuations in the Fund\u2019s cash balance and (2) impact major programmatic decisions which may be driven largely by cash balance considerations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Reports Used for Managing Cash Are Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with DOD policy, the Fund\u2019s monthly financial reports provide cash balance information at the military service and DOD component level who presently have cash management responsibility. However, the Fund\u2019s monthly financial reports do not provide cash balance information on the Fund\u2019s individual business areas although most decisions that impact cash, such as buying inventory items from vendors, are made at the business area or activity level. Instead, the monthly financial reports only show collections and disbursements. As such, the reports lack key information such as the amount of the initial allocation of the cash by DOD to the military services and DOD components in February 1995, when cash management responsibility was decentralized. The initial allocation\u2014a substantial amount of the Fund\u2019s cash\u2014was $1.7 billion, or 39 percent of the Fund\u2019s $4.4 billion cash balance at the end of September 1995.", "Lacking this basic information can put entities charged with Antideficiency Act responsibilities in the position of having to comply with the Act without the tools to do so. For example, since the Antideficiency Act responsibility was passed from DLA to the Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) in May of 1995, TRANSCOM managers are responsible for ensuring that they do not spend more than they have. However, they do not know their cash balance. The position the managers are in is similar to an individual writing personal checks without ever knowing his or her checkbook balance. In April 1995, just before cash management responsibility was transferred, TRANSCOM called attention to the difficulties it would have in complying with the Act to DLA, stating that it \u201cdoes not have an accounting system to properly account for or report cash transactions,\u201d and that \u201cduring contingency operations, we have no control over cash collections of transportation bills.\u201d In response to TRANSCOM\u2019s memorandum, the DLA comptroller stated that \u201cthe lack of control over cash cited in your memorandum applies equally to all Defense agencies, including DLA.\u201d", "Further, managers only receive official information once a month on the amount of collections and disbursements that impact the cash balance. These data are not timely since they are not received until 3 to 4 weeks after the end of the month in which transactions took place. For example, the reports for February 1996 will not be available until the end of March 1996. As a result, the Fund\u2019s cash can only be managed on a reactive rather than proactive basis.", "The lack of timely data was raised as a serious problem by the Joint Logistics Commanders who are senior-level general officers. In a June 1995 memorandum to the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Joint Logistics Commanders stated that \u201cthe current twenty-five day compilation period is not acceptable for cash management purposes\u201d and that a \u201creduction in cycle times for recording and reporting transactions impacting cash balances is required.\u201d They also stated that \u201ccycle time reduction is of critical importance to facilitate major programmatic decision which may be driven largely by cash balance considerations, particularly those made late in the fiscal year.\u201d", "DFAS officials recognize that the current reports are not adequate or timely. A DFAS official told us that DFAS is currently developing reporting procedures so that the military services and DOD components can identify the monthly cash balance for each Fund business area, such as the Navy shipyard business area or the Air Force depot maintenance business area. With respect to the timeliness of the reports, DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation on the Fund establishes a goal to improve cash reporting by providing real-time cash balances on the Fund\u2019s business areas. However, until the Fund\u2019s financial systems and processes are improved, the ability to provide the collection and disbursement data more promptly will not be achieved.", "Further, given that these system improvement efforts will be a long-term venture, it is important for DOD to concurrently pursue efforts to improve the quality of the financial information in the systems today. In previous reports on the Fund, we have stressed the need for DOD to improve existing operations and to not wait for implementation of the new systems to improve the quality of information. Operating improvements can be realized under the present systems through better adherence to existing policies and procedures and manual correction of existing erroneous data. In fact, if the reliability of the information is not improved dramatically, any new systems will provide the same erroneous data and perpetuate the operational problems that result from managers not receiving accurate information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Reports Do Not Disclose Impact of Undistributed Disbursements and Collections on Accounts Receivables and Payables", "paragraphs": ["The Fund\u2019s financial reports, as of September 1995, showed that the Fund had $4.5 billion and $920 million of undistributed disbursements and collections, respectively. In preparing the Fund\u2019s monthly financial reports, DOD did not fully disclose that billions of dollars of adjustments were made to its accounts receivable and payable balances for undistributed disbursements and collections.", "In order to more accurately reflect the true accounts receivable and payable balance on financial reports, DOD\u2019s guidance\u2014Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11B, Chapter 54\u2014provides that accounts receivables and payables should be adjusted by the amount of undistributed collections and disbursements, respectively. Conceptually, undistributed collections and disbursements are collections and disbursements that have been made and reported to the Treasury but not posted to DOD\u2019s records. Therefore DOD adjusts the (1) accounts payable balance based on the difference between the disbursements recorded in the accounting system\u2019s general ledger and the disbursements reported to the Treasury and (2) accounts receivable balance based on the difference between the collections recorded in the accounting system\u2019s general ledger and the collections reported to the Treasury. Normally, adjustments should reduce receivable and payable balances.", "However, our analysis of the Fund\u2019s financial reports and supporting documentation showed that DOD had negative undistributed disbursements and collections in some business areas which increased, instead of decreased, the amounts of accounts payable and receivable. These negative amounts can occur for numerous reasons, such as transactions being reported on the activity records but not on Treasury records and/or double recording of transactions by the activities. For example, as of the end of September 1995, accounts receivable for the Navy shipyards and the DLA distribution depots were increased by $542 million and $364 million, respectively, as a result of negative undistributed collections. Similarly, accounts payable for the Military Sealift portion of TRANSCOM increased by $205 million as a result of negative undistributed disbursements.", "Fully disclosing adjustments on the Fund\u2019s monthly reports would serve to highlight reporting problems, such as negative undistributed collections and disbursements. Such negative amounts cast serious doubts on the accuracy and reliability of the reported account balances. If they were fully disclosed on financial reports, they would serve as \u201cred flags\u201d for management, calling attention to the fact that the information being reported could be inaccurate and warrants further analysis, and that corrective action may be needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Advance Billings Continue Despite Large Amounts of Accounts Receivables", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 1995, DOD continued the practice of advance billing customers for work it had not yet performed to ensure that sufficient funds were available to meet day-to-day operating expenses.

In July 1994, the Comptroller of Defense stopped the advance billing at all activities except the Naval shipyards and research and development activities. Although these remaining activities had been tentatively scheduled to stop advance billing in January 1995, this did not occur. In discussing a draft of this report with DOD officials, they stated that when the responsibility for Fund cash was returned to the DOD components, along with the associated Antideficiency Act responsibilities, in February 1995, the amount of cash returned to the Army, Navy, and Air Force was not sufficient to cover outstanding Fund liabilities. The Fund\u2019s financial reports indicate that this was the case, with each of the military services facing cash shortages. Therefore, according to DOD, it was necessary for the military services to continue to advance bill customers so that their cash portion of the Fund would not go negative.", "The following table provides information on the actual amount of outstanding advance billings and the reported cash balance for the military services and the Defense agencies at the end of September 30, 1995.", "The above table shows that if the Navy had not advance billed its customers, the Navy Fund cash balance would have been a negative $372 million as of September 30, 1995. In fact, the Navy advance billed its customers about $1.2 billion during September 1995 to ensure that the Navy Fund cash balance remained positive\u2014at the end of August 1995, the Navy Fund cash balance was about $40 million. By comparison, even without advance billing, the table shows that the Army and Air Force portion of the Fund had positive balances of $315 million and $157 million, respectively.", "In updating the Fund\u2019s cash balance information as of the end of December 1995, we found that the reported cash balance had significantly decreased since September 1995. Over that 3-month period, the Fund\u2019s overall cash balance had decreased from $4.4 billion to $2.1 billion\u2014over a 50-percent reduction. Navy had the greatest share of the cash reduction; its balance decreased from about $1.6 billion to $83 million. In discussing a draft of this report with DOD officials, they stated that the Fund would not advance bill customers during fiscal years 1996 and 1997. They also stated that the Army and Air Force would eliminate their outstanding advance billing balances by the end of fiscal year 1996 and that the Navy would eliminate its outstanding advance billing balance by the end of fiscal year 1997.

Since the Fund is a $75 billion operation and it bills customers at least monthly, it is normal to have 1 or 2 months of accounts receivables on the books. As of September 1995, DFAS reported that the Fund had $6 billion in accounts receivables for Fund business areas with receivables exceeding $50 million. However, about 24 percent of the Fund\u2019s receivables, or $1.4 billion, have been outstanding for over 60 days with almost $1 billion of this amount outstanding for over 120 days.

The aggressive and efficient management of receivables in the Department of Defense is an important element of DOD stewardship over public funds.\u201d However, as the above table shows, DOD has not collected the accounts receivables in a timely manner. Some examples of why the Fund has not been collecting receivables in a timely manner are highlighted below and are discussed in further detail in appendix I.", "DFAS was not reimbursed $57 million by the Army and $34 million by the Navy in a timely manner for work performed in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. DFAS was paid 6 months to 2 years after it performed this work. Further, as of February 2, 1996, the Navy still has not reimbursed DFAS $7 million for work performed during fiscal years 1993 or 1994. DFAS was not paid primarily because it was performing work before receiving a funding document from its customers as generally required by the DOD Financial Management Regulation.", "As of September 30, 1995, DFAS\u2019 accounts receivable report showed that TRANSCOM had $697 million of accounts receivable. Of that amount, $437 million had not been billed to customers.

TRANSCOM has not been reimbursed primarily because the billing documentation did not identify the specific activities to be billed.", "In discussing a draft of this report with DOD officials, while agreeing to pursue collection of the receivables, they stated that accounts receivable data provide misleading information to DOD managers since some of these receivables will not be collected. They said they needed to determine the collectibility of the receivables and write-off amounts determined to be uncollectible. However, since most of the receivables are from DOD activities, if they were valid receivables, it would seem they should be collectible. Therefore, DOD needs to aggressively pursue collecting the receivables and fully document why any receivables would not be collectible. Because the Fund is a revolving fund, promptly being reimbursed for work performed is essential to its financial stability since this is the principal means through which it receives moneys needed to cover operating expenses. Further, the lack of timely reimbursements may result in cash fluctuations throughout the fiscal year and therefore lead to possible additional advance billing of customers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Navy Cash Management Problems Are the Most Severe", "paragraphs": ["Although problems discussed in this report transcend the entire Department, they were most prevalent with the Navy and DFAS activities providing accounting services to the Navy.

In this case, the Navy did not send DFAS a funding document to cover routine DFAS accounting services. DFAS and the Navy have been working on resolving this problem, and DFAS recently requested that the Navy provide a funding document\u2014called a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)\u2014for $7 million to cover DFAS services performed in fiscal years 1993 and 1994.", "Chapter 61 of the DOD Financial Management Regulation on the Fund provides that \u201cas a general rule, no work or services should be performed by a Defense Business Operations Fund activity except on the basis of reimbursable orders received and accepted that constitute obligations of Federal Government ordering activities or advances from non Federal Government entities.\u201d", "The following details cases we identified in which the Army and Navy did not promptly reimburse DFAS.", "DFAS performed $17 million of work in fiscal year 1993 and $40 million of work in fiscal year 1994 that the Army did not pay for until the following fiscal year.

They told us that (1) this has been a continual problem since DFAS became part of the Fund in fiscal year 1992 and (2) the military services and DOD components knew that DFAS was going to perform some accounting services even without receiving a funding document. To resolve the DFAS funding problem, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) issued memorandums to the military services and DLA in August 1995 requiring them to fund the full fiscal year 1996 DFAS amount no later than 10 working days after the apportionment reflecting the fiscal year 1996 Appropriations Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution Depots Are Also Experiencing Timeliness Problem in Being Reimbursed", "paragraphs": ["Similar to DFAS, DLA distribution depots, which are responsible for receipt, storage, and issue of inventory items, are not promptly reimbursed for the work they have performed.

We found that, at the time, 19 activities had provided the distribution depots funding documents totaling about $78 million. However, 18 activities had not provided the distribution depots with funding documents. After we requested the information, the 18 activities eventually provided the distribution depots with funding documents totaling $174 million. Of that amount, about $167 million was received in December 1995. Because the distribution depots did not receive funding documents in time, they could not bill some customers for work performed in October and November 1995 until December 1995.", "In addition to the funding document problem, the distribution depot billing process is manual, which precipitates other problems because it is time-consuming and can cause clerical errors. For example, clerical errors resulted in $234 million of collections being improperly recorded in March 1995. As a result, large fluctuations were shown on the distribution depot business area\u2019s monthly reports on budget execution (1176 report) as the errors were corrected. Specifically, the cumulative collection balances for February, March, and April 1995 were $404 million, $769 million, and $570 million, respectively. Since the monthly reports provide cumulative balances, the collection amount should be increasing each month. However, the April balance is almost $200 million less than the March balance.", "DFAS-Columbus, which provides accounting services for the distribution depots, recognizes that it needs to automate the manual billing process. In fiscal year 1993, a system change request was made to automate the billing process. Current DFAS plans show that automating the billing process will be done in three segments with the initial segment being implemented in June 1996. The first segment is to include such features as establishing a new subsidiary ledger, identifying customers, and capturing funding document information. The second and third segments, which are expected to be implemented in January 1997 and January 1998, respectively, are to add such features as the issuance and acceptance of funding documents by electronic data interchange (EDI), automatic updates to general ledger accounts, EDI transfer of funds capability, status of funds reports to customers, and an interface of billing data to the disbursing and collection system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TRANSCOM Has Not Been Reimbursed for Transportation Services", "paragraphs": ["As of September 1995, DFAS\u2019 accounts receivable aging report showed that TRANSCOM had $697 million of accounts receivable.

Of the $104.5 million, TRANSCOM performed $61.1 million and $43.4 million of transportation services in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, respectively.
