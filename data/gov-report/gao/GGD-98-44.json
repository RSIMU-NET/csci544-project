These twin demands are the broad forces behind the move to a performance-based approach to management in public sector organizations\u2014the most important effort to improve government management in over a generation. Congress enacted the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, commonly referred to as \u201cGPRA\u201d or \u201cthe Results Act,\u201d in conjunction with the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act and information technology reform legislation, such as the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, to address these twin demands and to instill performance-based management in the federal government.", "The Results Act seeks to shift the focus of government decisionmaking and accountability away from a preoccupation with the activities\u2014such as grants and inspections made\u2014to a focus on the results of those activities\u2014such as real gains in employability, safety, responsiveness, or program quality. Under the Act, agencies are to develop strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is also to prepare the annual federal government performance plan that is based on the performance plans of individual agencies. Agencies submitted the first cycle of the strategic plans to Congress and OMB in September 1997. The first federal government performance plan is to be submitted to Congress in February 1998 with the President\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget; and the first annual performance plans, which were to be submitted to OMB in the fall of 1997, are due to Congress after the submission of the President\u2019s budget.", "On October 30, 1997, we submitted a statement for the record at the request of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight on those strategic plans.

As agreed, we focused our reviews on the progress of agencies\u2019 strategic planning efforts, specifically their efforts to improve their strategic plans, with particular attention to the key planning challenges that are most in need of sustained attention. Agencies included in our analysis are listed in appendix I, and our observations on individual agencies are summarized in appendixes II through XXV. To gather information on how annual performance planning and measurement could be used to address the critical planning challenges we observed in our reviews of the September plans, we relied on our recent report on critical challenges needing sustained attention, our report on governmentwide implementation of the Results Act, our guidance for congressional review of Results Act implementation, and our guidance on effectively implementing the Act.", "We reviewed individual agency plans from September 30, 1997, through November 1997.

In addition to the Results Act, the framework comprises the CFO Act and information technology reform legislation, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Congress enacted the CFO Act to remedy decades of serious neglect in federal financial management by establishing chief financial officers across the federal government and requiring the preparation and audit of annual financial statements. The information technology reform legislation is based on the best practices used by leading public and private sector organizations to manage information technology more effectively.", "Under the Results Act, strategic plans are the starting point and basic underpinning for performance-based management. In our report on agencies\u2019 draft strategic plans, we noted that complete strategic plans were crucial if they were to serve as a basis for guiding agencies\u2019 operations and be used to help congressional and other policymakers make decisions about activities and programs. The Act requires that an agency\u2019s strategic plan contain six key elements. These elements are (1) a comprehensive agency mission statement; (2) agencywide long-term goals and objectives for all major functions and operations; (3) approaches (or strategies) and the various resources needed to achieve the goals and objectives; (4) a description of the relationship between the long-term goals and objectives and the annual performance goals; (5) an identification of key factors, external to the agency and beyond its control, that could significantly affect the achievement of the strategic goals; and (6) a description of how program evaluations were used to establish or revise strategic goals and a schedule for future program evaluations.", "Building on the decisions made as part of the strategic planning process, the Results Act requires executive agencies to develop annual performance plans covering each program activity set forth in the agencies\u2019 budgets. The first annual performance plans, covering fiscal year 1999, are to be submitted to Congress after the President\u2019s budget is submitted, which is approximately February 1998. Each plan is to contain an agency\u2019s annual performance goals and associated measures, which the agency is to use in order to gauge its progress toward accomplishing its strategic goals. OMB is to use the agencies\u2019 performance plans to develop an overall federal government performance plan that is to be submitted with the President\u2019s budget. The performance plan for the federal government is to present to Congress a single cohesive picture of the federal government\u2019s annual performance goals for a given fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "September Plans Included Required Elements and Addressed Many Weaknesses in Draft Plans", "paragraphs": ["Agencies\u2019 September plans appear to provide a workable foundation for the continuing implementation of the Results Act.

In addition, just over a fourth of those plans failed to cover at least three of the required elements. Moreover, we found that many of the elements included in the plans contained weaknesses\u2014some that were more significant than others.", "The agencies, on the whole, made a concerted effort during August and September to improve their plans. For example, all of the September plans we reviewed contained at least some discussion of each element required by the Act. And, in many cases, those elements that contained weaknesses were substantially improved by September. For example:", "The Department of Transportation explained more clearly how its mission statement is linked to its authorizing legislation.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) improved its ability to assess progress toward its strategic goals by stating when specific performance objectives would be met.", "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) better explained the scope of its crosscutting functions by identifying major crosscutting functions and interagency programs and its coordination with those agencies.", "The Department of Education improved its discussion of external factors that could affect its achievement of strategic goals by describing agency actions to mitigate against those factors.", "Appendixes II through XXV contain our observations on the progress and remaining challenges of individual agencies\u2019 strategic planning efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Planning Challenges Remain to Be Addressed as Efforts Under the Results Act Proceed", "paragraphs": ["Although the September plans appear to provide a workable foundation for the continuing implementation of the Results Act, we found that critical planning challenges remain. Among the remaining critical challenges are (1) clearly establishing a strategic direction for agencies by improving goal-setting and measurement; (2) improving the management of crosscutting program efforts by ensuring that those programs are appropriately coordinated to avoid duplication, fragmentation, and overlap; and (3) ensuring that agencies have the data systems and analytic capacity in place to better assess program performance and costs, improve management and performance, and establish accountability. The forthcoming annual performance planning and measurement processes offer agencies an opportunity to make progress in addressing these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Can Use the Annual Performance Planning Process to Build Upon Their Initial Efforts to Establish a Strategic Direction", "paragraphs": ["By improving on their draft strategic plans, agencies\u2019 September plans undertook the first steps toward setting a strategic direction for their programs and activities. However, we found that the September plans often lacked clear articulation of the agency\u2019s strategic direction: (1) strategic goals and objectives were not as measurable and results oriented as possible, (2) linkages among planning elements were not clear, and (3) strategies for achieving those goals and objectives were incomplete or underdeveloped. However, the performance planning and measurement phase of the Results Act offers agencies an opportunity to continue to refine their strategic directions.", "In our reviews of agencies\u2019 September plans, we found that some agencies have begun to address the challenge of setting a strategic direction. For example:", "The most notable improvement in the plan for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the inclusion of an outline of strategic objectives for accomplishing the Department\u2019s six strategic goals. Those objectives are largely focused on outcomes and are defined in measurable terms. This plan also identifies for each strategic objective the key measures of progress. For example, one measure of progress for the outcome-oriented objective of \u201creducing the use of illicit drugs\u201d is \u201cdeath rate of persons aged 15 to 65 attributed to drug use.\u201d", "The September plans of the Departments of Agriculture, Education, and the Treasury now include helpful matrixes to link various planning elements, such as goals, objectives, measures, and programs or responsible organizational components. These matrixes are also useful in assessing a plan\u2019s underlying logic, determining programmatic accountability, and identifying crosscutting programs and potential duplication and overlap among program efforts. For example, Treasury\u2019s September plan contained an appendix that identified which bureau or office is responsible for achieving its Department-wide goals and objectives.", "The September plan for the Department of Energy (DOE) better explains how it plans to accomplish many of its goals. The plan provides greater specificity on the money, staff, workforce skills, and facilities that the agency plans to employ to meet its goals. For example, to support its national security goal, DOE\u2019s plan says it will need to change the skills of its workforce and how it constructs new experimental test facilities.", "Although improvements were not isolated to these agencies, we also found that agencies need to further clarify their strategic directions if the Results Act is to be effective in guiding the agencies and informing congressional and other decisionmakers. The goals and objectives of many agencies could be more results oriented and expressed in a manner that will better allow for a subsequent assessment of whether the goals and objectives have been achieved. For example, the plan for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) contains the following objectives supporting the goal for its compensation and pension area: \u201c(1) evaluate compensation and pension programs and (2) modify these programs, as appropriate.\u201d Also, although the first goal in the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) September plan \u201co promote valued, strong, and responsive social security programs and conduct effective policy development, research, and program evaluation\u201d sets a strategic direction for the agency, it could be stated in more measurable terms to better enable the agency to make a future assessment of whether it is being achieved.", "Another challenging area for agencies in setting strategic direction in the September plans was to establish linkages among planning elements, such as goals, objectives, and strategies. For example, Treasury\u2019s plan says that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a role in three law enforcement objectives\u2014to reduce counterfeiting, money laundering, and drug smuggling. However, the IRS plan contained no specific strategy to help achieve any of those objectives. In another example, the September plan for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) included lists of objectives and strategies under each goal with no explanation of how the strategies would contribute to achievement of the objectives.", "Another weakness of agencies\u2019 September plans was incomplete and underdeveloped strategies for achieving long-term strategic goals and objectives. More specifically, we found that agencies did not always provide an adequate discussion of the resources needed to achieve goals. For example, SBA\u2019s September plan did not contain any discussion on the resources, such as human resources and information technology, needed to achieve its goals. Although other plans we reviewed discussed resources, the discussions were incomplete. For example, few plans discussed the physical capital resources, such as facilities and equipment, needed to achieve their goals. Although many agencies may not rely heavily on physical capital resources, even the plans of some of those that do, such as the General Services Administration and the National Park Service, a component of the Department of the Interior, did not provide a focused discussion of their capital needs and usage.", "The role that information technology played, or can play, in achieving agencies\u2019 long-term strategic goals and objectives was generally neglected in the September plans. The government\u2019s track record in employing information technology is poor, and the strategic plans we reviewed often contained only limited discussions of technology issues. For example, most of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) strategic goals are fundamentally linked to information technology. However, we have placed DOD\u2019s management of critical information management processes on our high-risk list. We believe DOD\u2019s strategic plan would be significantly enhanced if it more explicitly linked its strategic goals to a strategy for improving management and oversight of information technology resources. Additionally, DOD should recognize the dramatic impact the Year 2000 problem will likely have on its computer operations, including the mission-critical applications identified in its strategic plan.", "The Department of State\u2019s September plan also does not specifically address the serious deficiencies in State\u2019s information and financial accounting systems. Rather, the plan notes, in more general terms, that it will take State several years to develop performance measures and related databases in order to provide sufficient information on achievement of its long-term goals. The lack of such a discussion in many of the plans is of particular concern because, without it, agencies cannot be certain that they are (1) addressing the federal government\u2019s information technology problems and (2) better ensuring that technology acquisition and use are targeted squarely on program results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Annual Performance Planning and Measurement Offers Agencies Opportunity to Better Clarify a Strategic Direction", "paragraphs": ["Strategic planning\u2014setting a strategic direction for agency operations\u2014did not end with the submission of a strategic plan to Congress last September. Performance-based management, as envisioned by the Results Act, is not a linear, sequential process but, rather, an iterative one in which strategic and performance planning cycles will result in subsequent revisions to both strategic and annual performance plans. Each cycle of strategic planning and performance planning, particularly in the first few years of governmentwide implementation of the Results Act, will likely result in agencies making significant changes and improvements in those documents.", "Consequently, agencies can continue to address the critical planning challenges associated with setting a strategic direction as they develop their first annual performance plans. For example, the process of defining targeted levels of performance within set time frames and providing baselines against which to compare actual performance will likely produce opportunities for agencies to revisit and improve upon their strategic goals and objectives so that those goals are as results oriented and measurable as they can be.", "If successfully developed, those annual performance goals can function as a bridge between long-term strategic planning and day-to-day operations, thereby assisting agencies in establishing better linkages among planning elements. For example, agencies can use performance goals to show clear and direct relationships in two directions\u2014to the goals in the strategic plans and to operations and activities within the agency. By establishing those relationships, agencies can (1) provide straightforward roadmaps that show managers and staff how their daily activities can contribute to attaining agencywide strategic goals, (2) hold managers and staff accountable for contributing to the achievement of those goals, and (3) provide decisionmakers with information on their annual progress in meeting the goals. As agencies gain experience in developing these annual performance goals, they likely will become better at identifying and correcting misalignment among strategic goals, objectives, and strategies within their plans.", "The importance of clearly showing how strategies are linked to goals is underscored by the Results Act requirement that annual goals are to be based on budgetary program activities. Unlike previous federal reform initiatives, the Results Act requires agencies to plan and measure performance using the same program activity structures that form the basis for their budget requests. However, we have found that the relationships among the budget structures, performance plans, and strategic plans will require coordinated and recurring attention by Congress, OMB, and agencies as they move to implement the annual performance planning and measurement phase of the Act. This attention is important because the wide variability of the budget structures indicates that the suitability of those structures for the Results Act\u2019s performance planning and measurement will also vary.", "For example, we reported in 1997 that agency officials we spoke with confirmed the varying suitability of their program activity structures for the Results Act\u2019s purposes. One agency successfully worked through its recent performance-planning process using its existing program activities. A second agency had a program activity structure that reflected its organizational units\u2014a structure that is useful for traditional accountability purposes, such as monitoring outputs and staff levels\u2014but less useful for results-oriented planning. Still other agencies separated performance planning from program activity structures, believing it necessary to first establish appropriate program goals, objectives, and measures before considering the link to the budget. These agencies planned to rely on the Results Act\u2019s provision to aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities in constructing their annual performance plans.", "In addition, annual performance planning can be used to better define strategies for achieving strategic and annual performance goals. For example, annual performance plans provide agencies with another opportunity to further discuss strategies for information technology investments and the operational improvements expected from those investments. The annual performance plans should also provide annual performance measures that Congress and other decisionmakers can use to determine if those investments are achieving the expected improvements. Thus, annual performance planning and measurement can provide decisionmakers with an early warning of information investment strategies that need to be revisited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies and Congress Can Use Performance Planning to Address Crosscutting Program Efforts", "paragraphs": ["A focus on results, as envisioned by the Results Act, implies that federal programs that contribute to the same or similar results should be closely coordinated to ensure that goals are consistent and, as appropriate, program efforts are mutually reinforcing. We have found that uncoordinated program efforts can waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program customers, and limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort. This suggests that federal agencies are to look beyond their organizational boundaries and coordinate with other agencies to ensure that their efforts are aligned and complementary.", "Agencies\u2019 September plans show progress in this area, but coordination of crosscutting programs continues to be a strategic planning challenge. During the summer of 1996, in reviewing early strategic planning efforts, OMB alerted agencies that augmented interagency coordination was needed at that time to ensure consistency among goals in crosscutting programs areas. However, the draft strategic plans we reviewed during the summer of 1997 often lacked evidence that agencies in crosscutting program areas had worked with other agencies to ensure that goals were consistent; strategies were coordinated; and, as appropriate, performance measures were similar.", "Agencies\u2019 September plans better described crosscutting programs and coordination efforts. Some plans, for example, contained references to other agencies that shared responsibilities in a crosscutting program area or discussed the need to coordinate their programs with other agencies. For example, as noted earlier, NRC better explained its crosscutting functions in its September plan. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) plan contains an appendix that lists the federal agencies with which EPA coordinated. This appendix describes the major steps in the coordination process and lists by strategic goal the agencies with which EPA believes greater integration and review of efforts will be needed. Similarly, the plan for the Department of Transportation contains a table that shows the contributions of other federal agencies to each of its major mission areas. NRC\u2019s, EPA\u2019s and Transportation\u2019s plans illustrate the kind of presentation that could be especially helpful to Congress and the administration in identifying program areas to monitor for overlap and duplication.", "These presentations, and similar ones in other agencies\u2019 September plans that identify agencies with crosscutting programs, also provide a foundation for the much more difficult work that lies ahead\u2014undertaking the substantive coordination that is needed to ensure that those programs are effectively managed. For example, in an improvement over its draft plan, the Department of Labor\u2019s September plan refers to a few other agencies with responsibilities in the area of job training programs and notes that Labor plans to work with them. However, the plan contains no discussion of what specific coordination mechanism Labor will use to realize efficiencies and possible strategies to consolidate job training programs to achieve a more effective job training system.", "Our work has shown that the next phases of the Results Act\u2019s implementation will offer a structured framework to address crosscutting issues. For example, the Act\u2019s emphasis on results-based performance measures as part of the annual performance planning process should lead to more explicit discussions concerning the contributions and accomplishments of crosscutting programs and encourage related programs to develop common performance measures. As agencies work with OMB to develop their annual performance plans, they can consider the extent to which agency goals are complementary and the need for common performance measures to allow for cross-agency evaluations. Also, the Results Act\u2019s requirement that OMB prepare a governmentwide performance plan that is based on the agencies\u2019 annual performance plans can be used to facilitate the identification of program overlap, duplication, and fragmentation.", "Our work also indicates that if agencies and OMB use the annual planning process to highlight crosscutting program efforts and provide evidence of joint planning and coordination of those efforts, the individual agency performance plans and the governmentwide performance plan should help provide Congress with the information needed to identify agencies and programs addressing similar missions. Once these programs are identified, Congress can consider the associated policy, management, and performance implications of crosscutting program efforts and whether individual programs make a sufficiently distinguishable contribution to a crosscutting national issue. This information should also help identify the performance and cost consequences of program fragmentation and the implications of alternative policy and service delivery options. These options, in turn, can lead to decisions concerning department and agency missions and the allocation of resources among those missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Planning Can Assist Agencies in Building the Capacity to Gather, Process, and Analyze Performance and Program Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["Our previous work has shown that agencies need to have reliable data during their planning efforts to set realistic goals and later, as programs are being implemented, to gauge their progress toward achieving those goals. In addition, in combination with an agency\u2019s performance measurement system, a strong program evaluation capacity is needed to provide feedback on how well an agency\u2019s activities and programs contributed to achieving its goals and to identify ways to improve performance. However, our work has also found serious shortcomings in agencies\u2019 ability to generate reliable and timely data to measure their progress in achieving goals and to provide the analytic capacity to use that data. The Results Act\u2019s requirement that annual performance plans discuss the verification and validation of data provides agencies with an opportunity to be forthcoming about data limitations and to show how those limitations will be addressed. Verified and validated performance information, in conjunction with augmented program evaluation efforts, will help ensure that agencies are able to report progress in meeting goals and identify specific strategies to improve performance.", "The absence of both sound program performance and cost data and the capacity to use those data to improve performance is a critical challenge that agencies must confront if they are to effectively implement the Results Act. Efforts under the CFO Act have shown that most agencies are still years away from generating reliable, useful, relevant, and timely financial information, which is urgently needed to make our government fiscally responsible. The widespread lack of available program performance information is equally troubling. For example, in our June report on a survey of managers in the largest federal agencies, we found that fewer than one-third of those managers said that results-oriented performance measures existed to a great or very great extent for their programs.", "Our work also suggests that even when performance information exists, its reliability is frequently questionable. For example, our work has shown that the reliability of performance data currently available to a number of agencies is suspect, because the agencies must rely on data collected by parties outside the federal government. In a recent report, we noted that the fact that data were largely collected by others was the most frequent explanation offered by agency officials for why determining the accuracy and quality of performance data was a challenge. In our June 1997 report on the implementation of the Results Act, we also reported on the difficulties that agencies were experiencing as a result of their reliance on outside parties for performance information.", "Agencies are required under the Results Act to describe in their annual performance plans how they will verify and validate the performance information that will be collected. This section of the performance plan can provide important contextual information for Congress and agencies to address the weaknesses in this area. For example, this section can provide an agency with the opportunity to alert Congress to the problems the agency has had or anticipates having in collecting needed results-oriented performance information. Agencies can also use this section to alert Congress to the cost and data quality trade-offs associated with various collection strategies, such as relying on sources outside the agency to provide performance data and the degree to which those data are expected to be reliable. The discussion in this section can also provide Congress with a mechanism for examining whether the agency currently has the data to confidently set performance improvement targets and will later have the ability to report on its performance.", "More broadly, continuing efforts to implement the CFO Act also are central for ensuring that agencies resolve their long-standing problems in generating vital information for decisionmakers. In that regard, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) has developed a new set of accounting concepts and standards that underpin OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies on the form and content of their agencywide financial statements. As part of that effort, FASAB developed managerial cost accounting standards that were to be effective for fiscal year 1997. These standards are to provide decisionmakers with information on the costs of all resources used and the costs of services provided by others to support activities or programs. Such information would allow for comparisons of costs across various levels of program performance.", "However, because of serious agency shortfalls in cost accounting systems, the Chief Financial Officers Council\u2014an interagency council of the CFOs of the major agencies\u2014requested an additional 2 years before the standard would be effective. FASAB recommended extending the date by 1 year, to fiscal year 1998, with a clear expectation that there would be no further delays.", "Under the Results Act, another aspect of performance planning is a requirement for agencies to discuss the use and planned use of program evaluations that can provide feedback on how well an agency\u2019s activities and programs contributed to the achievement of its goals and to assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of those goals. However, our recent report on agencies\u2019 draft plans stated that 16 of the 27 draft plans did not discuss program evaluations. Although all the September plans included discussions of program evaluations, we continued to find weaknesses in those discussions. However, this is not surprising because agencies that had not undertaken program evaluations prior to the preparation of the first cycle of strategic plans would not likely be able to discuss in their September plans how they used program evaluations to help develop the plans.", "Of greater concern, many agencies, including the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor, also did not discuss how they planned to use evaluations in the future to assess progress or did not offer a schedule for future evaluation as required by the Results Act. In contrast, the National Science Foundation\u2019s September plan contains a noteworthy exception to this trend. The plan discusses how the agency used evaluations to develop key investment strategies, action plans, and its annual performance plan. It also discusses plans for future evaluations and provides a general schedule for their implementation.", "Over the longer term, the program performance information that agencies are to generate under the Results Act should be a valuable new resource for Congress to use in its program authorization, oversight, budget, and appropriation responsibilities. As we have noted before, to be most useful in these various contexts, that information needs to be consolidated with budget data and critical financial and program cost data, which agencies are to produce and have audited under the CFO Act. This consolidated program performance, cost, and budget information, in conjunction with the annual performance plans, should provide congressional and other decisionmakers with a more complete picture of the results, operational effectiveness, and costs of agencies\u2019 operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Agencies, on the whole, made significant progress in improving their plans during August and September 1997.

We reviewed the overview and the 16 agency plans that are directly related to accomplishing USDA\u2019s mission and implementing its programs. We also reviewed the plans for the offices of the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Information Officer.", "We observed that the May draft strategic plan did not fulfill the requirements of the Results Act. USDA\u2019s overall mission and goals were contained in the Department-wide strategic overview; the overview then referred the reader to the agencies\u2019 plans for information on the six required elements. However, only one of the agencies\u2019 plans we reviewed contained all six required elements. The draft strategic plan also fell short in several other areas necessary for achieving the purposes of the Results Act. Among other things, the draft strategic plan lacked an emphasis on externally focused goals and objectives, adequate quantifiable performance measures, and good linkages between the agencies\u2019 goals and the Department\u2019s goals.", "We also reported that we could not determine the extent to which coordination with other federal agencies, both within and outside the Department, occurred in the formulation of the draft strategic plan. It was also unclear whether agencies\u2019 goals and objectives had been assessed for duplication and complementary functions. USDA\u2019s Department-wide strategic overview acknowledged the role of USDA agencies that carry out similar and/or complementary functions but did not recognize the role of other federal agencies. Many of the agencies\u2019 plans generically recognized the roles of other federal agencies in accomplishing their missions. However, there was little evidence in either the Department-wide strategic overview or the agencies\u2019 plans to suggest that the agencies coordinated with other agencies\u2014internally or externally\u2014when developing their goals and objectives.", "USDA\u2019s draft plan addressed some, but not all, of the high-risk issues and management problems we had previously identified. Generally, information on how USDA planned to address these high-risk issues and management problems, such as the need to reduce losses in the farm loan program, was included as goals and objectives in the agencies\u2019 plans. However, USDA\u2019s draft plan did not address some management issues, such as the need to reform milk marketing orders, improve the management of agricultural trade programs, and strengthen financial controls under credit reform. In addition, we have identified significant, long-standing Department-wide problems in information technology, accounting, and financial management. However, USDA\u2019s draft strategic plan did not adequately recognize and address these problems. For example, the plan for the Office of the Chief Information Officer lacked time frames and milestones and the resources needed to accomplish the stated goals.

For example:", "Most of the agencies\u2019 plans have comprehensive and concise mission statements. However, the mission statements for two agencies\u2019 plans\u2014concerning the Agricultural Marketing Service and Rural Development\u2014are stated so broadly that it is difficult to determine what the basic purpose of the agency is or how it differs from that of other agencies. For example, it is unclear how the mission of the Agricultural Marketing Service differs from the missions of the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration and the Foreign Agricultural Service.", "Most of the agencies\u2019 plans have results-oriented goals and objectives.", "However, some plans\u2014those of the Farm Service Agency, Food and Consumer Service, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Forest Service\u2014have too many goals and objectives structured around existing programs and activities rather than the ultimate results that these agencies should achieve. For example, the Farm Service Agency\u2019s plan has four goals that we believe could be combined under two that would fulfill the agency\u2019s mission\u2014(1) improving the economic viability of the agriculture sector and (2) protecting the environment.", "All of the agencies\u2019 plans provide more detailed strategies and improved information on the resources needed for achieving goals and objectives, compared with the information provided in the May draft plan.", "All of the agencies\u2019 plans provide a detailed discussion of the external factors beyond the control of the agency that could affect the achievement of the goals. However, the linkages between external factors and their impact on specific goals could be improved in some plans, such as the plans for the four research agencies.", "Unlike the May draft, in which only 1 of the 16 agencies\u2019 plans included information on the relationship between annual performance goals and strategic goals, all of the agencies\u2019 September plans include this information. However, the quality of the descriptions provided in this section of the agencies\u2019 plans varies by agency. For example, some plans, such as those for the Food and Consumer Service, Farm Service Agency, Food Safety and Inspection Service, and Center for Nutrition Policy and Programs, easily allow the reader to envision how the annual performance goals relate to the strategic goals; other agencies\u2019 plans, such as those for the Economic Research Service and the Risk Management Agency, are less clear.", "Most of the agencies\u2019 plans provide greater detail than they did in the May draft on how program evaluations were used to develop the strategic plan and how they will be used in the future. However, two plans\u2014those for the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Agricultural Research Service\u2014state that program evaluations were not used to develop the strategic plan, although information on program evaluations planned for the future is included; and the plan for the Agricultural Marketing Service states that program evaluations were not used to develop the plan and are not planned for the future. While these agencies state that they did not use formal program evaluations when developing their plans, the information provided in the plans indicates that the results of relevant studies and assessments were actually used to help develop the plans\u2014which in our opinion meets the requirements of the Results Act. Consequently, we believe that these agencies may be using too narrow a definition for the term \u201cprogram evaluation.\u201d According to an August 7, 1997, letter, sent by the House Majority Leader to the Director, OMB, program evaluations should include all significant evaluations relevant to the development and future assessment of an agency\u2019s plan. The letter suggested that this definition include reviews by the Inspector General, GAO, and others that deal with program implementation and operating policies and practices.", "Moreover, we found that many of the key attributes necessary for a quality plan, which were missing in the May draft plan, have been included in the September strategic plan. These include clear linkages between the agencies\u2019 goals and their statutory authorities as well as the Department-wide goals; a better focus on external goals rather than internal processes (the result of a separation of strategic goals from management initiatives); and a more complete discussion of relevant performance measures, although some agencies are still developing baseline information and targets. For targets included in the plans, it is sometimes unclear whether they are annual or 5-year targets.", "Some of the management challenges facing USDA that we raised in the past have been included in the September plan. For example, reform of the milk marketing orders is included in the Agricultural Marketing Service\u2019s plan as an objective. Similarly, USDA revised its strategic plan to address certain accounting and financial management issues that the draft plan did not adequately address. For example, the strategic plan reflects USDA\u2019s efforts to strengthen controls for establishing and reestimating loan subsidy costs, as required under credit reform. Also, the strategic plan recognizes that additional staff and resources may be needed to ensure that USDA can accomplish the goals set out in the plan for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA\u2019s Strategic Plan Can Be Improved Further", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the suggestions that we have made herein to improve the clarity of some agencies\u2019 plans, some more significant aspects of the strategic plan could be further improved. These improvements include (1) explaining interagency coordination for crosscutting issues and (2) addressing previously identified management problems.", "USDA\u2019s September strategic plan provides more detailed information about other agencies\u2014both internal and external to the Department\u2014that share responsibilities for achieving the stated goals and objectives. The Department-wide strategic overview now includes links to agencies outside of the Department that are important partners to USDA agencies. In addition, the agencies\u2019 plans not only identify the agencies that they coordinate and consult with, in some cases they also identify the specific roles of these other agencies. However, we still could not determine from the information provided in most of the agencies\u2019 plans whether consultations actually took place with these agencies to resolve crosscutting issues. Moreover, we could not determine whether an assessment of duplicative or complementary programs and activities was performed when the agencies were developing their goals and objectives. In addition, we found that while many agencies\u2019 plans explain that stakeholders were consulted during the plan\u2019s development, they usually do not clearly identify the stakeholders. Although this information is not required to be included in the strategic plan by the Results Act, we believe that including information in the agencies\u2019 plans that clearly identifies all stakeholders would be helpful.", "In addition, the September plan still does not include two management issues that we identified in the past. In particular, the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s plan still does not address the numerous problems we have identified in agricultural trade programs. Furthermore, there is little evidence to suggest that substantial progress has been made in addressing our concerns about information technology. Although USDA has added time frames for completing the 14 objectives appearing in its Office of Chief Information Officer\u2019s plan, each time frame has a completion date \u201cthrough FY 2002.\u201d We are concerned about the absence of earlier time frames, or at least interim ones, for resolving major Department-wide information technology problems, such as the Year 2000 issue. By establishing such time frames, it is not clear what priority USDA is really placing on solving its information technology problems or whether the Department has adequate strategies for doing so. In addition, although the Office of Chief Information Officer\u2019s plan includes a number of goals and objectives to better manage its $1 billion in annual investments for information technology, we remain concerned about the lack of information in the plan on the resources needed to accomplish these goals and objectives and how they link to the agencies\u2019 plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our observations on USDA\u2019s strategic plan for the Department\u2019s review and comment.

In addition, USDA made the following observations:", "USDA disagreed with our statement that program evaluations were not used to develop the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\u2019s plan. While we agree that this plan recognizes the importance of using program evaluations to set performance goals, it does not clearly identify how the results of program evaluations were used to develop the strategic plan. Consequently, we have deleted this statement from our report to reflect the agency\u2019s comment, but we would suggest that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service add language to clarify how program evaluations were used to develop its plan.", "USDA noted that while there is no duplication of services between the Agricultural Marketing Service and the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration and the Foreign Agricultural Service, the mission statement of the Agricultural Marketing Service would be clarified, in future versions of the plan, to distinguish it from the mission statements of the other two agencies. In connection with our observation about the Food and Consumer Service\u2019s plan having too many goals that were structured around current programs rather than results, USDA told us that the Food and Consumer Service had considered structuring its plan around a smaller number of generic goals. However, the agency chose to establish six goals corresponding to its existing programs because it believed that a plan structured in this manner would be more meaningful to all interested parties, including external partners and program participants. While we agree that setting up goals around familiar programs and activities may make the plan easier to understand, this approach may ultimately defeat the purpose of the Results Act\u2014which is to require agencies to focus on outcomes by reevaluating what they do and why they do it. Therefore, we would suggest that the Food and Consumer Service consider restructuring the goals in its plan around broader outcomes rather than current programs.", "USDA disagreed with our statement that the Foreign Agricultural Service plan still does not address the numerous problems that we have identified in the past relating to agricultural trade programs. For example, USDA believes that the Foreign Agricultural Service has addressed the concerns outlined in our report entitled U.S. Department of Agriculture: Foreign Agricultural Service Could Benefit From Better Strategic Planning (GAO/GGD-95-225, Sept. 28, 1995) by including information on agency resource allocation, overseas priorities, and trade opportunities under the management initiatives section of the plan. According to USDA, other issues raised by us, such as streamlining the agency\u2019s foreign service, will be addressed in the annual performance plan. Although we agree that some issues that we have raised in the past can be appropriately addressed by including them in the annual performance plan, others cannot. Over the past decade, we have issued a series of reports that raise serious concerns about the fundamental operations of the Foreign Agricultural Service\u2019s export programs, such as the Foreign Market Development Program, Market Access Program, P.L. 480 Program, and Export Credit Guarantee Program. We believe that solutions to these problems will require long-term planning that has not been adequately addressed in the strategic plan.", "Finally, USDA stated that it did not believe that the Office of Chief Information Officer\u2019s strategic plan had to be the medium to address specific solutions to the individual agencies\u2019 issues identified in previous audits. Our observations on the Office of Chief Information Officer\u2019s plan, however, did not discuss the need for specific solutions; rather, we noted that the plan lacked sufficient information on time frames, resources, and how the goals and objectives were linked to other USDA agencies\u2019 plans. We believe that such information is essential to clearly identify what priority USDA is placing on solving its information technology problems and determining whether the Department has adequate strategies for addressing these issues. This is especially important given the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s May 1997 direction to subcabinet officials that fixing USDA\u2019s long-standing, pervasive information technology management problems must be a top priority. USDA also disagreed with our statement that there is a perceived lack of attention on the Year 2000 issue. While we recognize that the plan discusses the Year 2000 issue, we are concerned about the stated time frames for completion for this objective. By stating a \u201cthrough FY 2002\u201d completion time frame for the Year 2000 problem, we believe that the plan does not present an adequate strategy for resolving one of USDA\u2019s most pressing information technology management problems and one that must be solved within the next 2 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issue Area Contact", "paragraphs": ["Robert A.

For example, the mission statement included the core functions of the Department and mentioned the role of businesses and universities but not the important role also played by other government entities. While there were useful linkages among themes, goals, objectives, and responsible components, the goals and objectives were not as results oriented as they could be. The draft plan identified the Commerce bureau responsible for each goal and objective but did not adequately discuss strategies for achieving those goals and objectives or include required information describing the operational processes, staff skills, and technologies, as well as the human, capital, information, and other resources needed to achieve them. Many but not all key external factors were discussed, but the factors that were identified appeared to be used to justify programs rather than to show how those factors could affect the achievement of goals.", "Commerce\u2019s draft strategic plan did not explicitly discuss the other two elements required by the Results Act\u2014the relationship between long-term goals and objectives and annual performance goals and the description of program evaluations used to establish general goals and objectives and a schedule for future program evaluations. The draft plan said that relating long-term goals and objectives to annual performance goals will more appropriately be done in the Department\u2019s future annual budget requests. The draft plan made limited references in various sections to a few past studies of Commerce programs, but those references did not describe how the studies were used to establish general goals and objectives, and the draft plan did not provide a schedule for future program evaluations. Concerning other plan components, the draft plan provided much useful information on Commerce\u2019s statutory authorities. However, the draft plan could have been more useful to Commerce, Congress, and other stakeholders if it had provided a more explicit discussion of crosscutting activities, the major management challenges the Department faces, and the Department\u2019s ability to provide reliable financial and other management and program information to measure achievement of its goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Made in Commerce\u2019s Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["Commerce\u2019s publicly issued strategic plan incorporated improvements in several areas and now addresses, to some extent, all of the elements required by the Results Act. The improvements that the Department made are steps in the right direction and address some but not all of the weaknesses discussed in our July 1997 report on an earlier draft of the plan. The plan\u2019s discussions of strategic goals have been expanded to briefly indicate Commerce\u2019s strategy for achieving each goal. For example, under the theme of keeping America competitive with cutting-edge science and technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a goal to \u201cpredict and assess decadal to centennial change.\u201d The plan now describes how NOAA will approach this goal by addressing questions dealing with air quality, ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, and climate change.", "Also, the plan now more explicitly acknowledges the need to link strategic goals and objectives to annual performance goals and includes an illustrative performance measure for each of the objectives under the three strategic themes. For example, the illustrative performance measure for two of the Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s (PTO) objectives is \u201creduced pendency time.\u201d This illustrative performance measure is one of several that addresses PTO\u2019s goal of granting exclusive rights for limited times to inventors for their discoveries. Similarly, the plan\u2019s three strategic theme chapters now more strongly emphasize the importance of external factors that could affect achievement of Commerce\u2019s strategic goals and identify more key external factors. Under the economic infrastructure strategic theme, for example, the plan now includes a reference to the International Trade Administration\u2019s (ITA) strategy to identify obstacles to U.S. exports and plans for removing such obstacles and marshaling U.S. government resources to eliminate barriers.", "Commerce\u2019s revised strategic plan includes new sections on program evaluations, interagency linkages, and major management challenges. The new section on the role of program evaluations discusses current evaluations as well as future evaluation plans, provides examples, highlights the difficulties in specifying the level and focus of future evaluations because of year-to-year competition for funds, and states that future evaluations for many Commerce bureaus will be included in annual performance plans and budgets. The new section on interagency linkages acknowledges the importance of close interagency ties and emphasizes the Department\u2019s commitment to strengthen those ties by reaching out to other federal agencies with complementary responsibilities. In addition, the partnership sections of the three strategic theme chapters now more fully identify and discuss Commerce\u2019s shared mission responsibilities with other federal agencies. Under the economic infrastructure theme, for example, the plan now emphasizes those aspects of Commerce\u2019s mission that are complementary. It points out that Commerce chairs the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC), a 20-member interagency task force charged by the President and Congress with developing and implementing the National Export Strategy.", "The new section on management challenges recognizes and discusses three of the key management challenges facing the Department that were highlighted in our July report\u2014weather service modernization, Census 2000, and financial management systems. Finally, the usefulness of the plan has been improved by the addition of an index or matrix, which shows which Commerce bureaus are responsible for which strategic themes and goals; and an appendix, which provides clearer and more comprehensive information on, and consolidates in one place in the plan, the statutory and other authorities for the Department and its bureaus, themes, and goals and objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commerce\u2019s Strategic Plan Can Be Further Improved", "paragraphs": ["While the overall quality of Commerce\u2019s strategic plan has been improved since we reported in July 1997 on an earlier draft of the plan, further improvements still could be made in each of the elements required by the Results Act. As we indicated in our July report, the mission statement could be made more complete by explicitly recognizing that several other federal agencies as well as state and local governments also play major roles in the areas covered by Commerce\u2019s three strategic themes. In the export controls area under the economic infrastructure theme, for example, the plan acknowledges that Commerce shares mission responsibilities with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the mission statement does not recognize this or other shared responsibilities.", "Similarly, the treatment of crosscutting functions could clarify Commerce\u2019s role in the three strategic theme areas, specify how the Department\u2019s efforts intersect with or complement the efforts of the other participants, and identify which other government entities Commerce coordinated its plan with and the results of that coordination. The Department\u2019s September 30, 1997, letter transmitting the revised plan to Congress said that Commerce consulted with stakeholders, provided them and congressional committees with copies of its draft plans, and responded to stakeholder and congressional comments. According to Commerce\u2019s transmittal letter, there were no unresolved contrary views concerning its plan.", "The strategies for achieving each strategic goal could be further expanded to specify how Commerce will hold its bureaus and managers accountable for meeting strategic goals and the resources that will be required to meet them. The linkages between long-term strategic goals and objectives and annual performance goals could be improved by (1) making the illustrative performance measures more outcome oriented, such as by using the \u201cnumber of counseling sessions\u201d as a measure of ITA\u2019s economic infrastructure objective to \u201cincrease trade assistance targeted to small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d or (2) showing how the performance measures that were added cause results. The discussion of external factors could identify and discuss more key factors beyond Commerce\u2019s direct control that could affect achievement of its goals, such as congressional concerns about the Census Bureau\u2019s plans for conducting Census 2000, and specify how the external factors that are identified will be addressed or mitigated. The discussion of program evaluations could indicate more specifically how evaluations were used to establish goals/objectives and performance measures.", "Finally, the discussions of Commerce\u2019s major management challenges and its capacity to provide reliable data on performance could acknowledge and discuss more of the major management challenges and data capacity problems that we emphasized in our July 1997 report, such as managing modern information technology and the \u201cyear 2000 computer problem.\u201d Also, the plan could relate identified management challenges, including performance measurement limitations, to Commerce\u2019s strategic goals and objectives, discuss their implications for achievement of its strategic goals and objectives, and indicate more specifically how and when the Department expects to overcome these challenges. The plan could be made more useful to stakeholders and would better meet the intent of the Act if it identified and discussed these types of problems as well as other material weaknesses or high-risk areas, such as NOAA\u2019s fleet for acquiring marine data, that are disclosed in Commerce\u2019s Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act reports or financial statements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Observations on Commerce\u2019s Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["Given the diversity of its programs and activities and its bureaus\u2019 independence, Commerce faced an especially formidable challenge in developing its strategic plan.

The plan\u2019s long-term goals and objectives were succinct and logically linked to its mission statement, and the quality of the goals and objectives reflected the Department\u2019s thoughtful deliberation in its efforts to comply with the Results Act. In addition, the plan addressed in some form all of the Department\u2019s major statutory responsibilities.", "Although the plan presented a logical and fairly complete description of how the Department intends to achieve its mission, we identified a few areas in the draft plan that could be improved. We observed that the plan could benefit from more information, clarity, and context in some of its components. The plan should have included an explanation of the relationship between its long-term goals and objectives and its annual performance goals as well as a complete description and schedule of program evaluations. It could also have better addressed the Department\u2019s major statutory responsibilities.", "The Department has the primary responsibility for implementing federal education policy and programs, but several other federal agencies also provide education-related programs and services. In our past work, we have identified opportunities for consolidating programs in certain areas, such as job training and early childhood education, to eliminate inappropriate duplication. The draft strategic plan did a good job of identifying crosscutting program activities in elementary and secondary programs, but it did not identify or discuss activities for postsecondary programs that require coordination. By discussing the agencies and activities involved with the Department\u2019s higher education programs, the strategic plan could provide Congress with a more complete picture of the scope of the Department\u2019s coordination activities.", "In its discussion of core strategies for achieving its strategic goals and objectives, the Department identified several management challenges it will face in the coming years, but it provides little detail about these challenges and how it will meet them. This type of information could help the Department and its stakeholders identify major management problems that could impede the Department\u2019s efforts to achieve its goals and objectives. Further, stakeholders could benefit from knowing what the Department has done, is doing, or plans to do to address such problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Made in the Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["The Department\u2019s strategic plan issued October 3, 1997, included several significant improvements that make it more responsive to the requirements of the Results Act than its draft plan. The Department\u2019s plan now addresses all six elements required by the Results Act. The plan addressed the relationship between the agency\u2019s long-term goals and objectives and its annual performance plan\u2014the only element missing from its draft plan\u2014by including a matrix linking long-term goals and objectives in the strategic plan with fiscal year 1997 appropriation information and agency programs. The matrix indicated where programs have a significant number of activities or products supporting an objective. Though the strategic plan does not specifically describe how the Department intends to measure the performance of its programs each year, the matrix and the supplemental information on the Department\u2019s performance indicators (shown in appendix A of the plan) provided a better understanding of the relationship between the Department\u2019s strategic and annual performance plans. The Department states that the strategic plan was based, in part, on objectives and indicators in draft program performance plans prepared for key programs in the winter of 1997. According to the plan, the annual performance plan (which includes budget and performance plans for each of the Department\u2019s programs) will further clarify this linkage.", "The Department\u2019s October 1997 plan also provided a description of the program evaluations and assessments that were used to develop each of its four strategic goals as well as evaluations that will help to \u201cinform the implementation\u201d of the plan and provide data for the performance indicators supporting the goals. For example, at the end of the narrative describing Goal 2 (build a solid foundation for learning for all children), the plan stated that early evaluations of the Even Start program and crosscutting evaluations of Goals 2000 and the reauthorized elementary and secondary education programs were used to develop this goal. In addition to the evaluations highlighted in the introduction of each goal, appendix B of the plan described 57 key program evaluations and other studies, including information on when the evaluation data were or will be collected and, in many instances, how often the data will be collected in the future. The Department\u2019s strategic plan also identified agency efforts that will help to avoid duplication among its evaluation efforts and reduce respondent burden.", "In addition, the narrative supporting the Department\u2019s mission statement now encompasses the Department\u2019s major statutory responsibilities. Our review of the Department\u2019s draft plan indicated that it had failed to address the agency\u2019s statutory requirements for basic education for adults, vocational rehabilitation, education of individuals with disabilities, and school-to-work opportunities. In its October 1997 plan, the Department addressed this weakness by including as one of its key agency functions \u201cproviding grants for literacy, employment, and self-sufficiency.\u201d", "The plan more clearly addressed the Department\u2019s civil rights function within the goals and objectives sections. During our review of the Department\u2019s draft plan, we observed that the agency\u2019s civil rights function, although reflected in its mission statement, was not addressed in the plan\u2019s long-term goals or objectives. In support of two objectives related to goals 1 and 4, the Department added strategies for addressing its civil rights function. Objective 1.5 is to get families and communities fully involved with schools and school improvement efforts. In support of this objective, the plan states that the Department will create collaborative partnerships among parents, community groups, and other stakeholders that ensure equal educational opportunity, and provide civil rights training and technical assistance to build these linkages. Objective 4.2 is to provide Education\u2019s partners the support and flexibility they need without diminishing accountability. In support of this objective, the plan adds the following strategy: to build civil rights partnerships to achieve shared civil rights objectives and secure timely improvements for students.", "As required by the Results Act, the Department described in its draft plan several factors outside the agency\u2019s program scope and responsibilities that could negatively affect its ability to achieve its strategic goals. The Department strengthened this discussion in the plan by describing agency actions intended to mitigate against seven key external factors that could affect the achievement of its long-term goals. For example, the plan states that school systems will need to undertake long-term investments in professional development and other capacity-building activities if education reforms are to succeed. Yet, pressures outside of the Department\u2019s control may encourage school systems to focus instead on demonstrating short-term gains. To counter these pressures, the plan states that the Department will (1) work with program and technical assistance providers to highlight the importance of sustained professional development aligned with the standards and (2) emphasize the importance of professional development in its performance indicators.", "Consistent with our suggestions in our July report, the Department\u2019s strategic plan also addressed several other issues. The plan specifically identified coordination activities related to the Department\u2019s postsecondary education programs and activities. It listed interagency coordination and data matches with, for example, the Social Security Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Selective Service as a strategy for ensuring that postsecondary student aid delivery and program management are efficient (objective 3.3). Core strategies to achieve this objective also included working with the Internal Revenue Service on tax refund offsets and address matches and the Department of the Treasury on administrative offsets to increase defaulted student loan collections.", "In addition, the Department has taken the important step to revise the date for its Year 2000 conversion performance indicator. The plan established 1998, rather than 1999, as the year all of its relevant computer systems will be Year 2000 compliant, thus allowing more time for system testing and validation. While the Department had previously included the Year 2000 conversion effort in its draft plan, it established in its current plan December 31, 1999, as the deadline for repairing seven mission critical systems. As we pointed out, the Year 2000 problem is not technically challenging; however, it is massive and complex. With about 800 days before the Year 2000 deadline, the current plan\u2019s performance indicator of assuring that all systems have been evaluated and, where necessary, converted to make them Year 2000 compliant by December 31, 1998, is a major improvement. In recognition of the critical challenge facing federal agencies in dealing with this issue, GAO has added the Year 2000 problem as one of its high-risk areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Observations", "paragraphs": ["The Department has made significant strides in its October 1997 plan in recognizing major management challenges facing the Department. In our review of its draft strategic plan, we discussed the Department\u2019s particularly difficult challenge in improving its information systems for the student aid program. We discussed the problems that the lack of an integrated student financial aid system creates. We also discussed the Department\u2019s reengineering effort, known as \u201cEasy Access for Students and Institutions (EASI),\u201d which was being developed to redesign the entire student assistance program delivery system. In its draft strategic plan, the Department identified EASI as an important part of its core strategy for integrating its aid systems. However, as we pointed out, the project had a history of false starts. We subsequently recommended in another report that the Department should first develop a systems architecture to address system integration deficiencies before proceeding with new major systems development. The Department\u2019s plan eliminated EASI from its core strategies and adopted the broader core strategy of (1) developing an \u201cintegrated, accurate, and efficient student aid delivery system\u201d and (2) ensuring that systems are mission-driven and consistent with the Department\u2019s information technology architecture.", "In our July 18, 1997, report we also highlighted problems with the Department\u2019s management, systems, and processes that affect its ability to ensure financial accountability, particularly among its student financial aid programs. The Department recognized these problems in its strategic plan and listed the following as its most important challenges: (1) student aid systems that are incompletely integrated, (2) financial data from aid programs that are only partially consolidated at the student level, and (3) too many contractors who use different operating systems. The plan stated that correcting this situation will require the redesign and modernization of the federal student financial aid system using the latest information engineering and computer system technology. To address these and other issues, the Department included under Goal 3 a new, separate objective for the management of its postsecondary student financial aid programs: \u201cPostsecondary student aid delivery and program management is efficient, financially sound, and customer-responsive\u201d (objective 3.3). The Department identified with specificity numerous strategies and performance indicators that will help to address and track agency efforts to achieve this objective.", "Postsecondary program management. To improve efforts in this area, the strategic plan states that the Department will develop and utilize a risk management system to target compliance and enforcement activities on poorly performing institutions while reducing burdens on high performing ones. Responding to a recommendation from its fiscal year 1996 Department-wide financial audit, the Department is currently developing this new risk analysis system to better utilize its limited monitoring resources towards the highest risk institutions. However, this system will not be fully implemented until fiscal year 1998. Another Department strategy to improve the management of its student financial aid programs involves expanding the use of the case management approach to maximize the effectiveness of institutional oversight. According to the plan, this approach encompasses review of recertification applications, compliance audits, financial statements, risk management system inputs, and program reviews.", "Financial integrity. The Department stated in its draft strategic plan that poor data from the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) have prevented it from obtaining an unqualified audit opinion on its annual financial statements for the past 4 years. The Department\u2019s plan included several core strategies for addressing this data integrity problem, such as integrating the multiple student aid databases based on student-level records and improving contract performance for major information systems by increased use of performance-based contracting. The Department also added to its plan an indicator to track the accuracy and integrity of data supplied by applicants, institutions, lenders, and guaranty agencies. Data from these sources have been problematic in the past. In addition, the Department\u2019s October 1997 strategic plan included a new performance indicator related to the financial integrity of the Department\u2019s postsecondary financial aid programs. It states that: \u201cThere will be no material internal weaknesses identified in the student aid programs\u2019 portions of the Department-wide financial statement audit and no student aid program issues that prevent the Department from receiving an unqualified opinion on the financial statements.\u201d This indicator is linked to and supports indicator 26, which now definitively states that auditors will issue a clean opinion on the Department-wide financial statements every year.", "Although, in general terms, the plan better specifies how the Department will address this critical financial management weakness, it still has not completely clarified how it will resolve the data integrity issues for FFELP or accurately estimate the government liability that has prevented the Department from obtaining an unqualified opinion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["On October 21, 1997, the Department provided written comments on a draft summary of our observations of its October 3, 1997, strategic plan.

However, our report on the vulnerability of oil supplies observed that, in today\u2019s world oil market, replacing oil imports with domestically produced oil would only marginally lower the potential costs of disruptions because oil prices are set in the global marketplace and the price for all oil rises during disruptions.", "While we agree that one of DOE\u2019s strategies\u2014diversify the international supplies\u2014can lead to measures that contribute to reducing the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to disruptions in the energy supply, our vulnerability report offers five other factors that we believe would better focus DOE\u2019s efforts in developing strategies and measures for its objective of reducing the vulnerability to energy supply disruptions: (1) excess world oil production capacity, (2) the oil intensity of the U.S. economy, (3) the oil dependency of the U.S. transportation sector, (4) world oil stocks, and (5) the dependence of the U.S. economy on oil imports.", "Finally, our July report noted several weaknesses in the information system that DOE uses to track performance measures.

The objectives are largely focused on outcomes, such as reducing the use of illicit drugs, and they are defined in measurable terms, such as increasing the percentage of the nation\u2019s children and adults who have health insurance coverage. The plan also identifies for each strategic objective the key measures of progress. For example, the two measures to determine the reduction of tobacco use are the rate of tobacco use among the young and rate of smoking among adults.", "HHS also added descriptions of its efforts to coordinate both internally among its operating divisions and externally with other departments and agencies. It describes, for example, a range of approaches to improve internal coordination among the various operating divisions, such as special initiatives managed by two or more operating divisions and coordinating councils that integrate planning and policy development across HHS. The discussions of several strategic objectives include a recognition of the need to cooperate with other departments and agencies. For example, the plan indicates that HHS\u2019 substance abuse treatment and prevention programs will work with the Health Resources and Services Administration as well as the Departments of Education and Justice to support an initiative to provide information to communities on the incidence of street and gang violence, domestic violence, and substance abuse and violence.", "The plan is also improved by HHS\u2019 discussion of three types of challenges that could significantly affect its ability to achieve its strategic goals\u2014external factors, management issues, and data administration.

First, its strategies are not clearly linked to the attendant measures of success, making it difficult to determine how the strategies would contribute to the desired outcomes. For example, to increase the economic independence of families on welfare, the plan specifies three strategies\u2014providing technical assistance, promoting employment, and improving access to child care. The four measures of success for economic independence, however, are all related to employment, with no apparent relationship to the strategies for child care or technical assistance.", "Second, the plan does not discuss the effectiveness of the outlined strategies, making no mention of either existing evaluations to indicate what is known about the effectiveness of these strategies or plans for future evaluation to determine their effectiveness. For example, some of the strategies were built around a common HHS approach to support state-administered programs: technical assistance, training, and identifying and disseminating best practices. Yet, we have found in our work on these programs that there have been problems in implementing such strategies: in some cases, HHS\u2019 technical assistance was inadequate, the capacity of regional offices to provide assistance and training was limited, and the dissemination of research and best practices was lacking. In addition to drawing on past evaluations, HHS\u2019 plans should identify future evaluations to determine how well its strategies are working.", "Third, the plan does not discuss the resources required to implement the strategies.

The overview also includes a sixth Department-wide goal of maintaining a departmental strategic management process, which may be an indication of a renewed emphasis by Labor to develop a more strategic approach to departmental management. Other indications of this renewed approach to Department-wide leadership are evident in the similar organizational style of each of the component plans and the clear linkage between the strategic overview and the plans. For example, in the overview, the strategic goals of each of the units/offices are highlighted under the appropriate Department-wide goal; and in each of the plans for the offices/units, the office/unit strategic goals are categorized according to the Department-wide goal to which they correspond.

Instead, the overview discusses the fact that evaluations in the regulatory agencies have lagged behind those in the employment and training area. In that respect, it is even more important that the overview provide schedules or time lines for future evaluations, identify what evaluations will be done, and highlight how future program evaluations will be used to improve performance. Along those lines, we had earlier reported that the experiences of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a pilot could provide insight on how evaluations can be managed. OSHA has been involved in a number of activities geared toward making the management improvements intended by the Results Act.

To fully achieve the purposes of the Act, State\u2019s draft plan needed to be more descriptive and consistent with OMB guidance. For example, the plan contained several sections labeled strategy for specific goals, but it did not specifically identify the actions and resources needed to meet the plan\u2019s goals or include a schedule for taking significant actions. State\u2019s strategies often focused on describing the Department\u2019s role in various areas instead of describing how State\u2019s programs and operations would help achieve the goals.", "We observed that State\u2019s draft plan did not specifically discuss the likelihood that other agencies might have functions similar to or possibly duplicative of State\u2019s role that could affect the formulation and implementation of strategies. administrative systems. These issues were discussed separately in a diplomatic readiness section of the strategic plan. We said that the draft plan would be strengthened if it better described how meeting these management challenges could affect achievement of the plan\u2019s strategic goals. Furthermore, we noted that the draft plan would have been enhanced if it had included a discussion of how the proposed consolidation of State, U. S.

These strategies provide useful information, for example, in explaining how long-term goals will be communicated to employees and how personnel will be assigned accountability for achieving the goals.

For example, Customs\u2019 strategic plan includes a strategy to prevent drug smuggling whose performance measures (the number of arrests, seizures, and convictions, for example) are output oriented. The plan could be improved if more results-oriented measures, focusing on lowered drug smuggling rates, were developed in support of Customs\u2019 strategy to prevent drug smuggling.", "Treasury officials stated that they will attempt to develop results-oriented measures whenever possible, but that performance data may be difficult to collect in some cases, and output measures may be the best data available, at least for the near term. Furthermore, they felt that a balance of output-oriented and results-oriented measures may be desirable since the purpose of performance measures is to determine an agency\u2019s effect on results. Nonetheless, Treasury\u2019s plan could be further improved if results-oriented measures were developed to complement output measures wherever possible.", "As we observed in our review of Treasury\u2019s draft strategic plan, the current plan could also be improved if it explicitly addressed all critical management problems. Although the plan states that it addresses all our high-risk areas and other critical management issues, its discussion of Treasury\u2019s critical management problems is not always explicit. For example, IRS\u2019 accounts receivable\u2014a high-risk area\u2014is not addressed specifically in Treasury\u2019s or IRS\u2019 plan. Both plans contain goals related to increasing compliance with the tax laws and improving customer service, which indirectly could address IRS\u2019 accounts receivable. However, as we previously reported, Treasury\u2019s strategic plan could be more useful to Congress and other stakeholders if it more clearly presented how Treasury will address its critical management problems and how this will facilitate the Department\u2019s achievement of its strategic goals and objectives. performance measures are contained within the plans of the bureaus and program offices. However, the Treasury plan does not address the difficulties of developing measures and collecting reliable data for some important areas of performance. For example, IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms both use taxpayer burden as a performance indicator, but neither agency has adequate measures or data for tracking taxpayer burden. We recognize that developing measures of some areas of Treasury\u2019s performance, such as taxpayer burden, will be very challenging, but the Treasury plan does not discuss how the Department plans to deal with these challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["On October 30, 1997, we obtained oral comments from Treasury officials, including the Director of the Office of Strategic Planning, on a draft of our analysis of Treasury\u2019s strategic plan.

This is an area where VA and Congress can make progress in further clarifying program purposes and expected results.

While VA added discussions of the implications of demographic changes among veterans, they are not linked to specific goals in the plan. For example, VA noted the impact of increased veteran death rates on demands for burials in VA and state veterans\u2019 cemeteries. However, this is not linked to VA\u2019s performance goals to complete specific numbers of cemetery construction and land acquisition projects by fiscal year 2002. Discussions of external factors were often limited to whether Congress would appropriate sufficient funds or make substantive legislative changes.

The OMB guidance states that general goals that are quantitative facilitate this determination, but it also recognizes that the goals need not be quantitative and that related performance goals can be used as a basis for future assessments. However, we observed that many of the performance goals that GSA included in the plan also were not expressed in terms that could easily enable quantitative analysis, which could make gauging progress difficult in future assessments.", "The strategies component\u2014how the goals and objectives will be achieved\u2014described the operational processes, human resources and skills, and information and technology needed to meet the general goals and objectives. This component is an improvement over the prior version we reviewed, and applicable performance goals are listed with each of these factors. Although GSA chose to discuss generally the factors that will affect its ability to achieve its performance goals, we believe that a more detailed discussion of how each goal will actually be accomplished would be more useful to decisionmakers. To illustrate with a specific example, the plan could discuss the approaches that GSA will use to meet the performance goals related to its general goal of promoting responsible asset management using operational processes, human resources and skills, information and technology, and capital/other resources.", "The September 30 plan does discuss, in the general goals and objectives component, an operational/human resource change involving the appointment of a new Chief Measurement Officer in the Public Buildings Service. More discussion of this type of change in the strategies component would help stakeholders better understand GSA\u2019s specific strategies to ensure that it is achieving its goals and objectives. We also noted that the strategies component does not discuss priorities among the goals and objectives. Such a discussion would be helpful to decisionmakers in determining where to focus priorities in the event of a sudden change in funding or staffing. Finally, GSA deferred to the President\u2019s budget its discussion about capital and other resources. We believe it seems reasonable to include in this component at least some general discussion of how capital and other resources will be used to meet each general goal.", "Although the external factors component in the September 30 plan is much clearer and provides more context than the draft plan we reviewed, the factors are not clearly linked to the general goals and objectives. OMB Circular A-11 states that the plan should include this link, as well as describe how achieving the goals could be affected by the factors. This improvement would allow decisionmakers to better understand how the factors potentially will affect achievement of each general goal and objective. The program evaluations component in the September 30 plan provides a listing of the various program evaluations that GSA indicates were used in developing the plan. However, it still does not include a schedule of future evaluations. Instead, the plan states that the schedule for future program evaluations is under development and that GSA intends to use the remainder of the consultation process to obtain input from Congress and stakeholders concerning the issues that should be studied on a priority basis. However, OMB Circular A-11 indicates that the schedule should have been completed and included in the September 30 plan, together with an outline of the general methodology to be used and a discussion of the particular issues to be addressed. decisionmakers understand the crosscutting issues that affect GSA as a central management agency. However, explicit discussion of these issues is limited, and the September 30 plan makes no reference to the extent to which GSA coordinated with stakeholders.", "The September 30 plan references major management problems in the program evaluations component, but it does not explicitly discuss these problems or identify which problems could have an adverse impact on meeting the general goals and objectives. Our work has shown over the years that these types of problems have significantly hampered GSA\u2019s and its stakeholder agencies\u2019 abilities to accomplish their missions. For example, the plan could address how GSA will attempt to ensure that its information systems meet computer security requirements or how GSA plans to address the Year 2000 problem in its computer hardware and software systems. The plan does reference data reliability in the general goals and objectives component. However, the discussion of data reliability, which is so critical for measuring progress and results, is limited and not as useful as it could be in attempting to assess the impact that data problems could have on meeting the general goals and objectives.

We acknowledge that not all objectives may lend themselves to quantification; however, this element of the plan could be more helpful to decisionmakers if more of the objectives had specified time frames, quantifiable targets, or identified base points against which progress could be measured.

However, some of the required elements in the plan could have been strengthened in important ways. For example, for some goals, it was not clear what SSA hoped to achieve and how it planned to measure its achievement, and some goals seemed to overlap. In addition, the plan cited many initiatives that SSA intends to begin or continue without additional agencywide resources and without setting priorities or delineating time frames and schedules. As a result, it was difficult to see how SSA could accomplish all of its planned initiatives. SSA went beyond minimum requirements by providing numerous performance measures.
