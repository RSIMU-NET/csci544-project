If growth in the number of services provided to each beneficiary--referred to as volume--and in the average complexity and costliness of services--referred to as intensity--is high enough, spending will exceed the SGR target. While the SGR system allows for some volume and intensity spending growth, this allowance is limited. If such growth exceeds the average growth in the national economy, as measured by the gross domestic product per capita, fee updates are set lower than inflation in the cost of operating a medical practice. A large gap between spending and the target may result in fee reductions. There are two principal reasons why physician fees are projected to decline under the SGR system beginning in 2006. One problem is that projected volume and intensity spending growth exceeds the SGR allowance for such growth.

A brief look at the updates  resulting from the SGR system since it was enacted by Congress puts  current concerns in context. From 1999\u2014the first year that the SGR  system was used to update Medicare\u2019s physician fees\u2014through 2001,  annual fee increases ranged from 2.3 percent to 5.5 percent. However, in  2002 the SGR system reduced physician fees by nearly 5 percent. Fee  declines in subsequent years were averted only by new legislation that  modified or temporarily overrode the SGR system. For example, the  Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003  (MMA) specified a minimum update of 1.5 percent for both 2004 and 2005.  Absent additional administrative or legislative action, however, the SGR  system is projected to reduce fees by about 5 percent per year for several  years beginning in 2006. These projected declines have raised  policymakers\u2019 concerns about the appropriateness of the SGR system for  updating physician fees and about physicians\u2019 continued participation in  the Medicare program. At the same time, there are concerns about  Medicare spending growth and the long-term fiscal sustainability of the  program.", "My comments today are intended to describe the issues that Medicare  faces in annually updating physician fees and potential approaches for  addressing those issues. Specifically, I will discuss (1) how the SGR  system is designed to moderate the growth in spending for physician  services, (2) why physician fees are projected to decline under the SGR  system, and (3) options for revising or replacing the SGR system and their  implications for physician fee updates and Medicare spending. My  testimony today is based on the findings contained in our October 2004  report on this subject. This work was performed between January 2004  through September 2004 according to generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "In summary, the SGR system is designed to apply financial brakes  whenever spending for physician services exceeds predefined spending  targets. It does this by reducing physician fees or limiting their annual  increase. Historically, efforts that limited fees but did not set spending  targets failed to moderate spending growth. Increases in the number of  services delivered to each beneficiary\u2014known as volume\u2014and the  complexity or costliness of those services\u2014known as intensity\u2014caused  continued increases in spending. The SGR system allows for some volume  and intensity spending growth, but if such growth exceeds the average  growth in the national economy, as measured by the gross domestic  product (GDP) per capita, fee updates are reduced. There are two  principal reasons why physician fees are projected to decline under the  SGR system beginning in 2006. One reason is that projected spending  growth attributable to volume and intensity increases exceeds the SGR  allowance for such growth. The MMA is also partly responsible because it  increased the update for 2004 and 2005\u2014thus increasing spending\u2014but  did not raise the spending targets for those years. The SGR system, which  is designed to keep spending in line with its targets, must reduce fees  beginning in 2006 to offset the excess spending attributable to both  volume and intensity increases and this MMA provision. In general,  proposals to reform Medicare\u2019s method for updating physician fees would  either (1) eliminate spending targets and establish new considerations for  the annual fee updates or (2) retain spending targets, but modify certain  aspects of the current system. Either approach could be complemented by  focused efforts to moderate volume and intensity growth directly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although the current focus of concern is largely on the potential for  several years of declining physician fees, the historic challenge for  Medicare has been to find ways to moderate the rapid growth in spending  for physician services. Before 1992, the fees that Medicare paid for those  services were largely based on physicians\u2019 historical charges. Spending  for physician services grew rapidly in the 1980s, at a rate that the Secretary  of Health and Human Services (HHS) characterized as out of control.  Although Congress froze fees or limited fee increases, spending continued  to rise because of increases in the volume and intensity of physician  services. From 1980 through 1991, for example, Medicare spending per  beneficiary for physician services grew at an average annual rate of 11.6  percent.", "The ineffectiveness of fee controls alone led Congress to reform the way  that Medicare set physician fees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1989 (OBRA 1989) established both a national fee schedule and a  system of spending targets, which first affected physician fees in 1992.  From 1992 through 1997, annual spending growth for physician services  was far lower than the previous decade. The decline in spending growth  was the result in large part of slower volume and intensity growth. (See  fig. 1.) Over time, Medicare\u2019s spending target system has been revised and  renamed. The SGR system, Medicare\u2019s current system for updating  physician fees, was established in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)  and was first used to adjust fees in 1999.", "Following the implementation of the fee schedule and spending targets in  1992, through 1999, average annual growth in volume and intensity of  service use per beneficiary fell to 1.1 percent. More recently volume and  intensity growth has trended upward, rising at an average annual rate of  about 5 percent from 2000 through 2003. Although this average annual rate  of growth remains substantially below that experienced before spending  targets were introduced, the recent increases in volume and intensity  growth are a reminder that inflationary pressures continue to challenge  efforts to moderate growth in physician expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SGR System Designed to Limit or Reduce Physician Fee Updates in Response to Excess Growth in Volume and Intensity", "paragraphs": ["The SGR system establishes spending targets to moderate physician  services spending increases caused by excess growth in volume and  intensity. SGR\u2019s spending targets do not cap expenditures for physician  services. Instead, spending in excess of the target triggers a reduced fee  update or a fee cut. In this way, the SGR system applies financial brakes to  physician services spending and thus serves as an automatic budgetary  control device. In addition, reduced fee updates signal physicians  collectively and Congress that spending due to volume and intensity has  increased more than allowed.", "To apply the SGR system, every year the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) follows a statutory formula to estimate the allowed rate of  increase in spending for physician services and uses that rate to construct  the spending target for the following calendar year. The sustainable  growth rate is the product of the estimated percentage change in (1) input  prices for physician services;9, 10 (2) the average number of Medicare  beneficiaries in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program; (3) national  economic output, as measured by real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita;  and (4) expected expenditures for physician services resulting from  changes in laws or regulations. SGR spending targets are cumulative. That  is, the sum of all physician services spending since 1996 is compared to the  sum of all annual targets since the same year to determine whether  spending has fallen short of, equaled, or exceeded the SGR targets. The  use of cumulative targets means, for example, that if actual spending has  exceeded the SGR system targets, fee updates in future years must be  lowered sufficiently both to offset the accumulated excess spending and to  slow expected spending for the coming year.", "CMS calculates changes in physician input prices based on the growth in the costs of  providing physician services as measured by the Medicare Economic Index, growth in the  costs of providing laboratory tests as measured by the consumer price index for urban  consumers, and growth in the cost of Medicare Part B prescription drugs included in SGR  spending.", "Under the SGR and MVPS systems, the Secretary of Health and Human Services defined  physician services to include \u201cservices and supplies incident to physicians\u2019 services,\u201d such  as laboratory tests and most Part B prescription drugs.", "Under SGR, spending per beneficiary adjusted for the estimated  underlying cost of providing physician services is allowed to grow at the  same rate that the national economy grows over time on a per-capita  basis\u2014currently projected to be slightly more than 2 percent annually. If  volume and intensity grow faster, the annual increase in physician fees  will be less than the estimated increase in the cost of providing services.  Conversely, if volume and intensity grow more slowly than 2 percent  annually, the SGR system permits physicians to benefit from fee increases  that exceed the increased cost of providing services. To reduce the effect  of business cycles on physician fees, MMA modified the SGR system to  require that economic growth be measured as the 10-year moving average  change in real per capita GDP. This measure is projected to range from 2.1  percent to 2.5 percent during the 2005 through 2014 period.", "When the SGR system was established, GDP growth was seen as a  benchmark that would allow for affordable increases in volume and  intensity. In its 1995 annual report to Congress, the Physician Payment  Review Commission stated that limiting real expenditure growth to 1 or 2  percentage points above GDP would be a \u201crealistic and affordable goal.\u201d  Ultimately, BBA specified the growth rate of GDP alone. This limit was an  indicator of what the 105th Congress thought the nation could afford to  spend on volume and intensity increases.", "If cumulative spending on physician services is in line with SGR\u2019s target,  the physician fee schedule update for the next calendar year is set equal to  the estimated increase in the average cost of providing physician services  as measured by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI). If cumulative  spending exceeds the target, the fee update will be less than the change in  MEI or may even be negative. If cumulative spending falls short of the  target, the update will exceed the change in MEI. The SGR system places  bounds on the extent to which fee updates can deviate from MEI. In  general, with an MEI of about 2 percent, the largest allowable fee decrease  would be about 5 percent and the largest fee increase would be about 5  percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Volume and Intensity Growth and Legislated Fee Updates Contribute to Projected Decline in Physician Fees", "paragraphs": ["The 2004 Medicare Trustees Report announced that the projected  physician fee update would be about negative 5 percent for 7 consecutive  years beginning in 2006; the result is a cumulative reduction in physician  fees of more than 31 percent from 2005 to 2012, while physicians\u2019 costs of  providing services, as measured by MEI, are projected to rise by 19  percent. According to projections made by CMS Office of the Actuary  (OACT) in July 2004, maximum fee reductions will be in effect from 2006  through 2012, while fee updates will be positive in 2014. (See fig. 2.) There  are two principal reasons for the projected fee declines: increases in  volume and intensity that exceed the SGR\u2019s allowance\u2014partly as a result  of spending for Part B prescription drugs\u2014and the minimum fee updates  for 2004 and 2005 specified by MMA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Volume and Intensity Growing Rapidly, Partly as a Result of Included Spending for Outpatient Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Recent growth in spending due to volume and intensity increases has been  larger than SGR targets allow, resulting in excess spending that must be  recouped through reduced fee updates.

However, in  July 2004, CMS OACT projected that the volume and intensity of physician  services paid for under the physician fee schedule would grow by   3 percent per year. To offset the resulting excess spending, the SGR  system will have to reduce future physician fee updates.", "Additional downward pressure on physician fees arises from the growth in  spending for other Medicare services that are included in the SGR system,  but that are not paid for under the physician fee schedule. Such services  include laboratory tests and many Part B outpatient prescription drugs  that physicians provide to patients. Because physicians influence the  volume of services they provide directly\u2014that is, fee schedule services\u2014 as well as these other services, defined by the Secretary of HHS as  \u201cincident to\u201d physician services, expenditures for both types of services  were included when spending targets were introduced. In July 2004, CMS  OACT projected that SGR-covered Part B drug expenditures would grow  more rapidly than other physician service expenditures, thus increasing  the likelihood that future spending would exceed SGR system targets. To  the extent that spending for SGR Part B drugs and other \u201cincident to\u201d  services grows larger as a share of overall SGR spending, additional  pressure is put on fee adjustments to offset excess spending and bring  overall SGR spending in line with the system\u2019s targets. This occurs  because the SGR system attempts to moderate spending only through the  fee schedule, even when the excess spending is caused by expenditures  for \u201cincident to\u201d services, such as Part B drugs, which are not paid for  under the fee schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MMA\u2019s Minimum Updates for 2004 and 2005 Contribute to Future Physician Fee Cuts", "paragraphs": ["The MMA averted fee reductions projected for 2004 and 2005 by specifying  an update to physician fees of no less than 1.5 percent for those 2 years.

As a result, SGR\u2019s 2005 fee  updates would have needed to offset the $7.8 billion deficit from excess  spending in 2004 plus the accumulated excess spending of $5.9 billion  from previous years to realign expected spending with target spending.

The other approach  would retain spending targets but modify the current SGR system to  address perceived shortcomings.

Although MedPAC\u2019s  recommended update approach would limit annual increases in the price  Medicare pays for each service, the approach does not contain an explicit  mechanism for constraining aggregate spending resulting from increases  in the volume and intensity of services physicians provide. In 2004  testimony, MedPAC stated that fee updates for physician services should  not be automatic, but should be informed by changes in beneficiaries\u2019  access to services, the quality of services provided, the appropriateness of  cost increases, and other factors, similar to those that MedPAC takes into  consideration when considering updates for other providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retain Spending Targets, Modify Current SGR System", "paragraphs": ["Another approach for addressing the perceived shortcoming of the current  SGR system would retain spending targets but modify one or more  elements of the system.

Although spending for physician services would likely also rise under this  approach, the advantage of retaining spending targets is that the fee  update system would automatically work to moderate spending if volume  and intensity growth began to increase above allowable rates. The SGR  system could be modified in a number of ways: for example, by raising the  allowance for increased spending due to volume and intensity growth;  resetting the base for the spending targets and not requiring the system to  recoup previous excess spending; or removing the prescription drug  expenditures that are currently counted in the SGR system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increase Allowance for Volume and Intensity Growth", "paragraphs": ["The current SGR system\u2019s allowance for volume and intensity growth  could be increased, through congressional action, by some factor above  the percentage change in real GDP per capita.

Consequently, under the SGR  system the additional MMA spending and other accumulated excess  spending will have to be recouped through fee reductions beginning in  2006.
