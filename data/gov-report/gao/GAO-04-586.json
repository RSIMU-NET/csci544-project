DHS developed a draft risk management plan and a process to implement and manage risks. However, DHS does not have a current life cycle cost estimate or a cost/benefit analysis for US-VISIT. The US-VISIT program merges four components into one integrated whole to carry out its mission. GAO also developed a number of observations about the expenditure plan and DHS's management of the program. These generally recognize accomplishments to date and address the need for rigorous and disciplined program practices. US-VISIT largely met its commitments for implementing an initial operating capability, known as Increment 1, in early January 2004, including the deployment of entry capability to 115 air and 14 sea ports of entry. However, DHS has not employed rigorous, disciplined management controls typically associated with successful programs, such as test management, and its plans for implementing other controls, such as independent verification and validation, may not prove effective. More specifically, testing of the initial phase of the implemented system was not well managed and was completed after the system became operational. In addition, multiple test plans were developed during testing, and only the final test plan, completed after testing, included all required content, such as describing tests to be performed. Such controls, while significant for the initial phases of US-VISIT, are even more critical for the later phases, as the size and complexity of the program will only increase. Finally, DHS's plans for future US-VISIT resource needs at the land ports of entry, such as staff and facilities, are based on questionable assumptions, making future resource needs uncertain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act,  2004, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted to the  Congress in January 2004 its fiscal year 2004 expenditure plan for the  United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US- VISIT) program.

An initial operating  capability for entry (including biographic and biometric data collection)  was deployed to 115 air and 14 sea ports of entry on January 5, 2004,  with additional capabilities deployed on February 11, 2004. Exit  capability (including biometric capture) was deployed to one air and  one sea port of entry.", "Increment 1 testing was not managed effectively and was completed  after the system became operational. The Increment 1 system  acceptance test plan was developed largely during and after test  execution. The department developed multiple plans, and only the final  plan, which was done after testing was completed, included all required  content, such as tests to be performed and test procedures. None of the  test plan versions, including the final version, were concurred with by  the system owner or approved by the IT project manager, as required.  By not having a complete test plan before testing began, the US-VISIT  program office unnecessarily increased the risk that the testing  performed would not adequately address Increment 1 requirements and  failed to have adequate assurance that the system was being fully tested.  Further, by not fully testing Increment 1 before the system became  operational, the program office assumed the risk of introducing errors  into the deployed system. In fact, post-deployment problems surfaced  with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)  interface as a result of this approach, and manual work-arounds had to  be implemented.", "The independent verification and validation contractor\u2019s roles may be  in conflict. The US-VISIT program plans to use its contractor to review  some of the processes and products that the contractor may be  responsible for defining or executing. Depending on the products and  processes in question, this approach potentially impedes the  contractor\u2019s independence, and thus its effectiveness.", "A program-level change control board has not been established.", "Changes related to Increment 1 were controlled primarily through daily  coordination meetings (i.e., oral discussions) among representatives  from Increment 1 component systems teams and program officials, and  the various boards already in place for the component systems. Without  a structured and disciplined approach to change control, program  officials do not have adequate assurance that changes made to the  component systems for non-US-VISIT purposes do not interfere with  US-VISIT functionality.", "The fiscal year 2004 expenditure plan does not disclose management  reserve funding. Program officials, including the program director,  stated that reserve funding is embedded within the expenditure plan\u2019s  various areas of proposed spending. However, the plan does not  specifically disclose these embedded reserve amounts. By not creating,  earmarking, and disclosing a specific management reserve fund in the  plan, DHS is limiting its flexibility in addressing unexpected problems  that could arise in the program\u2019s various areas of proposed spending,  and it is limiting the ability of the Congress to exercise effective  oversight of this funding.", "Plans for future US-VISIT increments do not call for additional staff  or facilities at land ports of entry. However, these plans are based on  various assumptions that potential policy changes could invalidate.  These changes could significantly increase the number of foreign  nationals who would require processing through US-VISIT. Additionally,  the Data Management Improvement Act Task Force\u2019s 2003 Second  Annual Report to Congress has noted that existing land port of entry  facilities do not adequately support even the current entry and exit  processes. Thus, future US-VISIT staffing and facility needs are  uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2004 US-VISIT expenditure plan (with related program  office documentation and representations) at least partially satisfies the  legislative conditions imposed by the Congress. Further, steps are planned,  under way, or completed to address most of our open recommendations.  However, overall progress on all of our recommendations has been slow,  and considerable work remains to fully address them. The majority of these  recommendations are aimed at correcting fundamental limitations in the  program office\u2019s ability to manage US-VISIT in a way that reasonably  ensures the delivery of mission value commensurate with costs and  provides for the delivery of promised capabilities on time and within  budget. Given this background, it is important for DHS to implement the  recommendations quickly and completely through active planning and  continuous monitoring and reporting. Until this occurs, the program will  continue to be at high risk of not meeting expectations.", "To the US-VISIT program office\u2019s credit, the first phase of the program has  been deployed and is operating, and the commitments that DHS made  regarding this initial operating capability were largely met. However, this  was not accomplished in a manner that warrants repeating. In particular,  the program office did not employ the kind of rigorous and disciplined  management controls that are typically associated with successful  programs, such as effective test management and configuration  management practices. Moreover, the second phase of US-VISIT is already  under way, and these controls are still not established. These controls,  while significant for the initial phases of US-VISIT, are even more critical  for the later phases, because the size and complexity of the program will  only increase, and the later that problems are found, the harder and more  costly they are to fix.", "Also important at this juncture in the program\u2019s life are the still open  questions surrounding whether the initial phases of US-VISIT will return  value to the nation commensurate with their costs. Such questions warrant  answers sooner rather than later, because of the program\u2019s size,  complexity, cost, and mission significance. It is imperative that DHS move  swiftly to address the US-VISIT program management weaknesses that we  previously identified, by implementing our remaining open  recommendations. It is equally essential that the department quickly  corrects the additional weaknesses that we have identified.

First, it did not agree with  our position that it had not developed a security plan and completed a  privacy impact assessment. According to DHS, it has completed both. We  acknowledge DHS\u2019s activity on both of these issues, but disagree that  completion of an adequate security plan and privacy impact assessment  has occurred. As we state in the report, the department\u2019s security plan for  US-VISIT, titled Security and Privacy: Requirements & Guidelines  Version 1.0, is a draft document, and it does not include information  consistent with relevant guidance for a security plan, such as a risk  assessment methodology and specific controls for meeting security  requirements. Moreover, much of the document discusses guidelines for  developing a security plan, rather than specific contents of a plan. Also, as  we state in the report, the Privacy Impact Assessment was published but is  not complete because it does not satisfy important parts of OMB guidance  governing the content of these assessments, such as discussing alternatives  to the designed methods of information collection and handling.", "Second, DHS stated that it did not fully agree with our observation that the  Increment 1 system test plan was developed largely during and after  testing, citing several steps that it took as part of Increment 1 requirements  definition, test preparation, and test execution. However, none of the steps  cited address our observations that DHS did not have a system acceptance  test plan developed, approved, and available in time to use as the basis for  conducting system acceptance testing and that only the version of the test  plan modified on January 16, 2004 (after testing was completed) contained  all of the required test plan content. Moreover, DHS\u2019s comments  acknowledge that the four versions of its Increment 1 test plan were  developed during the course of test execution, and that the test schedule  did not permit sufficient time for all stakeholders to review, and thus  approve, the plans.", "Third, DHS commented on the roles and responsibilities of its various  support contractors, and stated that we cited the wrong operative  documentation governing the role of its independent verification and  validation contractor. While we do not question the information provided in  DHS\u2019s comments concerning contractor roles, we would add that its  comments omitted certain roles and responsibilities contained in the  statement of work for one of its contractors. This omitted information is  important because it is the basis for our observation that the program  office planned to task the same contractor that was responsible for  program management activities with performing independent verification  and validation activities. Under these circumstances, the contractor could  not be independent. In addition, we disagree with DHS\u2019s comment that we  cited the wrong operative documentation, and note that the document DHS  said we should have used relates to a different support contractor than the  one tasked with both performing program activities and performing  independent verification and validation activities.", "The department also provided additional technical comments, which we  have incorporated as appropriate into the report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that  have authorization and oversight responsibilities for homeland security.

On a  daily basis, the information collected on departed passengers is downloaded to  a CD-ROM.2 The CD is then express mailed to a DHS contractor facility to be  uploaded into IDENT, where a 1:1 match is performed (i.e., the fingerprint captured during entry is compared with the one captured at exit).", "According to program officials, biometric capture for exit was deployed at two  POEs on January 5, 2004, as a pilot.

To be effective, the  IV&V function must be performed by an entity that is independent of the processes  and products that are being reviewed.", "The US-VISIT program plans to use its IV&V contractor to review some of the processes and products that the contractor may be responsible for.

A key ingredient to effectively controlling configuration change  is the functioning of a change control board (CCB); using such a board is a structured and disciplined approach for evaluating and approving proposed configuration changes.", "SEI\u2019s Capability Maturity Model \u00ae Integration (CMMISM) for Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, Integrated Product and Process Development, and Supplier Sourcing, Version 1.1 (Pittsburgh: March 2002).", "According to the US-VISIT CIO, the program does not yet have a change control board.

In particular, the interim approach requires individuals from each system  component to interface with as many as six other stakeholders on system changes.  Moreover, these interactions are via human-to-human communication. In contrast,  the alternative approach reduces the number of interfaces to one for each  component system and relies on electronic interactions with a single control point  and an authoritative configuration data store.", "Without a structured and disciplined approach to change control, the US-VISIT  program does not have adequate assurance that approved system changes are  actually made; that approved changes are based, in part, on US-VISIT impact and  value rather than solely on system component needs; and most importantly, that  changes made to the component systems for non-US-VISIT purposes do not interfere with US-VISIT functionality.", "Observation 7: Expenditure plan does not disclose management reserve funding.", "The creation and use of a management reserve fund to earmark resources for  addressing the many uncertainties that are inherent in large-scale systems acquisition programs is an established practice and a prudent management approach. The appropriations committees have historically supported an explicitly designated management reserve fund in expenditure plans submitted for such  programs as the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Business Systems Modernization and DHS\u2019s Automated Commercial Environment. Such explicit designation provides the  agency with a flexible resource source for addressing unexpected contingencies that can inevitably arise in any area of proposed spending on the program, and it  provides the Congress with sufficient understanding about management reserve funding needs and plans to exercise oversight over the amount of funding and its  use.", "The fiscal year 2004 US-VISIT expenditure plan does not contain an explicitly designated management reserve fund. According to US-VISIT officials, including the program director, reserve funding is instead embedded within the expenditure plan\u2019s various areas of proposed spending. However, the plan does not specifically disclose these embedded reserve amounts. We requested but have yet to receive  information on the location and amounts of reserve funding embedded in the plan.1 By not creating, earmarking, and disclosing a specific management reserve fund in  its fiscal year 2004 US-VISIT expenditure plan, DHS is limiting its flexibility in  addressing unexpected problems that could arise in the program\u2019s various areas of  proposed spending, and it is limiting the ability of the Congress to exercise effective  oversight of this funding.", "In agency comments on a draft of this report, US-VISIT stated that it supported establishing a management reserve and would be revising its fiscal year 2004 expenditure plan to identify a discrete management reserve amount.", "Observation 8: Land POE workforce and facility needs are uncertain.", "Effectively planning for program resource needs, such as staffing levels and facility  additions or improvements, depends on a number of factors, including the assumptions being made about the scope of the program and the sufficiency of  existing staffing levels and facilities. Without reliable assumptions, the resulting projections of resource needs are at best uncertain.", "For entry at land POEs, DHS plans for Increment 2B do not call for additional staff  or facilities. The plans do not call for acquiring and deploying any additional staff to  collect biometrics while processing foreign nationals through secondary inspection areas. Similarly, these plans provide for using existing facilities, augmented only by  such infrastructure improvements as conduits, electrical supply, and signage. For  exit at land POEs, DHS\u2019s plans for Increment 2B also do not call for additional staff  or facilities, although they do provide for installation of RF technology at yet-to-be- defined locations in the facility area to record exit information.", "US-VISIT Increment 2B workforce and facility plans are based on various assumptions, including (1) no additional foreign nationals will need to go to  secondary inspection and (2) the average time needed to capture the biometric information will be 15 seconds, based on the Increment 1 experience at air POEs. However, these assumptions raise questions for several reasons.", "According to DHS program officials, including the Acting Increment 2B  Program Manager, the Director of Facilities and Engineering, and the Program Director, any policy changes that could significantly increase the number of foreign nationals who would require processing through US-VISIT could impact  these assumptions and thus staffing and facilities needs.", "According to the Increment 1 pilot test results, the average time needed to capture biometric information is 19 seconds. Moreover, DHS facilities told us that they have yet to model the impact of even the additional 15 seconds for secondary inspections.", "Moreover, according to a report from the Data Management Improvement Act Task  Force,1 existing land POE facilities do not adequately support even the current entry and exit processes. In particular, more than 100 land POEs have less than 50  percent of the required capacity (workforce and facilities) to support current inspection processes and traffic workloads.", "To assist in its planning, the US-VISIT program office has begun facility feasibility assessments and space utilization studies at each land POE.

We do not agree that the US-VISIT program has a security plan. In  response to our request for the US-VISIT security plan, DHS provided a  draft document entitled Security and Privacy: Requirements &  Guidelines Version 1.0. However, as we state in the report, this  document does not include information consistent with relevant  guidance for a security plan. For example, this guidance states that a  system security plan should (1) provide an overview of the system  security requirements, (2) include a description of the controls in place  or planned for meeting the requirements, (3) delineate roles and  responsibilities of all individuals who have access to the system,  (4) describe the risk assessment methodology to be used, and  (5) address security awareness and training. The document provided by  DHS addressed two of these requirements\u2014security requirements and  training and awareness. As we state in the report, the document does  not (1) describe specific controls to satisfy the security requirements,  (2) describe the risk assessment methodology, and (3) identify roles  and responsibilities of individuals with system access. Further, much of  the document discusses guidelines for developing a security plan,  rather than providing the specific content expected of a plan. 2. Although DHS has completed a Privacy Impact Assessment for  Increment 1, the assessment is not consistent with the Office of  Management and Budget guidance. This guidance says that a Privacy  Impact Assessment should, among other things, (1) identify  appropriate measures for mitigating identified risks, (2) discuss the  rationale for the final design or business process choice, (3) discuss  alternatives to the designed information collection and handling, and  (4) address whether privacy is provided for in system development and  documentation. While the Privacy Impact Assessment for US-VISIT  Increment 1 discusses mitigation strategies for identified risks and  briefly discusses the rationale for design choices, it does not discuss  alternatives to the designed information collection and handling.  Further, Increment 1 system documentation does not address privacy. 3. DHS\u2019s comments did not include a copy of its revised fiscal year 2004  expenditure plan because, according to an agency official, OMB has not  yet approved the revised plan for release, and thus we cannot  substantiate its comments concerning either the amount or the  disclosure of management reserve funding. Further, we are not aware  of any unduly burdensome restrictions and/or approval processes for  using such a reserve. We have modified our report to reflect DHS\u2019s  statement that it supports establishing a management reserve and the  status of revisions to its expenditure plan. 4. We have modified the report as appropriate to reflect these comments  and subsequent oral comments concerning the membership of the US- VISIT Advisory Board. 5. We do not believe that DHS's comments provide any evidence to  counter our observation that the system acceptance test plan was  developed largely during and after testing. In general, these comments  concern the Increment 1 test strategy, test contractor and component  system development team coordination, Increment 1 use cases, and  pre-existing component system test cases, none of which are related to  our point about the completeness of the four versions of the test plan.  More specifically, our observation does not address whether or not an  Increment 1 test strategy was developed and approved, although we  would note that the version of the strategy that the program office  provided to us was incomplete, was undated, and did not indicate any  level of approval. Further, our observation does not address whether  some unspecified level of coordination occurred between the test  contractor and the component system development teams; it does not  concern the development, modification, and use of Increment 1  \u201coverarching\u201d use cases, although we acknowledge that such use cases  are important in developing test cases; and it does not address the pre- existence of component system test cases and their residence in a test  case repository, although we note that when we previously asked for  additional information on this repository, none was provided.", "Rather, our observation concerns whether a sufficiently defined US- VISIT Increment 1 system acceptance test plan was developed,  approved, and available in time to be used as the basis for conducting  system acceptance testing. As we state in the report, to be sufficient  such a plan should, among other things, define the full complement of  test cases, including inputs and outputs, and the procedures for  executing these test cases. Moreover, these test cases should be  traceable to system requirements. However, as we state in our report,  this content was added to the Increment 1 test plan during the course of  testing, and only the version of the test plan modified January 16, 2004,  contained all of this content. Moreover, DHS's comments recognize that  these test plan versions were developed during the course of test  execution and that the test schedule did not permit sufficient time for  all stakeholders to review the versions. 6. We do not disagree with DHS\u2019s comments describing the roles and  responsibilities of its program office support contractor and its  Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)  contractor. However, DHS\u2019s description of the FFRDC contractor\u2019s  roles and responsibilities do not cover all of the taskings envisioned for  this contractor. Specifically, DHS\u2019s comments state that the FFRDC  contractor is to execute such program and project management  activities as strategic planning, contractor source selection, acquisition  management, risk management, and performance management. These  roles and responsibilities are consistent with the FFRDC contractor\u2019s  statement of work that was provided by DHS. However, DHS\u2019s  comments omit other roles and responsibilities specified in this  statement of work. In particular, the comments do not cite that this  contractor is also to conduct audits and evaluations in the form of  independent verification and validation activities. It is this audit and  evaluation role, particularly the independence element, which is the  basis for our concern and observation. As we note above and state in  the report, US-VISIT program plans and the contractor\u2019s statement of  work provide for using the same contractor both to perform program  and project management activities, including creation of related  products, and to assess those activities and products. Under these  circumstances, the contractor could not be sufficiently independent to  effectively discharge the audit and evaluation tasks. 7. We do not agree with DHS\u2019s comment that we cited the wrong operative  documentation pertaining to US-VISIT independent verification and  validation plans. As discussed in our comment No. 6, the statement of  work that we cite in the report relates to DHS plans to use the FFRDC  contractor to both perform program and project management activities  and develop related products and to audit and evaluate those activities  and products. The testing contractor and testing activities discussed in  DHS comments are separate and distinct from our observation about  DHS plans for using the FFRDC contractor. Accordingly, our report  does not make any observation regarding the independence of the  testing contractor. 8. We agree that US-VISIT lacks a change control board and support  DHS\u2019s stated commitment to establish a structured and disciplined  change control process that would include such a board."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Barbara Collier, Gary Delaney,  Neil Doherty, Tamra Goldstein, David Hinchman, Thomas Keightley, John  Mortin, Debra Picozzi, Karl Seifert, and Jessica Waselkow made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal  government for the American people.
