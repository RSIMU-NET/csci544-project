During the Forum on Global Climate Change Modeling, held in October 1994, scientists agreed that the buildup of these gases is creating an enhanced greenhouse effect that will lead to global warming. Specifically, they estimate that the surface temperature of the earth will rise by 1 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit from 1990 to 2050 if emissions continue to grow without restriction. An increase of such magnitude could begin to melt the polar ice caps and, in turn, raise the sea level and alter weather patterns (particularly patterns of precipitation). These changes could bring about the extinction of certain plant and animal species as they shift to adapt to a warmer climate.", "Anticipating that costly actions may be needed to avoid or respond to global warming, policymakers are seeking accurate information about possible future climatic changes. The most highly developed tools now available to project climatic changes are complex computer models called general circulation models (GCM).

Some of this radiation passes back through the atmosphere, and some is absorbed in the atmosphere by the molecules of gas\u2014principally water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons\u2014known collectively as greenhouse gases. These gas molecules act as a partial thermal blanket, trapping much of the heat energy and redirecting it to the earth\u2019s surface and lower atmosphere.

During the past century, as industry, agriculture, and transportation have grown, so, too, have atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases (see app. I). At the same time, the earth has gotten warmer, according to historical data. Recorded temperatures for the period from 1860 through 1993 show a warming trend that generally coincides with the increased use of fossil fuels during the Industrial Revolution\u2014and, hence, with the increased emission of greenhouse gases.", "During the past 50 to 100 years, volcanic eruptions have combined with the increased combustion of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases to increase the concentration of aerosols in the lower atmosphere. Scientists believe that because these aerosols deflect sunlight, they have partially offset the effects of global warming. As a result, scientists surmise, temperatures have not reached the levels projected by GCMs, which do not include the aerosols\u2019 effects.", "To help understand the global climate system\u2019s response to emissions of greenhouse gases, scientists use three types of GCMs: atmospheric, oceanic, and coupled. In general, atmospheric GCMs predict the physical behavior of the atmosphere. Oceanic GCMs represent the physics of the ocean. Coupled GCMs, which scientists regard as the most advanced of the models, physically join atmospheric and oceanic GCMs and treat the evolution of the climate in both domains. To improve predictions of the future climate, modelers are also striving to couple, and to some degree have coupled, (1) the land surface to the atmosphere and (2) the Antarctic sea ice to both the ocean and the atmosphere.", "All types of GCMs process vast quantities of data on variables affecting climate. Using complex mathematical equations to represent the actions and interactions of these variables, the GCMs process the data to project patterns of climatic conditions.

To test the accuracy of a model\u2019s projections, modelers run the model with their best estimates of historical climatic data and compare the resulting projections with records of actual climatic conditions for the period being modeled. Modelers assume that if the model can accurately simulate actual climatic conditions for prior periods, then it can be used to accurately project future climatic conditions.", "Although the earth\u2019s gradual warming since the mid-19th century is generally consistent with GCMs\u2019 estimates of the effects of greenhouse gases (when adjusted for the effects of aerosols), scientists have not been able to attribute the warming conclusively to the enhanced greenhouse effect or to quantify its effects. Specifically, they have not been able to uniquely and quantitatively distinguish the effects of higher concentrations of greenhouse gases from the effects of other factors that can change the climate. Such factors include natural fluctuations in the global climate system, increases in atmospheric ozone, air pollution, and aerosols emitted into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions.

Oceanic models have also simulated the general circulation of the ocean, including the patterns of the principal currents. Coupled models, though still prone to small-scale errors, have simulated the current climate on a large scale as well as portrayed large-scale atmospheric and oceanic structures.", "This progress notwithstanding, the models remain limited in their ability to estimate, with desired accuracy, the magnitude, timing, and regional distribution of future climatic changes. These limitations stem from scientists\u2019 imperfect understanding of the global climate system and computers\u2019 insufficient capacity to perform more detailed simulations. More specifically, the accuracy of the models\u2019 predictions is limited by (1) incomplete or inadequate representations of the processes affecting climate and (2) insufficient computer power.

Atmospheric models do not fully portray the influence of oceanic pressures (currents) and fluctuations in climate, while oceanic models do not fully account for the effects of atmospheric surface winds. The omission or incomplete incorporation of some processes may introduce errors into these models\u2019 projections. For example, atmospheric models tested in 1991 produced systematic errors in their projections of sea level pressure, temperature, zonal wind, and precipitation. Compared with atmospheric and oceanic GCMs, coupled GCMs include more processes and interactions at the ocean-atmosphere interface, but even they do not include critical biospheric and chemical interactions with the atmosphere.

Modelers believe that these models are impaired by a condition known as climatic drift, which results from imbalances in the models\u2019 analyses of heat and moisture variables. These imbalances cause the models\u2019 estimates of temperature and precipitation to deviate from actual conditions. For example, in an experiment conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1988, the models estimated wintertime ocean temperatures that were 7 degrees warmer than observed temperatures for the icebound region of Antarctica and 9 degrees colder than observed temperatures for the tropics.", "Modelers either accept climatic drift or try to correct its effects by inserting adjustments, called flux adjustments. Because flux adjustments artificially improve the models\u2019 performance, their use is controversial. Scientists believe that an increased understanding of the interactions between atmospheric and oceanic variables\u2014and, hence, a more accurate mathematical representation of these interactions\u2014may eventually remove the need for flux adjustments.

Although they have clarified the role of water vapor and improved their ability to model its effects, they are still seeking to understand and accurately model the effects of clouds, which have the greatest potential of all the feedback mechanisms to amplify or moderate global warming. Recent studies have shown that different schemes for modeling cloud formation processes can lead to substantially different projections of the earth\u2019s temperature.

For example, modelers have assumed that the ocean was not warmed by emissions of greenhouse gases before 1985. Although this assumption gains capacity for the GCMs, it introduces an error, called the cold start error, that increases the uncertainty of the GCMs\u2019 predictions. Another oversimplification, the division of the earth into relatively large grids for analytical purposes, prevents the GCMs from accurately predicting regional changes in climate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cold Start Error", "paragraphs": ["Simulations by coupled GCMs that are calculated on the assumption that the ocean was not warmed by increased emissions of greenhouse gases before 1985 do not adequately account for the ocean\u2019s reduced capacity to absorb these emissions.

It will then deflect more of the heat-trapping emissions to the atmosphere, thereby enhancing global warming more rapidly than the models predict.", "While recognizing that the cold start error artificially delays the onset of global warming in GCMs\u2019 predictions, scientists do not know by how much or by how long it distorts the predictions. Overall, they believe that it causes the models to underestimate the change in temperature that will result from the emissions. Modelers have shown that the cold start error can cause projections of the earth\u2019s average annual temperature to differ by as much as 0.7 degrees after 50 years.", "According to scientists, an extraordinary commitment of computer time would be required to project the timing of future temperature changes more accurately.

The intent of the forum was to address requests from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the General Accounting Office to produce a consensus document on issues concerning the use of climate models to inform policy on future climatic changes. This forum, whose participants included agency officials, scientists, and academicians involved in studying the global climate, provided information on the strengths and weaknesses of GCMs, as well as other relevant topics. In addition, we searched four scientific data bases to identify additional assessments of the models\u2019 limitations. Throughout our review, we met with the Director of the Office of USGCRP to clarify technical issues associated with the models\u2019 limitations.", "To identify federal funding for GCMs during fiscal years 1992 through 1994, we obtained cost data by agency from USGCRP. We worked with the Director of the Office of USGCRP to develop an instrument to capture all relevant cost components. We did not independently verify the validity of the cost data.", "On May 12, 1995, we met with the Director of the Office of USGCRP, the Manager of the Climate Modeling Program at NASA, the Deputy Director of the Office of Global Programs at NOAA, and the Manager of the Global Change Research Program at EPA to obtain their comments on a draft of this report. On May 22, 1995, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research provided us with written comments on the draft. These comments integrated the responses of the five agencies included in our review (see app. VI). We have addressed the comments in the text of this report, where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Subcommittee on Global Change Research", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Subcommittee on Global Change Research\u2019s letter dated May 22, 1995. 1. Under the heading \u201cFactors Limiting the Accuracy of Models\u2019 Estimates,\u201d we discussed some of the successes of GCMs to create a context and provide balance for our discussion of the models\u2019 limitations. Later, under the heading \u201cImproving GCMs\u2019 Estimates,\u201d we discussed the efforts that are currently under way to address these limitations and referred to the agencies\u2019 discussion of such activities in this letter. Under the heading \u201cAgency Comments,\u201d we explained why we did not reproduce the report of the U.S. Global Change Model Forum in this report. 2. We added a footnote on page 3 of the report to better explain USGCRP\u2019s role in coordinating federal research on global climate change. 3. We revised our discussion of the models\u2019 limitations (pp. 8-14 of our draft report) as necessary to address the agencies\u2019 specific comments.
