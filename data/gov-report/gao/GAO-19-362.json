To train CMF teams rapidly, CYBERCOM used existing resources where possible, such as the Navy's Joint Cyber Analysis Course and the National Security Agency's National Cryptologic School. As of November 2018, many of the 133 CMF teams that initially reported achieving full operational capability no longer had the full complement of trained personnel, and therefore did not meet CYBERCOM's readiness standards. This was caused by a number of factors, but CYBERCOM has since implemented new readiness procedures that emphasize readiness rather than achieving interim milestones, such as full operational capability.", "DOD has begun to shift focus from building to maintaining a trained CMF. The department developed a transition plan for the CMF that transfers foundational (phase two) training responsibility to the services. However, the Army and Air Force do not have time frames for required validation of foundational courses to CYBERCOM standards. Further, services' plans do not include all CMF training requirements, such as the numbers of personnel that need to be trained. Also, CYBERCOM does not have a plan to establish required independent assessors to ensure the consistency of collective (phase three) CMF training.", "Between 2013 and 2018, CMF personnel made approximately 700 requests for exemptions from training based on their experience, and about 85 percent of those applicants had at least one course exemption approved.

Our report does not address the cybersecurity awareness training that is  delivered to most DOD personnel, nor does it include personnel who have  a mission within DOD\u2019s cyberspace but are not members of the CMF.  The objectives in this report focus on the cyber training standards,  processes, and infrastructure used by CYBERCOM\u2019s CMF personnel.  Wherever possible, we corroborated the results of our analyses with  appropriate officials.", "For our first objective, we reviewed DOD\u2019s cyber training standards and  manuals, as confirmed by officials from CYBERCOM and the military  service cyber components, including CYBERCOM\u2019s CMF Training and  Readiness Manual and its cyberspace training and certification  standards. These documents contain tables that track the revisions  made over time, allowing us to determine the extent to which substantive  changes were made to the standards. In addition, we reviewed  CYBERCOM\u2019s readiness reporting standard operating procedure, which  describes the readiness reporting metrics, including training metrics that  CMF teams must achieve. We also obtained and reviewed three recent  versions of DOD\u2019s phase two foundational training progression\u2014the  specific sets of courses required for all CMF personnel to qualify for the  various work roles in CMF teams. In order to understand how  CYBERCOM and the military services have held CMF personnel to  consistent standards, we compared the current phase two foundational  training progression, updated in November 2017, against prior versions  from June 2014 and December 2016 to document how it has changed.  We interviewed officials from CYBERCOM and its vendors who  implemented the training and officials from the military services who  received the training to understand how DOD ensures that the course  content and progression are consistently applied to all CMF teams. We  reviewed policies and interviewed DOD officials to obtain descriptions of  and comparisons among the phase two foundational course training  progressions from June 2014, December 2016, and November 2017.", "Further, we examined DOD\u2019s reported progress toward its stated goal in  the 2015 DOD Cyber Strategy to build a trained CMF workforce.  Specifically, we reviewed implementation plans and Joint Staff quarterly  status reports issued from September 2016 to December 2017 to  summarize DOD\u2019s reported progress toward achieving full operational  capability for the first wave of 133 CMF teams. To assess the quality of  DOD\u2019s internal controls related to certifying CMF teams as operationally  capable, we compared CYBERCOM\u2019s existing processes against the  standards in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Management\u2019s  Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control and  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.

To  gain further insight into DOD\u2019s progress in maintaining a trained CMF, we  reviewed the Joint Staff\u2019s quarterly readiness reports that characterize the  various levels of resource readiness (personnel, training, equipment  available, and condition of equipment available) reported by each of the  154 teams in the Defense Readiness Reporting System, a DOD-wide  readiness tracking system. We also reviewed and analyzed any training  plans developed by CYBERCOM and the military services to maintain  readiness after achieving full operational capability. For example, we  reviewed plans of actions and milestones produced by the services in  response to a requirement from CYBERCOM to make plans regarding  individual and course equivalency, training execution, and course  validation. We compared the contents of these plans against the  requirements established by CYBERCOM\u2019s guidance.", "Further, we interviewed officials from CYBERCOM\u2019s training and  readiness directorates, the service cyber components, and CMF teams to  learn their perspectives on whether personnel were prepared to perform  their missions as a result of going through CMF training. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s internal readiness reports to determine whether there  were any challenges being reported with regard to maintaining sufficient  capability for CMF personnel. Further, we reviewed DOD\u2019s plan to  transition phase two foundational training for the CMF from CYBERCOM  to the military services after the first wave of CMF teams had achieved full  operational capability. In addition, we interviewed knowledgeable officials  from CYBERCOM\u2019s training directorate, the Joint Staff directorate  responsible for cyber capability requirements, and the service offices  working on training transition with regard to the implementation of this  plan. We compared the standards related to defining objectives from the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which explains  that management should clearly define goals to be achieved, how those  goals will be achieved, and time frames for achievement, against the  practices DOD used to implement its transition plan.", "For our third objective, we reviewed CYBERCOM\u2019s policies with regard to  granting training exemptions for CMF staff based on their previous  education and/or work experience, a process known as individual training  equivalency. We also reviewed the milestones set in the CMF Training  Transition Plan, which required CYBERCOM to establish a master  individual training equivalency policy and master training task lists for  phase two foundational courses by March 2018, and compared  CYBERCOM\u2019s progress in promulgating the training tasks against that  milestone. We collected and reviewed the 69 signed official  memorandums from CYBERCOM\u2019s Individual Training Equivalency  Board reporting the number of applications and individual training  equivalencies the board granted, by course, from September 2017  through April 2018.", "We interviewed and obtained information from individuals from selected  DOD organizations and teams affected by the individual training  exemption process to learn their perspectives on the strengths and  challenges associated with it.

However,  the changes have also negatively affected training time frames,  particularly for the CMF teams composed of National Guard and Reserve  personnel. Because National Guard and Reserve teams are scheduled to  achieve full operational capability after the active duty teams, they are  more likely to be subject to the newer training progressions, which in  some cases require a few additional days of courses.

The manual states that the content should align  with the knowledge, skills, and abilities for the appropriate CYBERCOM  work roles and should meet the joint training standard. Further, the  manual states that the validation of instructional methods examines how  the course is taught and determines whether the methods are appropriate  to support desired course outcomes.", "CYBERCOM\u2019s draft course validation guidance lays out a series of  requirements for the validation process, among which are the following:", "The military service that is submitting the course for validation is  responsible for assembling course information, providing back-up data  about the course, and securing subject matter experts to review the  submission.", "The military service that is the joint curriculum lead for the course is  responsible for reviewing the submissions and offering  recommendations for modifications to courses to reflect joint  standards.", "CYBERCOM is responsible for making final determinations of course  validity. In this final review, CYBERCOM may hold discussions with  key stakeholders, audit the course, review student feedback on the  course, or review evaluation data from the course to inform its final  validation determination.", "Our review of the services\u2019 training transition plans found that the Army\u2019s  and Air Force\u2019s plans address course validation to some degree, but they  do not identify specific time frames for completing course validation.  Specifically, the Army\u2019s plan identifies the milestones, dates, and  resources for the submission of two of its analyst and planner courses to  CYBERCOM for validation, but it does not indicate when the service will  submit its Cyber Protection Team Core Training Course for validation.  The Air Force\u2019s plan establishes a timeline for developing, finalizing, and  distributing course validation guidance, but it does not have time frames  or milestones indicating a time for beginning the process of submitting  courses to CYBERCOM for validation.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government highlights the  need to define objectives in specific terms, to include how objectives are  to be achieved and time frames for their achievement. For example, the  Navy\u2019s plan indicates that the four courses for which it is responsible will  be iteratively validated between fiscal years 2019 and 2021. While a 24- month time frame is broad and it may be challenging for CYBERCOM and  the other services to know with precision when the Navy will complete its  course validation efforts, the plan includes a time frame that CYBERCOM  and the services can use for further discussion and planning purposes.", "The plans submitted by the Army and the Air Force indicate that the  course validation time frames for phase two foundational courses are  unknown because course validation is still dependent upon  CYBERCOM\u2019s review. The Army\u2019s plan includes time frames for  submitting to CYBERCOM two of the three courses it is responsible for  developing, but one of the courses does not have any time frames.  Further, the Air Force plan includes time frames for developing guidance  on how to perform course validation that only carry it through September  2018; it does not have time frames for actually carrying out its course  validation processes.", "As the military services assume phase two foundational training  responsibilities from CYBERCOM, it is important that they coordinate with  CYBERCOM to establish a timeline for course validation, as appropriate.  With a clearer idea of which information can appropriately be removed  from training courses, the services will be able to make informed  decisions to balance the cost-effectiveness of the training with delivering  trained cyber personnel to CMF teams more quickly.

Also, according  to our prior work published in Human Capital: A Guide for Assessing  Strategic Training and Development Efforts in the Federal Government,  training plans should be designed to determine the skills and  competencies a workforce needs to prepare for current, emerging, and  future agency needs in pursuit of its missions. These needs include the  size of the workforce; its deployment across the organization; and the  knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the agency to pursue its current  and future missions. To ensure a strategic workforce planning approach,  it is important that agencies consider how hiring, training, and other  human capital strategies can be aligned to support mission success.", "The Army, Navy, and Air Force developed training transition  implementation plans to address training requirements and execution to  some degree, but the plans do not identify the number of personnel or  teams and the specific training activities needed across all phases of  training to maintain the CMF. For example, neither the Army nor the Air  Force plan identifies the number (average or total) of personnel for each  of the work roles described in figure 2 (for example, cyber operators,  intelligence analysts, linguists) that the military services need to complete  phase two foundational training courses to maintain the appropriate sizing  and deployment of personnel across CMF teams. Additionally, the Army  and Air Force plans do not identify the number of personnel or teams  needed to conduct phase three (collective) and phase four (sustainment)  training in future years.

For example, the Air Force would  know how many Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel would attend  the courses being offered by the Air Force.

CYBERCOM\u2019s CMF Training and  Readiness Manual explains that evaluations are necessary to assess  readiness and provide commanders with a process to determine a team\u2019s  proficiency in the tasks it must perform during a mission. Assessors play  an important role in this evaluation process by judging the performance of  CMF teams using CYBERCOM\u2019s evaluation forms, which establish  common evaluation criteria to determine whether the team being  evaluated has met the certification standards. CYBERCOM officials told  us that to evaluate teams completing phase three certification through  CYBERCOM events (approximately 50 percent, according to agency  officials), the command provided a joint team of assessors. CYBERCOM  and service officials told us that the services provided their own  assessors for teams that completed phase three training through their  respective service-hosted exercises.", "In discussions with Army and Air Force officials, they identified two  challenges they have experienced with the services providing assessors  to evaluate their own teams, which could lead to subjectivity in CMF team  evaluations. First, in some instances the assessors have come from  within the same chain of command as the CMF team and thus are not  truly independent. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government discusses the importance of segregation of duties in  designing control activities so that incompatible duties are segregated in  order to mitigate the risk of management override of internal control. In  this case, having an assessor from the same chain of command evaluate  a CMF team\u2019s performance in a certification event presents an increased  risk of fraud through management override.", "Second, while the CMF Training and Readiness Manual includes  checklists that assessors can use to evaluate team performance,  according to service officials, the manual does not provide clear guidance  on how to evaluate whether the tasks and performance standards have  been sufficiently met by the team. The absence of such information could  lead to subjective evaluations as to whether a team met the desired  performance standard. According to one service official, these challenges  could be addressed if CYBERCOM were to provide an expert who  evaluates the training tasks and performance standards\u2014an action that  could lead to a more consistent application of evaluation criteria.", "When we asked officials from CYBERCOM\u2019s training directorate about  whether the command could provide more oversight for certification  events, the officials acknowledged that, among other tasks, the command  is responsible for ensuring that assigned joint cyber forces are trained,  certified, and interoperable with other forces. The officials said that to do  this, the command will use established training standards and develop a  plan to train and certify CMF team evaluators to a set of standardized  criteria. Command officials said they believe this will enable the services  and CMF teams to have qualified assessors who are trained and certified  by CYBERCOM to consistently evaluate the performance of the CMF  teams based on joint standards. With this capability, for example, a Navy  Cyber Protection Team assessor can be used by an Army Cyber  Protection Team to evaluate that team in an operation, exercise, or  training event. This training capacity should enhance the interoperability  between the services and allow for consistent evaluation of a team\u2019s  performance.", "However, as of June 2018, CYBERCOM had not provided a plan to train  and certify assessors from across the services; as such a plan had not  yet been developed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government explains that in defining objectives, management should  clearly define what is to be achieved, how it will be achieved, and the time  frames for achievement. Documenting these objectives in a plan also  will help formalize the new process and ensure that the appropriate  managerial emphasis is given to the effort. DOD has used similar  mechanisms to implement changes to cyber training in the past, such as  developing the CMF Training Transition Plan in response to moving  phase two foundational training responsibility from CYBERCOM to the  military services. Since phase three certification events act as a quality  control mechanism for CMF teams, it is important that the events be  independently evaluated to ensure that CMF teams are trained to a  consistent standard. Without a documented plan to train and certify  assessors to evaluate CMF phase three collective training certification  events, the CMF teams will not be consistently evaluated as they are  operationally certified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CYBERCOM Has Leveraged Other Cyber Experience to Meet Training Requirements, but It Has Not Established Master Training Task Lists for Courses", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CYBERCOM Has Established a Training Exemption Process for CMF Personnel Who Have Relevant Prior Experience", "paragraphs": ["CYBERCOM assesses the prior experience of CMF personnel to meet  training requirements through a process known as individual training  equivalency.

CYBERCOM  established an Individual Training Equivalency Board consisting of  subject matter experts and representatives from CYBERCOM, the  National Security Agency, and service cyber components who review the  applications and recommend whether equivalency should be granted.  The Individual Training Equivalency Board reviewed approximately 700  applications for equivalency from September 2013 through April 2018,  and more than three-quarters of those applicants had at least one course  exemption approved.", "According to officials from CYBERCOM\u2019s training directorate, which is  responsible for administering the individual equivalency process, there  are a number of reasons why requests for course exemptions are not  approved. For example, some applicants are denied for administrative  reasons, such as not filling out the paperwork correctly. Also, applicants  are not eligible to receive exemptions for courses that are not part of their  work role requirements, but some personnel try to do so. Officials also  said that board members do not deem some applicants\u2019 reported  experiences as comparable to the knowledge and skills they would obtain  from taking courses for which they seek exemptions.", "Based on our review CYBERCOM\u2019s memorandums that document the  approval or disapproval of approximately 700 individual requests for  training exemptions, we observed that applicants typically requested  exemptions for multiple courses, with some seeking exemptions for up to  16 courses. Altogether during this period, we found that CYBERCOM  granted more than 1,400 equivalencies for approximately 90 different  phase two foundational training courses. Certain courses were exempted  more often than others. For example, the course for which CYBERCOM  most frequently granted individual exemptions was the Joint Advanced  Cyber Warfare Course. This 4-week course provides an orientation to  CYBERCOM, the global cryptologic platform, the intelligence community,  and allies and major partners in the conduct of cyber warfare operations,  planning, and analysis of effects.", "Other courses that were commonly granted training exemptions included  1-week courses related to computer network exploitation, cyber offensive  and defensive operations, and understanding network and operating  system fundamentals. These courses teach the basic skills associated  with performing CMF operations. Additionally, we found that  CYBERCOM\u2019s Individual Training Equivalency Board approved  approximately 50 exemptions for Intermediate Cyber Core, which is an 8- week course that CYBERCOM training officials described as providing  the background and proficiency needed to identify, understand, and  navigate the digital environment.
