However, differences between future staffing levels it projects are appropriate to meet mission needs and actual staffing levels still exist due to unanticipated events and other factors. GAO reported in 2006 that State\u0092s Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing and Innovation (M/PRI) had not been conducting its rightsizing reviews consistently. Some reviews discussed various rightsizing elements, such as outsourcing, while others did not. State has since improved the consistency of its reviews by developing a variety of methodological tools and a standard template which it applies to each post. GAO found that over half of the 144 rightsizing projections analyzed were within 10 percent of actual staffing levels as of December 2011. In contrast, over 40 percent of the posts have staffing level differences of over 10 percent. Unanticipated events and other factors, such as changes in policies, contributed to these differences. For example, according to the management officer in Mozambique, M/PRI projected staffing increases as a result of the President\u0092s program to combat AIDS, but the actual funding level for the program was much higher than anticipated. This resulted in higher actual staffing levels for both U.S. direct-hire and locally-employed staff positions.", "Rightsizing reviews contain recommendations to improve post operations and eliminate duplicative services and positions. To develop its recommendations, M/PRI reviews the levels of all staff at posts and seeks input from State and non-State agencies. M/PRI relies on non-State agencies to determine independently their own staffing needs. Many of State\u0092s recommendations for a specific post focus on the level of State\u0092s administrative or management staff, rather than State\u0092s programmatic staff or staff from other agencies. Some State officials stated that the activities of administrative and management staff are better suited to quantitative measurement while the qualitative nature of programmatic staff activities, such as discussing policy issues with foreign diplomatic counterparts, is more difficult to measure.", "State\u0092s use of rightsizing reviews varies, and State does not follow up on review recommendations. State\u0092s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations uses the staffing projections in rightsizing reviews to plan the size of new embassy compounds. Further, M/PRI uses rightsizing reviews when it assesses requests by State or other agencies to add staff to overseas posts, although the final decision is made by the respective Chief of Mission. In addition, Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials said that they incorporate rightsizing reviews into their annual staffing planning exercise, and some post officials said that they refer to rightsizing reviews to support staffing changes. Some U.S. officials stated that undertaking the rightsizing process acts as a check on growth in overseas staffing levels. However, some State regional bureau officials said that they do not actively use the reviews except as a historical overview of staffing, and some post officials said that they do not use the reviews at all. State often uses documents other than rightsizing reviews for decisions in areas including staffing levels. Finally, State does not monitor the implementation of rightsizing review recommendations and has not designated an office with responsibility for their implementation. State issues an annual report to Congress in which it lists the rightsizing reviews it has completed, number of positions recommended for elimination, and potential cost savings; the report does not address whether recommendations have been implemented. Because State does not track or report on the implementation of recommendations, State cannot determine if rightsizing reviews are achieving their purpose of aligning overseas staffing levels with U.S. priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of State designate the appropriate entities to ensure that rightsizing recommendations are addressed and to track and report the actions taken to implement the recommendations.

In 2004, Congress mandated the establishment of the Office of  Rightsizing within the Department of State (State). This office, now part  of the Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing and Innovation (M/PRI),  reviews staffing levels for all U.S. government agencies at every overseas  mission once every 5 years and before undertaking all capital  construction projects. The office also projects future staffing levels that it  determines are appropriate to meet the missions\u2019 needs and recommends  ways to improve efficiency. Since 2002, we have conducted several  reviews related to U.S. government staffing overseas. In these reviews,  we examined the rightsizing process and issues related to the  construction of new facilities overseas, among other things. In 2006, we  found that the information presented within rightsizing reviews varied from  post to post, and the rightsizing elements that the posts evaluated and  reported were not consistent.", "In response to your request, we examined (1) the consistency of State\u2019s  approach to conducting rightsizing reviews and how its projections  compare to actual staffing levels; (2) the focus of State\u2019s rightsizing  recommendations; and (3) the extent to which State uses its rightsizing  reviews and monitors implementation of recommendations.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed rightsizing guidance, related  legislation, 181 rightsizing reviews State undertook from 2005 through  2011, and previous GAO reports related to U.S. government staffing  levels overseas.

We conducted site visits at 3 of the posts: Prague, the Czech  Republic; Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Kuwait City, Kuwait. We  communicated via teleconference and other means with the additional  posts. To compare projected staffing levels in rightsizing reviews with  actual staffing levels as of December 2011, we compared staffing data  from State\u2019s personnel database as of December 2011 with the staffing  projections of 144 rightsizing reviews State conducted from 2006 through  2011. We did not include all of the rightsizing reviews in the comparison  between the actual and projected staffing levels for various  methodological reasons, such as data reliability concerns and review time  frames that were outside the scope of our analysis. To assess the  reasons for the differences between the projection and the actual staffing  levels, we constructed a composite index for each country taking into  account the differences in staffing levels for various personnel categories.  We then sent questions to the management officers in 10 countries with  the highest indices: 5 for reviews that had projected staff levels that were  higher than actual levels and 5 for those that had projected levels that  were lower than actual levels. In addition, we discussed rightsizing with  State officials in Washington, D.C., from M/PRI, State\u2019s regional bureaus,  the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), the Bureau of  Diplomatic Security, and the Bureau of Consular Affairs. We also  discussed rightsizing with officials from non-State agencies based in  Washington, D.C. or overseas, including the Departments of Defense  (DOD); Commerce; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; and  Justice; and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

This legislation was  intended to result in the reallocation of resources to achieve a leaner,  streamlined, more agile and secure U.S. government presence abroad.  The conference report accompanying the legislation establishing the  Office of Rightsizing stated that a proper rightsizing plan should include a  systematic analysis to bring about a reconfiguration of overseas staffing  to the number necessary to achieve U.S. foreign policy needs, and noted  that rationalizing staffing and operations abroad had the potential for  significant budgetary savings. The office was directed by the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee to review all U.S. government staffing  overseas, including all American and foreign national personnel, in all  employment categories. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also  directed OBO to work closely with M/PRI to ensure that projected staffing  levels for new embassy compounds were prepared in a disciplined and  realistic manner, and that these estimates become a basis for  determining the size, configuration, and budget of new embassy  construction projects.", "M/PRI conducts rightsizing reviews before each construction project and  on each mission every 5 years, among other responsibilities. M/PRI  focuses on streamlining staffing levels by, for example, consolidating or  outsourcing administrative functions. M/PRI also looks for opportunities to  substitute less expensive, locally-employed staff for more expensive U.S.  direct-hire employees. According to the guidance M/PRI provides to  overseas missions, a rightsizing analysis may lead to the reallocation of  resources from one mission goal to another and to enhancing operational  efficiency through regionalization and centralization. M/PRI uses GAO\u2019s  definition of rightsizing: aligning the number and location of staff assigned  overseas with foreign policy priorities, security concerns, and other  constraints. Rightsizing may result in the addition or reduction of staff, or  a change in the mix of staff at a given embassy or consulate. M/PRI\u2019s  guidance stresses that all sections and agencies of an overseas mission  should be included in a rightsizing analysis.", "In the first step of the rightsizing process, overseas missions, generally  led by the mission\u2019s management officer, prepare a report for M/PRI  outlining their strategic goals, current staffing data for all agencies, and  projected staffing levels 5 years into the future. State and non-State  agencies present at an overseas mission provide their staffing data to be  included in the mission\u2019s submission to M/PRI. M/PRI officials stated that,  under their current process, an M/PRI analyst usually visits the mission to  assist in preparing the rightsizing report. After a mission completes its  rightsizing report, the relevant regional bureau approves the submission  before sending it to M/PRI. Next, M/PRI conducts its analysis of staffing at  the mission, coordinating with the headquarters of non-State agencies to  confirm the numbers provided at the mission for those agencies. When  M/PRI completes a draft rightsizing review, other State bureaus and  agencies have the opportunity to review and discuss it. According to  officials from State bureaus, they frequently engage in a dialogue with  M/PRI to negotiate the staffing projections to be published in the  rightsizing review and in a majority of cases, differences in projected  staffing numbers are resolved through these discussions. Once all  bureaus and agencies have reviewed the rightsizing review document,  M/PRI finalizes and publishes it on an internal State website.

M/PRI  officials stated that their reviews are now more standardized than in the  past. The reviews now contain the same types of information in a similar  format and have a more uniform level of detail. The required elements of  a rightsizing review include detailed analysis of current and projected staff  for each section of an overseas mission, as shown in table 1. M/PRI has  also refined its methodology for analyzing administrative, management,  and program staff. M/PRI has developed uniform guidance for staff at  overseas missions to use in preparing rightsizing submissions.

These tools are ratios and  formulas that compare missions considered similar in size, foreign policy  priority, and management and administrative requirements, and help  M/PRI to determine what it believes to be appropriate staffing levels in  each section of an overseas post. The total management ratio, for  example, is the number of customer units divided by the number of U.S.  direct-hire management positions. Further, the level of program staff is  analyzed using two tools\u2014the Four Factor Index and diplomatic density.  The Four Factor Index is an attempt to measure a country\u2019s theoretical  foreign policy importance to the United States using a combination of  factors such as population, gross domestic product, trade volume with the  United States, and U.S. foreign assistance. Diplomatic density is an effort  to quantify the size of the U.S. diplomatic presence in a country with  respect to U.S. interests in that particular country. It is calculated by  dividing the number of diplomatic direct-hire positions present in a given  country by the Four Factor Index. According to M/PRI officials, diplomatic  density tends to be relatively low in developed countries with which the  United States has close relations, such as Canada, Japan, and Germany,  or where our interests are limited or primarily humanitarian. Diplomatic  density may be higher where the United States has or has recently had  difficult relations or where vital security interests are at stake, such as in  Russia and many of the countries in the Middle East.", "Many post officials we spoke with considered M/PRI\u2019s standardized  analysis appropriate but emphasized the need for flexibility to account for  varying circumstances at each post.

For example, one management officer  stated that the rightsizing review found that locally-employed staff at post  had heavier workloads than their counterparts at similar posts. The post  used this analysis as justification for requesting more locally-employed  staff positions.", "According to non-State officials, M/PRI generally coordinates with other  agencies in preparing rightsizing reviews of U.S. government staffing  overseas. In 2006, we reported that coordination with other agencies in  the rightsizing process was initially limited. Non-State agencies had  voiced a number of concerns regarding their interaction with the Office of  Rightsizing, including their desire for greater participation in the rightsizing  process.

A foreign government\u2019s decision to eliminate program  funding or request the closure of a U.S. program usually leads to lower  staffing levels, as in the following examples.", "According to the Deputy Chief of Mission in Kuwait, the decrease in  Kuwaiti government funding for the Office of Military Cooperation- Kuwait caused the post to reduce staffing levels beginning in 2009.  In 2008, the Bolivian government ordered the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Agency to leave Bolivia, leading to an unexpected reduction in staff,  according to the management officer in Bolivia.", "According to the management officer in Libya, staff levels decreased  after the evacuation and destruction of the U.S. embassy in February  2011.", "Additionally, some posts reported that they were unable to carry out the  relatively large reductions in staffing levels projected in the rightsizing  reviews, usually for locally-employed staff positions. M/PRI projected  sizeable reductions in locally-employed staffing levels for posts through  outsourcing or contracting. However, some posts reported that a lack of  viable service options in the local economy made it unfeasible to  outsource or contract services. For example,  In Mozambique, outsourcing services such as the motor pool,  customs shipping, travel services, and warehousing are not feasible  due to the country\u2019s poor infrastructure, according to a management  officer in the country.  In Bangladesh, according to a management officer in the country, the  post does not contract custodial services, warehouse services, or car  repair as recommended by the rightsizing review because no local  contracting options exist.

To develop its recommendations, M/PRI reviews the levels of all  staff at missions and seeks input from both State and non-State agencies.  Many of M/PRI\u2019s recommendations that we analyzed focused on State  administrative and management staff rather than programmatic staff or  staff from other agencies. Officials stated that administrative and  management functions are where greater efficiencies are considered  likely to be achieved. M/PRI recommendations may include outsourcing  or regionalization of administrative functions such as voucher processing  or warehousing. These changes affect administrative staff responsible for  those functions, at times addressing dozens of positions filled by locally-  employed staff. In Albania, for example, the rightsizing review  recommended a reduction of over half of the locally-employed staff non- desk positions, from 216 to 93, mainly through outsourcing of guard  services. In Bangladesh, the rightsizing review recommended eliminating  27 locally-employed non-desk staff positions out of a total of 192 to  improve the efficiency of administrative functions, such as building,  gardening, and custodial services. The review found that the number of  square meters maintained per service provider for both residential and  non-residential buildings in Bangladesh was lower than the worldwide  median. For example, the review found that the area a service provider  maintained in Bangladesh was less than half that in other posts for non- residential buildings and thus deemed the service to be inefficient. It  recommended eliminating a sufficient number of positions to bring the  ratio of square meters per service provider on par with other posts.", "According to State officials, the focus on management services is  appropriate because that is where duplication of effort is most likely to  occur. State officials said that it is easier to apply M/PRI\u2019s quantitative  tools to administrative and management staff activities than to  programmatic activities. According to State officials, administrative or  management work is better suited to measurements that can be  compared across posts. For example, voucher examiners can record the  volume of vouchers handled in a given time and the length of time they  take to process. M/PRI has developed tools to assess the level of  administrative support needed at posts of different sizes and has used  those tools to compare posts of similar size. By comparing the efficiency  of administrative services across similar posts, M/PRI has developed  targets that posts should meet and uses these targets to identify posts  that may be under- or overstaffed in administrative functions. For  example, the rightsizing review for Paraguay recommended that the  embassy cut one U.S. direct-hire position in administrative services  support, a general services officer. This recommendation was based on  comparing the workload of Paraguay\u2019s service providers with workloads  of service providers at similar posts\u2014Uruguay, Croatia, and Cyprus.  Rightsizing reviews also evaluate whether posts can utilize locally-  employed staff in a position rather than a more costly U.S. direct hire. For  example, the 2010 rightsizing review for Kenya recommended that the  post use appointment-eligible family members to serve in office  management positions instead of U.S. direct hires. According to M/PRI,  the cost of employing these appointment-eligible family members is only a  fraction of U.S. direct-hire employees and helps minimize the American  footprint in dangerous overseas environments. In addition, M/PRI  recommended that appointment-eligible family members be considered  for employment if host country nationals are unavailable or present an  unacceptable risk.", "According to State officials, it is more difficult to quantify the workload of  program staff such as political officers than that of administrative and  management staff. M/PRI has developed methodological tools to  measure a post\u2019s diplomatic density and foreign policy priority for  comparison with similar posts. However, State officials said that it is  difficult to assess the efficiency of program staff due to the qualitative  nature of their activities, such as discussing policy issues with their  diplomatic counterparts or drafting briefing documents for visiting officials.  Nevertheless, M/PRI makes recommendations regarding programmatic  staff where possible. In Kuwait, for example, the 2010 rightsizing review  recommended the periodic reevaluation of the political and economic  sections to assess the possibility of combining them. In some cases,  M/PRI has made broader recommendations for posts to review levels of  staff across an entire region. For example, M/PRI recommended that the  Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs reevaluate an appropriate  presence in former Warsaw Pact country posts, given that the political  and economic environment in these countries has shifted dramatically  during the past 2 decades."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Does Not Often Make Recommendations Directed at Other U.S. Government Agencies and Relies on These Agencies to Determine Their Own Staffing Needs Overseas", "paragraphs": ["M/PRI reviews all U.S. government staffing overseas and incorporates  staffing data and projections from non-State agencies with a presence  overseas.

M/PRI generally does not analyze staffing numbers of  other U.S. agencies overseas or make recommendations affecting these  staff. Instead, M/PRI officials stated that they rely on these agencies to  conduct their own rightsizing assessments and determine independently  what their staffing needs will be for each post. M/PRI infrequently makes  recommendations to other agencies, such as USAID. For example, M/PRI  recommended that USAID evaluate the distribution of its staff in Central  America, questioning the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of high  USAID staffing levels in El Salvador and suggesting that USAID\u2019s  development resources could be better utilized elsewhere in Central  America. However, such broader recommendations are an exception in  rightsizing reviews and not a common occurrence, according to M/PRI  officials.", "According to some bureau officials, non-State agencies that are relatively  new to operating overseas have been slow to acclimate to the rightsizing  process. State officials noted that non-State agency officials in  Washington might have a different view of long-range overseas staffing  needs than their agency officials at post. Several officials from different  regional bureaus said that agencies prefer to conduct their own strategic  planning and staffing exercises and view rightsizing as an activity internal  to State. Officials from several non-State agencies confirmed that they  conduct their own internal staffing analyses. For example, officials from  the Department of Homeland Security noted that they review overseas  staffing on an ongoing basis, since current events dictate the  department\u2019s operational needs. Similarly, officials from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention stated that they evaluate overseas  staffing through annual updates to their strategic staffing plan and look for  opportunities to reduce U.S. direct hires by empowering locally-employed  staff to serve in senior management and leadership positions.

In addition, some  State officials stated that rightsizing is the only comprehensive process to  verify the number of overseas positions and the personnel occupying  them.", "The reviews that precede the construction of a new diplomatic compound  have the most impact, according to M/PRI\u2019s fiscal year 2010 report to  Congress, because OBO uses the rightsizing projections to plan the size  and estimate the preliminary costs of such projects. OBO officials told us  that using rightsizing reviews to plan new construction is a significant  improvement over the process previously used, which was informal and  not systematic. Rightsizing reviews must accompany any proposal for  new construction that is sent to the Office of Management and Budget  and to Congress. While OBO bases its construction plans on M/PRI\u2019s  rightsizing review, OBO officials stated that they also verify the staffing  numbers in the rightsizing reviews with the staffing numbers in personnel  databases and with agency and post officials. If post staffing levels  increase by more than 10 percent (the amount of growth space OBO  builds in) after a project has started, OBO asks M/PRI to do a rightsizing  revision to obtain more accurate numbers and improve construction  planning, according to OBO officials. Regional bureau officials stated  that they and post officials pay particularly close attention to rightsizing  reviews that are conducted in preparation for construction because they  want to ensure that OBO plans enough space for the new diplomatic  compounds.", "Further, M/PRI and post officials stated that they use rightsizing reviews  when assessing requests by State or other agencies through the NSDD- 38 process to add staff to overseas posts, although the final decision on  requests is made by the chief of mission. An M/PRI official stated that  rightsizing reviews are intended to be used by the chief of mission to  inform decisions on staffing, including those made through the NSDD-38  process. A few post management officers told us that the rightsizing  process had prompted posts to review staffing requests more carefully.  One management officer said that the rightsizing process also prompted  a more substantial justification for NSDD-38 requests, adding  organization and structure to the decision-making process. Another  management officer said that rightsizing prompted the post to launch a  new internal mechanism to control growth. The post instituted an internal  pre-NSDD-38 vetting process requiring each office or agency to justify the  need for a requested position via internal memorandum and explain how  it would be funded and address other logistical needs (such as available  office space).", "In addition, some officials from State bureaus and posts told us that they  use rightsizing reviews in a variety of other ways. Bureau of Diplomatic  Security officials said that they use rightsizing reviews in conjunction with  Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports, annual Mission Strategic   and other information to make resource  Resource Plans (MSRP),allocation decisions in their annual staffing planning exercise. In addition,  an official in Kuwait said that she read the rightsizing review when she  arrived at post because it gave a more concise summary of conditions at  post than other documents, such as the MSRP. Further, a regional  bureau official stated that the primary value of rightsizing was that it  forces missions to systematically collect information and plan for future  staffing. Several officials stated that undertaking the rightsizing process  acts as a check on growth in overseas staffing levels. For example,  M/PRI\u2019s fiscal year 2011 report to Congress states that M/PRI projected  42 fewer U.S. direct-hire positions than missions had projected.", "Some post officials, particularly those in management functions, said that  they refer to rightsizing reviews to support staffing changes. For example,  the management officer in Paraguay stated that the post concurred with  the rightsizing recommendation to eliminate an assistant general services  officer position; post officials are now in the process of abolishing the  position. The financial management officer in Sarajevo said that she had  already considered outsourcing cashiering, but a rightsizing  recommendation to do so gave her more incentive to take action. Further,  according to M/PRI officials, M/PRI\u2019s 2007 review on Uruguay  recommended adding a second U.S. direct-hire public diplomacy position,  and the post has since implemented that recommendation.", "According to State officials, M/PRI provides a broader perspective in  analyzing overseas staffing, providing information on where posts are  overstaffed or understaffed, and recommending potential ways to achieve  greater efficiencies. OBO officials stated that rightsizing is an independent  process that provides staffing projections. According to regional bureau  officials, the rightsizing review is currently the only tool that provides a  comprehensive process to verify the number of overseas positions and  the personnel occupying them. Officials from several regional bureaus  said that M/PRI\u2019s broader perspective in analyzing post operations was a  benefit to rightsizing, as posts tend to have a narrower, more parochial  perspective on what staffing levels are necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some U.S. Officials Use Rightsizing Reviews Less Often than Other Documents that Are More Timely and More Widely Known", "paragraphs": ["Several U.S. officials stated that they do not actively use rightsizing  reviews; they view other documents and tools as more timely and useful  for planning and staffing decisions. For example, officials from a regional  bureau said that they do not actively use the reviews except as a  historical overview of staffing. Officials from one regional bureau said that  the 5-year reviews do not have as clear a use as those done specifically  for construction. Some State post officials, especially in non-management  functions, said that the rightsizing reviews were of little or no use to them.", "Several U.S. officials stated that that they use MSRPs and OIG reports  more frequently than rightsizing reviews to make staffing and resource  allocation decisions. These officials said that they were more aware of the  annual MSRPs, which are more current than 5-year rightsizing reviews,  and OIG reports and recommendations, which require follow-up until they  are closed. Officials said that rightsizing reviews, done every 5 years,  quickly become outdated as the situation at a post changes. Officials from  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that, while the  rightsizing review is a long-term planning document, the more immediate  time frame of the annual MSRP is more actionable, given the short-term  program-driven nature of the agency\u2019s work. Further, some State officials  told us that because the rightsizing process is still relatively new and done  at each post only once every 5 years, many post management officers  have not yet gone through a rightsizing review and may be unfamiliar with  it. As a result, some post officials may be resisting the rightsizing process  rather than viewing it as a tool, according to M/PRI officials.", "In addition, some officials said that the final rightsizing reviews are not  widely disseminated, or that they do not know how to find the reviews.  Department of Homeland Security officials said that this is the first year  State has given them access to the final rightsizing review on State\u2019s  intranet. Previously, while they provided comments on drafts, they were  not given access to the final document. In addition, a human resources  officer at one of the posts we visited stated that the training State  provides to new human resources officers does not mention the  rightsizing review.

M/PRI\u2019s 2010 report to Congress states  that rightsizing decisions are implemented through the NSDD-38 process,  with the final decision resting with the chief of mission. However, one post  official stated that regional bureaus should have responsibility for taking  action on rightsizing recommendations because they make resource  allocations across posts. Other post and regional bureau officials, in  contrast, stated that individual posts have responsibility to take action on  rightsizing recommendations because the recommendations are  generally directed at the posts, not the bureau. Still other officials stated  that the posts and regional bureaus should share responsibility for  implementing the recommendations. Officials from one regional bureau  said that M/PRI\u2019s recent rightsizing recommendations were often  developed in concert with the regional bureaus, which could prompt the  bureau to follow up and encourage the post to implement the  recommendations. M/PRI began requiring posts to provide  recommendation implementation action plans in 2007 in response to one  of our previous recommendations. However, officials said that they  stopped doing the plans after about a year. The time horizon for  implementing the rightsizing recommendations varied to such an extent  that frequent reevaluation of progress would have been required to  ensure compliance, which was impractical given M/PRI\u2019s resource  constraints, according to M/PRI officials. Officials from both M/PRI and  the regional bureaus have noted that M/PRI does not have the authority  to compel implementation of rightsizing recommendations.", "Some post officials noted that there is little incentive to implement  recommendations, particularly if the recommendations are to decrease  the workforce size. While posts may agree with rightsizing  recommendations in concept, the tendency is for posts to protect their  staffing levels and look for increases if possible. For example, an official  in Prague agreed with a rightsizing recommendation to conduct a  strategic regional review of staffing in former Warsaw Pact countries to  determine whether the number of positions could be reduced. He noted,  however, that it would be difficult to accomplish in practice because posts  lack incentive to cut positions.

No State office has responsibility for following up on  recommendations, and posts or bureaus have limited incentive to  undertake an examination of recommendations and implement them if  they prove to have value. Further, any actions post officials take to  implement recommendations may not be known or documented outside  the post, which contributes to a substantial loss of information for State  officials. Although the reviews have certain limitations, including  competing priorities at posts, State has not yet realized the full potential of  its rightsizing reviews. To strengthen the impact of future rightsizing  reviews, State needs a process by which it can capture this information to  inform future decisions about the optimal number and mix of staff at posts  overseas to maximize the use of limited resources.

State noted that M/PRI will take the lead with regard to tracking  implementation of rightsizing review recommendations.  For rightsizing  reviews initiated after August 1, 2012, as part of the ongoing second cycle  of reviews, M/PRI analysts will outline the extent to which specific  recommendations M/PRI provided in the previous rightsizing cycle have  been implemented, as appropriate.

In addition, beginning in calendar year  2013, M/PRI will survey each mission 1 year after the completion of a  rightsizing review to assess progress with regard to the implementation of  recommendations. Posts will be asked to report on measures taken to  comply with recommendations, provide a time frame for doing so, or  explain changing conditions or policies that make compliance unfeasible.   State proposed to then include this additional information in the yearly  rightsizing report to Congress beginning in December 2013.

We based our selections on interviews  with M/PRI and State\u2019s regional bureaus, the content of the rightsizing  reviews, and the political and security conditions at post to ensure that we  analyzed a range of experiences. In selecting posts, we considered the  date the rightsizing review was completed, whether other U.S. agencies  were present at post, geographic diversity and whether a post was  located in a new embassy compound. We traveled to Prague, the Czech  Republic; Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Kuwait City, Kuwait to  discuss their respective rightsizing reviews with post officials. While at  post, we interviewed officials in each embassy section, including the  office of the chief of mission, management, human resources, financial  management, facilities management, the regional security office, political  affairs, public affairs, and consular affairs, among others.

During our overseas site visits to the Czech Republic,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kuwait, we discussed the rightsizing  process with the embassy section heads. To examine M/PRI\u2019s  coordination with other U.S. government agencies, we spoke with officials  from non-State agencies in the United States and overseas. We also  discussed their process for allocating overseas staff with these officials. In  addition, we reviewed legislation related to the establishment of the Office  of Rightsizing within State and the intent of rightsizing. To examine how  M/PRI\u2019s methodology has evolved in recent years, we reviewed 181  rightsizing reviews completed by M/PRI between 2005 and 2011. We  reviewed information papers on M/PRI\u2019s methodological tools for  assessing both administrative staff and program staff, including the total  management ratio and diplomatic density.", "To assess the extent to which State\u2019s staffing projections compare with  actual staffing levels, we relied on two main sources of data: (1) the  staffing projections in the rightsizing reviews, which we manually entered  into a spreadsheet and (2) the actual staffing levels State extracted from  the Post Personnel database for us. To assess the reliability of the data,  we conducted a data consistency check and interviewed knowledgeable  State officials on how the data were collected and maintained, as well as  how the data were extracted for our use. We sent the staffing projection  data we manually entered to State for verification. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purpose of comparing staffing  projections with actual staff levels as of December 2011. We obtained  181 rightsizing reviews from the Office of Rightsizing. We took the  following steps to reduce the number of reviews to 144 for the  comparison analysis: deleted entries with projection years prior to 2011; deleted entries based on an older review if there were multiple deleted entries with unreliable data. For example, State told us that  Afghanistan personnel numbers were not reliable;  consolidated projections for bilateral and multilateral missions in the  same country. For example, we combined projections for the U.S.  missions to Belgium, the European Union, and the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization into one entry;  consolidated projections for multiple posts in one country into one  entry. For example, we consolidated projections for posts in Russia  and posts in Poland; and deleted entries with no projections.", "To compare rightsizing projections to the actual staffing levels of 2011,  which is the year for which State provided personnel data, we  extrapolated 2011 staffing levels based on rightsizing review projections.  We assumed linear growth or decline in staffing levels. For example, if the  base year was 2008 and the projection year was 2013, we divided the  change in staffing levels by 5 (5 years between the projection year and  the base year) to get the annual change in staffing levels. We added the  changes for 3 years (3 years between the base year and 2011) to the  base-year staffing level. We then identified the number of reviews in each  category of differences between the actual and the projection: within 10  percent, 10 to 50 percent overprojection, 10 to 50 percent  underprojection, more than 50 percent overprojection, and more than 50  percent underprojection. Missions with overprojections had fewer staff  than projected, while those with underprojections had more.", "To understand the factors that could lead to differences between the  actual and projected staffing levels, we identified posts with relatively  large differences by generating a composite index for each country,  taking into consideration the differences in absolute numbers and  percentages for the following three categories: (a) U.S. direct-hire desk  positions, which have the most significant impact on the physical space at  a post; (b) locally-employed staff, which comprise the majority of the  personnel overseas; and (c) country total, which captures all personnel at  a post . Based on the composite index, we identified five countries for  overprojection\u2014Tunisia, Libya, Bolivia, Korea, and the Philippines\u2014and  five countries for underprojection\u2014Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ghana,  Mozambique, and Burkina Faso. The differences between projected and  actual total staffing levels as of December 2011 were over 10 percent for  all 10 countries.
