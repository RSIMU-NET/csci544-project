To address these objectives, GAO analyzed program information and interviewed agency officials in headquarters and selected field offices, entrepreneurs, and third-party entities, such as nonprofits, that use federal grants to provide assistance directly to entrepreneurs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal efforts to support entrepreneurs are fragmented--including among 52 programs at the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Small Business Administration (SBA). All overlap with at least one other program in terms of the type of assistance they are authorized to offer, such as financial (grants and loans) and technical (training and counseling), and the type of entrepreneur they are authorized to serve. Some entrepreneurs struggle to navigate the fragmented programs that provide technical assistance. For example, some entrepreneurs and technical assistance providers GAO spoke with said the system can be confusing and that some entrepreneurs do not know where to go for assistance. Collaboration could reduce some negative effects of overlap and fragmentation, but field staff GAO spoke with did not consistently collaborate to provide training and counseling services to entrepreneurs. The agencies have taken initial steps to improve how they collaborate by entering into formal agreements, but they have not pursued a number of other good collaborative practices GAO has previously identified. For example, USDA and SBA entered into a formal agreement in 2010 to coordinate their efforts to support businesses in rural areas; however, the agencies' programs that can support start-up businesses--such as USDA's Rural Business Enterprise Grant program and SBA's Small Business Development Centers--have yet to determine roles and responsibilities, find ways to leverage each other's resources, or establish compatible policies and procedures. Without enhanced collaboration and coordination agencies may not be able to make the best use of limited federal resources in the most effective and efficient manner.", "Agencies do not track program information on entrepreneurial assistance activities for many programs, a number of programs have not met their performance goals, and most programs lack evaluations. In particular, the agencies do not generally track information on the specific type of assistance they provide or the entrepreneurs they serve, in part because they do not rely on this information to administer the programs. Rather, agencies may rely, for example, on data summaries in narrative format, which cannot be easily aggregated or analyzed. According to government standards for internal control, this information should be available to help inform management in making decisions and identifying risks and problem areas. GAO also found that 19 programs failed to meet their annual performance goals related to entrepreneurial assistance, including USDA's Rural Business Opportunity Grants, Commerce's Economic Development/Support for Planning Organizations, HUD's Indian Community Development Block Grants, and SBA's 504 loans to finance commercial real estate. Programs could potentially rely on results from program evaluations to determine the reasons why they have not met their goals, as well as to gauge overall effectiveness. However, the agencies lack program evaluations for 32 of the 52 programs. Therefore, information on program efficiency and effectiveness is limited, and scarce resources may be going toward programs that are less effective. In addition, without more robust program information, agencies may not be able to administer programs in the most effective and efficient manner. GAO recommends that the agencies and the Office of Management and Budget explore opportunities to enhance collaboration among programs, both within and across agencies; track program information; and conduct more program evaluations. Commerce, HUD, and USDA provided written comments and each neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations. However, USDA commented that the recommendations were not explicit.

The federal  government provides a variety of support and assistance to them, and  dozens of programs exist to support entrepreneurs across numerous  federal agencies. Economic development programs that effectively  provide assistance to entrepreneurs, in conjunction with state and local  government and private sector economic development initiatives, may  help businesses develop and expand. However, we have previously  raised questions about the potential negative effects of fragmentation and  overlap among federal programs that can support entrepreneurs.  Specifically, we have questioned how efficiently federal agencies are  administering these programs and how effective the programs are at  achieving their mission. This report focuses on 52 programs administered  by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce (Commerce),  and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Small  Business Administration (SBA) that provide assistance to entrepreneurs.  In 2011, we examined these programs and found that each program  overlapped with at least one other program in terms of the economic  development activities that they are authorized to fund. According to  agency officials, these programs, which typically fund a variety of  activities in addition to supporting entrepreneurs, spent an estimated $2.0  billion on economic development efforts in fiscal year 2011.", "Section 21 of Public Law 111-139, enacted in February 2010, requires  GAO to conduct routine investigations to identify federal programs,  agencies, offices, and initiatives with duplicative goals and activities within  departments and governmentwide, and report annually to Congress.This report discusses (1) the extent of overlap, fragmentation, and  duplication and their effects on entrepreneurs, and agencies\u2019 actions to  address them; and (2) the extent to which agencies collect information  necessary to track program activities and whether these programs have  met their performance goals and have been evaluated.", "While we identified a more comprehensive list of federal programs that  can fund economic activities more generally, we focused our analyses on  these 52 economic development programs that are authorized to support  entrepreneurs because these are the programs that appeared to overlap  the most within the four agencies whose missions focus on economic  development. We reviewed statutory and regulatory authority for each  program on the activities and services the agencies can conduct to  administer each of the programs. Because there was significant overlap  and fragmentation among programs that provide technical assistance (for  example, business training and counseling and support for research and  development) to entrepreneurs (35 of the 52 programs), we focused on  how the agencies provide this assistance. We reviewed agency  documents and conducted interviews in both headquarters and the field  to determine how technical assistance is provided to entrepreneurs and  the extent of agency collaboration at the local level. We interviewed 14  officials from four federal agencies, 9 officials from two regional  commissions, four entrepreneurs who have received federal support, and  five state and local partners in select geographic areas where there was  evidence of ongoing collaboration between the federal agencies. These  geographic areas included both urban and rural areas. We assessed this  technical assistance information against promising collaborative practices  that we have previously identified. For all 52 programs, we also  evaluated the agencies\u2019 methods for tracking the activities conducted and  assistance provided against standards for internal controls that we have  previously identified. For each program, we reviewed information on  program mission and goals, performance goals and accomplishments,  and program evaluations conducted during the last decade.

Within the technical  assistance category, 24 of the 35 programs are authorized to provide or  fund a broad range of technical assistance both to entrepreneurs with  existing businesses and to nascent entrepreneurs\u2014that is, entrepreneurs  attempting to start a business\u2014in any industry. This broad range of  support can include any form of training or counseling, including start-up  assistance, access to capital, and accounting. Examples of programs in  this category include Commerce\u2019s Minority Business Centers, five of  HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs, SBA\u2019s  Small Business Development Centers, and USDA\u2019s Rural Business  Opportunity Grants. Eight additional programs can support limited types  of technical assistance or industries. For example, Commerce\u2019s Trade  Adjustment Assistance for Firms only supports existing businesses  negatively affected by imports, and USDA\u2019s Small Socially- Disadvantaged Producer Grants only serves agricultural businesses.", "Similarly, 16 of the 30 financial assistance programs can provide or  guarantee loans that can be used for a broad range of purposes to  existing businesses and nascent entrepreneurs in any industry.

Five other programs  can support loans for a more narrow range of purposes or industries,  while the other nine programs can only support other types of financial  assistance, such as grants, equity investments, and surety guarantees.", "In addition, a number of programs overlap based on the characteristics of  the targeted beneficiary. Most programs either target or exclusively serve  one of four types of businesses: businesses in rural areas, businesses in  economically distressed areas, disadvantaged businesses, and small  businesses. support to entrepreneurs are focused on serving beneficiaries in  economically distressed areas or target benefits at low- to moderate- income individuals. SBA\u2019s 19 programs are all limited to serving small  businesses, with several programs that either target or exclusively serve  disadvantaged businesses and microenterprises. Eight of USDA\u2019s 13  programs are limited to rural service areas, and four of these programs  are limited to small businesses or microenterprises. Among Commerce\u2019s  eight programs, six are limited to serving beneficiaries in economically  distressed areas, while two exclusively serve disadvantaged businesses.", "The definition of rural varies among these programs, but according to USDA\u2014the  agency that administers many of the economic development programs that serve rural  areas\u2014the term rural typically covers areas with population limits ranging from less than  2,500 to 50,000. Based on statutory language, we characterize economically distressed  areas as communities with high concentrations of low- and moderate-income families or  high rates of unemployment and/or underemployment. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141; 42  U.S.C. \u00a7 5301.

See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 656. The definition of small business  varies among these programs, but according to SBA\u2014the agency that administers many  of the economic development programs that serve small businesses\u2014the term small  business refers to businesses that have annual receipts or total employee numbers under  an agency-defined value for their specific industry.", "Entrepreneurs may fall into more than one beneficiary category\u2014for  example, an entrepreneur may be in an area that is both rural and  economically distressed. Therefore, these entrepreneurs would be  eligible, based on program authority, for more than one subset of  program. For example, a small business in a rural, economically  distressed area, such as Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, could, in  terms of program authority, receive a broad range of technical assistance  through at least nine programs at all four of the agencies, including:", "Commerce\u2019s Economic Adjustment Assistance;", "HUD\u2019s CDBG/States, Rural Innovation Fund, and Section 4 Capacity", "SBA\u2019s SCORE and Small Business Development Centers;", "USDA\u2019s1890 Land Grant Institutions, Rural Business Enterprise  Grants, and Rural Business Opportunity Grants.", "Similarly, a small business that is both minority- and women-owned in an  urban, noneconomically distressed area, such as Seattle, Washington,  could in terms of program authority, receive a broad range of technical  assistance through at least seven programs at three of the four agencies,  including:", "Commerce\u2019s Minority Business Centers;", "HUD\u2019s CDBG/Entitlement and Section 4 Capacity Building; and", "SBA\u2019s Program for Investment in Micro-entrepreneurs (PRIME),  SCORE, Small Business Development Centers, and Women\u2019s  Business Centers.", "HUD\u2019s Rural Innovation Fund program did not receive funding in fiscal year 2011 but is  still active. USDA\u2019s1890 Land Grant Institutions received an unspecified amount of  funding through USDA\u2019s Salaries and Expense account rather than program  appropriations.", "Entrepreneurs may also be eligible for multiple subsets of financial  assistance programs based on their specific characteristics. For example,  a small business in a rural, economically distressed area, such as  Bourbon County, Kansas, could in terms of authority, receive financial  assistance in the form of guaranteed or direct loans for a broad range of  uses through at least eight programs at the four agencies, including:", "Commerce\u2019s Economic Adjustment Assistance;", "HUD\u2019s CDBG/States, Rural Innovation Fund and Section 4 Capacity", "SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan Program and Small Business Investment", "USDA\u2019s Business and Industry Loans and Rural Business Enterprise  Grants.", "A small business that is both minority and women-owned in an urban,  noneconomically distressed area, such as Raleigh, North Carolina, could  receive financial assistance in the form of guaranteed or direct loans for a  broad range of uses through at least four programs at two of the four  agencies, including:", "HUD\u2019s CDBG/Entitlement and Section 4 Capacity Building; and", "SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan Program and Small Business Investment  Companies.", "Five programs provide government contracting assistance to  entrepreneurs, but our analysis did not identify significant overlap in the  types of assistance these programs provide or the types of entrepreneurs  they serve. While these five programs are all administered by SBA and  can serve businesses in any industry, they tend to target specific types of  entrepreneurs and provide unique types of assistance. For example, the  Procurement Assistance to Small Businesses program coordinates  access to government contracts for small and disadvantaged businesses  with other federal agencies, while the 8(a) Business Development  Program coordinates certification of eligible disadvantaged businesses for  the contracts made available at these other agencies, in addition to  providing business development assistance during their 9-year term.", "While many programs overlap in terms of statutory authority,  entrepreneurs may in reality have fewer options to access assistance  from multiple programs. Agencies often rely on intermediaries (that is,  third-party entities such as nonprofit organizations, higher education  institutions, or local governments that use federal grants to provide  eligible assistance directly to entrepreneurs) to provide specific support to  entrepreneurs, and these intermediaries vary in terms of their location  and the types of assistance they provide. For example, while  entrepreneurs seeking technical assistance in Susquehanna County,  Pennsylvania, are eligible to receive this support through USDA\u2019s1890  Land Grant Institutions program, the closest funded intermediary is in  Delaware, making it unlikely that such an entrepreneur would utilize  services through this program. Additionally, intermediaries we spoke to in  several areas said they typically provide a more limited range of services  to entrepreneurs than are allowed under their statutory authority. For  example, two intermediaries that we interviewed in Texas that were  authorized to provide a broad range of technical support to entrepreneurs  through SBA\u2019s Small Business Development Center and Commerce\u2019s  Minority Business Center noted that they each specialized in a narrower  subset of services and referred beneficiaries to each other and other  resources for some services outside of their niches. Specifically, the  intermediary at the Small Business Development Center noted that they  provide a range of long-term services to small businesses over different  phases of development, while the intermediary at the Minority Business  Center noted that they focused specifically on larger minority-owned firms  as well as start-up companies.", "Overlapping programs may also employ different mechanisms to provide  similar types of support to entrepreneurs. For example, programs may  support technical assistance through different types of intermediaries that  provide services to entrepreneurs. USDA\u2019s Rural Business Opportunity  Grants program can provide technical assistance through local  governments, nonprofit corporations, Indian tribes, and cooperatives that  are located in rural areas, while SBA\u2019s SCORE program utilizes retired  business professionals and others that volunteer their time to provide  assistance. Additionally, programs may support financial assistance in the  form of loans through loan guarantees, direct loans, or support for  revolving loan funds. SBA\u2019s 7(a) Loan program provides guarantees on  loans made by private sector lenders, while USDA\u2019s Intermediary Re- lending program provides financing to intermediaries to operate revolving  loan funds.", "Additionally, some programs distribute funding through multiple layers of  intermediaries before it reaches entrepreneurs. For example, HUD\u2019s  Section 4 Capacity Building program is only authorized to provide grants  to five national organizations, which pass funding on to a number of local  grantees, including community development corporations that may use  the funding to provide technical or financial assistance to entrepreneurs.  HUD officials also noted that most of their programs allow local grantees  discretion on whether to use funds to support entrepreneurs or for other  authorized purposes. Other programs may competitively award grants to  multiple intermediaries working jointly in the same community to serve  entrepreneurs. For example, Commerce\u2019s Economic Adjustment  Assistance program can provide grants to intermediaries, such as  consortiums of local governments and nonprofits, which in turn provide  technical or financial assistance to entrepreneurs.", "Although we identified a number of examples of statutory overlap, we did  not find evidence of duplication among these programs (that is, instances  when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same  activities to provide the same services to the same beneficiaries) based  on available data. However, most agencies were not able to provide the  programmatic information, such as data on users of the program that is  necessary to determine whether or not duplication actually exists among  the programs. The agencies\u2019 data-collecting practices will be discussed at  greater length later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Entrepreneurs Struggle to Navigate Technical Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, 35 programs distributed across the four  agencies provide technical assistance, including business training and  counseling. While the existence of multiple programs in and of itself is not  a problem, the delivery system of these fragmented and overlapping  technical assistance programs contains many components (see fig. 1).  Several entrepreneurs and various technical assistance providers with  whom we spoke\u2014including agency field offices, intermediaries, and other  local service providers\u2014told us that the system can be confusing and that  some entrepreneurs do not know what services are available or where to  go for assistance. As discussed earlier, federal funds typically flow from  the federal agencies to different eligible intermediaries, which are third- party entities that receive federal funds, such as nonprofits or universities.  These intermediaries in turn may provide technical assistance to  entrepreneurs by, for example, helping them to develop a business plan  or put together a loan package to obtain financing. For instance, SBA\u2019s  Women\u2019s Business Center and Commerce\u2019s Minority Business Center  programs can provide technical assistance through different  intermediaries, such as the Arkansas Women\u2019s Business Center and the  University of Hawaii. Although intermediaries are the primary providers of  technical assistance, agency field offices may also provide some  technical assistance. For example, USDA\u2019s Rural Development state  offices may provide advice on how to complete their respective grant  applications. SBA\u2019s district offices may also discuss the different business  structures available.", "Technical assistance providers sometimes attempt to help entrepreneurs  navigate the system by referring them to other programs, but these efforts  are not consistently successful. Some of these providers told us that they  assess the entrepreneur\u2019s needs to determine whether to assist them or  refer them to another entity that could provide the assistance more  effectively. For example, if an 1890 Land Grant intermediary were not able  to assist an entrepreneur, it might refer the entrepreneur to SBA, USDA, or  a local provider. However, such referrals are not always successful. For  example, an entrepreneur we spoke with described a case in which he  needed assistance with developing a business plan but was unable to  receive this assistance, even after several referrals. Some technical  assistance providers that we spoke with either did not appear to fully  understand other technical assistance programs or thought that others did  not fully understand their programs. For example, one technical assistance  provider told us that some technical assistance providers were focused on  more established businesses, but when we reached out to some of these  providers, they said they served all entrepreneurs. This lack of  understanding could prevent providers from making helpful referrals and  leveraging other programs and limit the effectiveness of the programs.", "In addition, programs\u2019 Internet resources can also be difficult to navigate.  Each agency has its own separate website that provides information to  entrepreneurs, but they often direct entrepreneurs to other websites for  additional information. For example, the SBA website directs users to  another website that lists the Small Business Development Centers,  which then directs users to another website that provides some  information on the centers\u2019 available services. SBA, Commerce, USDA,  and other agencies have recently collaborated to develop a joint website  called BusinessUSA with the goal of making it easier for businesses to  access services. However, the site was not fully operational as of June  2012, and none of the entrepreneurs and almost all the technical  assistance providers we spoke with were not yet aware of it. As of June  2012, this website listed a number of potential technical assistance  programs across different federal agencies with links to the programs\u2019  websites.

We have  identified practices that can help to support collaboration among federal  agencies and programs. In addition, greater collaboration is one way  agencies can help overcome overlap and fragmentation among programs  within and across agencies. Moreover, without enhanced collaboration  and coordination, agencies may not be able to make the best use of  limited federal resources and may not reach their intended beneficiaries  in the most effective and efficient manner.", "In addition, given the number of federal programs focused on supporting  entrepreneurs, agencies need specific information about these programs  to best allocate limited federal resources and make decisions about better  administering and structuring the programs. In our February 2012 report  on duplication, overlap, and fragmentation, we expected to recommend  that Congress tie funding to program performance and that OMB and the  agencies explore opportunities to restructure programs through such  means as consolidation or elimination. However, decisions about funding  and restructuring would be difficult without better performance and  evaluation information. Thus, making these recommendations would be  premature until the agencies address a number of deficiencies.  Specifically, agencies typically do not collect information that would  enable them to track the services they provide and to whom they provide  those services. This practice is not consistent with government standards  for internal controls. Without such information, the agencies may not be  able to administer the programs in a way that will result in the most  efficient and effective federal support to entrepreneurs.", "Moreover, most of the programs that set goals did not meet them or only  met some of them, and agency officials could not always identify reasons  why program goals were not met.

All  written comments are reprinted in appendixes VI, VII and VIII.", "The Acting Secretary of Commerce stated that we may wish to consider  the complementary role many agencies play in the field of economic  development and the need for varied but complementary activities to  address the complexities of entrepreneurs. She commented that what  may appear as duplication at a higher level is in reality a portfolio of  distinct services meeting unique needs. Our report notes that in some  instances it may be appropriate for multiple agencies or entities to be  involved in the same programmatic or policy area due to the nature or  magnitude of the federal effort. We found that many of the 52 programs  we examined overlap in terms of statutory authority; our report does not  state that duplication exists among these programs. However, we found  that most of these agencies were not able to provide programmatic  information, such as data on users of the programs that is necessary to  determine whether or not duplication actually exists.", "The Acting Secretary also stated that federal agencies do successfully  collaborate and forge policy partnerships, and noted that EDA plays a key  role in leading and shaping federal policy for fostering collaborative  regional economic development. As noted in our report, Commerce,  HUD, SBA, and USDA have taken initial steps to improve how they  collaborate to provide technical assistance to entrepreneurs and cites  specific examples of these collaborative efforts. However, GAO found that  the four agencies, including Commerce, have not pursued a number of  other good collaborative practices we have previously identified. For  example, our report states that the White House Rural Council, comprised  of Commerce and other federal agencies, is working to better coordinate  federal programs in order to maximize the impact of federal investment in  rural areas. Although the council has announced a number of initiatives,  such as helping rural small businesses access capital, we found that the  agencies have yet to implement many of our other good collaborative  practices such as developing compatible guidance to implement inter- agency agreements. For example, we found that while most of these  agencies at the headquarters level have agreed to work together by  signing formal agreements to administer some of their similar programs,  the agencies generally have yet to develop compatible guidance to  implement these agreements in the field.", "Finally, the Acting Secretary stated that EDA agrees with our report\u2019s  focus on the need for more specific information tracking and more  frequent performance evaluation. She noted that EDA has established  performance measures for each of its programs, and that these  performance measures were subject to thorough review and validation  procedures. She also noted that EDA routinely conducts evaluations of its  programs (often limited only by lack of resources). However, the Acting  Secretary stated that efforts to monitor and track project progress seem to  have been outside of the scope of our report, based on many of the  general statements made in the report about the need for additional work  in this area. As previously stated, we found that most of the agencies  were not able to provide programmatic information for programs that can  support entrepreneurs. Our report also states that Commerce does collect  information on the type of entrepreneur served and the entrepreneur\u2019s  industry for all eight of its programs that can provide technical assistance;  however, the report notes that Commerce does not collect information on  the specific type of technical assistance provided to entrepreneurs for six  of these eight programs\u2014information necessary to compare activities  across programs. We provided summary information on evaluations  conducted by the agencies in the report, including Commerce. We also  found that Commerce, HUD, SBA, and USDA had not evaluated the  majority of the 52 programs that can support entrepreneurs, including four  of the eight programs Commerce administers.

She stated  that the entire program may be unfairly perceived as ineffective as a  result of this statement. Our report states that 33 of 52 programs we  examined set goals related to entrepreneurial assistance and that 19 of  these 33 programs did not meet any of their goals or only met some of  their goals. Our report does not state that these 19 programs were  ineffective. We added language on the highlights page of the report to  clarify that our findings were only based on each program\u2019s goals related  to entrepreneurial assistance.", "The Assistant Secretary also stated that our report misrepresents the  Indian CDBG program as an economic development program. She noted  that while economic development is an eligible program activity, only 3  percent of the dollars awarded under the program since 2005 funded  economic development activities. She further noted that most of the  program\u2019s grants were used for community development activities, such  as building community buildings, developing infrastructure of various  types, and rehabilitating housing units on Indian lands. As noted in our  report, the 52 programs we examined for this report typically fund a  variety of activities in addition to supporting entrepreneurs. In addition, the  report notes that most of these programs either target or exclusively serve  particular types of businesses.", "The Assistant Secretary noted that an independent evaluation of the  Indian CDBG program was conducted in 2006. HUD had not previously  provided us with this evaluation. We revised our report to state that the  Indian CDBG program had been evaluated within the past 12 years.  Finally, the Assistant Secretary stated that HUD supports efforts to  accurately measure the performance of its programs. She noted that  HUD\u2019s Office of Native American Programs had recognized limitations in  its method of projecting and measuring performance in the Indian CDBG  program. She also stated that the office had begun drafting a revised form  to be used at grant application and grant closeout to better collect  performance measurement data, and that the office was examining its  data collection procedures as well as the methodology used to establish  program targets. These actions are consistent with our recommendation  that the agencies collect program information and use it to help  administer their programs.", "USDA\u2019s Under Secretary for Rural Development stated that he agreed  with our report\u2019s statements that entrepreneurs play a vital role in the U.S.  economy and that no duplication exists among federal programs that  assist entrepreneurs. However, he disagreed with some of the other  observations in our report. First, he stated that our report broadly portrays  federal programs that assist entrepreneurs and does not highlight the  unique characteristics of each agency, such as USDA\u2019s Rural  Development\u2019s specialization in rural economic development and its  network of state and local area offices. Our report notes that most of  USDA\u2019s 13 programs that can support entrepreneurs are limited to areas  with a rural statutory definition. We also include discussion based on our  outreach to participants in rural economic development, including regional  commissions and authorities, on their experiences with the four federal  agencies in rural economic development efforts. More importantly,  however, when considering the unique characteristics of the various  programs, we emphasize the need for agencies to conduct program  evaluations to assess effectiveness. While the Under Secretary suggests  that the rural focus and the network of state and local area offices  enhance program effectiveness, USDA has not conducted evaluations to  support this conclusion.", "Second, USDA\u2019s Under Secretary stated that our report highlights  examples where entrepreneurs may be eligible for multiple federal  programs based on an entrepreneur\u2019s specific characteristics, but that the  report does not mention whether this was a pervasive or problematic  issue. He stated that rural entrepreneurs may be eligible for multiple  programs, and that a business\u2019s unique situation dictates which programs  best meets its needs. Again, our report emphasizes the need for  evaluations to determine the relative effectiveness of different programs  serving similar purposes. Third, regarding our findings related to the  information agencies collect on program activities, the Under Secretary  cited a number of tools that the Rural Business-Cooperative Service  (RBS) uses to identify and improve the effectiveness of its programs. As  noted in this report, we determined that USDA collected detailed  information on the industry of each of the entrepreneurs it supports for all  of its programs. In addition, we determined that USDA collected detailed  information (19 categories) on how entrepreneurs use proceeds provided  through 5 of its financial programs. However, we found that over the past  12 years USDA had conducted a program evaluation for only 1 of its 13  programs that can support entrepreneurs, including USDA programs that  RBS does not administer.", "Finally, the Under Secretary stated that the recommendations in our  report are not explicit, which makes it unclear how RBS would effectively  address them. Our report does provide information on how agencies  could address our recommendations. First, we recommended that OMB,  Commerce, HUD, SBA, and USDA work together to identify opportunities  to enhance collaboration among programs, both within and across  agencies. Our report identifies several practices that can help agencies  and their offices enhance and sustain collaboration, which include  indentifying common outcomes, establishing joint strategies, leveraging  resources, determining roles and responsibilities, and developing  compatible policies and procedures, among others. Second, we  recommended that Commerce, HUD, USDA and SBA consistently collect  information that would enable them to track the specific type of assistance  provided and the entrepreneurs they serve and use this information to  help administer their programs. Our report identifies programs that  Commerce, HUD, SBA, and USDA administer for which the agencies did  and did not maintain information in a readily available format that could be  tracked to help administer the programs. Finally, we recommended that  Commerce, HUD, SBA, and USDA conduct more evaluations to better  understand why programs have not met performance goals and their  overall effectiveness. Our report acknowledges that program evaluations  can be costly; however, the report also notes that there are various  methods agencies can employ to make the evaluations more cost- effective, such as relying on their own data instead of purchasing data  from a vendor.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and other interested parties.

Based on past work, these programs appeared to overlap  the most within the four agencies with missions focused on economic  development. We reviewed the statutes and regulations that authorize the  activities that can be conducted under each program. We categorized the  types of activities into three categories: (1) technical assistance, (2)  financial assistance, and (3) government contracting assistance. Many of  the programs can provide more than one type of assistance, and most  focus on technical assistance, financial assistance, or both. To identify  the effects of overlap and fragmentation on entrepreneurs and agencies\u2019  actions to address them, we focused on 35 of the 52 programs that  provide technical assistance because there was significant overlap and  fragmentation among these programs. We reviewed agency documents,  such as inter-agency agreements, and conducted interviews to determine  how technical assistance is provided to entrepreneurs, including the  extent of agency collaboration at the local level. More specifically, we  interviewed technical assistance providers, including 14 federal agency  officials from four federal agencies located in the field, nine officials from  two regional commissions, and 14 representatives of intermediaries (that  is, third-party technical assistance providers); four entrepreneurs who  have received assistance federal support; and five state and local  partners in three geographic areas. These geographic areas included  both urban and rural areas. We selected geographic areas based on, the  presence of an active regional commission and evidence of collaboration  among at least two of the four federal agencies being located within the  same region. We assessed this technical assistance information against  promising collaborative practices that we have previously identified.", "To determine the extent to which agencies collect information necessary  to track program activities, we reviewed agency manuals and data  collection forms that describe information collected on program activities  and methods for analyzing and using the information. Specifically, we  assessed each agency\u2019s capacity to track specific types of  entrepreneurial assistance they provided to specific types of beneficiaries,  as well as their ability to report this information in a readily available  format at the program level. We compared these processes against  standards for internal controls we have previously identified to determine  how well agencies track the support they provide to entrepreneurs. To  determine the extent to which these 52 economic development programs  have met their performance goals, we reviewed agency documents on  their fiscal year 2011 program goals and accomplishments. We also  interviewed agency officials to determine reasons why goals were not met  (see app. III).", "To describe results from program evaluations related to the effectiveness  of the 52 economic development programs that we reviewed, we  requested all studies that have been conducted on these programs from  the four agencies that administer the programs.

The resulting list of  program evaluations totaled 16. Because some evaluations studied more  than one program, these 16 evaluations covered 20 of the 52 programs in  our review. We reviewed the methodologies of these studies to ensure  that they were sound and determined that they were sufficiently reliable  for our purpose, which was to report high-level findings related to the  program\u2019s overall effectiveness (see app. V).
