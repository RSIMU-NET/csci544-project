The higher cost generally relates to upgrading assets to reflect added homeland security mission requirements. Upgrades to vessels account for the single largest area of increase; with upgrades to the command, control, communications and other capabilities being second highest. In contrast, because the revised plans upgrade rather than replace most legacy aircraft and reduce the number of unmanned aircraft, the cost for Deepwater aircraft drops. The revised plans, like the original plan, are heavily dependent on receiving full funding each year. Coast Guard officials state that a shortfall in funding in any year could substantially increase total costs. The Coast Guard's analytical methods were appropriate for determining if the revised asset mix would provide greater mission performance and whether the mix is appropriate for meeting Deepwater missions. GAO and other independent experts found the Coast Guard's methods were reliable for assessing the effects of changing the asset mix and a Department of Defense review board facilitated accreditation of the Coast Guard's approach. Because the model has proved useful for guiding Coast Guard decisions on the proper asset mix for achieving Deepwater performance goals, the Coast Guard is considering ways to expand the model to guide decisions on meeting its Coast Guard-wide performance goals. Actions by the Coast Guard and the system integrator have fully implemented three of the eight GAO recommendations that were not fully addressed during GAO's review in 2005, and three more recommendations appear to be nearly implemented. The remaining two have unresolved concerns, but the Coast Guard is taking steps to resolve them. A program of this size, however, will likely experience other challenges beyond those that have emerged so far, making continued monitoring by the Coast Guard important."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s new homeland security realities have affected plans for  modernizing the Coast Guard\u2019s fleet of aircraft and vessels. For about a  decade, the Coast Guard has been developing an Integrated Deepwater  System (or Deepwater) acquisition program, a long-term plan to replace or  modernize this fleet. Many of these legacy assets are at or approaching the  end of their estimated service lives. As originally conceived, Deepwater  was designed around producing aircraft and vessels that would function in  the Coast Guard\u2019s traditional at-sea roles, such as interdicting illicit drug  shipments or rescuing mariners from difficulty at sea. After the terrorist  attacks on September 11, 2001, however, these aircraft and vessels began  taking on additional missions related to protection of ports, waterways,  and coastal areas. As a result, the Coast Guard began revising the  Deepwater implementation plan to provide replacement assets that could  better address these added responsibilities. To do so, the Coast Guard  used an operational effectiveness model and other methods to help  determine what mix of assets it needed and what their capabilities should  be. In August 2005, the Coast Guard issued the revised Deepwater  implementation plan detailing the assets it planned to modify or acquire,  along with the proposed cost and schedule for doing so. Then, in February  2006, the Coast Guard again updated its Deepwater plan to align with its  fiscal year 2007 budget submissions.", "While there is widespread acknowledgment that many of the Coast  Guard\u2019s aging assets need replacement or renovation, concerns also exist  about the acquisition approach the Coast Guard adopted in launching the  Deepwater program. From the outset, we have expressed concern about  the risks involved with the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition strategy, which  involves relying on a prime contractor (or system integrator) to identify  the assets needed and then using tiers of subcontractors to design and  build the actual assets. The subsequent changes in the Deepwater asset  mix and delivery schedules only increase these concerns. In 2004 we  reported that well into the contract\u2019s second year, key components needed  to manage the program and oversee the system integrator\u2019s performance  had not been effectively implemented. Accordingly, we made   11 recommendations to address three broad areas of concern: improving  program management, strengthening contractor accountability, and  promoting cost control through greater competition among potential  subcontractors.", "This report, prepared at your request, examines the changes the Coast  Guard has made in the Deepwater program to address its broader scope,  as well as addressing the concerns we raised in 2004. More specifically, it    compares the revised Deepwater implementation plan issued in August  2005 and the February 2006 updated plan with the original (August 2002)  plan in terms of the assets to be replaced or modified, and the time frames  and costs for doing so;   assesses the degree to which the operational effectiveness model and  other analytical methods used by the Coast Guard to develop the revised  Deepwater asset mix are sound and appropriate for such a purpose; and   assesses the progress made in implementing our prior recommendations  regarding Deepwater program management.", "Our work included extensive reviews and analyses of (1) the original and  revised Deepwater implementation plans, (2) the Coast Guard\u2019s  operational effectiveness models and other analytical tools used for  determining the proposed Deepwater asset mix, and (3) documentation  provided by the Coast Guard on its progress in addressing our  recommendations. We supplemented our document reviews and analyses  with extensive discussions with officials at the Deepwater Program  Executive Office, as well as with interviews of key Coast Guard operations  and maintenance officials, contract monitors, and representatives of the  system integrator.

The Deepwater fleet, which currently consists of  186 aircraft and 88 vessels of various sizes and capabilities, plays a critical  role in all of these missions.", "Some Coast Guard Deepwater vessels were built in the 1960s.  Notwithstanding extensive overhauls and other upgrades, a number of the  vessels are nearing the end of their estimated service lives. Similarly, while  a number of the Deepwater legacy aircraft have received upgrades in  engines, operating systems, and sensor equipment since they were  originally built, they too have limitations in their operating capabilities.  The Integrated Deepwater System acquisition program, which the Coast  Guard began developing in 1996, is its major effort to replace or modernize  these aircraft and vessels. This Deepwater program is designed to replace  some assets\u2014such as deteriorating vessels\u2014with new assets, and to  upgrade other assets\u2014such as some types of helicopters\u2014so they can  meet new performance requirements.", "The Deepwater program represents a unique approach to a major  acquisition in that the Coast Guard is using a prime contractor\u2014the  system integrator\u2014to identify and deliver the assets needed to meet a set  of mission requirements the Coast Guard has specified. In 2002, the Coast  Guard awarded a contract to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS), a  joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, as the system  integrator for the Deepwater program. Lockheed Martin and Northrop  Grumman, as the two main subcontractors, in turn contract with other  subcontractors. Rather than using the traditional approach of replacing  classes of ships or aircraft through a series of individual acquisitions, the  Coast Guard chose to employ a system-of-systems acquisition strategy that  would replace its deteriorating Deepwater assets with a single, integrated  package of new or modernized assets. This system-of-systems approach is  designed to provide an improved, integrated system of aircraft, vessels,  and unmanned aerial vehicles to be linked effectively through systems that  provide command, control, communications, computer, intelligence,  surveillance, reconnaissance, and supporting logistics. The Deepwater  program\u2019s three overarching goals are to maximize operational  effectiveness, minimize total ownership cost, and satisfy the customer\u2014  the operational commanders, aircraft pilots, cutter crews, maintenance  personnel, and others who will use the assets.", "We have been reviewing the Deepwater program for several years,  pointing out successes as well as difficulties and expressing concern over  a number of facets comprising the program. In 2001, we identified several  areas of risk for Deepwater. First, the Coast Guard faced potential risk in  the overall management and day-to-day administration of the contract. At  the time, we reported on the major challenges in developing and  implementing plans for establishing effective human capital practices,  having key management and oversight processes and procedures in place,  and tracking data to measure system integrator performance. In addition,  we expressed concerns about the potential lack of competition during the  program\u2019s later years and the reliance on a single system integrator for  procuring the Deepwater assets. We also reported there was little evidence  that the Coast Guard had analyzed whether the approach carried any  inherent risks for ensuring the best value to the government and if so,  what to do about them.", "We reviewed the Deepwater program again in 2004 and found many of the  same concerns. Specifically, we reported that key components needed to  manage the program and oversee the system integrator\u2019s performance had  not been effectively implemented. The Coast Guard\u2019s primary tool for  overseeing the system integrator, integrated product teams (IPT), were  struggling to effectively collaborate and accomplish their missions  because of changing membership, understaffing, insufficient training, and  inadequate communication among members. Also, the Coast Guard had  not adequately addressed the frequent turnover of personnel in the  program and the transition from existing assets to those assets that will be  part of the Deepwater program moving forward. Further, the Coast  Guard\u2019s assessment of the system integrator\u2019s performance in the first year  of the contract lacked rigor, and the factors that formed the basis for the  award fee were unsupported by quantifiable measures. This resulted in the  system integrator receiving an award fee of $4.0 million out of a maximum  of $4.6 million despite documented problems in schedule, performance,  cost controls, and contract administration.", "At the time of our 2004 report, the Coast Guard had begun to develop  models to measure the extent to which Deepwater was achieving  operational effectiveness and had reduced total ownership cost, but it had  not made a decision as to which specific models would be used. Further,  Coast Guard officials were not able to project a time frame for when the  Coast Guard would be able to hold the contractor accountable for  progress toward the goals of maximizing operational effectiveness,  minimizing total ownership cost, and increasing customer satisfaction.  Additionally, the Coast Guard had not measured the extent of competition  among suppliers of Deepwater assets or held the system integrator  accountable for taking steps to achieve competition. At the time, the Coast  Guard\u2019s lack of progress on these issues had contributed to our concerns  about the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to rely on competition as a means to  control future programmatic costs. In response to these concerns, we  made a number of recommendations to improve Deepwater management  and oversight of the system integrator. In 2005, we reported that the Coast  Guard had fully addressed three of the recommendations and had actions  underway on others.", "For the past several years, the Coast Guard has been revising its  Deepwater plan to incorporate expanded homeland security requirements  it received after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On May 31,  2005, the Coast Guard submitted a revised implementation plan to the  House Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on  Appropriations, which included both a 20-year and a 25-year plan. The  House Appropriations Committee directed the Department of Homeland  Security and the Coast Guard to select a single revised implementation  plan to accompany the Deepwater fiscal year 2006 budget request. In  compliance with the Committee\u2019s direction, the Coast Guard Commandant  testified on July 21, 2005 to the 25-year revised Deepwater implementation  plan. Further, in February 2006, the Coast Guard submitted an updated  Deepwater implementation plan to align with its fiscal year 2007 budget  submission. These 2005 and 2006 revised plans are the ones we are using  to compare to the Coast Guard\u2019s August 26, 2002, original implementation  plan.", "To reflect added homeland security responsibilities based on the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, the August 2005 revision and February 2006  update to the Deepwater implementation plan change the balance of  upgraded legacy versus new assets, the delivery schedules, and program  costs from the original 2002 plan. For aircraft, the revised plans include  upgrading many of the legacy aircraft rather than replacing them with new  assets as called for in the original plan. For vessels, the revised plans  maintain the original plan\u2019s strategy of replacing all of the legacy vessels,  but include some changes in the number of small boats being acquired.  Overall, the revised plan (1) increases the program length by 5 years, to a  total of 25 years; (2) changes the delivery schedules for a number of  assets; and (3) increases overall costs to $24 billion, $7 billion more than  earlier estimates. The program\u2019s higher costs largely reflect the Coast  Guard\u2019s expanded homeland security responsibilities and cover such  changes as greater weaponry, improved communications systems, and  greater operating capabilities. Coast Guard officials caution, however, that  this 25-year program is heavily dependent on receiving the anticipated  budget amount each fiscal year.

After the events of September  11, 2001, the revised plans took into account the increased security threats  by incorporating a new mission to provide greater security for ports,  waterways, and coastal areas and enhancing the capabilities of the  Deepwater assets to better meet the increased threats. In particular, the  revised plans call for equipping Deepwater helicopters to provide warning  and disabling weapons fire at sea and in ports, waterways, and coastal  areas. Further, while the original plan called for assets to have Deepwater  interoperability\u2014meaning that all Deepwater aircraft and vessels could  communicate with one another\u2014the revised plans call for Deepwater  assets to also have interoperability with assets from the Departments of  Homeland Security and Defense, as well as with the Coast Guard\u2019s  Rescue21 (R21) project.

Under the revised plans, the Coast Guard will  upgrade the HH-60s and not purchase any AB-139 helicopters. Coast Guard  officials said they elected to retain the HH-60s because they determined  that the AB-139 aircraft was unsuitable to meet new requirements for  weaponry and for tactical operations. Retaining and upgrading HH-60  helicopters cost $500 million less than replacing them. Another major  change in aircraft involved retaining more HC-130s to meet long-range  surveillance, search and rescue, and airlift needs. For vessels, the revised  plans retain the original plan\u2019s approach of replacing all cutters and patrol  boats.

In particular, data provided by the Coast Guard show  that most of the $7 billion increase is attributable to costs for enhancing  and upgrading the capabilities of the planned Deepwater replacement  vessels.

For  this element, the additional capabilities included in the revised plans vary  by asset. The most extensive are for the National Security Cutter, which is  to have a sealed section within which crew can operate the ship in a  contaminated environment for limited time periods.

Using three  different capacity models, the Coast Guard generated three different  versions of the asset mix needed to meet Coast Guard performance  targets.

To ensure use of valid and current data for its  major updates of DMOES, Coast Guard gathered updated historical data  and compared these data to data from past events.

Since 2002, the Coast Guard has annually reviewed\u2014and plans to continue  reviewing\u2014the most recent complete year\u2019s worth of data and estimates  the Deepwater-only contribution toward meeting performance goals for  seven particular performance metrics. These performance metrics and  results for the most recent year available are shown in table 5.", "Disaggregating performance data to reflect Deepwater-only contributions  provides an estimate of the extent to which the Deepwater fleet is helping  the Coast Guard meet these key targets on an annual basis. For example,  as a result of these efforts, the Coast Guard determined that Deepwater  assets saved 92.6 percent of lives at risk after Coast Guard notification in  fiscal year 2004, which is slightly below the Deepwater asset target value  of 93 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress Continues in Making Recommended Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Our past concerns about the Deepwater program have been in three main  areas\u2014ensuring better program management and contractor oversight,  ensuring greater accountability on the part of the system integrator, and  creating sufficient competition to help act as a control on costs\u2014and we  made a total of 11 recommendations to address these concerns. During  our 2005 review, we determined that the Coast Guard had addressed and  fully implemented 2 of these 11 recommendations. The Coast Guard  disagreed with and declined to implement a separate recommendation that  pertained to updating its cost baseline to determine whether the  Deepwater acquisition approach is costing more than a conventional  acquisition approach. While we stand behind our original  recommendation, we decided not to pursue it further because the Coast  Guard determined that the cost to implement this recommendation was  excessive. Thus, at the time we began our current review, 8 of the   11 recommendations were not yet fully implemented. On the basis of  information we gathered for this review, we consider 3 of these   8 recommendations to be fully implemented. The Coast Guard is in the  process of taking actions to implement 3 more recommendations, but full  implementation is dependent on seeing results or completion of actions  that are not yet in final form. The 2 remaining recommendations, both  relating to overall program management and oversight, remain  problematic. One relates to improving the effectiveness of integrated  product teams, the other to providing field personnel with guidance and  training on transitioning to new Deepwater assets.

These staffing shortfalls contributed to problems in making  timely decisions and keeping pace with the workload.", "Steps taken: The Coast Guard took several steps to address this issue. Its  initial steps involved hiring contractors to assist with program support  functions, shifting some positions from being staffed by military personnel  to civilian personnel to mitigate turnover risk, and identifying the hard-to- fill positions and developing recruitment plans specifically for them.  Subsequent to these changes, the Deepwater program\u2019s executive officer  (1) approved a revised human capital plan in February 2005 emphasizing  workforce planning and (2) is developing ways to leverage institutional  knowledge as staff rotate out of the Deepwater program.

Integrated product teams (IPTs), the  Coast Guard\u2019s primary tool for managing the Deepwater program,  overseeing contractor activities, and ensuring collaboration have  experienced difficulty from the outset. IPTs, which are generally chaired  by a subcontractor representative and consist of members representing  the subcontractors and the Coast Guard, are responsible for overall  program planning and management, asset integration, and overseeing  delivery of specific Deepwater assets. In 2004, we reported these teams  were struggling to carry out their missions because of four major issues:  lack of timely charters to provide authority needed for decision making,  inadequate communication among team members, high turnover, and  insufficient training.", "Steps taken: In 2005, we found that all IPTs had charters and their  members had received entry-level training. Decision making, however,  continued to be largely compartmented. Since then, the Coast Guard has  established domain management teams to serve as oversight and conflict  resolution entities for the IPTs. According to Coast Guard officials, these  teams are also to enhance collaboration on issues that cut across several  IPTs. Monthly assessments show IPTs have continued to improve their  effectiveness across all performance measures.", "Recommendation status: While the Coast Guard has taken some actions,  we do not believe the actions are sufficient to consider the  recommendation to be fully implemented because there are indications  that collaboration among subcontractors remains inconsistent. Last year  we pointed out that ICGS\u2019s two major subcontractors, Lockheed Martin  and Northrop Grumman, were operating under their own management  systems and that this approach could lessen the likelihood that a system- of-systems outcome would be successfully achieved. During our current  review, Coast Guard performance monitors and the program\u2019s executive  officer reported that collaboration among the subcontractors continues to  be problematic and that ICGS wields little influence to compel decisions  among them. For example, when dealing with proposed design changes to  assets under construction, ICGS submits the changes as two separate  proposals from both first-tier subcontractors rather than coordinating the  separate proposals into one coherent plan. According to Coast Guard  performance monitors, this approach complicates the Coast Guard\u2019s  review of the needed design change because the two proposals often carry  overlapping work items, thereby forcing the Coast Guard to act as the  system integrator in these situations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Field Personnel with Guidance and Training on Transitioning to New Deepwater Assets", "paragraphs": ["Original issue: In 2004, we found the Coast Guard had not effectively  communicated decisions on (1) how new Deepwater and existing assets  are to be integrated during the transition and (2) whether Coast Guard or  contractor personnel (or a combination of the two) will be responsible for  maintenance of the Deepwater assets. For example, Coast Guard field  personnel, including senior-level operators and naval engineering support  command officials, said they had not received information about how they  would be able to continue accomplishing their missions using existing  assets while also being trained on the new assets.", "Steps taken: The Coast Guard has taken some steps to improve the level  of communication between the Deepwater program and field operators  and maintenance personnel. A November 2004 analysis of the Deepwater  program\u2019s communication process, conducted in coordination with the  National Graduate School, found that the communication and feedback  process was inadequate. Since then, the Coast Guard has placed more  emphasis on outreach to field personnel, including surveys, face-to-face  meetings, and presentations.

In 2004, we found that the time frame for the  first review of the contractor\u2019s performance against the Deepwater goals  had slipped.

These criteria allow the baseline to be  adjusted based on significant changes in mission requirements, schedule  changes, or project funding, or for specific congressional actions. Coast  Guard officials also told us that they have also added criteria for making  changes to the baseline, such as:  insufficient program funding or inflationary pressure that exceeds the  assumptions and   natural disasters or periods of national emergency that require a deviation  from the baseline\u2019s cost, schedule, or performance parameters.", "Coast Guard officials said that approval of revisions to the program\u2019s  overall baseline must come through approved decision memorandums  from the Agency Acquisition Executive, who is the Vice Commandant of  the Coast Guard.

The Coast Guard is required to submit  Deepwater program baseline information to DHS on a quarterly basis, and  the project is subject to an annual review by the DHS Investment Review  Board.

Shortly before, the system integrator had adopted  Lockheed Martin\u2019s \u201copen business model\u201d as a corporate policy to help  ensure competition and keep costs under control. However, the open  business model is not a formal policy involving specific decision points to  ensure that competition will be considered.

These interviews also  included discussions of how these models, and other factors, were used in  developing the current Deepwater asset mix, as well as whether the Coast  Guard has developed an approach for determining the extent to which the  Deepwater asset mix will allow it to meet its performance targets.", "In assessing the Coast Guard\u2019s modeling and other analytical methods  used for developing the revised Deepwater asset mix, we paid particular  attention to the most recent performance gap analysis (PGA) study (PGA  IV), which compared the projected performance of the revised Deepwater  asset mix to that of the original Deepwater asset mix\u2014so that we could  gain a better understanding of how these results were used in developing  the revised Deepwater asset mix. Specifically, we reviewed the report\u2019s  methodology and requested additional clarifying information to help  determine if the analytic work supported the report\u2019s conclusions. As part  of our assessment, we developed an analysis that departs from what the  Coast Guard describes in its report in two important ways. First, and most  important, the Coast Guard assigned a linear scale ranging from 1 to 5 to  five statistical categories describing the distribution of the analysis data.  This range assigned numerical values to the degree to which the revised  asset mix was projected to outperform (or underperform) the original  asset mix, with 1 representing projected performance two or more  standard deviations below that of the original asset mix, up to 5,  representing projected performance two or more standard deviations  above that of the original asset mix. It is our opinion that this type of linear  scale is not appropriate for capturing the variations in projected  performance. Accordingly, we used a weighting scheme for these  categories (known as z-scores) that better reflects the relationship among  these categories. The z-scores take into account the statistical property  that being two standard deviations away from the mean value is almost  five times more difficult than being one standard deviation away from the  mean. Second, we compared our calculated performance measure weights  to a standard in order to assess if our weighting scheme would affect the  study\u2019s conclusions. Since the methodology identified three mission  significance categories and four regional mission priority categories, we  compared our recalculated weights based upon the z-score with the  weights we would expect to see if all mission performance measures  across all mission priorities for the four modeled regions had exceed one  standard deviation above the mean in improvement. Despite the different  methodologies used, our results generally aligned with what the Coast  Guard reported in PGA IV.", "To determine the status of the Coast Guard\u2019s implementation of our prior  recommendations for improving program management, strengthening  contractor accountability, and controlling costs, we reviewed and  analyzed briefings and relevant documentation provided by the Deepwater  Program Executive Office on actions taken to address our concerns.

We analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s plans to increase communications  to field operators, and documentation from field operators and  maintenance personnel regarding these communications. Further, we  analyzed the February 2005 Deepwater revised Human Capital Plan to  identify changes that have been made and discussed Deepwater Program  Office staffing plans with Coast Guard officials. To supplement our  analyses of the relevant documentation, we held several meetings with the  Deepwater Program Executive Officer, the Deputy Program Executive  Officer, and a number of Deepwater staff, including contracting officials  and representatives from the system integrator.
