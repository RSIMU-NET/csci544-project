In fiscal years 1993-2001, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded approximately $4.5 billion for 165 HOPE VI revitalization grants to public housing authorities (grantees). GAO was asked to examine (1) the types of housing to which the original residents of HOPE VI sites were relocated and the number of original residents that grantees expect to return to the revitalized sites, (2) how the fiscal year 1996 grantees have involved residents in the HOPE VI process, and (3) how the neighborhoods surrounding the 20 sites that received HOPE VI grants in fiscal year 1996 have changed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The largest percentage of the approximately 49,000 residents that had been relocated from HOPE VI sites, as of June 30, 2003, were relocated to other public housing, and about half were expected to return to the revitalized sites. Although grantees, overall, expected 46 percent of relocated residents to return, the percentage of original residents that were expected to return (or the reoccupancy rate) varied greatly from site to site. The level of resident involvement in the HOPE VI process varied at the 1996 sites. While all of the 1996 grantees held meetings to inform residents about revitalization plans and solicit their input, some took additional steps to involve residents. For example, in Tucson, the housing authority submitted the revitalization plan for the Connie Chambers site to the city council for approval only after the residents had voted to approve it. The neighborhoods in which 1996 HOPE VI sites are located generally have experienced improvements in indicators such as education, income, and housing, although GAO could not determine the extent to which the HOPE VI program contributed to these changes. In a comparison of four 1996 HOPE VI neighborhoods to four comparable neighborhoods, mortgage lending activity increased to a greater extent in three of the HOPE VI neighborhoods. But, a comparison of other variables (such as education and new construction) produced inconsistent results, with HOPE VI neighborhoods experiencing both greater positive and negative changes than comparable neighborhoods."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The public housing program began in the late 1930s and 1940s as a means  to provide temporary housing for the working poor. By the 1960s and 1970s,  public housing had become the housing of last resort. Over time, some of  the nation\u2019s public housing became old and deteriorated, leaving residents  to live in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. In 1989, Congress formed the  National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing (the  Commission) and tasked it with proposing a national action plan to  eradicate severely distressed public housing by the year 2000. In 1992, the  Commission reported that approximately 86,000, or 6 percent, of the  nation\u2019s public housing units were severely distressed\u2014characterized by  physical deterioration and uninhabitable living conditions; high levels of  poverty; inadequate and fragmented services; institutional abandonment;  and location in neighborhoods often as blighted as the sites themselves.  Therefore, the Commission recommended increased funding for support  services to residents of severely distressed public housing, resident  participation in revitalization efforts, and revitalization consistent with any  occurring in surrounding neighborhoods.", "In response to the Commission\u2019s report, Congress, in October 1992,  established the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program, commonly  known as HOPE VI, which is administered by the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD). By providing funds for a combination of  capital improvements and supportive services, such as child care and job  training, HOPE VI seeks to fulfill its legislative goals of (1) improving the  living environment for public housing residents of severely distressed  public housing through the demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or  replacement of obsolete public housing; (2) revitalizing sites on which such  public housing is located and contributing to the improvement of the  surrounding neighborhood; (3) providing housing that will avoid or  decrease the concentration of very low-income families; and (4) building  sustainable communities. In fiscal years 1993-2001, HUD awarded  approximately $4.5 billion in HOPE VI revitalization grants to 98 public  housing authorities (grantees) for 165 sites.", "You requested that we comprehensively review the HOPE VI program.  Because of the scope of the request, we agreed with your office to provide  the information in a series of reports. The first report, issued in November  2002, discussed the financing of HOPE VI sites. The second report, issued  in May 2003, described HUD\u2019s management of the HOPE VI program. This  third and final report focuses on the effect that the HOPE VI program has  had on residents and the neighborhoods surrounding HOPE VI sites.  Specifically, as agreed with your office, this report examines (1) the types  of housing to which the original residents of HOPE VI sites were relocated  and the number of original residents that grantees expect to return to the  revitalized sites, (2) how the fiscal year 1996 grantees have involved  residents in the HOPE VI process, (3) the types of community and  supportive services that have been provided to residents and the results  achieved, and (4) how the neighborhoods surrounding the sites that  received HOPE VI grants in fiscal year 1996 have changed.", "To address these objectives, we first obtained and analyzed information  from HUD\u2019s HOPE VI reporting system on the 165 revitalization grants  awarded through fiscal year 2001, including relocation, reoccupancy (the  movement of some original residents to completed units), and community  and supportive services data. Second, we visited the 18 housing authorities  that were awarded revitalization grants in fiscal year 1996 and interviewed  resident representatives at 19 of the 20 sites. We selected the 1996 grants  because they were the first awarded after HUD issued a rule allowing  revitalization to be funded with a combination of public and private funds,  which has become the HOPE VI model. Third, to determine how  neighborhoods have changed, we analyzed Census and Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act (HMDA) data and reviewed crime data summaries. Finally,  we interviewed the HUD headquarters officials responsible for  administering the program. We assessed the reliability of the HUD, Census,  HMDA, and summary crime data we used by reviewing information about  how the data were collected and performing electronic testing to detect  obvious errors in completeness and reasonableness. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We performed our work in Washington, D.C. and other U.S. cities from  November 2001 to October 2003 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

NOFAs announce the availability of funds and set forth application  requirements and the selection process. Grant agreements are executed  between each grantee and HUD and specify the activities, key deadlines,  and documentation that grantees must meet or complete. Both NOFAs and  grant agreements also contain guidance on resident involvement in the  HOPE VI process. For example, the fiscal year 2002 NOFA stated that  residents and the broader community should be involved in the planning,  proposed implementation, and management of revitalization plans. In  additional guidance on resident involvement, HUD encourages grantees to  communicate, consult, and collaborate with affected residents and the  broader community through resident councils, consultative groups,  newsletters, and resident surveys. HUD\u2019s guidance states that residents  should be included in all phases of HOPE VI development, but also states  that grantees have the final decision-making authority.", "The majority of HOPE VI grants involve the relocation of residents from a  public housing site prior to demolition or rehabilitation. Grantees must  conduct the relocation process in accordance with laws such as the  Uniform Relocation Act and HUD guidance. Before the relocation process  can begin, the grantee must develop a HOPE VI relocation plan that  includes the number of families to be relocated, a description of the  counseling and advisory services to be offered to families, a description of  housing resources that will be used to relocate families, an estimate of  relocation costs, and an example of the notice the grantee will provide to  residents concerning relocation. Residents are generally given three basic  relocation options: (1) using a housing choice voucher (formerly Section 8)  to move into the private market, (2) moving to a different public housing  site, or (3) leaving federally assisted housing.", "Revitalized HOPE VI sites often contain fewer public housing units and  have more stringent screening criteria. HUD guidance states that grantees  must collaborate with residents and other stakeholders to establish criteria  that residents must meet in order to return to the site. Residents are not  guaranteed that they will automatically return to the site. Typically,  grantees offer original residents who remain in good standing the first  priority right to return to the revitalized site.", "Grantees must offer community and supportive services\u2014such as child  care, transportation, job training, job placement and retention services, and  parenting classes\u2014to all original residents, regardless of their intention to  return to the revitalized site. HUD guidance states that services for original  residents should begin as soon as possible following the grant award and  help residents make progress toward self-sufficiency. Additionally, HUD  guidance suggests that grantees offer residents community and supportive  services that are specifically designed to help them meet the criteria for  their return to the revitalized site. New households that move to the  revitalized site also are eligible to receive services. HUD guidance  emphasizes that HOPE VI grantees should use case managers to assess the  needs and circumstances of residents and then make appropriate referrals  to a range of service providers. Grantees must submit to HUD a community  and supportive services plan that contains a description of the supportive  services that will be provided to residents, proposed steps and schedules  for establishing arrangements with service providers, plans for actively  involving residents in planning and implementing supportive services, and  a system for monitoring and tracking the performance of the supportive  services programs, as well as resident progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Largest Percentage of Original Residents Were Relocated to Other Public Housing, and About Half Are Expected to Return to HOPE VI Sites", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD data, the largest percentage of residents living at HOPE  VI sites were relocated to other public housing.

Additionally, approximately 6 percent were evicted, and about 14 percent  were classified as \u201cother,\u201d which includes either residents who moved  without giving notice or who moved out of public housing. Grantees lost  track of some original residents for a number of reasons. HUD did not  emphasize the need to track original residents until 1998 and did not  require grantees to report the location of residents until 2000. Also, four of  the 1996 grantees we interviewed stated that it was difficult to track  residents who had left federally-assisted housing (i.e., were no longer in  public housing or using a voucher.)", "In a June 2002 report to Congress, HUD acknowledged that efforts to track  original residents during the development process had been uneven and  stated that the agency and grantees were working to improve resident  tracking. All but one of the 1996 grantees developed some means of  tracking original residents, although three stated that they only tracked a  subset of original residents, such as those still in public housing or using a  voucher. The Housing Authority of Louisville created a database to track  residents and used it to determine the status of the 1,304 families that  resided at Cotter and Lang Homes prior to relocation. The housing  authority concluded that 65 percent had been relocated to other public  housing or given vouchers, and 33 percent had vacated Cotter or Lang prior  to being relocated. It could not determine if the remaining 2 percent had  been relocated or vacated prior to relocation. In addition, two 1996  grantees took steps to locate original residents with whom they had lost  contact. The Chicago Housing Authority hired a consultant to help it find  relocated residents. To track down those original residents that did not  remain in public housing or take a voucher, the Spartanburg Housing  Authority posted public notices stating that the authority was trying to  track down original residents and held meetings to get their addresses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors May Affect the Return Rate for Original Residents", "paragraphs": ["Overall, grantees estimated that 46 percent of all the original residents of  HOPE VI sites would return to the revitalized sites. However, as shown in  figure 2, the percentage of original residents that were expected to return  varied greatly from site to site. For example, at the 113 sites where  reoccupancy was not yet complete, the planned reoccupancy rate was less  than 25 percent at 23 sites; in contrast, the planned rate was 75 percent or  greater at 24 sites. At the 39 sites where reoccupancy was complete, the  actual reoccupancy rate was less than 25 percent at 17 sites and 75 percent  or greater at 7 sites. Also, the percentage of residents that were expected to  return decreased over time. As of September 30, 1999 (the earliest date for  which we could obtain data), fiscal year 1993\u20131998 grantees estimated that  61 percent of the original residents would return to the revitalized sites. By  June 30, 2003, the same grantees estimated that 44 percent of the original  residents would return.", "Several factors may affect planned and actual reoccupancy rates, including  the mix of units. To reduce the concentration of poverty at HOPE VI sites,  HUD recommends a mix of public housing, affordable housing (low- income housing tax credit or other subsidized housing), and market-rate  housing. As a result, grantees, as of June 30, 2003, had demolished or  planned to demolish 76,393 public housing units and rebuild or renovate  44,781 replacement public housing units. At the 1996 sites, the percentage  of public housing units being replaced ranged from 10 percent to 102  percent (see fig. 3). Resident and low-income housing advocates have  criticized the HOPE VI program for reducing the number of public housing  units. However, HUD, in its June 2002 report to Congress, pointed to the  number of affordable units and vouchers that the program would provide.  HUD also noted that over 20,000 of the units to be demolished were long- standing vacancies when the housing authorities applied for a HOPE VI  grant, and that a majority of the vacant units were uninhabitable.", "As shown in figure 4, the percentage of revitalized units that are public  housing units varied from site to site. Among the 143 sites where  construction was not yet complete, as of June 30, 2003, public housing  units constituted less than 50 percent of total units at 69 sites. At all but  three of the 22 sites where construction was complete, 50 percent or more  of the units were public housing units. Additionally, the number of  planned public housing units decreased over time. As of September 30,  1999 (the earliest date for which we could obtain data), fiscal year 1993\u2013 1998 grantees estimated that they would construct 34,199 public housing  units. By June 30, 2003, the same grantees estimated that they would  construct 30,772 public housing units\u2014about a 10-percent decrease. (This  decrease in the number of planned public housing units may help explain  why the percentage of residents that the grantees expected to return  decreased over time, as discussed previously in this report.)", "Another factor that may affect reoccupancy is the screening criteria that  original residents must meet to return to the revitalized sites. HUD allows  grantees to determine the screening criteria for each site. Consequently, the  screening criteria varied at the 1996 sites we visited. For example, the  Charlotte Housing Authority required returning Dalton Village residents to  participate in the family self-sufficiency program. Residents that do not  successfully complete the program within 5 years and are not in violation  of their lease will be transferred to another public housing site. In addition  to participation in the family self-sufficiency program, the Spartanburg  Housing Authority required returning Tobe Hartwell residents to agree to  random drug testing. In contrast, there were no special criteria at some  sites. In Tucson, there were no new screening criteria for the original  residents of the Connie Chambers site. Under a settlement agreement, all of  the residents of Henry Horner Homes in Chicago, Illinois, were eligible to  return.", "Other factors that may affect reoccupancy include resident preferences  and the time between relocation and completion of construction of the new  units. According to three of the 1996 grantees, some relocated residents did  not want to return to the revitalized sites because they preferred a voucher  or were satisfied at their new location. Another 1996 grantee observed that,  because of the length of time between relocation and construction, some  residents did not want to move again. For the 1996 grantees, the average  time between the completion of relocation and the projected or actual  completion of construction was 86 months (times ranged from 26 months  to 129 months)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Resident Involvement in the HOPE VI Process Has Varied", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which grantees involved residents in the HOPE VI process  has varied at the 1996 sites.

The NOFA required that, prior to  applying for a HOPE VI revitalization grant, housing authorities conduct at  least one training session for residents on the HOPE VI development  process and at least three public meetings with residents and the broader  community to involve them in developing revitalization plans and preparing  the application. The fiscal year 2002 grant agreement (between HUD and  the winning applicants) stated that grantees were required to foster the  involvement of, and gather input and recommendations from, affected  residents throughout the entire development process.

In addition to their HOPE  VI funds, grantees are encouraged to obtain in-kind, financial, and other  types of resources necessary to carry out and sustain supportive service  activities from organizations such as local boards of education, public  libraries, private foundations, nonprofit organizations, faith-based  organizations, and economic development agencies. Of the $714 million  budgeted for community and supportive services, $418 million were HOPE  VI funds (59 percent), and $295 million (41 percent) were leveraged funds.

In fact, all of the 1996 grantees have used the case  management approach. For example, the Housing Authority of New  Orleans hired a social service provider located near the St. Thomas site to  perform assessments and provide case management plans for residents.  The Holyoke Housing Authority has three case managers, who help  residents of its 1996 grant site find employment, acquire General  Educational Development (GED) certificates, take English as a Second  Language courses, and receive homeownership counseling. The Chester  Housing Authority established a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d at a local hospital, which  serves as the coordinating point for all programs and partners servicing the  authority\u2019s residents.", "Grantees have also used funds set aside for community and supportive  services to construct facilities where services are provided by other  entities. For example, the Charlotte Housing Authority spent $1.5 million in  HOPE VI funds to construct an 11,000-square-foot community and  recreational center consisting of a gymnasium, four classrooms, and a  computer lab near its 1996 grant site. In exchange, the residents annually  will receive $60,000 in services from the center, which is run by the  Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation Department. The Tucson  Community Services Department, which serves as Tucson\u2019s public housing  authority, used some of its 1996 HOPE VI funds to fund the construction of  a child development center and learning center. Two day care programs\u2014 one operated by Head Start and the other by a local nonprofit  organization\u2014are operating in the child development center, and a  computer library run by the Tucson-Pima Public Library is operating in the  learning center. The Spartanburg Housing Authority used a portion of its  HOPE VI funds to build a community center containing a computer center,  health clinic, and gymnasium. The Spartanburg Technical College provides  adult and student computer training, and the University of South Carolina  Spartanburg School of Nursing performs health assessments and tracking  at the center.", "Grantees also provided direct services such as computer and job training.  For instance, the New York City Housing Authority instituted a computer  incentive program that provides a personal computer system to Arverne  and Edgemere residents who either work 96 hours volunteering on HOPE  VI recruiting and other HOPE VI activities or who participate in a HOPE VI  training program. HOPE VI residents enrolled in the San Francisco Housing  Authority\u2019s family self-sufficiency program can receive up to $1,200 per  household to participate in training for various trades.

We recommended in July 1998 that HUD develop  consistent national, outcome-based measures for community and support  services at HOPE VI sites. Since June 2000, HUD has used its HOPE VI  reporting system to collect data from grantees on the major types of  community and supportive services they provide and the outcomes  achieved by some of these services.

At the 39 sites where reoccupancy was  complete, we divided the number of original residents who actually  returned by the total number of residents relocated. We excluded 10 of the  165 sites from our analysis because they did not involve relocation and an  additional three sites because the reoccupancy data reported as of June 30,  2003, was incorrect.

Census block groups were  used, as this geographic area was likely to better represent the area of the  housing site and its adjacent neighborhood than a larger census entity, such  as a census tract, would have. That is, use of block groups lessened the  likelihood that both community residents and characteristics that are not  influenced by the housing development were included in the analyses.

While we recognized that such a method would permit the greatest  understanding of community changes and their relationship to HOPE VI,  we could not utilize it for two reasons. First, in-depth, longitudinal case  studies of multiple HOPE VI sites would be very resource-intensive and  were outside the scope of this study. Second, it is unlikely that we or other  analysts could identify a series of identical neighborhoods given the natural  variation in population, business, and housing development characteristics  that occurs within a city over the length of a longitudinal study. Therefore,  in an attempt to limit the potential factors that could explain changes  observed in HOPE VI communities, we worked with the public housing  authorities that managed the four 1996 HOPE VI sites that had completed  75 percent or more of their on-site construction, as of December 31, 2002,  to identify comparison neighborhoods.

Populations were based on a 100 percent count of the  individuals living in the block groups.", "With the exception of the population total, each of the census variables is  based on sample data. Since this sample is only one of a large number of  samples that might have been drawn and each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of this  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (for  example, plus or minus 7 percentage points). This is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples that could  have been drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals in this report will include the true values for the  population. We used the methodology described in the Census Bureau\u2019s  documentation for the 1990 and 2000 Censuses (Appendix C: Accuracy of  the Data, 1990, and Chapter 8: Accuracy of the Data, 2000) to calculate  standard errors and confidence intervals. Essentially, we used the Census  Bureau\u2019s formulas to compute the standard error for the sample estimate  under the assumption of simple random sampling. We then multiplied this  result by a design effect factor to adjust for the survey\u2019s sample design to  give the appropriate standard error.", "In order to determine whether the 1990 and 2000 percent change estimates  were statistically significant, we interpreted the confidence interval. For  example, if the confidence interval includes zero, then the difference  between the 1990 and 2000 estimates is not considered a statistically  significant difference. If the confidence interval does not include zero, then  the percent change between the 1990 and 2000 estimates is considered  statistically significant (see app. III). We also calculated 95 percent  confidence intervals to determine whether there are statistically significant  differences between the HOPE VI and non-HOPE VI (comparable)  neighborhoods on the percent differences from 1990 to 2000.", "In addition to sampling errors, sample data (and 100 percent data) are  subject to nonsampling errors, which may occur during the operations  used to collect and process census data. Examples of nonsampling errors  are not enumerating every housing unit or person in the sample, failing to  obtain all required information from a respondent, obtaining incorrect  information, and recording information incorrectly. Operations such as  field review of enumerators\u2019 work, clerical handling of questionnaires, and  electronic processing of questionnaires also may introduce nonsampling  errors in the data. The Census Bureau discusses sources of nonsampling  errors and attempts to control in detail.", "To analyze the HMDA data for each of the 20 HOPE VI sites and the four  comparable sites, we compared the number of loans originated in 1996  with the number originated in 2001 (see app. III). The HMDA data contain  all of the loans originating in these time periods; therefore, it is not a  sample, and confidence intervals did not need to be computed for these  data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Census, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and Summary Crime Data", "paragraphs": ["We obtained 1990 and 2000 census data for each neighborhood in which a  1996 HOPE VI site is located, as well as for four neighborhoods in which  public housing that is comparable to selected 1996 HOPE VI sites is  located.  When using census data, we defined a neighborhood as consisting  of the census block group in which a site is located, as well as the adjacent  census block groups.  We selected nine census data variables, which are  generally used by researchers to measure neighborhood change, and  analyzed the changes in these variables from 1990 to 2000 (see tables 2  through 4).

This data was obtained from public housing authority  officials and consisted of the total number of crimes that occurred in  selected categories.
