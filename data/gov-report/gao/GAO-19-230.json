Perpetrators of fraud can use stolen personal information\u2014such as account numbers, passwords, or Social Security numbers\u2014to take out loans or seek medical care under someone else's name, or make unauthorized purchases on credit cards, among other crimes. Foreign state-based actors can use personal information to support espionage or other nefarious uses.", "Public and private entities that experience a breach sometimes provide complimentary commercial identity theft services to affected individuals to help monitor their credit accounts or restore their identities in cases of identity theft, among other features. Consumers also may purchase the services. As of November 30, 2018, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had obligated about $421 million for a suite of credit and identity monitoring, insurance, and identity restoration services to offer to the approximately 22 million individuals affected by its 2015 data breaches. As of September 30, 2018, about 3 million had used the services and approximately 61 individuals had received payouts from insurance claims, for an average of $1,800 per claim. OPM re-competed and awarded a contract to the previously contracted company in December 2018.", "GAO's review did not identify any studies that analyzed whether consumers who sign up for or purchase identity theft services were less subject to identity theft or detected financial or other fraud more or less quickly than those who monitored their own accounts for free. A few experts said consumers could sign up for such services if offered for free. Credit monitoring may be convenient for consumers and personalized restoration services may help identity theft victims recover their identities, but such services do not prevent fraud from happening in the first place. The services also do not prevent or directly address risks of nonfinancial harm such as medical identity theft.", "Consumer, government, and industry experts highlighted other free options, including a credit freeze, which prevents one type of fraud. A freeze restricts businesses from accessing a person's credit report\u2014and can prevent the illicit opening of a new account or loan in the person's name. A provision of federal law that took effect in September 2018 made it free for consumers to place or lift credit freezes quickly at the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Consumers also can regularly monitor their accounts and review their credit reports for free every 12 months. In addition, they can take advantage of free federal assistance such as the guidance on the Federal Trade Commission's IdentityTheft.gov website.", "Finally, large amounts of personal information are outside of consumers' control and bad actors can use stolen information for years after a breach. Therefore, experts noted that data security at entities that hold such information\u2014and efforts to make stolen information less useful for identity thieves, through use of new identity verification technologies, for example\u2014are important ways to mitigate risks of harm for consumers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO reiterates a matter for congressional consideration and a recommendation from its 2017 report on identity theft services ( GAO-17-254 ).

Therefore, Congress should consider permitting agencies to determine the appropriate coverage level for such insurance.

Consumers whose information is exposed can be at risk of a  range of harms, including identity theft or fraud. Consumers can try to  prevent or mitigate these harms in a number of ways, such as monitoring  their credit reports and credit card statements for suspicious activity, or  placing a credit freeze that restricts access to their credit report.

For example, two  company representatives said that their services focus on detection of  fraudulent activity or assistance after identity theft has occurred, rather  than on prevention of identity theft or other harms. The representatives of  each of the providers said that their companies generally measure how  customers use their products and services; customer satisfaction (for  example, through surveys or other feedback); and whether the products  work as intended (for example, whether alerts of fraudulent activity are  successfully delivered to customers or customers can successfully  access the company\u2019s website when they need to). Companies that offer  identity restoration services also measure the rate at which they complete  the process of recovering stolen identities.

For example, FTC suggests that consumers ask  if service providers check databases that show payday loan applications  or changes in addresses for misuse of their information as part of identity  monitoring.

Representatives of retail and  banking associations we interviewed indicated that it has become the  industry standard to offer 1 year of credit or identity monitoring services in  the wake of a data breach. One industry representative said that in some  cases the decision is not based on the effectiveness of the services.  States such as California require companies to offer some type of identity  theft service after a data breach. Moreover, Connecticut requires health  insurers and certain health care-related companies to offer identity theft  services following an actual or suspected data breach. In 2017, we  reported that companies do not assess the effectiveness of an identity  theft provider\u2019s services when selecting a vendor to provide such  services.

No one solution  can protect against the full range of risks to individuals whose personal  information was exposed in a data breach, based on our review of  documentation and the views of academic, consumer, government, and  industry experts. We obtained perspectives on the value of options  available to consumers. The following summarizes key observations:  Identity theft services. Representatives of 9 of the 10 consumer groups  we interviewed generally viewed credit or identity monitoring (or both) to  be of limited value. However, one consumer group representative noted  that identity monitoring might be useful in circumstances in which Social  Security numbers were compromised. In addition, a few consumer group  representatives indicated that consumers could consider signing up for  such services if they are offered for free. If identity theft services are not  free, FTC and CFPB consumer education materials recommend that  consumers consider the benefits and limitations of such services and  compare them to free or low-cost options before signing up. A few  consumer groups and one academic highlighted that consumers may not  fully understand the limitations of signing up for identity theft services. A  few consumer group representatives and one industry and state  government representative cautioned that free services may be offered for only 1 or 2 years; exposed information can be used for identity theft or  other harms over a much longer period. For example, in 2017, we  reported that nation-state actors that steal consumer data as part of their  espionage activities can wait much longer than a private identity thief to  use compromised information (if at all), according to one identity theft  service provider. In addition, CFPB consumer information and a few  consumer group representatives noted that consumers should be aware  that some services may try to charge consumers after the free period  ends.", "Some consumer group and one industry representatives also said that  the value of one feature of identity monitoring\u2014dark web monitoring\u2014is  unclear. One representative said that there is nothing new that  consumers can do once they learn their information was found on an illicit  website. Rather, they must continue to monitor their accounts as they  already should have been doing. In addition, one consumer group  representative indicated that these services may provide consumers with  a false sense of security.", "Experts we interviewed for our 2017 report said that identity restoration in  particular could be helpful to consumers. FTC staff and one consumer  group representative we interviewed said that one-on-one assistance can  be helpful. Identity restoration typically is included with other identity theft  services rather than offered as a stand-alone service. However, the level  of service provided in identity restoration can vary substantially\u2014some  providers offer individualized hands-on assistance, while others largely  provide self-help information that is of more limited value. In our 2017  report, we also found that another feature of identity theft services,  identity theft insurance, may provide minimal benefits for consumers.  More details about identity theft insurance appear later in this report.", "Options to prevent fraud or harm unrelated to credit accounts.  Consumers have limited options to mitigate risks of other harms from data  breaches, such as medical identity theft and identity theft tax refund fraud.  Commercial identity theft services, credit freezes, and fraud alerts do not  directly address these risks. Some consumer, government, and industry  representatives cited self-monitoring as a way for consumers to be on the  alert for these other types of fraud.", "Consistent with our 2017 report, identity theft service providers we  interviewed generally indicated that their products and services do not  directly monitor for these types of fraud. However, two noted that they  would assist with any identity restoration involving medical identity theft,  tax refund fraud, or government benefits fraud (such as fraudulently  redirecting Social Security benefits). Identity theft services also may  address these types of fraud indirectly\u2014for example, detecting a  fraudulent change of address can prevent sensitive health insurance  information from being redirected to the fraudster. A few consumer  groups said that consumers may not understand which risks commercial  identity theft services address. Additionally, we reported in 2017 that  identity theft services do not address non-financial harms, such as  emotional distress, embarrassment, and harm to one\u2019s reputation. For  example, a House Committee report on the OPM data breaches noted  that the information stolen from background investigations included some  of the most intimate and potentially embarrassing aspects of a person\u2019s  life, such as mental health history, misuse of alcohol or drugs, or  problems with gambling. Identity theft services also may be of limited  value in cases of nation-state espionage. For example, in 2017, we  reported that when the source of the data breach appears to be a nation  state (as opposed to a private party), the risk of the information being sold  for monetary purposes is likely to be lower, according to an FTC  representative.", "Importance of data security. In the view of some experts, entities such  as the federal government and private companies that hold consumer  data have a responsibility to protect those data. A few experts said that  the burden should not be on consumers to protect data they do not  control. Except in certain circumstances, companies are generally not  required to be transparent about the consumer data they hold or how they  collect, maintain, use, and secure these data. Identity theft service  providers may contract with third parties such as consumer reporting  agencies or with third-party identity monitoring providers, such as dark  web monitoring services. Moreover, one consumer group representative  noted that identity monitoring services require consumers to provide  additional personal information to enroll\u2014which also could be  compromised if the service provider\u2019s information were breached.", "Finally, consumer group and government researchers we interviewed  suggested other options that entities can (or already) use to address risks  of harm. For example, one government researcher noted that financial  institutions have started to use multifactor authentication and other  technologies that can help institutions verify a consumer\u2019s identity and  thus help prevent fraud. Multifactor authentication involves first logging  into an online account using the traditional username and password, and  then the institution sending a verification code to a mobile phone or e-mail  address that the consumer must enter as part of the log-in process. In  addition, one researcher noted that some institutions have started to use  facial recognition technology, or to ask an account holder to provide  answers to questions such as the size of the account holder\u2019s last  deposit. Other biometric technologies such as fingerprint recognition on  mobile phones, or one-time passcodes that are synced with financial  institutions\u2019 websites, also can help, according to one researcher and one  consumer group representative. Other strategies can focus on reducing  the riskiness of breaches by making information less useful for purposes  of committing identity theft. For example, one researcher noted that  organizations could encrypt data or use tokens so static account numbers  could not be used on their own. There is no single solution to address all  risks of harm, based on our review of documentation and the views of  academic, consumer, government, and industry experts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumers Can Use Free Credit Freezes and Fraud Alerts to Effectively Prevent New-Account Fraud", "paragraphs": ["A credit freeze is the only consumer option that can prevent one type of  identity theft-related fraud, and recent federal legislation made credit  freezes free and easier to place or lift. This option is effective because it  restricts potential creditors from accessing a consumer\u2019s credit report to  open a new account until the consumer asks the nationwide consumer  reporting agency to remove or temporarily lift the freeze. In contrast,  identity theft services and self-monitoring detect or remediate identity theft  after it has occurred, but do not prevent the fraud from occurring in the  first place. We interviewed representatives, or reviewed the consumer  education or informational materials, of consumer, industry, and  government entities and found that almost all of them included credit  freezes on credit reports as a useful consumer option to protect against  identity theft.", "More specifically, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act, which took effect on September 21, 2018,  required the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies (Equifax,  Experian, and TransUnion) to make placing and lifting freezes free and  specifies that the agencies must place a freeze within 1 business day,  and lift it within 1 hour, of receiving a telephone or electronic request (see  fig. 1). Consumers must contact each of the three agencies individually  and request the freeze. Consumers obtain a PIN from each company,  which enables them to lift or remove a freeze at a later date. Before the  2018 act, consumers typically had to pay $5-$10 per agency to place a  credit freeze. Some experts had noted cost and inconvenience as some  of the limitations to a credit freeze. The new law addresses these  concerns to some degree by making credit freezes free and requiring  these consumer reporting agencies to lift freezes expeditiously on  request.", "While the new law removed some barriers to placing credit freezes,  others still exist and the freezes have some limitations. For example,  consumers still have to lift a freeze before applying for a loan or new  credit account and need to place or remove a freeze at each consumer  reporting agency separately, which could cause delays for consumers  actively shopping for a home, car, or other purchase requiring the  extension of credit. Two consumer groups said that there is confusion  about how the law would affect minor children. (Under the new law, credit  freezes only can be placed on behalf of children under age 16, but not  minors ages 16 and 17\u2014who must place freezes themselves).", "Moreover, as the new law only applies to the three nationwide consumer  reporting agencies, credit freezes do not protect against new-account  fraud resulting from the use of credit reports from other consumer  reporting agencies. For example, one consumer group recommended that  consumers place a fourth freeze with the National Consumer Telecom  and Utilities Exchange\u2014a consumer reporting agency that maintains  credit reports that telecommunications or utilities companies may use to  check the creditworthiness of consumers interested in opening phone or  utility accounts. The law also permits insurance companies and  employers to continue to access credit reports even after they are frozen,  among other exceptions.", "One general limitation of credit freezes is that they do not protect against  new-account fraud in cases in which credit reports are not used to verify a  consumer\u2019s creditworthiness. Furthermore, credit freezes do not protect  against existing-account fraud, such as fraudulent credit card charges, or  certain other types of fraud, such as identity theft tax refund fraud or  synthetic identity fraud using elements of individuals\u2019 identity information.", "While experts with whom we spoke across industry, government, and  consumer groups generally believed credit freezes to be an effective tool  in preventing new-account fraud, some consumer and industry experts  indicated that fraud alerts also can be a good alternative for consumers.  Unlike a credit freeze, a fraud alert still allows companies to access an  individual\u2019s credit report for the purpose of opening a loan or credit  account. Fraud alerts notify companies requesting the reports that the  individual may have been a victim of identity theft. The alerts require  companies to verify consumers\u2019 identities before they issue credit to a  consumer. Fraud alerts therefore can make it harder for an identity thief  to open accounts in a consumer\u2019s name. Moreover, fraud alerts are  easier to place than credit freezes, as consumers only need to contact  one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies to place a fraud  alert (that agency is then obligated to contact the other two on the  individual\u2019s behalf). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act extended the period of an initial fraud alert from  90 days to 1 year.", "However, fraud alerts do not restrict access to consumers\u2019 credit reports  the way freezes do. Therefore, some consumer group and industry  representatives noted that consumers should be aware that a fraud alert  may not offer as strong a protection as a credit freeze does. We did not  find any data or analysis on the effectiveness of fraud alerts compared to  credit freezes or monitoring options. One consumer group told us that it  recommends that after a data breach consumers first place a fraud alert,  because it requires contacting only one of the three nationwide consumer  reporting agencies, and then follow up by placing a credit freeze at the  three agencies.", "The three nationwide consumer reporting agencies also offer a product  called a credit lock that is functionally similar to a credit freeze in that it  restricts access to an individual\u2019s credit report. Credit locks do not require  consumers to use a PIN and consumers can turn access to credit reports  on or off through an application on their mobile phone. However, credit  locks are not subject to the same federal requirements regarding the  placement and removal of freezes and therefore do not offer the same  degree of protection to consumers. Instead, credit locks are private  products subject to the consumer reporting agencies\u2019 terms and  conditions, which could change.

Consumers can consider the extent to which an option  might prevent fraud. For example, because credit freezes block all  access to an individual\u2019s credit report, by definition they are effective  in preventing new-account fraud where credit reports are used as part  of the account-opening process. Identity theft services do not prevent  fraud, but detect suspicious activity or help restore identities after  identity theft.", "Cost. Consumers can consider the cost of a service. For instance,  consumers can consider whether to pay for commercial identity theft  services if they believe the value of the service outweighs the effort of  monitoring their accounts on their own. In addition, they may consider  that credit freezes now are available for free.", "Convenience. Consumers may consider the convenience of a  service. For example, while consumers can monitor their own credit  reports and accounts, some might prefer not to or may be limited in  their ability to do so. In addition, technologies offered through financial  institutions that automatically alert customers to any transactions  involving their accounts can be a convenient, no-cost way for  consumers to monitor their accounts.", "Type of information at risk. Finally, several experts from consumer  and industry organizations indicated that the type of option that might  be beneficial would depend on the type of information at risk. For  example, one consumer group representative noted that if a credit  card number were stolen, an identity monitoring service that  monitored the dark web for Social Security numbers might not be  needed. Furthermore, consumers should consider that credit  monitoring will be of limited effectiveness in alerting them to misuse of  an existing credit account\u2014which is more common than fraud related  to setting up new accounts.

In our March 2017 report, we found  that OMB policy guidance for federal agencies on how to prepare for and  respond to data breaches did not address how agencies might assess the  effectiveness of identity theft services relative to lower-cost alternatives.  For example, the guidance did not discuss whether identity theft services  would be preferable to alternatives (such as fraud alerts, credit freezes, or  the agency conducting its own database monitoring).
