Asked to update its estimate, GAO (1) estimated the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin and (2) examined other effects stakeholders suggested such a replacement could have. To perform its work, GAO constructed an economic model and interviewed officials from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the U.S. Secret Service, outside experts, and officials from Canada and the United Kingdom. To determine the effects on stakeholders, GAO interviewed officials from industries and organizations that might be affected by changes to currency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO's analysis, replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin could save the government approximately $5.5 billion over 30 years. This would amount to an average yearly discounted net benefit--that is, the present value of future net benefits--of about $184 million. However, GAO's analysis, which assumes a 4-year transition period beginning in 2011, indicates that the benefit would vary over the 30 years. The government would incur a net loss in the first 4 years and then realize a net benefit in the remaining years. The early net loss is due in part to the up-front costs to the U.S. Mint of increasing its coin production during the transition. GAO's current estimate is lower than its 2000 estimate, which indicated an annual net benefit to the government of $522 million. This is because some information has changed over time and GAO incorporated some different assumptions in its economic model. For example, the lifespan of the note has increased over the past decade, and GAO assumed a lower ratio of coins to notes needed for replacement. GAO has noted in past reports that efforts to increase the circulation and public acceptance of the $1 coin have not succeeded, in part, because the $1 note has remained in circulation. Other countries that have replaced a low-denomination note with a coin, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, stopped producing the note. Officials from both countries told GAO that this step was essential to the success of their transition and that, with no alternative to the note, public resistance dissipated within a few years. Stakeholders representing a variety of cash-intensive entities in the private sector identified potential shorter- and longer-term effects of a replacement. For example, some stakeholders said that they would initially incur costs to modify equipment and add storage and that later their costs to process and transport coins would go up. Others, however, such as some transit agencies, have already made the transition and would not incur such initial costs. As in the past, GAO's analysis indicates that replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a financial benefit to the government if production of the $1 note ceased. GAO previously recommended replacement of the $1 note and continues to support this recommendation. The Federal Reserve and Treasury reviewed a draft of this report and both noted the importance of societal effects in deciding on such a replacement and offered technical comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 40 years, many countries have replaced lower-denomination  notes with coins as a means of providing a financial benefit to their  governments. We have reported four times over the past 20 years that  replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a net benefit to the  government of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Most recently, in  2000, we estimated a net benefit to the government of about $522 million  annually. Because this last estimate was a decade old, you asked us to  update it and describe some potential effects of replacing the $1 note with  a $1 coin. To accomplish these objectives, we addressed the following  questions: (1) What is the estimated net benefit, if any, to the government  of replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin? (2) What other effects did  stakeholders suggest such a replacement could have?", "To estimate the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 note with  a $1 coin, we constructed an economic model with data from the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Bureau of  Engraving and Printing (BEP), and the United States Mint (Mint). We  analyzed past GAO and Federal Reserve reports that previously estimated  the net benefit to the government of such a replacement. We interviewed  officials from two bureaus of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury)\u2014 BEP and the Mint\u2014the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s U.S. Secret Service to develop the structure, inputs, and  assumptions for the model. In addition, we interviewed government  officials in Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) to obtain information  about their experiences replacing notes with coins and used this  information to develop some of the model assumptions. To determine the  effects such a replacement could have, we identified industries and  organizations that might be affected by changes to currency. We  interviewed private entities involved in the production of materials for and  processing of notes and coins; 15 associations and companies that  represent five major industries that often deal in cash\u2014banking and  financial institutions; grocery and convenience stores; and vending,  transit, and retail businesses. We conducted this performance audit from  June 2010 to March 2011 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  Appendix I contains more detailed information on our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To promote efficient commercial exchange and economic growth, national  governments and central banks issue money, including paper notes and  coins in various denominations. The federal government experiences a  financial gain when it issues notes or coins because both forms of  currency usually cost less to produce than their face values. As long as  there is a public demand, when the government puts coins into circulation,  it creates a value known as \u201cseigniorage.\u201d Seigniorage is traditionally  defined as the difference between the face value of coins and their cost of  production. In addition, the face value of notes issued, net of their  production costs, creates an analogous net value for the federal  government. In this report, we use the term \u201cseigniorage\u201d to refer to the  value created from the issuance of both coins and notes. Seigniorage  reduces the government\u2019s need to raise other revenues, thus reducing the  amount of money that the government needs to borrow. When the  government has to borrow less, it pays less in interest over time. Although  the interest avoided is a benefit to the government, the public effectively  finances this benefit by choosing to hold more cash on which it does not  earn interest.", "Two Treasury bureaus, BEP and the Mint, produce notes and coins,  respectively, and the Federal Reserve places them in circulation through  banks in response to public demand. Under current law, the Federal  Reserve determines the amount of $1 notes necessary for commerce. For  the circulation of $1 coins, the Secretary of the Treasury decides what is  necessary to meet the needs of the United States. In practice, according  to officials from the Mint and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve  makes this determination by producing a short-term forecast of demand  for notes and coins. Based on this forecast, the Federal Reserve orders  notes from BEP and the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks order coins  from the Mint. The Federal Reserve circulates the notes through the  Federal Reserve banks and the Mint distributes coins directly to those  banks. The Federal Reserve banks distribute notes and coins to  commercial banks to meet the demand of retailers and the public. When  notes and coins are returned by commercial banks as deposits to the  Federal Reserve banks, each note is processed to determine its quality and  authenticity. During processing, worn and counterfeit notes are removed  from circulation and the rest are wrapped for storage or re-circulation.  While the Federal Reserve re-circulates coins received from banks, it does  not have a comparable program to test the authenticity or fitness of coins.  The Federal Reserve contracts with private entities such as armored  carriers to count, sort, and transport notes and coins for circulation or  storage. Figure 1 shows the production and circulation of notes and coins.", "Currently, there are five different $1 coin designs in circulation\u2014the  Eisenhower coin, the Susan B. Anthony coin, the Sacagawea coin, the  Presidential $1 coin series, and the Native American $1 coin series. Table  1 shows production figures for the four $1 coin designs produced since  1979.", "The four recent $1 coin designs are the same size and weight and have the  same electromagnetic properties. The Susan B. Anthony $1 coin is silver in  color, while the Sacagawea, Presidential, and Native American $1 coins  are golden in color. The golden color was introduced in 2000 so that the  public could better distinguish the $1 coins from the quarter, which the  Susan B. Anthony $1 coin resembles and with which it is often confused.", "The number of $1 coins shipped from the Mint to Federal Reserve banks  peaked at over 1 billion in 2000, when the Sacagawea coin was first  minted, and immediately declined to about 100 million coins in 2001. The  number of $1 coins shipped averaged less than 50 million annually from  2002 through 2006, until the Presidential coin series was initiated in 2007.  (See fig. 2.) About 1.1 billion $1 coins are held in storage by the Federal  Reserve banks because, according to senior Federal Reserve officials, of  the limited public demand.", "In recent years, Congress sought to increase the circulation of the $1 coin,  but circulation has remained limited. To remove barriers to circulation,  the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005, among other things (1) mandated the  use of $1 coins by federal agencies, the United States Postal Service, all  transit agencies receiving federal funds, and all entities operating  businesses, including vending machines, on U.S. government premises; (2)  required the Mint to promote $1 coins to the public; and (3) required the  Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, to  review the co-circulation of the different $1 coin designs and make  recommendations to Congress on improving the circulation of $1 coins.  Even with efforts taken to implement the legislation, the Federal Reserve  banks had an inventory of about 1.1 billion $1 coins as of December 2010,  which is sufficient inventory to cover the current level of public demand  for the coin for over 13 years.", "Other countries have introduced coins of similar value into circulation by  replacing the corresponding notes, eventually leaving the public with no  alternative to the coin of that value. Among the rationales for replacing  notes with coins cited by foreign government officials and experts are the  cost savings to governments derived from lower production costs and the  decline over time of the purchasing power of currency due to inflation. In  1985, for example, the Canadian House of Commons estimated that the  conversion to a $1 coin would save the government $175 million  (Canadian) in total over 20 years because it would no longer have to  regularly replace worn out $1 notes. Canadian officials later determined  that the Canadian government saved $450 million (Canadian) between  1987 and 1991.", "Over the last 47 years, Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands,  New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, and the UK, among others, have  replaced lower-denomination notes with coins. Most of these  replacements occurred in the 1980s. (Table 2 indicates when selected  countries replaced notes with coins.)", "In past work we reported that the annual net benefit to the government of  replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would be about $318 million (1990),  $395 million (1993), $456 million (1995), and $522 million (2000). Based  on the experiences of other countries and the potential financial net  benefit to the government, we have twice recommended that Congress  provide for the elimination of the $1 note to ensure the success of $1 coin  initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Replacing the $1 Note with a $1 Coin Could Save the Government Approximately $5.5 Billion in Interest Expense over 30 Years", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Replacing $1 Notes with $1 Coins Would Increase the Net Benefit to the Government over 30 Years", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would provide a net  benefit to the government of approximately $5.5 billion over 30 years,  amounting to an average yearly discounted net benefit of about $184  million. However, this benefit would not be achieved evenly over the 30  years. In fact, as shown in figure 3, the federal government would incur a  net loss during the first 4 years. Yearly net benefits begin to accrue in the  fifth year of our analysis, and in the tenth year (2020), the initial start-up  costs are paid back and overall net benefits begin to accrue. The early net  loss represents the up-front cost of producing a large number of coins  during the transition from notes to coins, together with the limited interest  expense the government would avoid in the first few years after  replacement began. While the estimated benefits in earlier GAO analyses  were due to both seigniorage and reduced costs of coins (as compared to  notes) over 30 years, our current net benefit estimate is solely due to  seigniorage. In fact, the cost of producing coins for a full replacement is  never fully recovered during the 30-year analysis, likely due to the longer  note life and relatively higher cost of coin production today than was the  case when our earlier studies were conducted. Moreover, our estimate,  like all estimates, is uncertain, particularly in the later years, and thus the  benefits could be greater or smaller than estimated. As a result, we have  considered several alternative scenarios that are discussed later in this  report and in appendix II.", "To arrive at our estimate, we developed a model to examine the effects of  replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin. We assumed that the replacement  would be implemented starting in 2011, and during that year the Mint  would invest in new equipment to increase its production capability for $1  coins. We also assumed that it would take 4 years for the Mint to produce  enough coins to replace the currently outstanding dollar notes, and that  during the transition, production of the paper note would stop. Our model  assumptions cover a range of factors including the replacement ratio of  coins to notes, the expected rate of growth in the demand for currency  over 30 years, the costs of producing and processing both coins and notes,  and the differential life span of coins and notes. The cessation of  production of $1 notes in our analysis might suggest a possible shortage of  dollar currency during the transition. However, because of the existing $1  coins that the Federal Reserve banks hold and the rapid ramp up of  production during the first 2 years of the transition, the outstanding dollar  currency\u2014both notes and coins\u2014during the years of the transition equals  or exceeds the demand we estimate for each of those years.", "The assumption that contributed the most to the net benefit we estimated  was the replacement ratio of coins to notes. Following the example of  other countries that have replaced a note with a coin of equal value, we  assumed that, because of differences in how people use these two forms  of money, the public would need more than one coin for each note that  had been in circulation. It is common for people to take coins out of their  pockets and store them at the end of each day rather than retain them in  their wallets as they do notes, for use the next day. These factors cause  coins to circulate with less frequency than notes. Thus, for any given  denomination of currency, a larger number of coins would need to be  maintained in circulation to meet the public\u2019s demand for cash than would  be needed if that denomination were provided in notes.", "We previously reported that when Canada replaced its $1 note and the UK  replaced its \u00a31 note with a coin, both countries used a 1.6-to-1 replacement  ratio. However, in both cases, once the transition was complete, coin  production was very low or even nil in some years. Therefore, we  determined that a 1.5-to-1 replacement rate would be appropriate for our  analysis\u2014low enough to avoid an excess of $1 coins without creating an  undue risk of producing too few. Our analysis thus assumes that the  number of $1 coins issued is 50 percent greater than the number of $1  notes that were in circulation. This assumption of increased production  results in substantially increased seigniorage and accounts for our  estimate of a net benefit to the government over the 30-year period of the  analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Current Estimate of the Yearly Net Benefit of Replacing the $1 Note with a $1 Coin Is Lower than Previous Estimates for a Variety of Reasons", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, we estimated that the yearly net benefit to the government of  replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin would be roughly $522 million per  year, after the replacement was complete. Our current estimate of an  average yearly discounted net benefit to the government of about $184  million is lower than our previous estimate because of differences in the  structure of our analysis and in our assumptions about the replacement  ratio of coins to notes and the lifespan of the note.", "Structure of the analysis. Our 2000 analysis estimated an annual level of  net benefit to the government assuming that the transition to coins had  already been completed. Hence, that analysis did not fully address the  initial production costs of replacing all outstanding notes with coins. For  the current analysis, we determined that the Mint would need to make  various investments to produce substantially more new coins in relatively  few years. We therefore assumed that the minting and distribution of new  coins would substantially increase during a 4-year transition period and  the production of $1 notes would cease.  We included these increased coin  production costs in the 30-year analysis.", "Lower replacement ratio. For our 2000 model, we assumed that, to meet  society\u2019s needs, two $1 coins would be needed to replace each $1 note that  had been in circulation. We arrived at that 2-to-1 replacement ratio based  on the experience of other countries that had replaced their lowest- denomination note with a coin of the same denomination. Some of these  countries used replacement ratios as high as 4 to 1. As we noted above,  however, based on the experience of Canada and the UK, in our current  model we used a replacement ratio of 1.5 to 1 because a higher ratio did  not appear to be needed. Because a lower replacement ratio entails a  reduced level of seigniorage, the net benefit to the government of  switching to a $1 coin is lower in our current analysis than in our 2000  analysis. To examine the extent to which this assumption lowered our  estimate, we ran our current model using the same 2-to-1 replacement  ratio that we used in 2000 but maintained all other elements of our current  model unchanged. This higher replacement ratio had the most impact on  the estimated net benefit of the various sensitivity analyses we conducted.  The average yearly discounted net benefit to the government would have  been about $297 million, and the total net benefit over 30 years would have  been about $8.9 billion if this higher replacement ratio had been used.", "The expanded lifespan of the note. Ten years ago, a $1 note lasted  about 1.5 years on average. Because of improvements in the processing of  paper notes, the life of the $1 note has grown considerably\u2014to as high as  40 months on average, according to a BEP analysis. This longer note life  reduces the differential between the lives of the note and the coin, which  is expected to have an average life of at least 30 years, according to senior  Federal Reserve officials. To ascertain the extent to which the current  longer life of a paper note led to a lower estimated net benefit to the  government in our current analysis, we ran our model using the same 1.5- year average note life we used in the 2000 model, but retained all other  elements of our current model. We found that if we had used the shorter  note life in our current analysis, we would have estimated that the  discounted net benefit to the government of a replacement would have  been about $7.7 billion over the entire 30 years and the average yearly  discounted net benefit would have been just over $256 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Current Estimate Would Vary with Changes in Other Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["Besides analyzing how differences in assumptions from our 2000 report  affected our current estimate (our base case analysis) we analyzed  alternative scenarios using the same model as we did for our base case  analysis but altered certain assumptions. We compared our base case  analysis to two alternative scenarios that relate to possible changes in how  society uses money. In the first case, we assumed that the growing use of  electronic payment mechanisms would erode society\u2019s use of cash over  the period of our analysis. In the second case, we assumed that, rather  than transferring all demand for the $1 note to the $1 coin, the public  would prefer, and therefore demand, increased circulation of the $2 note  as production of the $1 note ceased.", "Reduced growth in demand for cash. In our base case, we assumed that  the demand for cash would continue to grow with the growth in economic  activity, as it has over many years. Even in the last several years, as the use  of electronic means of payment has grown substantially, according to the  Federal Reserve, the demand for cash has continued to grow with the  gross domestic product. However, further changes in the way Americans  pay for goods at retail could lead to greater reliance on electronic payment  methods. For example, some U.S. companies are planning to develop ways  to make payments with a cell phone, a method that is already in use in  some countries. If Americans come to rely more heavily on electronic  payments, the demand for cash could grow more slowly in the future than  we assume in our base case. For example, one possibility is that if the  government replaces the $1 note with a $1 coin, electronic payments may  increase as the public chooses to avoid the $1 coin. In this scenario, we  assumed that the public would respond to the replacement of $1 notes  with $1 coins by increasing its use of electronic payments, thereby  reducing its demand for $1 currency by 20 percent. In this scenario, we  found that the net benefit to the government would be nearly $4.5 billion  over 30 years and the average annual discounted net benefit would be  nearly $149 million.", "Replacement-induced demand for the $2 note. If the $1 coin replaced  the $1 note, the use of the $2 note could increase because people and  businesses might limit how many coins they kept in their pockets and cash  trays, and using the $2 note would help them do this. In Canada, demand  for the $2 bill did increase when the $1 note was replaced with the $1 coin.  However, Canada already had a readily circulating $2 note at the time,  whereas the United States does not; therefore, we did not assume an  increase in demand for the $2 note in our base case. In an alternative  scenario, we assumed that 25 percent of the demand for cash that had  been met with $1 notes would transfer to $2 notes and the remainder to $1  coins. Thus, the government would increase its production of $2 notes  accordingly. This scenario reduced the net benefit of the replacement  because fewer new coins were produced and less seigniorage was  generated. We found that the discounted net benefit to the government of  replacement in this scenario would be slightly lower than our base case\u2014 about $5 billion over 30 years, for an average annual discounted net  benefit of about $168 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Model\u2019s Method of Estimating Net Benefit Differs from the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s Method of Estimating How a Replacement Would Affect the Federal Budget", "paragraphs": ["Our estimate of the discounted net benefit to the government of replacing  the $1 note with a $1 coin differs from the method that the Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) would use to calculate the impact on the budget of  the same replacement. In the mid-1990s, CBO made such an estimate and  noted that its findings for government savings were lower than our  estimates at that time because of key differences in the two analyses. Most  important, budget scorekeeping conventions do not factor in gains in  seigniorage in calculating budget deficits. Thus, the interest expense  avoided in future years by reducing borrowing needs, which accounts for  our estimate of net benefit to the government, would not be part of a CBO  budget scoring analysis.

Moreover,  counterfeit $1 notes accounted for less than 1 percent of all counterfeit  U.S. notes detected in fiscal year 2009 (about 24,000 out of about 3  million). Nevertheless, senior officials at the Federal Reserve and Mint told  us the increased circulation of $1 coins could increase the risk of  counterfeiting, and senior Secret Service officials told us that  counterfeiting of coins is an ongoing problem in the UK.

Canada created its validation program when it introduced its  $1 coin, while the UK created its program in response to a sharp increase  in the counterfeiting of \u00a31 coins. According to Canadian officials, the  validation program was introduced to enable better management of  Canada\u2019s coin inventories. The program provides information on the  number of coins in circulation and allows for removing unfit coins from  circulation, as well as for detecting counterfeit coins. The Federal Reserve  banks circulate coins they receive from commercial banks, but do not  have a comparable validation program. Coin processing companies run the  coins through counting machines that, according to a processing company  we interviewed, verify the denomination and genuineness of each coin.

In addition, 64 percent  of the respondents to that survey were opposed to eliminating the $1 note.  However, when respondents were told that such a replacement would  save the government about half a billion dollars a year (our 2000 estimate),  the proportion who said they opposed elimination of the note dropped to  37 percent. Two more recent national survey results suggest that  opposition to eliminating the $1 note persists. For example, according to a  Gallup poll conducted in 2006, 79 percent of respondents were opposed to  replacing $1 notes with $1 coins, and their opposition decreased only  slightly, to 64 percent, when they were asked to assume that a replacement  would result in half a billion dollars in government savings each year.", "Efforts by the Mint to increase public acceptance and use of the $1 coin as  it co-circulates with the $1 note have shown moderate success. To  increase public acceptance and circulation of the $1 coin, the Presidential  $1 Coin Act of 2005 requires the Mint to promote $1 coins to the public.  In response to the legislation, in 2008, the Mint conducted a pilot program  in Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and  Charlotte, North Carolina, to increase public acceptance of the $1 coin.  Enlisting the support of national and local retailers, the Mint carried out  advertising and public relations campaigns in which it promoted the $1  coin as recyclable, lasting for decades, and saving the nation money. As  figure 4 shows, data collected as part of the pilot program show modest  increases in the public\u2019s use of $1 coins in three of the four target markets  as measured in public opinion surveys. Pilot program data also show that  nationwide usage of the $1 coin declined during the period that the pilot  study was conducted.", "In past reports, we have noted that Congress and the executive branch  would have to lead rather than follow public opinion for a transition from  the $1 note to the $1 coin to succeed. Furthermore, we have noted in  those reports that past $1 coin initiatives\u2014such as changes to the color of  the $1 coin and new coin designs\u2014have not led to widespread public  acceptance and use, in part because the $1 note was not simultaneously  eliminated.

Some of the transitional  costs and challenges may be more formidable than others. For example,  increasing storage and transport capacity could entail additional  investment, while modifying cash register drawers may involve primarily  retooling the drawers.", "Ten of the 15 stakeholders we spoke with also identified three areas in  which the replacement of $1 notes with $1 coins might entail longer-term  or ongoing costs: transportation, processing, and labor. For example, since  coins are heavier than notes, 7 of 15 stakeholders said that their costs  would likely increase because of higher transportation costs incurred by  armored carriers from making additional trips or using more fuel with the  heavier cargo. Moreover, two stakeholders noted that making additional  trips to transport coins could increase security risks for staff. In addition,  replacing the $1 note with a $1 coin might increase the number and types  of personnel needed to physically handle coins and process them. Some  stakeholders anticipated that any additional costs associated with $1 coins  would be passed on to customers.", "In contrast to the stakeholders who, as noted above, said that a  replacement would mean higher short- and long-term costs for their  businesses, two stakeholders we interviewed said that it might have only a  minimal impact, particularly if the metal content of the $1 coin remained  the same. According to officials from the National Automatic  Merchandising Association, an organization representing the food and  refreshment vending industry, many of its members have already modified  their vending machines to accept all forms of payment, including coins,  notes, and electronic transactions. Further, according to an association  official, increased use of the $1 coin could be beneficial for the vending  industry because it may reduce rejected sales due to old or damaged  notes. He further noted that while the acceptance rate of notes has  improved dramatically in vending, wider use of a $1 coin could improve  consumer satisfaction. In addition, since transit agencies that receive  federal funds were required under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 to  accept and distribute $1 coins, many of the larger transit agencies have  already modified their equipment to accept these coins, according to  industry officials. For example, industry officials stated that New York  City\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates buses,  subways, commuter trains, bridges, and tunnels in New York City and the  surrounding area, is the largest user of $1 coins, with over 1,200 ticket  vending machines that accept or dispense them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observation", "paragraphs": ["As in the past, our analysis indicates that replacing the $1 note with a $1  coin would provide a financial benefit to the government if production of  the $1 note ceased.

However, we believe that seignorage cannot be set aside  since it is a result of issuing currency. The Federal Reserve also noted that  the discounted net cost or benefit resulting from such a replacement  would be influenced by assumptions about the length and cost of the  initial transition and suggested that the report include sensitivity analyses  that varied these assumptions. We included analyses that varied a number  of assumptions and showed how our estimate would change.

Based on  our document reviews and these interviews, we determined that the data  used as inputs to our model for the production of notes and coins were  sufficiently reliable for our analysis. We also interviewed officials from  Canada and the United Kingdom (UK), both of which have replaced notes  with coins, to gain information useful in determining certain key  assumptions in our model. These included officials from the Bank of  Canada, the Canadian Department of Finance, the Royal Canadian Mint,  and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s National Anti-Counterfeiting  Bureau, as well as officials from the Royal Bank of England, the Royal  Mint, and the Serious Organized Crime Agency. In addition, we  interviewed four experts at federal agencies or academic institutions to  obtain their views on our economic model. More detailed information on  the structure, assumptions, and inputs of the economic model are found in  appendix II.", "To determine the various effects replacement could have on stakeholders,  we identified industries and organizations that might be affected by  changes to notes and coins.  Through a literature review and interviews  with agency officials, we identified private companies involved in the  production of materials for $1 notes and $1 coins. Because these entities  would be affected by any increase or decrease in production, we  interviewed the entities that produce the paper and ink for the $1 note  (Crane Paper and SICPA Securink Corporation) and process metal for  coins (Olin Brass and PMX Industries). Furthermore, through a review of  literature and congressional testimonies, as well as interviews with agency  officials, experts, and Canadian government officials, we identified other  industries and interest groups that are intensive users of currency and  might be affected by the replacement of the $1 note with the $1 coin.  These entities included banks and financial institutions; grocery stores;  convenience stores; fast food establishments; vending machine companies,  including those that make the note and coin acceptors used in vending  machines; armored carriers that process and transport currency; transit  agencies; retailers, including companies that make cash register drawers;  coin laundry establishments; and consumer and public advocacy groups.  To ensure broad representation among these groups, we interviewed  officials from the following organizations:    American Public Transit Association,    National Association of Convenience Stores,    National Armored Car Association,    National Automatic Merchandising Association,    National Cash Register Company,    National Federation of the Blind,    $1 Coin Coalition.", "Finally, to better understand the production, processing, and circulation of  currency, we visited the BEP production facility in Washington, D.C.; the  Mint production facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and an armored  carrier note and coin processing facility in Baltimore, Maryland.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The  difference between the net benefits under these two scenarios is the net  benefit to the government.", "For the status quo, we assume that notes remain the dominant form of  currency at the $1 denomination.

Anthony $1 coin in  1979 are stored with the Federal Reserve. We do not count these coins as  contributing toward the net benefit to the government because these coins  are not being held by the public, and therefore, governmentwide, there has  not been a financial gain.", "We assume that the remaining 3 billion $1 coins are held by the public. We  also assume that some of these remaining $1 coins are lost or not in active  circulation.", "Based on current projections, which incorporate the legislative  requirements for producing Presidential and Native American $1 coins, we  assume that the Mint will continue to manufacture more coins than the  public demands until it completes its production of Presidential $1 coins,  currently scheduled through part of 2016. In our baseline scenario we  assume that production of the $1 coin essentially ceases after 2016. BEP  officials commented that it is unrealistic to assume the Mint will cease $1  coin production after 2016. However, we have no basis on which to make  an assumption about the level of $1 coin production after the completion  of the Presidential series. As such, we assume that coins stop being  produced after the series is complete. The small level of demand for $1  coins will be able to be satisfied by coins on hand at Federal Reserve  banks for many years after that time.", "For our replacement scenario, we assume a 4-year transition period during  which  the production of $1 notes stops immediately;   no $1 notes are withdrawn from circulation, but due to their short life,  they would naturally fall out of circulation within a few years; the 1 billion coins currently stored with the Federal Reserve are released  into circulation in the first year;   1 billion $1 coins that were inactive and held by the public enter active  circulation in the first year; and the Mint expands its production of $1 coins during the first 4 years.", "During the transition period, we assume the Mint\u2019s coin production and  the government\u2019s associated costs both increase.", "In the first year, the Mint not only increases its production to its current  maximum capacity, but also modifies other coin production lines to  produce more $1 coins.", "By the second year, the Mint is able to produce at a new maximum  capacity and does so throughout the 4-year transition period until it has  produced enough $1 coins to replace all $1 notes in circulation.", "These efforts by the Mint to expand its production of $1 coins increase its  costs during the transition period.", "In addition, we assume that the government incurs costs to publicize the  shift from $1 notes to $1 coins and that the variable costs of producing  higher-denomination notes increase after the BEP loses some degree of  economies of scale that it currently derives from producing $1 notes. For  example, if BEP is unable to purchase certain supplies such as ink and  paper in quantities as large as it does now, it may cause the vendors to  raise their prices.", "After the 4-year transition period, we assume that the Mint reduces its  production of $1 coins to an amount sufficient to offset attrition and meet  the growth in demand for currency.

We also interviewed  relevant officials from international governments and outside experts. All  assumptions used in the model are projections of future conditions,  hypothetical actions, or both. Therefore, some uncertainty is inevitable,  particularly for elements of the assumptions that occur farther in the  future. Moreover, some assumptions reflect our analysis of data.

This average masks significant variation over the 30- year period of our analysis. In the first few years, a replacement would  cause a net loss because the cost of producing so many coins would be  large. This early net loss represents the up-front cost of producing a large  number of coins during the transition from notes to coins together with  the limited interest expense the government would avoid in the first few  years after replacement began. While the estimated benefits in earlier GAO  analyses were due to both seigniorage and reduced costs of coins (as  compared to notes) over 30 years, our current net benefit estimate is  solely due to seigniorage.  In fact, the cost of producing coins for a full  replacement is never fully recovered during the 30-year analysis, likely due  to the longer note life and relatively higher cost of coin production today  than was the case when our earlier studies were conducted. Moreover, our  estimate, like all estimates, is uncertain, particularly in the later years, and  thus the benefits could be greater or smaller than estimated.
