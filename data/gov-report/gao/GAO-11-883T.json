In 2007, GAO made five recommendations to address challenges in ensuring the effectiveness of federal agencies' actions to protect energy tankers and implement response plans. The Coast Guard and the FBI have implemented two recommendations, specifically: (1) the Coast Guard, in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, developed protocols for facilitating the recovery and resumption of trade following a disruption to the maritime transportation system, and (2) the Coast Guard and the FBI participated in local port exercises that executed multiple response plans simultaneously. The Coast Guard has made progress on a third recommendation through work on a national strategy for the security of certain dangerous cargoes. It also plans to develop a resource allocation plan, starting in April 2012, which may help address the need to balance security responsibilities. However, the Coast Guard and the FBI have not yet taken action on a fourth recommendation to develop an operational plan to integrate the national spill and terrorism response plans. According to DHS, it plans to revise the National Response Framework, but no decision has been made regarding whether the separate response plans will be integrated. Also, DHS has not yet taken action on the final recommendation to develop explicit performance measures for emergency response capabilities and use them in risk-based analyses to set priorities for acquiring needed response resources. According to DHS, it is revising its emergency response grant programs, but does not have specific plans to develop performance measures as part of this effort. The Coast Guard has taken actions to assess the security risks to offshore energy infrastructure, which includes Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities (facilities that are involved in producing oil or natural gas) and deepwater ports (facilities used to transfer oil and natural gas from tankers to shore), but improvements are needed. The Coast Guard has used its Maritime Security Risk Analysis Model (MSRAM) to examine the security risks to OCS facilities and deepwater ports. To do so, the Coast Guard has coordinated with the intelligence community and stakeholders, such as the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. However, the Coast Guard faces complex and technical challenges in assessing risks. For example, the Coast Guard does not have data on the ability of an OCS facility to withstand an attack. The Coast Guard generally recognizes these challenges and has actions underway to study or address them. Further, GAO determined that as of May 2011, the Coast Guard had not assessed security risks for 12 of the 50 security-regulated OCS facilities that are to be subjected to such assessments. Coast Guard officials later determined that they needed to add these OCS facilities to MSRAM for assessment and have completed the required assessments. However, while the list of security-regulated facilities may change each year based on factors such as production volume, the Coast Guard's current policies and procedures do not call for Coast Guard officials to provide an annual updated list of regulated OCS facilities to MSRAM analysts. Given the continuing threat to such offshore facilities, revising its procedures could help ensure that the Coast Guard carries out its risk assessment requirements for security-regulated OCS facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that the Coast Guard revise policies and procedures to ensure its analysts receive the annual updated list of regulated offshore energy facilities to ensure risk assessments are conducted on those facilities.

The response to the incident encountered  numerous challenges, and by the time the well was sealed nearly 3  months later, over 4 million barrels of oil had spilled into the Gulf.

To  provide additional information on threats to energy tankers, we also  reviewed our recent work on piracy. More detailed information on the  scope and methodology used for our past reviews appears in those  reports.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed officials in Coast Guard  headquarters and field offices in New Orleans, Louisiana and Boston,  Massachusetts because these officials were knowledgeable about how  the Coast Guard uses the Maritime Security Risk Analysis Model  (MSRAM)\u2014a tool that the Coast Guard uses to assess the security risks  to vessels and offshore energy infrastructure. Moreover, the New  Orleans and Boston field offices are the only offices presently conducting  assessments of offshore energy infrastructure. We also reviewed Coast  Guard documents on MSRAM, such as Coast Guard guidance to its field  units and the MSRAM training manual. In addition, we reviewed relevant  laws and regulations, policies and procedures, and other documents  related to security risk assessments. For example, we reviewed the DHS  Quadrennial Review, the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, and a  National Research Council report on risk assessments at DHS. We also  reviewed our prior report on risk assessment efforts carried out by the  Coast Guard. In addition, we compared the Coast Guard\u2019s policies and  procedures regarding security actions with criteria in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. Further, we interviewed  representatives from two companies that together operate 18 of the 50  Outer Continental Shelf facilities, a type of offshore energy infrastructure,  regulated for security in 2011. While the information obtained from these  interviews is not generalizable to the offshore energy industry as a whole,  it provided insights into owners\u2019 and operators\u2019 concerns regarding  security and actions they have taken to address such concerns.

The FBI shares responsibility with the  Coast Guard for preventing and responding to terrorist incidents in the  maritime environment, including incidents involving energy tankers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risks to Energy Tankers", "paragraphs": ["Energy tankers face risks from various types of attack. We identified three  primary types of attack methods against energy tankers in our 2007  report, including suicide attacks, armed assaults by terrorists or armed  bands, and launching a \u201cstandoff\u201d missile attack using a rocket or some  other weapon fired from a distance. In recent years, we have issued  reports that discussed risks energy tankers face from terrorist attacks and  attacks from other criminals, such as pirates. Terrorists have attempted\u2014 and in some cases carried out\u2014attacks on energy tankers since  September 11, 2001. To date, these attacks have included attempts to  damage tankers or their related infrastructure at overseas ports. For  example, in 2002, terrorists conducted a suicide boat attack against the  French supertanker Limburg off the coast of Yemen, and in 2010, an  incident involving another supertanker, the M/V M. Star, in the Strait of  Hormuz is suspected to have been a terrorist attack. Our work on energy  tankers identified three main places in which tankers may be at risk of an  attack: (1) at foreign ports; (2) in transit, especially at narrow channels, or  chokepoints; and (3) at U.S. ports. For example, foreign ports, where  commodities are loaded onto tankers, may vary in their levels of security,  and the Coast Guard is limited in the degree to which it can bring about  improvements abroad when security is substandard, in part because its  activities are limited by conditions set by host nations. In addition, while  tankers are in transit, they face risks because they travel on direct routes  that are known in advance and, for part of their journey, they may have to  travel through waters that do not allow them to maneuver away from  possible attacks. According to the Energy Information Administration,  chokepoints along a route make tankers susceptible to attacks. Further,  tankers remain at risk upon arrival in the United States because of the  inherent risks to port facilities. For example, port facilities are generally  accessible by land and sea and are sprawling installations often close to  population centers.", "Beyond the relatively rare threat of terrorist attacks against tankers, the  threat of piracy has become relatively common. In particular, piracy  threatens tankers transiting one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes near  key energy corridors and the route through the Suez Canal. The vast  areas at risk for piracy off the Horn of Africa, combined with the small  number of military ships available for patrolling them, make protecting  energy tankers difficult. According to the International Maritime Bureau,  30 percent (490 of 1,650) of vessels reporting pirate attacks worldwide  from 2006 through 2010 were identified as tankers. See table 1 for a  summary of tankers attacked by pirates during 2006 through 2010.", "As shown in the table, pirate attacks against tankers have tripled in the  last 5 years, and the incidence of piracy against tankers continues to rise.  From January through June 2011, 100 tankers were attacked, an  increase of 37 percent compared to tankers attacked from January  through June 2010. Figure 1 shows one of the recent suspected pirate  attacks. In addition, tankers are fetching increasing ransom demands  from Somali pirates. Media reports indicate a steady increase in ransoms  for tankers, from $3 million in January 2009 for the Saudi tanker Sirius  Star, to $9.5 million in November 2010 for the South Korean tanker  Samho Dream, to $12 million in June 2011 for the Kuwaiti tanker MV  Zirku. The U.S. Maritime Administration and the Coast Guard have issued  guidance for commercial vessels to stay 200 miles away from the Somali  coast. However, pirates have adapted and increased their capability to  attack and hijack vessels to more than 1,000 miles from Somalia using  mother ships, from which they launch smaller boats to conduct the  attacks. To address the growing concern over piracy, the Coast Guard  has issued a directive with guidelines for U.S. vessels operating in high- risk waters. This directive provides vessel owners and operators with  direction for responding to emerging security risks.", "Offshore energy infrastructure also faces risks from various types of  attacks. For example, in 2004, a terrorist attacked an offshore oil terminal  in Iraq using speedboats packed with explosives, killing two U.S. Navy  sailors and a U.S. Coast Guardsman. Potential attack methods against  offshore energy infrastructure identified by the Coast Guard or owners  and operators include crashing an aircraft into it; using a submarine  vessel, diver, or other means of attacking it underwater; ramming it with a  vessel; and sabotage by an employee. Offshore energy infrastructure  may face security risks because this infrastructure is located in open  waters and generally many miles away from Coast Guard assets and  personnel.", "In addition to our work on energy tankers, we have recently completed  work involving Coast Guard efforts to assess security risks and ensure  the security of offshore energy infrastructure. Specifically, our work  focused on two main types of offshore energy infrastructure that the  Coast Guard oversees for security. The first type are facilities that operate  on the OCS and are generally described as facilities temporarily or  permanently attached to the subsoil or seabed of the OCS that engage in  exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or mineral  resources. As of September 2010, there were about 3,900 such  facilities, and if a facility of this type meets or exceeds any one of three  thresholds for production or personnel, it is subject to 33 C.F.R. part 106  security requirements. In this testimony, we focus on the 50 facilities  that, in 2011, are regulated for security because they meet or exceed the  threshold criteria. We refer to these security-regulated facilities as OCS  facilities. The second type of offshore energy infrastructure are deepwater  ports, which are fixed or floating manmade structures used or intended for  use as a port or terminal for the transportation, storage, or handling of oil  or natural gas to any state and includes the transportation of oil or natural  gas from the United States\u2019 OCS. There are currently four licensed  deepwater ports\u2014two in the Gulf of Mexico and two in Massachusetts  Bay. Unlike OCS facilities, which are involved in the production of oil or  natural gas, deepwater ports enable tankers to offload oil or liquefied  natural gas for transport to land by underwater pipelines."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress Made Addressing Our Recommendations, but Additional Actions Could Help Improve Tanker Security", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, we assessed Coast Guard and FBI efforts to ensure the security  of energy tankers and respond to terrorist incidents involving energy  tankers. We found that actions were being taken, internationally and  domestically, to protect tankers and port facilities at which tankers would  be present. For example, the Coast Guard visits foreign exporting ports to  assess the effectiveness of the anti-terrorism measures in place.  Additionally, port stakeholders in the United States have taken steps to  address vulnerabilities at domestic ports. For example, the Houston Ship  Channel Security District is a public-private partnership that was  established to increase preparedness and response capabilities with the  goal of improving security and safety for facilities, employees, and  communities surrounding the Houston Ship Channel. The security district  has installed technology, such as night vision and motion-activated  detection equipment, and conducts patrols on land and in the water.  However, we also reported on challenges that remained in (1) making  federal agencies\u2019 protective actions more effective and (2) implementing  plans for a response to an attack, if a terrorist attack were to succeed  despite the protective measures in place.", "We made five recommendations in our 2007 report, three of which were  directed to the Secretary of Homeland Security and two of which were  directed jointly to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney  General.

Further, the FBI has not  taken independent action to implement this recommendation, in part  because it did not concur with the need to develop a separate operational  plan. In the event of a successful attack on an energy tanker, ports would  need to provide an effective, integrated response to (1) protect public  safety and the environment, (2) conduct an investigation, and (3) restore  shipping operations in a timely manner. Consequently, clearly defined  and understood roles and responsibilities for all essential stakeholders  are needed to ensure an effective response, and operational plans for the  response should be explicitly linked. Regarding our recommendation that  DHS develop performance measures for emergency response  capabilities, DHS has begun to revise its grant programs, but it is too  early in that process to determine whether and how performance  measures will be incorporated into those revisions. Performance  measures would allow DHS to set priorities for funding on the basis of  reducing overall risk, thereby helping ports obtain resources necessary to  respond.

Coast Guard units throughout the country use  this tool to assess security risks to about 28,000 key infrastructure in and  around the nation\u2019s ports and waterways. For example, MSRAM  examines security risks to national monuments, bridges, and oil and gas  terminals.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to assess security risks to OCS facilities and  deepwater ports are part of a broader effort by DHS to protect critical  infrastructure and key resources. To further guide this effort, in 2009  DHS issued an updated version of the 2006 National Infrastructure  Protection Plan which describes the department\u2019s strategic approach to  infrastructure protection. The plan placed an increased emphasis on  risk management and it centered attention on going beyond assessments  of individual assets by extending the scope of risk assessments to  systems or networks.

The Coast Guard has used  MSRAM to, among other things, examine security risks to OCS facilities  and deepwater ports by assessing three main factors\u2014threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences. First, Coast Guard analysts use  MSRAM to assess security risks against such energy infrastructure by  examining potential scenarios terrorists may use to attack OCS facilities  or deepwater ports. For example, MSRAM assesses attack scenarios,  such as an attack by a hijacked vessel, a small boat attack, sabotage, or  an attack by a swimmer or diver. Second, the analysts use MSRAM to  evaluate vulnerabilities of OCS facilities and deepwater ports by  examining the probability of a successful attack by assessing factors such  as the ability of key stakeholders, including the owner, operator, or law  enforcement, to interdict an attack and the ability of a target to withstand  an attack. Third, the analysts use MSRAM to evaluate potential  consequences of an attack, such as deaths or injuries and economic and  environmental impacts. MSRAM\u2019s output produces a risk index number  for each maritime target\u2014such as an OCS facility or deepwater port\u2014that  allows Coast Guard officials at the local, regional, and national levels to  compare and rank critical infrastructure for the purpose of informing  security decisions. According to Coast Guard officials, based on  MSRAM\u2019s output, which is a relative risk ranking, OCS facilities are not  considered to be high-risk targets.", "To inform analysts\u2019 inputs into MSRAM, the Coast Guard has coordinated  efforts with the intelligence community and key stakeholders. For  example, the Coast Guard\u2019s Intelligence Coordination Center inputs  threat assessment data into MSRAM. Coast Guard analysts also use  information from other stakeholders, such as reports produced by the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,  Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), which contain oil and gas  production data, to inform their evaluations of vulnerabilities and  consequences. Based on the assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences, MSRAM produces a risk index number for each OCS  facility and deepwater port. The Coast Guard has also taken actions to  supplement MSRAM by, among other things, (1) including new data fields  on the frequency with which tankers visit a port and (2) adding additional  threat scenarios, such as a threat involving a cyber attack, to its data set.", "While MSRAM has been applied to deepwater ports, Coast Guard  officials have also used an independent risk assessment to assess  security risks as part of the application process for recently constructed  deepwater ports. For example, in December 2006, as part of the  application process for a proposed deepwater port in the Massachusetts  Bay, the Coast Guard, the owner and operator, and other stakeholders  collectively identified and assessed threat scenarios as well as the  potential consequences and vulnerabilities of each scenario. Based on  this assessment, stakeholders identified and agreed to carry out security  measures to mitigate the risks, such as installing camera systems and  increasing radar coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Data and Scope Hinder Risk Assessments", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard faces complex and technical challenges in assessing  security risks. The Coast Guard recognizes these challenges and  generally has actions underway to study or address them. Coast Guard  officials noted that some of these challenges are not unique to the Coast  Guard\u2019s risk assessment model and that these challenges are faced by  others in the homeland security community involved in conducting risk  assessments. Specific challenges are detailed below.  \uf0b7  Vulnerability-related data: The Coast Guard does not have data on  the ability of an OCS facility to withstand an attack, which is defined in  MSRAM as target hardness. The Coast Guard recognizes that target  hardness is an important consideration in assessing the vulnerability  of OCS facilities. However, MSRAM analysts described challenges in  assessing target hardness because empirical data are not available or  research has not been conducted to do so. For example, research on  whether a hijacked boat or an underwater attack could sink an  offshore oil or natural gas platform would give the Coast Guard and  owners and operators a clearer sense of whether this attack scenario  could result in major consequences. Coast Guard officials and  corporate security officers with whom we spoke indicated that such  research would advance knowledge about the vulnerabilities of OCS  facilities and deepwater ports. Gaining a better understanding of  target hardness of these and other threat scenarios could improve the  quality of the output from MSRAM. According to Coast Guard\u2019s  MSRAM Program Manager, the Coast Guard may recommend  conducting more research on the vulnerability to and consequences of  attack scenarios as a result of a study it is currently conducting on  OCS facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard initiated this  study in the fall of 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon incident. The  study initially reviewed the \u201clessons learned\u201d from Deepwater Horizon  and how those lessons could be used to improve MSRAM. During the  course of our review, Coast Guard officials stated that the scope of  the study has been expanded to include OCS facilities and that the  Coast Guard expects to issue its report in the fall of 2011.  \uf0b7  Consequences-related data: The input for secondary economic  impacts can have a substantial effect on how MSRAM\u2019s output  ranks a facility relative to other potential targets. Undervaluing  secondary economic impacts could result in a lower relative risk  ranking that underestimates the security risk to a facility, or inversely,  overvaluing secondary economic impacts could result in  overestimating the security risk to a facility. However, the Coast  Guard has limited data for assessing secondary economic impacts  from an attack on OCS facilities or deepwater ports. Coast Guard  analysts stated that gathering these data is a challenge because there  are few models or guidance available for doing so. During the course  of our review, the Coast Guard started using a tool, called \u201cIMPLAN,\u201d  that helps inform judgments of secondary economic impacts by  showing what the impact could be for different terrorist scenarios.  The tool, however, has limits in that it should not be used where the  consequences of a terrorist attack are mainly interruption to land or  water transportation. Enhancing DHS\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s ability  to assess secondary economic impacts could improve a MSRAM  analyst\u2019s accuracy in assessing the relative risk of a particular target.  Coast Guard officials added that they are working with DHS\u2019s Office of  Risk Management and Analysis in studying ways to improve how it  assesses secondary economic impacts.  \uf0b7  Challenges in assessing security risks to OCS facilities: We  determined that the Coast Guard did not conduct MSRAM  assessments for all 50 of the OCS facilities that are subject to federal  security requirements in 2011. Coast Guard guidance calls for  MSRAM analysts to identify and assess all significant targets that fall  within a unit\u2019s area of responsibility, which includes all security- regulated OCS facilities. Specifically, as of May 2011, we found that  MSRAM did not include 12 of the 50 OCS facilities operating at that  time. Coast Guard officials generally agreed with our finding and they  have since incorporated these 12 facilities into MSRAM and  completed the required risk assessments. While the Coast Guard  plans to update its policies and procedures for inspecting and  ensuring the security of OCS facilities in the future, the current set of  policies and procedures do not call for an updated list of OCS facilities  to be provided to MSRAM analysts to assess the security risks to  such facilities annually. Coast Guard officials acknowledged that their  policies and procedures did not include this requirement. Revising  policies and procedures to include such a requirement is important in  that the number of OCS facilities could change each year. For  example, some facilities may drop below the production or personnel  thresholds described earlier in this statement, thereby falling outside  the scope of 33 C.F.R. part 106, or other facilities could meet or  exceed such thresholds, thereby rendering them subject to part 106.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  policies and procedures enforce management directives and help  ensure that actions are taken to address risks. In addition, internal  control standards state that such control activities are an integral part  of an entity\u2019s planning, implementing, reviewing, and accountability for  stewardship of government resources and for achieving effective  results. Developing such procedures could help ensure that the Coast  Guard carries out its risk assessment requirements for such security- regulated OCS facilities.  \uf0b7  Challenges in assessing security risks to offshore energy  infrastructure that is not subject to security requirements: With  respect to OCS facilities, analysts only use MSRAM to assess  security risks associated with those OCS facilities that are regulated  for security under 33 C.F.R. part 106. For example, the Deepwater  Horizon did not meet the threshold criteria subjecting it to regulation  under part 106, and therefore, MSRAM was not used to assess its  security risks (see fig. 2 for a photo of the Deepwater Horizon  explosion). According to Coast Guard officials, mobile offshore drilling  units (MODUs), such as the Deepwater Horizon, do not generally  pose a risk of a terrorist attack since there is little chance of an oil spill  when these units are drilling and have not struck oil. However, the  officials noted that there is a brief period of time when a drilling unit  strikes a well, but the well has yet to be sealed prior to connecting it to  a production facility. The Deepwater Horizon was in this stage when it  resulted in such a large oil spill. During that period of time, MODUs  could be at risk of a terrorist attack that could have significant  consequences despite a facility not meeting the production or  personnel thresholds. For example, such risks could involve the  reliability of blowout preventer valves\u2014specialized valves that prevent  a well from spewing oil in the case of a blowout. Gaining a fuller  understanding of the security risks associated with MODUs, such as  the Deepwater Horizon, could improve the quality of program  decisions made by Coast Guard managers on whether actions may  be needed to ensure the security of this type of facility. According to  Coast Guard officials, they are studying the \u201clessons learned\u201d from the  Deepwater Horizon incident and part of the study involves examining  whether analysts should use MSRAM to assess MODUs in the future.  \uf0b7  Challenges in assessing systemic or network risks: MSRAM does  not assess systemic or network risks because, according to Coast  Guard officials, these types of assessments are beyond the intended  use of MSRAM. The 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan,  2010 DHS Quadrennial Review, and a National Research Council  evaluation of DHS risk assessment efforts have determined that  gaining a better understanding of network risks would help to  understand multiplying consequences of a terrorist attack or  simultaneous attacks on key facilities. Understanding \u201cnetwork\u201d risks  involves gaining a greater understanding of how a network is  vulnerable to a diverse range of threats. Examining how such  vulnerabilities create strategic opportunities for intelligent adversaries  with malevolent intent is central to this understanding. For example,  knowing what damage a malicious adversary could achieve by  exploiting weaknesses in an oil-distribution network offers  opportunities for improving the resiliency of the network within a given  budget.", "How the Coast Guard assesses offshore infrastructure within the  broader set of networks is important. The findings of the National  Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill incident illustrate  how examining networks or systems from a safety or engineering  perspective can bring greater knowledge of how single facilities  intersect with broader systems. The report noted that \u201ccomplex  systems almost always fail in complex ways\u201d and cautioned that  attempting to identify a single cause for the Deepwater Horizon  incident would provide a dangerously incomplete picture of what  happened. As a result, the report examined the Deepwater Horizon  incident with an expansive view toward the role that industry and  government sectors played in assessing vulnerabilities and the impact  the incident had on economic, social, and environmental systems.  Enhancing knowledge about the vulnerabilities of networks or systems  with which OCS facilities and deepwater ports intersect could improve  the quality of information that informs program and budget decisions  on how to best ensure security and use scarce resources in a  constrained fiscal environment. Doing so would also be consistent  with DHS\u2019s Quadrennial Review and other DHS guidance and would  provide information to decision makers that could minimize the  likelihood of being unprepared for a potential attack. Coast Guard  officials agreed that assessing \u201cnetwork effects\u201d is a challenge and  they are examining ways to meet this challenge. However, the Coast  Guard\u2019s work is this area is in its infancy and there is uncertainty  regarding the way in which the Coast Guard will move forward in  measuring \u201cnetwork effects.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The threat of terrorism against energy tankers and offshore energy  infrastructure highlights the importance of the Coast Guard having  policies and procedures in place to better ensure the security of energy  tankers, OCS facilities, and deepwater ports. The Coast Guard has taken  steps to implement prior GAO recommendations to enhance energy  tanker security, and it continues to work towards implementing the three  outstanding recommendations. Improvements in security could help to  prevent a terrorist attack against this infrastructure, which could have  significant consequences, such as those resulting from the Deepwater  Horizon incident. While the Coast Guard does not consider OCS facilities  that it has assessed in MSRAM to be high risk, it is important to assess all  OCS facilities as required by Coast Guard guidance. Since May 2011,  when we determined that some OCS facilities were not assessed, the  Coast Guard has completed its assessments for the previously omitted  facilities. However, given that the list of security-regulated facilities may  change each year based on factors such as production volume, it is  important to ensure that any facilities added to the list in the future will be  assessed for security risks in MSRAM. By revising policies and  procedures to help ensure that an updated list of OCS facilities is  provided to MSRAM analysts on an annual basis, the Coast Guard would  be better positioned to ensure that all risk assessments for facilities  requiring such assessments be conducted in a manner consistent with  the law and presidential directive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to assess security risks and  ensure the security of OCS facilities, we recommend that the  Commandant of the Coast Guard revise policies and procedures to  ensure that MSRAM analysts receive the annual updated list of security- regulated OCS facilities to ensure that risk assessments have been  conducted on all such OCS facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this testimony to DHS and DOJ for comment.
