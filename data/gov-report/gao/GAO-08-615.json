However, DOD's policies for providers to review medical records are inconsistent. DOD issued minimum mental health standards that servicemembers must meet in order to be deployed to a combat theater and identified the pre-deployment health assessment as a mechanism for ensuring their use in making deployment decisions. DOD's November 2006 policy implementing these deployment standards requires a review of servicemember medical records during the pre-deployment health assessment. However, DOD's August 2006 Instruction on Deployment Health, which implements policy and prescribes procedures for conducting pre-deployment health assessments, is silent on whether such a review is required. Because of this inconsistency, providers determining if Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom servicemembers meet DOD's mental health deployment standards may not have complete medical information. Health care providers at the installations GAO visited where the post-deployment health assessment (PDHA) is conducted manually track whether servicemembers who receive mental health referrals from the PDHA make or complete appointments with mental heath providers. Because health care providers conducting the PDHA and making referrals from the PDHA may not have an ongoing relationship with referred servicemembers, health care providers responsible for tracking referrals at these installations have developed manual systems to track servicemembers to ensure that they made or kept their appointments for evaluations. Tracking is more challenging for Guard and Reserve units because their servicemembers generally receive civilian care. Guard and Reserve units do not know if servicemembers used civilian care to complete their PDHA referrals unless disclosed by the servicemembers, which they may be reluctant to do because of stigma concerns. DOD is addressing the TBI requirement through implementing screening for mild TBI in its PDHA and prior to deployment. DOD has also provided guidance and training for health care providers. DOD in January 2008 added TBI screening to the PDHA, and plans to require screening of all servicemembers for mild TBI prior to deployment beginning in July 2008. The TBI screening questions on the PDHA assess the servicemember's exposure to events that may have increased the risk of a TBI and the servicemember's symptoms. The TBI screening questions to be used prior to deployment are similar to those on the PDHA. Prior to DOD's screening efforts, several installations had been screening servicemembers for mild TBI before or after deployment. An official from the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center told GAO that these initiatives would probably be replaced by the DOD-wide screening."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the initiation of military conflicts in Afghanistan\u2014Operation  Since the initiation of military conflicts in Afghanistan\u2014Operation  Enduring Freedom (OEF)\u2014and Iraq\u2014Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\u2014 Enduring Freedom (OEF)\u2014and Iraq\u2014Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)\u2014 servicemembers have engaged in intense and prolonged combat, placing  servicemembers have engaged in intense and prolonged combat, placing  them at risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other  them at risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other  mental health conditions.

In 2007 a  DOD Mental Health Task Force reported that DOD faced several  challenges to effective mental health assessments, including eagerness to  deploy or stigma, that may prevent servicemembers from disclosing  mental health concerns on the pre-deployment health assessment or the  PDHA respectively, and recommended that DOD coordinate the mental  health screening questions that are used on the health assessment forms to  ensure accuracy and consistency. In May 2006 we reported that DOD  could not provide reasonable assurance that OEF/OIF servicemembers  who need referrals for mental health following deployments receive them.", "There has also been interest in ensuring that servicemembers are screened  for TBI, particularly mild TBI. Mild TBI can be difficult to identify in part  because, unlike with more severe forms of TBI, there may be no  observable head trauma and because some of its symptoms overlap with  other conditions, such as PTSD. In May 2007 an Army TBI Task Force  report identified gaps in TBI screening efforts across all levels of Army  health care, such as few military installations that had been conducting  TBI screening before deployment and a lack of policies requiring TBI  screening after deployment.", "The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  (NDAA), enacted on October 17, 2006, included a provision that addressed  DOD\u2019s efforts to screen servicemembers for mental health concerns and  TBI.

More than  half of Marine Corps servicemembers and almost half of Army  servicemembers reported killing an enemy combatant in OIF. In addition  to certain types of experiences, multiple deployments are also associated  with mental health problems. For example, a 2006 Army mental health  advisory team report found that Army servicemembers who had been  deployed more than once were more likely to screen positive for PTSD,  depression, or anxiety than those deployed only once. In a 2008 Army  mental health advisory team report, 27 percent of Army male non- commissioned officers in their third or fourth deployment screened  positive for PTSD, depression, or anxiety (compared to 12 percent of those  on their first deployment).", "Servicemembers are also exposed to events such as blasts that increase  their risk of experiencing a TBI. TBI occurs when a sudden trauma causes  damage to the brain and can result in loss of consciousness, confusion,  dizziness, trouble with concentration or memory, and seizures. Of  particular concern are the after-effects of a mild TBI that may not have  resulted in readily apparent symptoms at the time of the injury. A recent  study found that mild TBI was associated with high combat intensity and  multiple exposures to explosions in combat. Identification of mild TBI is  important, as treatment has been shown to mitigate the injury\u2019s effects,  which can include difficulty returning to work or completing routine daily  activities. DVBIC has issued a screening tool called the Military Acute  Concussion Evaluation (MACE), which is based on a screening tool widely  used in sports medicine and is intended to evaluate a servicemember  within 48 hours of the suspected injury. In June 2007, the Army required  health care providers to document a servicemember\u2019s blast exposure in  theater using the MACE. DVBIC also issued in December 2006 a CPG for  the management of mild TBI in theater. The guidance contains a  structured series of questions that include certain \u201cred flags,\u201d such as  worsening headaches or slurred speech, that should trigger further  evaluation for a possible mild TBI.

In  contrast, information in AHLTA is available to medical facilities at  different installations and to providers in theater. Another distinction is  that CHCS I sends health care providers an email alert when a  servicemember they refer makes, completes, or cancels an appointment. If  servicemembers do not make appointments within 30 days, their referral is  terminated from CHCS I and the health care provider is notified by email.  AHLTA does not have this capability.

He stated that the guidance is distributed to email  accounts that some health care providers may not check regularly. In  addition, health care providers varied in their level of comfort in making  mental health assessments. At Camp Lejeune, eight of the 15 physicians  and IDCs we interviewed were comfortable making mental health  assessments, while the remaining seven were less comfortable making  these assessments and expressed interest in receiving more training on  making mental health assessments. At Fort Campbell, the division mental  health providers we spoke with stated that while physician assistants, for  example, could identify a servicemember with mental health concerns,  these providers were generally not comfortable in assessing  servicemembers for mental health issues.", "DOD and the military services have implemented and are in the process of  implementing several new mental health training initiatives. DOD created  the Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain  Injury in November 2007 that will focus on research, education, and  training related to mental health. According to DOD, the Center will  develop and distribute a core mental health curriculum for health care  providers, as well as implement policies to direct training in the  curriculum across the services. DOD plans to begin training primary care  providers in July 2008. The Army has created a program, RESPECT-MIL,  that trains primary care providers in identifying and treating  servicemembers with depression and PTSD. By the end of 2008, the Army  plans to train providers at 15 installations. The Army also directed all  servicemembers, including health care providers, to participate in a  training program that includes information on PTSD by October 18, 2007.  The training focused on the causes and physical and psychological effects  of PTSD and provided information on how to seek subsequent treatment  for this condition. As of January 31, 2008, 93 percent of Army  servicemembers had received the training. The Army also requires  commanders to include PTSD awareness and response training in pre- and  post-deployment briefings. The Marine Corps has a training program for  non-mental health providers, including those that conduct the PDHA, that  includes training on PTSD. This training began in January 2008 and is  scheduled to train 669 health care providers at 12 sites by August 2008.

These screening questions are  similar to the screening questions on the PDHA. The questions are  included in a cognitive assessment tool that will provide a baseline of  cognitive function in areas such as memory and reaction time. In January  2008, DOD released a new version of the post-deployment health  assessment form, the DD 2796, that contains screening questions for TBI  (See appendix I for a copy of the new version of the DD 2796).", "The TBI screening questions added to the PDHA are designed to be  completed by the servicemember in four series. The sequence of  questions specifically assesses (a) events that may have increased the risk  of a TBI, (b) immediate symptoms following the event, (c) new or  worsening symptoms following the event, and (d) current symptoms. (See  appendix I.) If there is a positive response to any question in the first  series, the servicemember completes the second and third series; if there  is a positive response to any question in the third series, the  servicemember completes the fourth series about current symptoms. The  DD 2796 directs the health care provider to refer the servicemember based  on the servicemember\u2019s current symptoms. See figure 2 for a description  of these screening questions.", "DOD is planning to require screening of all servicemembers for mild TBI  prior to deployment using questions similar to those on the PDHA. This  screening is planned to begin in July 2008 and these screening questions  are included in a cognitive assessment, the Automated Neuropsychological  Assessment Metrics (ANAM). The ANAM will provide a baseline  assessment of cognitive function in areas such as memory and reaction  time, which may be affected by a mild TBI. If a servicemember  experiences an event in theater, the ANAM can be administered again and  the differences in function assessed. Because the ANAM does not  distinguish between impairments in cognitive function caused by events  such as blasts and those caused by other factors such as fatigue, the  ANAM needs to be used with screening questions to identify the event that  may have caused a TBI. However, the ANAM can be used to identify  changes in baseline cognitive function that may warrant further  evaluation. According to an Army official, since August 2007 about 50,000  Army servicemembers have been assessed using the ANAM.", "Prior to DOD\u2019s plans to screen all servicemembers on the PDHA and prior  to deployment, several installations had implemented, as early as 2000,  initiatives for mild TBI screening to be used before or after units from  those locations deployed. Generally, servicemembers participating in  these initiatives are screened using a three-question screen developed by  the DVBIC called the Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen (BTBIS). The  BTBIS is designed to identify servicemembers who may have had a mild  TBI, and includes questions about events and symptoms that are similar to  those used on DOD\u2019s PDHA. The first of these initiatives began at Fort  Bragg, North Carolina in 2000. Since then, Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort  Irwin, California; Fort McCoy, Wisconsin and Camp Pendleton, California  have initiated screening for mild TBI either pre-deployment, post- deployment, or both.

In October 2007  DOD released guidance on identifying mild TBI for providers screening,  assessing, and treating servicemembers outside the combat theater. The  guidance contains information to help health care providers conducting  the PDHA, including follow-up questions that the provider can ask a  servicemember based on the servicemember\u2019s responses to the TBI  screening questions on the PDHA. The guidance contains structured series  of questions that include certain \u201cred flags,\u201d such as double vision or  confusion, that suggest a need for referral for further evaluation for a  possible mild TBI. The guidance recommends assessments and treatments  for servicemembers with symptoms such as irritability and includes  screening tools to help health care providers assess the severity of these  symptoms. According to a DOD official, DOD also plans to provide the  military services with guidance on using the new TBI screening questions  on the PDHA.", "In addition to issuing guidance, DOD and the military services also trained  health care providers on identifying possible mild TBI. In September 2007  DOD held a tri-service conference in which more than 800 health care  providers were trained. According to DVBIC officials, DVBIC staff provide  training through workshops for health care providers at its 14 sites and  travel to other installations to train health care providers. In addition,  DOD\u2019s planned Defense Center of Excellence for Psychological Health and  Traumatic Brain Injury, which began initial operations on November 30,  2007, and is expected to be fully functional by October 2009, will develop a  national collaborative network to advance and disseminate TBI  knowledge, enhance clinical and management approaches, and facilitate  services for those dealing with TBI, according to DOD. According to Army  officials, the Army is also initiating several health care provider training  efforts for the summer of 2008 designed to train primary care providers on  mild TBI. According to these officials, primary care providers are generally  uncomfortable with treating mild TBI, preferring instead to refer these  cases to specialty care. The Marine Corps\u2019 training program for non-mental  health care providers, including those conducting the PDHA, also includes  material on diagnosing mild TBI.

With respect to mental health, we found  that health care providers\u2019 familiarity with DOD\u2019s CPGs and comfort in  making mental health assessments varied. However, DOD and the military  services have implemented or are implementing training initiatives, some  of which are specifically aimed at the primary care providers who  generally conduct the PDHA. Furthermore, the installations we visited had  developed manual systems for tracking those servicemembers who were  referred from the PDHA to ensure that they made or completed their  appointments. Referral tracking is difficult for the Guard and Reserves  because their servicemembers generally receive civilian care.", "DOD has taken steps to meet 2007 NDAA requirements related to mental  health standards and screening, including issuing a policy on minimum  mental health standards for deployment. A key component of DOD\u2019s  efforts to meet these requirements is a review of medical records, and we  agree that this should be done to verify information in a screening process  that depends on self-reported information. Unfortunately, DOD\u2019s policies  for reviewing medical records during the pre-deployment health  assessment are inconsistent. During our site visits we found that health  care providers were unaware a medical record review was required and  that medical records were not always reviewed by providers conducting  the pre-deployment health assessment. A health care provider following  DOD\u2019s Instruction on Deployment Health, which is silent on whether  medical record review is required during the pre-deployment health  assessment, may not conduct the medical record review required by  DOD\u2019s policy on minimum mental health standards for deployment.

According to a senior DOD health official, it is  anticipated that the updated Instruction will be published in one year.  However, DOD does not explain how providers will be able to identify the  subset of servicemembers who have had a significant change in health  status. As a result, its response does not fully eliminate the inconsistency  between its policy and current Instruction.
