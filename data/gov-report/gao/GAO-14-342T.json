It is used to prevent terrorism, and provide border security and law enforcement, case management, and intelligence functions for multiple federal, state, and local agencies. It has become increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and is unable to support new mission requirements. In 2008, DHS began an effort to modernize the system. It is being managed as two separate programs by CBP and ICE.", "In December 2013, GAO reported that DHS needed to strengthen its efforts to modernize these key enforcement systems. This statement summarizes that report. Specifically, it covers (1) the scope and status of the two TECS Mod programs, (2) selected program management practices for TECS Mod, (3) the extent to which DHS is executing effective oversight and governance of the two TECS Mod programs, and (4) the importance of addressing our recommendations for improving DHS's development efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The schedule and cost for the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) border enforcement system modernization program known as TECS Mod that is managed by Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) continue to change; while the part managed in parallel by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is undergoing major revisions to its scope, schedule, and cost after discovering that its initial solution is not technically viable. CBP's $724 million program intends to modernize the functionality, data, and aging infrastructure of legacy TECS and move it to DHS's data centers by 2016. To date, CBP has deployed functionality to improve its secondary inspection processes to air and sea ports of entry and, more recently, to land ports of entry in 2013. However, CBP is in the process of revising its schedule baseline for the second time in under a year. Further, CBP has not developed its master schedule sufficiently to reliably manage work activities or monitor program progress. These factors raise questions about the certainty of CBP's remaining schedule commitments. Regarding ICE's $818 million TECS Mod program, it is redesigning and replanning its program, having determined in June 2013 that its initial solution was not viable and could not support ICE's needs. As a result, ICE largely halted development and is now assessing design alternatives and is revising its schedule and cost estimates. Program officials stated the revisions will be complete in spring 2014. Until ICE completes the replanning effort, it is unclear what functionality it will deliver, when it will deliver it, or what it will cost to do so, thus putting it in jeopardy of not completing the modernization by its 2015 deadline.", "CBP and ICE have managed many risks in accordance with some leading practices, but they have had mixed results in managing requirements for their programs. In particular, neither program identified all known risks, nor escalated them for timely management review. Further, CBP's guidance reflects most leading practices for effectively managing requirements, but important requirements development activities were underway before such guidance was established. ICE, meanwhile, operated without requirements management guidance for years, and its requirements activities were mismanaged, resulting in testing failures and delays. ICE issued requirements guidance in March 2013 that is consistent with leading practices, but it has not yet been implemented.", "DHS's governance bodies have taken actions to oversee the two TECS Mod programs that are generally aligned with leading practices. Specifically, they have monitored TECS Mod performance and progress and have ensured that corrective actions have been identified and tracked. However, a lack of complete, timely, and accurate data have affected the ability of these governance bodies to make informed and timely decisions, thus limiting their effectiveness. Until these governance bodies base their performance reviews on timely, complete, and accurate data, they will be constrained in their ability to effectively provide oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making no new recommendations in this statement.

In addition, it provides an investigative case  management function for activities carried out by ICE agents, including  money-laundering tracking and reporting; telephone data analysis; and  intelligence reporting and dissemination.", "Over time, TECS has evolved into a multifaceted computing platform that  CBP describes as a system of systems. This mainframe-based system  dates back to the 1980s and interfaces with over 80 other systems from  within DHS, other federal departments and their component agencies, as  well as state, local, and foreign governments. It contains over 350  database tables, queries and reports (e.g., querying law enforcement  records to determine if a traveler appears on a terrorist watch list), and  multiple applications (e.g., ICE\u2019s existing investigative case management  system). CBP agents and other users access TECS via dedicated  terminals. The system is managed by CBP\u2019s Office of Passenger  Systems Program Office and is currently hosted at CBP\u2019s datacenter.", "On a daily basis, the system is used by over 70,000 users and handles  more than 2 million transactions\u2014including the screening of over 900,000  visitors and approximately 465,000 vehicles every day. In addition,  federal, state, local, and international law enforcement entities use TECS  to create and disseminate alerts and other law enforcement information  about \u201cpersons of interest.\u201d Ten federal departments and their numerous  component agencies access the system to perform a part of their  missions.", "The current TECS system uses obsolete technology, which combined  with expanding mission requirements, have posed operational challenges  for CBP and others. For example, users may need to access and  navigate among several different systems to investigate, resolve, and  document an encounter with a passenger. In addition, CBP identified that  TECS\u2019s search algorithms do not adequately match names from foreign  alphabets. TECS\u2019s obsolescence also makes it difficult and expensive to  maintain and support. Specifically, DHS estimates that TECS\u2019s licensing  and maintenance costs are expected to be $40 million to $60 million per  year in 2015.", "In 2008, DHS initiated efforts to modernize TECS by replacing the  mainframe technology, developing new applications and enhancing  existing applications to address expanding traveler screening mission  needs, improving data integration to provide enhanced search and case  management capabilities, and improving user interface and data access.  DHS\u2019s plan was to migrate away from the existing TECS mainframe by  September 2015 to avoid significantly escalating support costs. The  modernization effort is managed by two program offices\u2014one at CBP and  the other at ICE\u2014working in parallel, with each having assumed  responsibility for modernizing the parts of the system aligned with their  respective missions.", "CBP expects that its modernization efforts will yield certain improvements  over the existing system, including the following.", "Enhancements to TECS\u2019s search algorithms to better match names  from foreign alphabets; address gaps in current processes that could  result in missing a person of interest.

Specifically, the program has not linked  all the work activities in the individual project schedules, nor has it defined  dependencies that exist between projects in the master schedule:  approximately 65 percent of CBP\u2019s remaining work activities were not  linked with other associated work activities. Thus, any delays early in the  schedule do not \u201cripple\u201d (i.e., transmit delays) to activities later in the  schedule, meaning that management will be challenged to determine how  a slip in the completion date of a particular task may affect the overall  schedule. In our report, we also noted that CBP had not yet developed a  detailed schedule for significant portions of the program. CBP reported in  January 2014 that it has now completed that work.", "Program officials stated these deficiencies existed because the program  has only two staff members with skills needed to properly develop and  maintain the schedules, and that fully documenting all the dependencies  would be time consuming, and in their view, not sufficiently important to  warrant the additional resources necessary to complete them.

Specifically, ICE determined that, after spending approximately  $19 million, the system under development could not be fielded as part of  ICE\u2019s eventual solution due to ongoing technical difficulties with the user  interface, access controls, and case-related data management. Instead of  continuing with the existing technical solution, the program manager  explained that ICE would scrap a significant portion of the work done to  date and start over. As a result, ICE halted most development work in  June 2013 and has since been assessing different design and technical  alternatives. In January 2014, ICE reported that it had rebaselined its  program requirements and that it anticipates having its revised cost and  schedule estimates finalized this coming spring. Nevertheless, given the  time lost in developing the current technical solution, as well as the  already reduced program scope, ICE cannot say what specific features it  will release to users, when this functionality will be delivered, or how  much such efforts will cost.

Similarly, even though ICE had not reported recent cost or schedule  data for its program\u2014an issue that may signal a significant problem\u2014 the Office of the CIO rated ICE\u2019s program as medium risk.

Further, the low-risk rating it  issued for ICE was based, in part, on its assessment of ICE\u2019s  performance between April and September 2012, which rated the  program\u2019s cost performance with the lowest possible risk score. Yet,  during that same time period, program documents show that ICE  TECS Mod\u2019s cost and schedule performance was declining and varied  significantly from its baseline.

As discussed, these  issues have caused the program to halt development and replan its  entire acquisition. Consequently, the newly-issued issued report is not  reflective of ICE\u2019s current status, and thus is not an effective tool for  management\u2019s use in providing oversight.", "Until these governance bodies base their reviews of performance on  timely, complete, and accurate data, they will be limited in their ability to  effectively provide oversight and to make timely decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Recommendations Could Improve DHS\u2019s Efforts to Develop and Implement Its TECS Mod Programs", "paragraphs": ["In our report, we made several recommendations to improve DHS\u2019s  efforts to develop and implement its TECS Mod programs.

The importance of  having updated cost and schedule estimates for both the CBP and ICE  programs cannot be understated, as this important management  information will provide Congress and DHS with visibility into the  performance of these vital border security investments. Further, while  both agencies have defined key practices for managing risks and  requirements, it is important that the programs fully implement these  critical practices to help ensure that they deliver the functionally needed  to meet mission requirements and minimize the potential for additional  costly rework.
