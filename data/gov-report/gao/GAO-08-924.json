Though not required to do so, the Coast Guard has established a similar policy. In response to congressional requests and Senate Report No. 110-77, GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD and the Coast Guard (1) have developed and implemented policies and programs to prevent, respond to, and resolve sexual assault incidents involving servicemembers; (2) have visibility over reports of sexual assault involving servicemembers; and (3) exercise oversight over reports of sexual assault involving servicemembers. To conduct this review, GAO reviewed legislative requirements and DOD and Coast Guard guidance; analyzed sexual assault incident data; and obtained through surveys and interviews the perspective on sexual assault matters of more than 3,900 servicemembers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the Coast Guard have established polices and programs to prevent, respond to, and resolve reported sexual assault incidents involving servicemembers; however, implementation of the programs is hindered by several factors. GAO found that (1) DOD's guidance may not adequately address some important issues, such as how to implement its program in deployed and joint environments; (2) most, but not all, commanders support the programs; (3) required sexual assault prevention and response training is not consistently effective; and (4) factors such as a DOD-reported shortage of mental health care providers affect whether servicemembers who are victims of sexual assault can or do access mental health services. Left unchecked, these challenges can discourage or prevent some servicemembers from using the programs when needed. GAO found, based on responses to its nongeneralizable survey administered to 3,750 servicemembers stationed at military installations in the United States and overseas and a 2006 DOD survey, the most recent available, that occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported, suggesting that DOD and the Coast Guard have only limited visibility over the incidence of these occurrences. At the 14 installations where GAO administered its survey, 103 servicemembers indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months. Of these, 52 servicemembers indicated that they did not report the sexual assault. GAO also found that factors that discourage servicemembers from reporting a sexual assault include the belief that nothing would be done; fear of ostracism, harassment, or ridicule; and concern that peers would gossip. Although DOD has established some mechanisms for overseeing reports of sexual assault, and the Coast Guard is beginning to do so, neither has developed an oversight framework--including clear objectives, milestones, performance measures, and criteria for measuring progress--to guide its efforts. In compliance with statutory requirements, DOD reports data on sexual assault incidents involving servicemembers to Congress annually. However, DOD's report does not include some data that would aid congressional oversight, such as why some sexual assaults could not be substantiated following an investigation. Further, the military services have not provided data that would facilitate oversight and enable DOD to conduct trend analyses. While the Coast Guard voluntarily provides data to DOD for inclusion in its report, this information is not provided to Congress because there is no requirement to do so. To provide further oversight of DOD's programs, Congress, in 2004, directed the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services to conduct an examination of matters relating to sexual assault in the Armed Forces. However, as of July 2008, the task force had not yet begun its review. Without an oversight framework, as well as more complete data, decision makers in DOD, the Coast Guard, and Congress lack information they need to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Sexual assault is a crime that contradicts the core values that the  Department of Defense (DOD), the military services, and the Coast Guard  expect servicemembers to follow, such as treating their fellow members  with dignity and respect. Within DOD and the Coast Guard, sexual assault  also presents a force protection challenge and can negatively affect units\u2019  readiness and cohesion. In 2004, following a series of high-profile sexual  assault cases involving servicemembers, Congress directed the Secretary  of Defense to develop a comprehensive policy for DOD on the prevention  of and response to sexual assaults involving servicemembers, including an  option that would enable servicemembers to confidentially disclose an  incident of sexual assault. Since July 2005, active duty servicemembers  have had two options for reporting an alleged sexual assault: (1)  restricted, which allows victims of sexual assault to disclose a sexual  assault incident to specific individuals and receive medical care and other  victim advocacy services without initiating a criminal investigation; and  (2) unrestricted, which entails notification of the chain of command and  may trigger a criminal investigation. Although these requirements do not  apply to the Coast Guard, which is overseen by the Department of  Homeland Security, the Coast Guard has adopted similar reporting  options.", "To help inform congressional deliberations on these issues, in August  2006, Congressman Christopher Shays, then Chairman of the House  Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security,  Emerging Threats, and International Relations, asked GAO to examine  sexual assault prevention and response programs at the military  academies as well as at military installations within DOD and the Coast  Guard and during deployments. In August 2007, Congressmen John  Tierney, in his new position as Chairman of the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security  and Foreign Affairs, signed on to the original request submitted by  Congressman Shays. In response, we issued a report in January 2008  reviewing programs to address sexual assault and sexual harassment at  the military and Coast Guard academies. That report found that, while the  academies have taken steps to prevent, respond to, and resolve sexual  assault and sexual harassment incidents, such incidents may be  underreported, suggesting that the academies may not have full visibility  over all sexual assault and sexual harassment incidents and that greater  federal oversight of their efforts is needed. In that report, we made a  number of recommendations to DOD to improve its visibility and oversight  of reported incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment at the  military academies, and to the Coast Guard to improve its oversight of  reported incidents of sexual assault and sexual harassment at the Coast  Guard Academy. In commenting on that report, both DOD and the Coast  Guard concurred or partially concurred with our recommendations and  specified actions they would take to address them. For example, DOD  stated that it was in the initial stages of identifying servicewide  performance metrics to help assess the academy\u2019s programs, while the  Coast Guard noted that it had recently published additional guidance and  would work with DOD to help improve oversight of its program.", "Subsequent to receiving the congressional request, the Senate Armed  Services Committee directed GAO to review sexual assault prevention and  response programs at DOD military installations and during deployments  overseas. In addition, several individual senators requested that we  examine issues surrounding mental health concerns that can result from  sexual assault. On July 31, 2008, we testified before the House Committee  on Oversight and Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security  and Foreign Affairs, on our preliminary observations of DOD\u2019s and the  Coast Guard\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response programs. This  report expands upon the preliminary observations we discussed at that  hearing and addresses sexual assault prevention and response programs in  the active components of DOD and the Coast Guard, including during  deployments. Specifically, it evaluates the extent to which DOD and the  Coast Guard (1) have developed and implemented policies and programs  to prevent, respond to, and resolve sexual assault incidents involving  servicemembers; (2) have visibility over reports of sexual assault involving  servicemembers; and (3) exercise oversight over reports of sexual assault  involving servicemembers.", "For our first objective, we reviewed legislative requirements; obtained and  analyzed DOD\u2019s, the military services\u2019, and the Coast Guard\u2019s guidance and  requirements for the prevention, response, and resolution of sexual  assault; analyzed DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress for calendar years  2004, 2005, 2006, and fiscal year 2007; interviewed knowledgeable officials  about implementation of the programs; and visited 15 military installations  in the United States and overseas to assess implementation of the  programs. At the installations we visited, we met with sexual assault  prevention and response program coordinators, victim advocates, judge  advocates, medical and mental health personnel, criminal investigative  personnel, law enforcement personnel, and chaplains. We also met with  various military commanders, including company and field grade officers,  and senior enlisted servicemembers. We also obtained the perspective of  more than 3,900 servicemembers by administering a total of 3,750  confidential surveys to a nonprobability sample of randomly selected  servicemembers and conducting more than 150 one-on-one, structured  interviews with randomly selected servicemembers at 14 of the 15  installations we visited. Our survey is the first since 2006 to obtain the  perspectives of selected servicemembers in each military service and the  Coast Guard on sexual assault issues and the first to assess sexual assault  issues in the Coast Guard since the restricted reporting option became  available in December 2007. Because we did not select survey and  interview participants using a statistically representative sampling method,  our survey results and the comments provided during our interview  sessions are nongeneralizable and therefore cannot be projected across  DOD, a service, or any single installation we visited. However, the survey  results and comments provide insight into the command climate and  implementation of sexual assault prevention and response programs at  each location at the time of our visit. For our second objective, in addition  to analyzing our confidential surveys and one-on-one structured  interviews, we reviewed the results of surveys conducted by DOD and the  Army and Navy since 2004; reviewed DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress;  and obtained and analyzed data for reported sexual assaults in both DOD  and the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2007. We assessed the reliability of the  reported sexual assault data by interviewing DOD and Coast Guard  officials to understand the processes and databases used to collect and  record the data, existing data quality control procedures, and known  limitations of the data. We found these data were sufficiently reliable to  present an overall description of reported incidents of sexual assault. For  our third objective, we interviewed knowledgeable officials; obtained and  analyzed various pertinent documents, such as meeting minutes for DOD\u2019s  Sexual Assault Advisory Council; reviewed reports issued by the services\u2019  inspector generals and examined DOD\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s responses  to recommendations from prior related studies; and analyzed all DOD and  Coast Guard installation-level data for reported sexual assaults for fiscal  year 2007. Further details about our scope and methodology, including the  development and administration of our survey and the one-on-one  structured interviews, can be found in appendix I. In addition, copies of  our survey questionnaires can be found in appendices VI and VII.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 through August 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In October 2004, Congress included a provision in the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 that required the  Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive policy for DOD on the  prevention of and response to sexual assaults involving members of the  Armed Forces. The legislation required that the department\u2019s policy be  based on the recommendations of the Department of Defense Task Force  on Care for Victims of Sexual Assaults and on such other matters as the  Secretary considered appropriate. Among other things, the legislation  required DOD to establish a standardized departmentwide definition of  sexual assault; establish procedures for confidentially reporting sexual  assault incidents; and submit an annual report to Congress on reported  sexual assault incidents involving members of the Armed Forces.", "In October 2005, DOD issued DOD Directive 6495.01, which contains its  comprehensive policy for the prevention of and response to sexual assault,  and in June 2006 it issued DOD Instruction 6495.02, which provides  guidance for implementing its policy. DOD\u2019s directive defines sexual  assault as \u201cintentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force,  physical threat or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or  cannot consent. It includes rape, nonconsensual sodomy (oral or anal  sex), indecent assault (unwanted, inappropriate sexual contact or  fondling), or attempts to commit these acts. Sexual assault can occur  without regard to gender or spousal relationship or age of victim.  \u201cConsent\u201d shall not be deemed or construed to mean the failure by the  victim to offer physical resistance. Consent is not given when a person  uses force, threat of force, coercion, or when a victim is asleep,  incapacitated, or unconscious.\u201d", "The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has the  responsibility for developing the overall policy and guidance for the  department\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response program. Under the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (within the Office  of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Plans) serves as the  department\u2019s single point of responsibility for sexual assault policy  matters. These include providing the military services with guidance,  training standards, and technical support; overseeing the department\u2019s  collection and maintenance of data on reported sexual assaults involving  servicemembers; establishing mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of  the department\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response program; and  preparing the department\u2019s annual report to Congress.", "In DOD, active duty servicemembers have two options for reporting a  sexual assault: (1) restricted, and (2) unrestricted. The restricted reporting  option permits a victim to confidentially disclose an alleged sexual assault  to select individuals and receive care without initiating a criminal  investigation. A restricted report may only be made to a Sexual Assault  Response Coordinator (SARC), victim advocate, or medical personnel.  Because conversations between servicemembers and chaplains are  generally privileged, a victim may also confidentially disclose an alleged  sexual assault to a chaplain. In contrast, the unrestricted reporting option  informs the chain of command of the alleged sexual assault and may  initiate an investigation by the military criminal investigative organization  of jurisdiction.", "Prior to December 2007, the Coast Guard only offered an option that  would enable servicemembers to confidentially disclose an incident of  sexual assault at the Coast Guard Academy. However, since then the Coast  Guard has employed Coast Guard-wide a definition of sexual assault  similar to DOD\u2019s as well as similar options for reporting a sexual assault in  its guidance, Commandant Instruction 1754.10C. Under the Coast Guard\u2019s  instruction, however, if the chain of command learns of an alleged sexual  assault they are required to notify the Coast Guard\u2019s criminal investigative  organization, the Coast Guard Investigative Service, which will initiate an  investigation or inquiry.", "At the installation level, the coordinators of the sexual assault prevention  and response programs are known as SARCs in DOD and as Employee  Assistance Program Coordinators (EAPC) in the Coast Guard.

Program officials we  met with overseas told us that DOD\u2019s guidance does not sufficiently take  into account the realities of operating in a deployed environment, in which  unique living and social circumstances can heighten the risks for sexual  assault and program resources are more widely dispersed than they are in  the United States, which can make responding to a sexual assault  challenging. One program official we met with overseas told us that his  area of responsibility includes six to seven installations spread out over an  area the size of New Jersey, constituting a geographic challenge in terms  of responding to sexual assaults. At another installation, we found no  criminal investigative presence, and program officials told us that it can  take 48 hours or longer for the criminal investigative organization with  jurisdiction to respond to some sexual assaults. Similarly, program  officials told us there is a need for better coordination of resources when a  sexual assault occurs in a joint environment. At one overseas installation  we visited, Coast Guard members told us that they were confused about  which program they fell under\u2014DOD\u2019s or the Coast Guard\u2019s\u2014and thus  who they should report an alleged sexual assault to. We also found that  installations can have multiple responders responsible for responding to  an assault, potentially leading to further confusion. Concerns over  implementing the sexual assault prevention and response program in joint  environments are also highlighted in the department\u2019s fiscal year 2007  annual report. For example, DOD noted the need to address challenges  that arise in environments wherein two or more services are operating  together, while the Army noted that challenges with joint environments  have often resulted in unnecessary duplication of services and  inconsistent application of policy with regard to sexual assault matters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Programs Is Hindered by Inconsistent Support from Commanders and Limited Effectiveness of Program Coordinators for Whom Program Management Is a Collateral Duty", "paragraphs": ["Commanders in DOD and the Coast Guard have taken actions to address  incidents of sexual assault and are generally supportive of sexual assault  prevention and response programs; however, we found evidence that  some commanders do not support the programs.

According to DOD\u2019s instruction, commanders and other leaders  are responsible for advocating a strong program and effectively  implementing sexual assault prevention and response policies. The Coast  Guard\u2019s instruction similarly requires that commanders and other leaders  ensure compliance with the Coast Guard\u2019s policies and procedures. At the  installations we visited, we found that commanders were supportive of  addressing incidents of sexual assault. For example, commanders told us  that they set a zero tolerance policy for incidents of sexual assault,  communicated the respective policies at command briefings, understood  their roles and responsibilities in supporting the programs, and  understood the need to protect victims. The results of a nongeneralizable  survey we conducted support these statements. For example, at the 14  installations where we administered our survey, the percentage of  servicemembers who indicated they thought their direct supervisor  (military or civilian) would address sexual assault, should it occur at their  current location, ranged from 91 to 98 percent.", "However, we found evidence that some commanders do not support the  programs. For example, at three of the installations we visited program  officials told us of meeting with resistance from commanders when  attempting to place, in barracks and work areas, posters or other materials  advertising the program or the options for reporting a sexual assault. A  victim advocate at one Navy installation we visited told us that her  command did not support the program and that her command did not feel  that servicemembers in the unit should be able to utilize DOD\u2019s restricted  reporting option. According to the individual, the command demonstrated  its resistance by routinely taking down any posters advertising the unit\u2019s  victim advocates or DOD\u2019s reporting options. In some cases, commanders  we spoke with told us that they supported the programs but did not like  the restricted reporting option because they felt it hindered their ability to  protect members of the unit or discipline alleged offenders.", "Some program officials told us that some commanders do not support the  programs because they do not understand them or do not consider sexual  assault matters to be a priority in the military. The following are some  examples of what we found:    At some of the installations we visited, commanders we spoke with were  unfamiliar with the options for reporting a sexual assault, mistakenly  believing that servicemembers could use the restricted option and still  report a sexual assault to them\u2014that is, without their being obligated to  then initiate an investigation.", "Army unit victim advocates at one location we visited told us that senior  enlisted leaders tend to ignore sexual assault matters until they become  public knowledge and affect the morale of the unit.", "Marine Corps unit victim advocates at one location we visited told us that  some commanders do not want to hear from them or from junior enlisted  Marines about sexual assault matters.", "At some of the installations we visited, program officials told us that some  commanders of all-male units do not believe that sexual assault matters  are a problem for their units or that the programs are relevant to their  units. For example, a SARC at one installation we visited told us that some  commanders from all-male units have prevented her from providing  required training to the units.", "Commanders who do not emphasize and prioritize sexual assault  prevention and response programs\u2014including those in all-male units\u2014or  who do not understand the policies and procedures effectively limit  servicemembers\u2019 knowledge about the program and ability to exercise  their reporting options. Consequently, sexual assault prevention and  response program coordinators\u2019 efforts to raise awareness at these  installations may also be limited.", "Program officials told us they need sufficient resources to appropriately  implement sexual assault prevention and response programs. However,  there is no direct funding for sexual assault prevention and response  programs at military installations. To fund the programs, funds from other  installation programs need to be utilized. At some of the installations we  visited, SARCs and other program officials told us that they lacked  sufficient funding to promote the programs, train servicemembers, or  otherwise raise servicemembers\u2019 awareness of sexual assault matters. In  such instances, program officials told us that they had to find creative  ways to implement the programs. One Army SARC told us that because of  limited funding she could not bring in any outside speakers during Sexual  Assault Awareness Month and had to rely on donations from units to print  posters advertising the program. Similarly, SARCs we met with in the Navy  and Marine Corps told us that they had only limited resources to train  servicemembers. In the Coast Guard, program officials told us that they  were expected to comply with the Coast Guard\u2019s instruction to provide  training to victim support personnel and servicemembers. However, they  were not provided with funding and did not know how they were going to  meet the new requirements. Program coordinators who are not provided  sufficient funding by their commands cannot ensure that their program is  appropriately implemented.", "At the installations we visited, we found that commanders have taken  action against alleged sexual assault offenders. In both DOD and the Coast  Guard, commanders are responsible for discipline of misconduct,  including sexual assault, and they have a variety of judicial and  administrative options at their disposal. Commanders\u2019 options are  specified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and the Manual  for Courts-Martial and include (1) trial by courts-martial, (2) nonjudicial  punishment, and (3) administrative actions.

However, DOD\u2019s instruction leaves  to the military services\u2019 discretion whether these positions are filled by  military members, DOD civilian employees, or DOD contractors, and thus  whether SARCs perform their roles as full-time or collateral duties. We  found that the military services are using a variety of models for staffing  the SARC position. For example, at the installations we visited in the  United States, the Army, Navy, and Air Force were using full-time civilian  or contractor employees, while the Marine Corps was using both civilian  and military servicemembers for whom the duty was collateral. At the  installations we visited overseas, we found that the Army assigned this  position to servicemembers as a collateral duty, the Navy assigned it to a  full-time civilian employee, and the Air Force assigned it to  servicemembers as a full-time duty. We found that the time and resources  dedicated to implementing the sexual assault prevention and response  program are more constrained where program coordinator positions are  staffed by servicemembers for whom these duties are collateral. Program  officials with whom we spoke told us that SARCs\u2019 ability to effectively  implement DOD\u2019s program depended on whether they served in full-time  or collateral-duty positions. For example, Army SARCs overseas told us  that in addition to the sexual assault prevention and response program  they are also responsible for supporting the Army\u2019s Equal Opportunity  program, and that when they handled an equal opportunity complaint or  had other mission requirements, those became their full-time job. As a  result, they had less time to support the sexual assault prevention and  response program. DOD has not systematically evaluated its policy for  staffing SARCs; however, without evaluating its policy and the services\u2019  processes for filling the SARC position, DOD is hindered in its ability to  ensure that the SARCs can effectively perform their function in managing  the sexual assault prevention and response program.", "The 13 EAPC positions in the Coast Guard are staffed by full-time federal  civilian employees who are responsible for simultaneously managing  multiple work-life programs, including sexual assault prevention and  response, for a designated geographic region.

As a result, these officials believe they will not be able  to train servicemembers on the Coast Guard\u2019s program, including the new  restricted reporting option, while also providing assistance to victims and  managing other work-life programs.

Specifically, DOD\u2019s instruction requires servicemembers to receive sexual  assault prevention and response training both annually and prior to  deploying to locations outside of the United States.

Such  servicemembers incur the risks of not knowing how to mitigate the  possibility of being sexually assaulted or how to seek assistance if needed,  or risk reporting the assault in a way that limits their option to seek  treatment while maintaining confidentiality. In some instances, we found  that these servicemembers were aware that the training was required  annually, but had not attended or received training within the preceding 12  months. For example, a junior officer at a Marine Corps installation told us  that he had last received the required training 2 years earlier while  stationed overseas, when the Marine Corps\u2019 program was initially rolled  out. He said that he had not received any subsequent training because he  had likely \u201cslipped through the cracks.\u201d As another example, a junior  enlisted servicemember at an Army installation told us that he had not  received the required training within the preceding 12 months because he  was on temporary duty assignment when his unit conducted the training.  In other cases, we found that servicemembers were not familiar with the  programs or had never received the required training. Program officials at  the installations we visited told us that they face challenges in ensuring  that all servicemembers receive the required training. For example, a  SARC at an Army installation told us that while she informally tracks  information on whether units have received required annual sexual assault  prevention and response training, she has no way of knowing how many  servicemembers within a unit have received it.

Similarly, a voluntary nonprobability survey conducted  by the Naval Inspector General in 2004 through early 2005 determined that  57 percent of victims who were sexually assaulted at some point in their  Navy career did not report the incident. Further, the Army noted as part  of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2007 annual report that recent Army survey data,  which are not generalizable, indicate that as many as 70 percent of female  soldiers who said they had experienced a sexual assault within the  previous 12 months had not reported the incident.", "While the survey results suggest a disparity between the actual number of  sexual assault incidents and the number of those reported, this is largely  an expected result of anonymous surveys. Whereas formal reports,  whether restricted or unrestricted, involve some level of personal  identification and therefore a certain amount of risk on the part of the  victim, the risks and incentives for servicemembers making anonymous  reports are very different. Hence, anonymous survey results tend to  produce higher numbers of reported incidents. Another factor obscuring  the visibility that DOD and Coast Guard officials can have over the  incidence of sexual assault is the fact that many of the individuals to  whom the assaults may be reported, including clergy and civilian victim  care organizations, civilian friends, or family, are not required to disclose  these incidents. As a result, while DOD and the Coast Guard strive to  capture an accurate picture of the incidence of sexual assault, their ability  is necessarily limited.", "Our survey data revealed a number of reasons why servicemembers who  experienced a sexual assault during the preceding 12 months did not  report the incident.

Survey respondents also  commented that they would not report a sexual assault because of  concern about being disciplined for collateral misconduct, such as  drinking when not permitted to do so; not knowing to whom to make a  report; concern that a restricted report would not remain confidential; the  belief that an incident was not serious enough to report; or concern that  reporting an incident would negatively impact their career or unit morale.

Further, each installation\u2019s Fleet and Family Support  Center conducts accreditation visits every 3 years to provide quality  assurance and identify and resolve potential problems. For example, they  have found that some servicemembers may not be aware of the reporting  options and, in the past, some commands had not supported the program.  While the Navy has not yet developed a database to track sexual assault  incident data, program officials told us they plan to do so before the end of  fiscal year 2008.", "Commanders in the Marine Corps use commanders\u2019 protocols for  responding to allegations of sexual assault to ensure they are  accomplishing the intent of the program without overlooking any aspects.  Further, the Marine Corps uses its Automated Inspection Reporting  System to assess management and administration of the program at the  installation level.", "Program officials in the Air Force told us they rely on SARCs to  proactively provide feedback about the program through their chain of  command and during monthly teleconferences. While Air Force officials  acknowledge that they have not conducted either official or formal  institutional reviews or assessments of the Air Force\u2019s program, they have  asked the Air Force\u2019s Inspector General to review its first responder  training and other aspects of the program to ensure compliance with  DOD\u2019s policy.

Our prior work has demonstrated the importance of outcome- oriented performance measures to successful program oversight and  shown that having an effective plan for implementing initiatives and  measuring progress can help decision makers determine whether  initiatives are achieving their desired results. DOD has not established an  oversight framework because it has not established a comprehensive plan  that includes such things as clear objectives, milestones, performance  measures, and criteria for measuring progress, nor has it established  evaluative performance measures with clearly defined data elements with  which to analyze sexual assault incident data. Because DOD\u2019s sexual  assault prevention and response program lacks an oversight framework,  its program, as currently implemented, does not provide decision makers  with the information they need to evaluate the effectiveness of the  program, determine the extent to which the program is helping to prevent  sexual assault from occurring, or ensure that servicemembers who are  victims of sexual assault receive the care they need.", "As discussed above, DOD\u2019s directive assigns oversight responsibility to  DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. However, this  office has yet to establish metrics to facilitate program evaluation and  assess effectiveness. For example, it has not developed specific metrics to:    determine the frequency with which victims were precluded from making  a confidential report using the restricted reporting option or reasons that  precluded them from doing so; or  track information on whether units have received required annual sexual  assault prevention and response training, including how many  servicemembers within a unit have received the training.", "Additionally, DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office has  yet to establish performance goals\u2014for example, a goal specifying the  percentage of servicemembers within a unit who should receive required  training. In the absence of such measures, Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office officials told us that they currently determine the  effectiveness of DOD\u2019s program based on how well the military services  are complying with program implementation requirements identified by  DOD. While they acknowledged that to date their focus has been on  program implementation as opposed to program evaluation, these officials  noted that the Sexual Assault Advisory Council is in the initial stages of  developing performance measures and evaluation criteria to assess  program performance and identify conditions needing attention. Presently,  DOD is working with the military services to develop guidelines to permit,  among other uses, consistent assessment of program implementation  during site visits conducted by DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office as well as by the military services at other times.  However, time frames for developing and implementing these measures  have not yet been established, and without such a plan and evaluative  measures, the program does not provide decision makers with the  information they need to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the  military services\u2019 efforts.", "Without an oversight framework to guide program implementation, DOD  risks that the military services will not collect all of the information  needed to provide insight into the effectiveness of their programs. For  example, officials have recognized that they will need additional data on  sexual assault incidents both for purposes of oversight and to respond  effectively to congressional inquiries as the program matures. However,  the military services have encountered challenges in providing requested  data because the request came after the start of the collection period. For  example, with the exception of the Army, none of the military services was  able to provide data as part of the fiscal year 2007 annual report to  Congress on sexual assaults involving civilian victims, such as contractors  and government employees.

Although the  Coast Guard recently revised its instruction to incorporate a restricted  reporting option and to generally mirror DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention  and response program, according to Coast Guard officials their focus to  date has been on program implementation as opposed to program  evaluation. Like DOD, the Coast Guard has not developed an oversight  framework that includes clear objectives, milestones, performance  measures, and criteria for measuring progress, nor has the Coast Guard  developed performance measures to assess its program. Coast Guard  program officials told us that they plan to conduct reviews of their  program for compliance and quality in the future and will continue to  review reported incident data, and they plan to leverage any metrics  developed by DOD to assess their program. Further, the Coast Guard  Investigative Service has begun to conduct limited trend analysis on  reported incidents, including the extent to which alcohol or drugs were  involved in alleged sexual assaults.

The  Coast Guard shares aggregate reported data with DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Office. However, DOD does not include these  data in its annual report and the Coast Guard does not provide these  incident data to Congress because neither is required to do so. As a result,  Congress does not have visibility over the extent to which sexual assaults  involving Coast Guard members occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Data Reported to Congress Could Be Misinterpreted", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress may not effectively characterize  incidents of sexual assault in the military services because the department  has not clearly articulated a consistent methodology for reporting  incidents, and because the means of presentation for some of the data  does not facilitate comparison. DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress include  data on the total number of restricted and unrestricted reported incidents  of sexual assault; however, meaningful comparisons of the data cannot be  made because the respective offices that provide the data to DOD measure  incidents of sexual assault differently. For example, in the military  services, SARCs, who focus on victim care, report data on the number of  sexual assault incidents alleged using the restricted reporting option based  on the number of victims involved. In contrast, the criminal investigative  organizations, which report data on the number of sexual assault incidents  alleged using the unrestricted reporting option, report data on a per  \u201cincident\u201d basis, which may include multiple victims or alleged offenders.  Thus, the lack of a common means of presentation for reporting purposes  has prevented users of the reports from making meaningful comparisons  or drawing conclusions from the reported numbers.", "Further, while we identified some improvements in the fiscal year 2007  report in the way DOD discusses some data, DOD\u2019s annual report lacks  certain data that we believe would facilitate congressional oversight or  understanding of victims\u2019 use of the reporting options. For example, while  DOD\u2019s annual report provides Congress with the aggregate numbers of  investigations during the prior year for which commanders did not take  action against alleged offenders, those aggregated numbers do not  distinguish between cases in which evidence was found to be insufficient  to substantiate an alleged assault versus the number of times a victim  recanted an accusation or an alleged offender died. Also, though DOD\u2019s  annual report documents the number of reports that were initially brought  using the restricted reporting option and later changed to unrestricted,  DOD\u2019s annual report includes these same figures in both categories\u2014that  is, the total number of restricted reports and the total number of  unrestricted reports. An official in DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office told us that because the military services do not provide  detailed case data to DOD, the department is not able to remove these  reports from the total number of restricted reports when providing  information in its annual report. However, we believe that double listing  the figures is confusing.", "Also, while DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office has  collected and reported incident data since calendar year 2004, the  department lacks a baseline for conducting trend analysis over time  because of changes in the way data are reported. Comparisons among data  reported during calendar years 2005 and 2006 are difficult to make  because the restricted reporting option was not available during the  entirety of calendar year 2005. Significantly, direct comparisons cannot be  made between fiscal year 2007 and prior years because of inconsistencies  in the reporting periods. For example, changes to sections of the UCMJ  dealing with sexual assault that took effect on October 1, 2007, led DOD to  change the period of data collection from calendar year to fiscal year.  Consequently, incident data reported in DOD\u2019s calendar year 2006 annual  report to Congress overlap with data reported in its fiscal year 2007 annual  report for the months of October, November, and December 2006.  However, because the military services provide incident data to DOD that  are aggregated for each service, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response  Office officials told us they cannot adjust the calendar year data to a fiscal  year basis to facilitate trend analysis. Officials noted that each military  service would need to manually adjust previously reported calendar year  data to a fiscal year basis, and such an undertaking would be time  intensive. Moreover, a Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office  official told us that these changes, which led DOD to revise the standard  definition of sexual assault, will also prevent comparisons between fiscal  year 2007 data and data in future years, except in general terms.  Consequently, the way in which sexual assault incident data are collected  and reported will change in the fiscal year 2008 annual report to Congress  and, until investigations of sexual assault incidents reported prior to fiscal  year 2008 are completed, both DOD\u2019s original and revised standard  definitions of sexual assault will be in use. Finally, DOD has not conducted  its own analysis of the information contained in the military services\u2019  annual reports or provided its assessment of their programs prior to  forwarding these reports to Congress, in part because it is not explicitly  required to include this type of assessment in its annual report. Without a  firm baseline and consistent data collection, DOD will not be able to  conduct trend analysis over time that provides insight into incident data  collected, except in the most general terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Access to Data to Conduct Comprehensive Cross- Service Analysis Over Time", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office is not able to  conduct comprehensive cross-service trend analysis of sexual assault  incidents because it does not have access to installation- or case-level data  that would facilitate such analyses. DOD officials told us that the military  services do not provide installation- or case-level incident data beyond  those that are aggregated at the military-service level. These data are  generally limited to information needed to meet statutory requirements for  inclusion in the annual report to Congress. Service officials told us they do  not want to provide installation- or case-level data to DOD because they  are concerned that (1) data may be misinterpreted, (2) even nonidentifying  data about the victim may erode victim confidentiality, and (3)  servicemembers may not report sexual assaults if case-level data are  shared beyond the service-level. However, without access to such  information, DOD does not have the means to identify those factors, and  thus to fully execute its oversight role, including assessing trends over  time. For example, without case-level data, DOD cannot determine the  frequency with which sexual assaults are reported in each of the  geographic combatant commands. Since 2004, DOD has required the Joint  Staff to provide periodic information on sexual assaults reported in the  U.S. Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility because of the significant  impact sexual assault has on mission readiness. However, DOD does not  know the rate of reported sexual assault incidents in U.S. Central  Command\u2019s area of responsibility as compared with the rate in other  geographic combatant commands, because the department does not  require the Joint Staff to provide such information.", "Furthermore, installation- and case-level data may be useful to identify  installations that over periods of time continue to have high rates of  reported alleged sexual assault incidents as a percentage of the total  population. For example, in analyzing the services\u2019 installation-level data  we identified, for one of the military services, three installations with  higher reporting rates for sexual assaults than other installations.  Continuation of such trends at these installations over time could indicate  best practices, such as supportive command climates, that encourage  victims to report sexual assaults. Conversely, such trends may identify  installations or units where additional training and resources to prevent  sexual assaults may be needed. Such information, if available, could better  inform decisions by officials in DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office to select installations within each service to visit for  program assessments and identify factors to consider when making  programmatic corrections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressionally Directed Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services Has Not Yet Begun Its Review", "paragraphs": ["To provide further oversight of DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention and  response program, the Ronald W.

We also reviewed  the results of surveys conducted by DOD and the military services since  2004. In reviewing the survey documentation provided by the Defense  Manpower Data Center and the Army and the Navy, we found these data  were sufficiently reliable and we present these survey results to illustrate  that multiple survey research sources indicate that there may be  underreporting by those who experience sexual assaults.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and the Coast Guard exercise  oversight over reports of sexual assault involving servicemembers, we  interviewed key officials with DOD\u2019s and the military services\u2019 respective  Sexual Assault Prevention and Response offices and the Coast Guard\u2019s  Office of Work Life to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the  processes, procedures, and controls used for monitoring and overseeing  the programs. We also interviewed representatives of the Defense Task  Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services, which is statutorily  required to undertake an examination of sexual assault matters in the  Armed Forces, to discuss the task force\u2019s progress. We reviewed various  pertinent documents, including meeting minutes for DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault  Advisory Council, federal internal control standards, and prior GAO  reports on the use of performance measures to evaluate programmatic  efforts. We also reviewed reports issued by the services\u2019 inspector  generals and examined DOD\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s responses to  recommendations from prior related studies. In addition, we analyzed  installation-level data for reported sexual assaults in both DOD and the  Coast Guard for fiscal year 2007.", "To obtain servicemembers\u2019 perspectives on issues regarding sexual assault  prevention and response programs in DOD and the Coast Guard, we  administered a total of 3,750 confidential surveys to a nonprobability  sample of randomly selected servicemembers and conducted more than  150 one-on-one, structured interviews with randomly selected  servicemembers at 14 of the 15 locations we visited. In the United States,  the locations we visited included Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; Fort  Bliss, Texas; Fort Drum, New York; Integrated Support Command  Portsmouth, Virginia; Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; Marine Corps Base  Quantico, Virginia; and Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. Overseas, the  locations we visited included Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar; Balad Air Base,  Iraq; Camp Arifjan, Kuwait; Camp As Saliyah, Qatar; Camp Ramadi, Iraq;  Camp Stryker, Iraq; Logistics Support Area Anaconda, Iraq; and Naval  Support Activity, Bahrain. We did not administer our survey or conduct  one-on-one structured interviews at Camp As Saliyah at the request of the  Army because many of the servicemembers stationed there are on rest and  relaxation tours during their overseas deployment. Of the 3,750  confidential surveys we administered, 711 surveys were administered in  Iraq; 852 in Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain collectively; and 2,187 at locations  across the United States. We considered conducting surveys of  servicemembers using probability samples that would allow generalizing  the results to all servicemembers at each installation we visited. However,  because of the difficulties in identifying accurate and complete lists of  servicemembers present at an installation as of a specific date from which  to draw samples, particularly for installations outside the United States,  and the administrative burden it would have placed on the installation  commands, we did not pursue this. Instead, we conducted nonprobability  surveys with randomly selected servicemembers to reflect all ranks and  both men and women at 14 of the 15 installations we visited. Table 7  provides information on the number of servicemembers we surveyed at  each location.", "To select the participants for our surveys and one-on-one structured  interviews, we requested that the locations we visited provide us with a  list of available personnel. To the extent possible, we requested that this  list not include personnel who were deployed, on temporary duty status,  or otherwise not available to attend our survey sessions at the time of our  visit. From the lists provided we randomly selected participants based on  gender and rank. Participants were categorized according to the following  ranks: junior enlisted (encompassing the ranks of E1-E4); mid-enlisted  (encompassing the ranks of E5-E6); senior enlisted (encompassing the  ranks of E7-E9); warrant officers and company grade officers  (encompassing the ranks of W1-W5 and O1-O3); and field grade officers  (encompassing the ranks of O4-O6).", "To ensure maximum participation by selected servicemembers, we  provided the locations we visited with lists of primary and alternate  selections for both the survey sessions and one-on-one structured  interviews. Because of the sensitivity of the information we were seeking,  we took several steps to help assure a confidential environment during our  survey sessions. First, we did not document the names of participants in  any of our sessions. Further, we surveyed participants separately based on  rank and gender; for instance, junior enlisted men were surveyed  separately, as were junior enlisted women. We used this same approach  for mid- and senior enlisted servicemembers; warrant and company grade  officers; and field grade officers. Finally, we had male GAO analysts survey  male servicemembers and female GAO analysts survey female  servicemembers. Similarly, in an attempt to encourage an open discussion  during our one-on-one structured interviews, but still protect the  confidentiality of the servicemembers, we did not document their names.  Because we did not select survey and interview participants using a  statistically representative sampling method, our survey results and the  comments provided during our interview sessions are nongeneralizable  and therefore cannot be projected across DOD, a service, or any single  installation we visited. However, the survey results and comments provide  insight into the command climate and implementation of sexual assault  prevention and response program at each location at the time of our visit.", "To develop our survey questions, we reviewed several DOD surveys and  studies of issues such as command climate and sexual harassment and  sexual assault in the military. We also reviewed the military services\u2019 and  the Coast Guard\u2019s policies and training materials for programs to prevent  and respond to incidents of sexual assault. Because the scope of our  review included focusing on military installations in the United States and  the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, we developed two survey  questionnaires\u2014the first focusing on the perspective of a servicemember  stationed in the United States (see app. VI) and the second on that of a  servicemember deployed outside the United States (see app. VII). We  worked with social science survey specialists to develop our survey  questionnaires. Because these were not sample surveys, there are no  sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.  For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or how the data  are entered into a database can introduce unwanted variability into the  survey results. We took steps in the development of the questionnaires, the  data collection, and data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors.  For example, prior to administering the survey, we pretested the content  and format of the questionnaire with servicemembers at Marine Corps  Base Quantico, Virginia and Fort Meade, Maryland to determine whether  (1) the survey questions were clear, (2) the terms used were precise, (3)  respondents were able to provide the information we were seeking, and  (4) the questions were unbiased. We made changes to the content and  format of our final questionnaires based on the results of our pretesting.", "We administered our surveys and conducted our one-on-one structured  interviews at the locations we visited between September 2007 and March  2008. Because our surveys and questions asked participants to consider  the frequency with which some things, such as training, have occurred  over the past 12 months, participants\u2019 responses may cover the period  between September 2006 and March 2008.", "We visited or contacted the following organizations during our review:    Defense Manpower Data Center, Arlington, Virginia    Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services, Alexandria,    Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness    Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Plans, Washington,  D.C.

The Coast Guard collects similar data, but  does not report these data to Congress because it is not statutorily  required to do so. Servicemembers on active duty in DOD may report an  alleged sexual assault using either the unrestricted or restricted reporting  options. As previously discussed, an unrestricted report of an alleged  sexual assault incident is provided to the chain of command or law  enforcement for investigation. The military criminal investigative  organizations within each military service and the Coast Guard are  responsible for investigating crimes, including sexual assaults in which  servicemembers are either alleged offender(s) or victim(s) and for  documenting case data including information on alleged offenders and  victims and the disposition of cases. A restricted report is a confidential  report of an alleged sexual assault that can be made without initiating an  investigation or notifying the chain of command. Within DOD, a restricted  report may be made to either a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator  (SARC) or a victim advocate at an installation; within the Coast Guard, a  restricted report may be made to the Employee Assistance Program  Coordinator (EAPC) or victim support person; and within both DOD and  the Coast Guard a restricted report may also be made to medical  personnel.

The  SARC in DOD or the EAPC in the Coast Guard generally collects limited  data about the alleged victim and the alleged incident because the purpose  of the restricted reporting option is to provide assistance to victims rather  than collect incident-related statistics.
