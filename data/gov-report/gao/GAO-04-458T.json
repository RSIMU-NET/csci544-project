The anthrax incidents in the fall of 2001, the SARS  outbreak in 2002-2003, and the recent incidents involving ricin have raised  concerns about the nation\u2019s ability to respond to a major public health  threat, whether naturally occurring or the result of bioterrorism. The  anthrax incidents strained the public health system, including surveillance  and laboratory capacities as well as the workforce, at the state and local  levels. The SARS outbreak highlighted the challenges in responding to  new and emerging infectious disease\u2014especially when the ability to  identify the disease and a vaccine for preventing it are lacking. The  current influenza season has heightened concerns about our nation\u2019s  ability to handle a pandemic. The Congress has recognized the need to  strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to respond to such threats and has  increased appropriations for federal, state, and local public health  preparedness efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) has been developing a national plan for responding to an influenza  pandemic.", "As you requested, to assist the Committee in its consideration of our  nation\u2019s ability to respond to a major public health threat, whether  naturally occurring or the result of bioterrorism, my remarks today will  focus on (1) state and local preparedness for responding to major public  health threats and (2) federal and state efforts to prepare for an influenza  pandemic.", "My testimony today updates testimony that we provided to you in April  2003 and is based largely on work we conducted for our recently released  report on HHS\u2019s programs that support state and local preparedness for  bioterrorism and other public health threats. For that report, we reviewed  each state\u2019s progress report on the use of bioterrorism preparedness  funding distributed in 2002 by HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) and Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA). The progress reports covered the period through August 30, 2003,  for CDC\u2019s program and through July 1, 2003, for HRSA\u2019s program. For that  report we also interviewed officials from 10 states, 1 local health  department within each of these states, and 2 major metropolitan areas  directly funded by CDC and HRSA. My testimony today also updates  information provided in our October 2000 report on federal and state  planning for an influenza pandemic. To update that information, in  February 2004, we spoke with officials from CDC and HHS\u2019s National  Vaccine Program Office. We conducted our work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, although states have further developed many important  aspects of public health preparedness, since I testified before you in April  2003, no state is fully prepared to respond to a major public health threat.  States have improved their disease surveillance systems, laboratory  capacity, communication capacity, and workforce needed to respond to  public health threats, but gaps in each remain. Moreover, regional planning  between states is lacking, and many states lack surge capacity\u2014the  capacity to evaluate, diagnose, and treat the large numbers of patients that  would present during a public health emergency.

As a public health emergency develops, each plays a critical role in an  effective response. Local and state health departments collect and monitor  data, such as reports from clinicians, for disease trends and evidence of an  outbreak. Laboratory personnel test clinical and environmental samples  for possible exposures and identification of illnesses. Epidemiologists in  the health departments use disease surveillance systems to detect clusters  of suspicious symptoms or diseases in order to facilitate early detection of  disease and treatment of victims. Public health officials provide needed  information to the clinical community, other responders, and the public  and implement control measures to prevent additional cases from  occurring. Health care providers treat patients and limit the spread of  infectious disease. All these response activities require a workforce that is  sufficiently skilled and adequate in number.", "The federal government provides funding and resources to state and local  entities to support preparedness and response efforts. For example, in  fiscal year 2002 CDC\u2019s Public Health Preparedness and Response for  Bioterrorism cooperative agreement program provided approximately  $918 million to states to improve bioterrorism preparedness and response  as well as other public health emergency preparedness capacities.  Similarly, HRSA\u2019s Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness cooperative  agreement program provided approximately $125 million to states in fiscal  year 2002 to enhance the capacity of hospitals and associated health care  entities to respond to bioterrorist attacks. HHS renewed these cooperative  agreements for the period of August 31, 2003 through August 30, 2004. For  these renewed agreements, CDC\u2019s program and HRSA\u2019s program  distributed about $870 million and about $498 million, respectively. Among  the other resources that the federal government provides is the Strategic  National Stockpile, which contains pharmaceuticals and medical supplies  that can be delivered to the site of a public health emergency anywhere in  the United States within 12 hours of the decision to deploy them.", "The federal government also supports preparedness efforts for an  influenza pandemic. HHS\u2019s National Vaccine Program Office is responsible  for the development of federal plans for vaccine and immunization  activities and coordinating these efforts among federal agencies. To foster  state and local planning, HHS issued interim planning guidance for the  states in 1997 that outlined general federal and state responsibilities during  an influenza pandemic. HHS expects that if a pandemic occurs, both the  vaccines that are used to prevent influenza and the antiviral drugs that are  used to treat influenza will be in short supply. The guidance discussed  certain key issues related to limited supplies of the influenza vaccine and  antiviral drugs\u2014for instance the amount of vaccine and antiviral drugs  that will be purchased at the federal level; the division of responsibility  between the public and private sectors for the purchase, distribution, and  administration of these supplies during a pandemic; and priorities for  vaccinating population groups, such as health workers and public health  personnel involved in the pandemic response, and persons traditionally  considered to be at increased risk of severe influenza illness and mortality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Have Further Developed Important Aspects of Public Health Preparedness, but Additional Work Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["States reported that as of the summer of 2003 they have made  improvements in their preparedness to respond to major public health  threats, but no aspect of preparedness has been fully addressed by all of  the states.

However,  only about half of the states reported that they have at least one public  health laboratory within the state that has the appropriate instrumentation  and appropriately trained staff to conduct certain tests for rapidly  detecting and correctly identifying biological agents. About half of the  states reported that they had a facility with a biosafety level sufficient to  handle such agents as anthrax.

However, most states continue to have  staffing concerns. As we have reported previously, some state and local  health officials have had difficulty finding and hiring epidemiologists and  laboratory personnel.

According to  HHS officials, as of February 2004, 15 states have final or draft plans, and  34 states are actively working on plans. In these plans, states have had to  make assumptions about what the federal role during an influenza  pandemic will be. It is still unclear whether the private sector, the public  sector, or both will have responsibility for purchasing and distributing  vaccines and antiviral drugs.
