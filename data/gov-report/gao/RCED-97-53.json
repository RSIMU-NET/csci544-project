In 1996, for example, almost 50,000 wildfires on national forest lands burned over 1.1 million acres. The aforementioned phenomena have contributed to the amount of salvage timber on the national forest system\u2019s lands.", "Since fiscal year 1977, the Forest Service has annually offered for sale about 1.6 billion board feet of salvage timber. Over this same 20-year period, however, the range of salvage timber offered varied from a low of 762 million board feet in fiscal year 1977, when the Forest Service first funded salvage sales, to a high of almost 2.9 billion board feet in fiscal year 1990 (see app. I). However, notwithstanding these efforts over the last 20 years, the Forest Service estimates that the national forests still contain about 13 billion board feet of salvage timber. While some of the salvage timber is inaccessible or too deteriorated to be of commercial value, much of it is marketable. Selling such timber can lessen the danger from future fires, improve the health of forests, and provide mills with a supply of timber. However, time is critical when selling salvage timber because it can deteriorate rapidly, thus making the harvest of such timber economically unfeasible.", "To reduce the amount of salvage timber on national forest lands, the Congress established the emergency salvage program\u2014referred to as the salvage rider\u2014as part of the rescissions act of July 27, 1995. The salvage rider contained a number of provisions that were intended to increase the volume of salvage timber that the Forest Service offered for sale during the emergency period\u2014July 27, 1995, to December 31, 1996. To increase the volume of salvage timber offered, the provisions in the salvage rider, among other things, exempted salvage sales from administrative appeals, limited the time available for the judicial review of salvage sales, eased the environmental procedures for planning and preparing salvage sales, and allowed rehiring retired employees without penalty.

The Forest Service does not know whether the volume of available salvage timber increased or decreased during the emergency period, because additional insect and fire damage continued to destroy green timber, while other timber was being lost to deterioration.

For example, officials at the Clearwater National Forest said that exempting salvage sales from appeal could speed up the forest\u2019s preparation for a salvage timber sale in two ways. First, the time between making the decision to proceed with a salvage sale and offering the sale would be reduced. Second, the salvage sale would not be submitted to a rigorous appeals resolution process that requires that national forest staff respond to comments, prepare transmittal letters, coordinate with forest management, and meet with the appellant.", "On the other hand, officials from three of the four national forests said they found the appeals process to be beneficial to them in that it provided them with a forum for resolving environmental issues, thereby reducing the potential for legal challenges and costly delays in awarding the salvage sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Legal Challenges Made to Salvage Sales", "paragraphs": ["The salvage rider provided an expedited judicial review process for those salvage sales for which legal challenges were received.

However, none of the four forests we visited had any legal challenges in fiscal years 1994 or 1995, nor did three of the four forests have legal challenges during fiscal year 1996. Of the 49 salvage sales offered by the four forests in fiscal year 1996, only 4 sales had legal challenges. Three of the four sales were at the Payette National Forest. The remaining sale was on both the Payette and the Boise National Forest. The Boise National Forest assumed the responsibility for resolving the legal challenge on this sale.", "The district court judge reviewing the legal challenges upheld the Forest Service\u2019s salvage sale decisions on each of the four salvage sales.

However, the forests continued to prepare separate documents and then combined them with a staple or clip. Officials from the four national forests said that preparing separate environmental assessments and biological evaluations was more efficient because it required less work, saved time, and resulted in less information to read and comprehend. In addition, Payette National Forest officials said that by keeping the environmental assessments and biological evaluations separate, they could plan and prepare their salvage sales faster. In fact, officials from the Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the regulatory agencies that assesses the environmental impacts of salvage sales, told Payette National Forest officials that they preferred separate documents.

Since 1992, the Forest Service made a concerted effort to reduce its work force because of the drastic reduction in the volume of green timber that was to be offered for sale. As a result, a significant number of employees with the skills needed to plan and prepare timber sales left the Forest Service. Consequently, when the salvage rider was enacted, the Forest Service needed people with the specialized skills to plan and prepare the environmental documents and contracts for the sale, mark the salvage timber to be sold, lay out the roads to the harvest sites, and administer the sales contracts.", "In a memorandum to the regional foresters, a headquarters official stated that between 300 and 350 former staff who had the specialized skills to plan and prepare salvage sales would be needed to implement the emergency salvage program but that it would be unlikely to find contract personnel with the required skills as quickly as needed. In response, national forest officials identified the number of skilled people needed to plan and prepare their salvage sales and surveyed retired Forest Service employees to determine their interest in returning to Forest Service employment. However, the response from retired employees was generally negative because they did not want to return to work or had taken other employment. Nationwide, only a total of 10 former employees were hired.", "At the four forests we visited, only one former employee was hired\u2014at the Stanislaus National Forest. Three of the four forests hired a total of seven private contractors\u2014four at the Stanislaus, two at the Clearwater, and one at the Deschutes. The Forest Service did not have information on the number of private contractors used to help plan, prepare, and offer the salvage sales nationwide.", "Officials from two of the three national forests that had hired private contractors told us that the use of contractors helped their forests to expedite the sale of salvage timber under the emergency salvage program. The officials said that the use of contractors permitted Forest Service employees to perform other duties and accomplish other tasks and that the contractors filled skill positions for which the forests had limited in-house expertise. According to these officials, the contractors performed such tasks as preparing fuel treatment plans, marking and measuring salvage timber sale units, and helping prepare environmental assessment documents and cultural resource studies.
