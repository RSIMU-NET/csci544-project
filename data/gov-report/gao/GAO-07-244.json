The Service has been challenged by recent fuel price fluctuations, and the Postmaster General stated that gas prices were a primary reason for the proposed 2007 postal rate adjustment. Based on this challenge, Congress asked GAO to review (1) how the Service's fuel costs changed recently and the impact of these cost changes on the Service's financial and operating conditions, and (2) how the Service's actions to control fuel costs and mitigate risk compare to leading practices and federal requirements. GAO collected fuel cost and price information; interviewed Service fuel officials; and compared the Service's actions against leading practices and federal requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Service's transportation and facility fuel costs have grown in recent years as fuel prices, particularly for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel have increased. For example, fuel cost growth for its vehicle fleet was due to rising prices rather than consumption. While fuel costs have directly pressured its financial condition, increasing compensation and benefits were the primary driver of the $3.4 billion operating expense increase in fiscal year 2006. The Service absorbed fuel cost increases through costcontainment efforts and increased revenues from the January 2006 rate increase, allowing it to achieve net income for the year. Nevertheless, the Service remains vulnerable to fuel price fluctuations, due in part to its purchasing process, which involves buying fuel as needed, often at retail locations. The Service is challenged to control fuel costs due to its expanding delivery network and inability to use surcharges. GAO found some of the Service's actions to control fuel costs to be generally consistent with procurement and consumption practices advocated by leading organizations and federal requirements for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles. However, GAO also identified areas where more actions could be taken. Taking actions to address data inconsistencies will be important, even as the Service develops a new energy strategy. These inconsistencies will limit the Service's ability to understand consumption changes and impacts and where to target potential cost-saving opportunities. Furthermore, additional progress is needed in reducing reliance on petroleum-based fuels because of the more stringent federal fuel consumption requirements that were recently passed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service (the Service) delivered over 213 billion pieces of  mail to over 146 million delivery points in 2006. Almost $72 billion was  spent in providing these and other postal services required as part of  meeting its universal service mandate. The Service is one of the major  users of fuel in the federal government, spending over $2.3 billion on  transportation and facility-related fuel in 2006. Its vehicle fleet of over  216,000 vehicles is the largest civilian fleet and consumed over 123 million  gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel. The Service also incurs fuel expenses  as part of its mail delivery and transportation contracts with highway  trucking companies and air carriers. Another area where the Service  incurs fuel expenses is in heating and operating the over 34,000 facilities it  occupies. The Service relies primarily on electricity, natural gas, and  heating oil for these operations. The Service is also subject to certain  federal energy conservation requirements as part of the Energy Policy Acts  of 1992 and 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 1992) required  federal agencies to increase their purchase of alternative fuel vehicles  (AFV), and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) details  requirements for federal fleets to use alternative fuels in these AFVs.  EPAct 2005 also requires agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, to  install meter systems at federal buildings to track energy consumption.", "Prices for fuels such as gasoline and diesel spiked in late 2005 due to  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and gradually increased until September 2006  when prices began to fall. These fuel price fluctuations have greatly  affected fuel costs for public and private organizations. Unlike its private- industry counterparts, however, the Service is unable to make offsetting  surcharges for rising fuel prices as part of its postal rates and fees. The  Service continues to identify fuel price fluctuations as one of its major  challenges. The Postmaster General stated that gas prices were a primary  reason for the proposed 2007 omnibus rate adjustment. Furthermore, the  Service has recently stated that a 1-percent increase in fuel and natural gas  costs would result in an, on average, $48 million increase in expenses.  Although the Service has taken actions to help address this challenge, it  continues to state that rising fuel costs are a serious concern and that fuel  cost increases are driving transportation cost increases, which  cumulatively grew by about $745 million over the last 2 years.", "In recent years, we have reported and testified on the overall significant  financial and operational challenges facing the Service. In 2001 we placed  the Service\u2019s transformation and long-term outlook on our high-risk list,  due in part to difficulties it had in controlling costs. The Service has made  progress since that time by improving productivity, achieving record net  incomes, and downsizing its workforce. Additional progress was also  made when Congress enacted comprehensive postal reform legislation in  December 2006, which provides a framework for modernizing the  Service\u2019s rate-setting processes and addresses the Service\u2019s long-term  financial obligations. Thus, in January 2007 we removed the Service\u2019s  transformation and long-term outlook from our high-risk list. Major  challenges continue to exist, however, that will require close monitoring in  the future. These challenges include generating sufficient revenues as  First-Class Mail volume declines and the changing mail mix provides less  revenue contribution; controlling costs as compensation and benefit costs  rise; and providing reliable data to assess performance.", "Based on the challenges facing the Service, you asked us to review (1)  how the Service\u2019s fuel costs changed recently and the impact of these cost  changes on the Service\u2019s financial and operating conditions and (2) how  the Service\u2019s actions to control fuel costs and mitigate risk compare to  leading practices and federal requirements.", "To describe changes in the Service\u2019s fuel costs and the impact of these  changes, we collected data on the Service\u2019s transportation and facility- related fuel costs and cost-saving initiatives, as well as fuel price  information from the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information  Administration (EIA). The Service was only able to provide cost data for  most fuel categories for 2004, 2005, and 2006. We conducted reliability  tests on this data and found it to be reliable for the purposes of our review.  We also reviewed the Service\u2019s procedures for documenting, measuring,  and reporting cost savings for its purchasing activities as well as the  methodology for specific fuel-related initiatives. For the purposes of this  engagement, the procedures, methodologies, and cost savings data  appeared to be reasonable and contain appropriate levels of review. We  also interviewed various Postal Service officials, including staff from the  Transportation Asset Management (TAM) group which procures  petroleum-based fuels; energy procurement group; vehicle operations and  maintenance; and finance to gather information on how the Service has  been impacted by rising fuel costs. To assess the effectiveness of the  Service\u2019s actions to control fuel costs and mitigate risk, we compared  these actions against practices advocated by leading organizations that  could be applied to the Service\u2019s fuel-related activities. We reviewed  information from a variety of sources including our past work on fuel use  and consumption, as well as from reviews of the purchasing efforts at  various federal agencies and private organizations that were recognized as  acquisition leaders (IBM, ChevronTexaco, Bausch & Lomb, Delta Air  Lines, and Dell). We also reviewed the Energy Policy Acts of 2005 and  1992, particularly the federal requirements and guidance pertaining to  alternative fuel vehicles and facility energy management. We also  interviewed federal officials whose operations focus on fuel use; an expert  on purchasing volatile commodities; as well as various executives and  contractors affiliated with the National Star Route Mail Contractors  Association who represent roughly 17,000 small business men and women  who contract with the Service for the over-the-highway transportation of  the mail. Based on this and other information, we identified key practices  related to (1) purchasing fuel\u2014aggregating purchases to leverage buying  power and size; enhancing organizational structure; utilizing public/private  partnerships; and tracking and monitoring fuel information and (2)  consuming fuel, including reducing reliance and use of petroleum-based  fuels. We also discussed planned actions with the Service\u2019s newly  appointed Executive Director for Energy Initiatives. Appendix I contains a  detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. We requested  comments on a draft of this report from the Service, and its comments,  which are reproduced in appendix II, are discussed later in this report.

Retail Fuel for the Postal-Owned Fleet: The majority of Postal-owned  mail delivery vehicles are fueled primarily at retail fueling stations  nationwide. Purchases are made using a Postal-issued purchasing  card\u2014the Voyager card. Under this program, which is administered  through GSA, a purchase card is assigned to a designated Postal  Service vehicle and can be used at over 200,000 retail locations  throughout the United States. The benefits to using this card, which  will be discussed later, include qualifying for rebates and volume  discounts.  2.  Bulk Fuel for the Postal-Owned Fleet: Postal facilities with fuel storage  tanks can provide on-site fuel for Postal-owned vehicles. Fuel for these  tanks is typically purchased through agreements with the Department  of Defense\u2019s Energy Support Center (DESC). Under these agreements,  DESC aggregates the Service\u2019s fuel requirements with other federal  agencies and then solicits offers from private fuel suppliers. After a  contract is reached between the Service (via DESC) and the private  fuel supplier, the fuel supplier is responsible for delivering fuel to the  Postal fuel tanks.", "The Service also utilizes a limited amount of specialized bulk fuel  contracts and agreements. In typically smaller, more remote locations  where DESC fuel is not available and a fueling tank is located on-site at  a Postal facility, the Service enters into Basic Pricing Agreements  (BPA). The Service enters into a BPA with a fuel supplier to provide  fuel for the on-site Postal tank. The Service spent nearly $800,000 in  BPAs in 2006. Postal contracts are another specialized fueling method,  which are used primarily during peak seasons when demand for postal  services increases beyond normal operating capacities. The Service  spent nearly $1.6 million on these contracts in 2006.  3.  Mobile Refueling for the Service\u2019s Fleet: Mobile refueling is a method  of fuel procurement used to refuel the Service\u2019s internal fleet vehicles  during non-delivery hours and is used primarily in the Southeastern  United States. Mobile refueling occurs on-site at Postal Service  facilities, where its delivery vehicles are filled from mobile bulk tanks  by contractors. A Voyager fuel card is used for these transactions. This  is the most expensive refueling option primarily because of the  additional service requirements.", "Table 2 summarizes fuel expenses for the Postal-owned fleet.", "The Service stated that the majority of its nearly 126,600 rural mail carriers  use their own personal vehicles to carry out their postal responsibilities.  Because these carriers do not operate Postal-owned vehicles, they are not  eligible to use the Voyager fuel card for refueling (the Voyager card system  is used for the over 20,000 Postal-owned vehicles operated by rural mail  carriers). The rural mail carriers not in the Voyager program purchase fuel  for their vehicles at retail fueling locations and then are reimbursed as part  of the contractually agreed upon Equipment Maintenance Allowance  (EMA). In addition to fuel, the EMA also includes certain vehicle  maintenance and repair costs. The most recent EMA was set at $0.52 per  mile for routes over 40 miles long (routes under 40 miles are paid a higher  EMA per mile). In 2006, the Service spent nearly $163 million in fuel on  these rural routes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracted Vehicle Fleet", "paragraphs": ["The Service also utilizes contracted vehicle fleet services to carry out  some of its surface transportation needs. These contractors range from  major trucking companies that provide mail transportation between the  Service\u2019s larger facilities to smaller box contractors who provide home  mail delivery in rural areas.

Again, like the  Postal-owned fleet, Voyager fuel cards are assigned to individual vehicles  and can be used at over 200,000 retail locations throughout the United  States. The Service has aimed to increase the number of highway  contractors using the Voyager fuel card to purchase retail fuel, as the  Service can secure rebates and discounts with a great number of Voyager  card transactions.", "Quarterly Adjustments for the Contracted Vehicle Fleet: The Service  utilizes quarterly adjustments for highway contractors who do not qualify  for the Voyager card program. Contractors may not qualify for the program  due to reasons such as an inability to reasonably estimate the annual  gallons used during a contract or that personal vehicles are used instead of  Postal-owned vehicles. According to Postal Service officials, since these  personal vehicles are not dedicated to Postal transportation, there is no  reliable way to separate out the gallons used for Postal-related work  versus the gallons used for personal travel. Under this adjustment system,  gallon projections are negotiated between the Service and the individual  contractor. The contractor is responsible for the initial fuel payment that  he/she makes at the fuel pump. The Service then reimburses the  contractor for these fuel costs based on an indexing system that adjusts  for changes in fuel prices on a quarterly basis using a Department of  Energy fuel index. Compensation rates are set at the beginning of the  quarter and readjusted every 3 months based on the average price of fuel  at the beginning and the end of the quarter. Highway contractors have  raised concerns about the 3-month lag between adjustments and have  stated that they would prefer a monthly adjustment. The Service is  considering converting to a monthly DOE fuel indexing system to more  accurately reflect actual fuel prices.", "Bulk Fuel for the Contracted Vehicle Fleet: Under the Service\u2019s contracted  bulk fuel purchasing program, the Service acts as a contract administrator  between fuel suppliers and highway contractors who qualify (e.g., they are  required to provide and maintain their own bulk fuel storage tanks). The  Service combines the volume of its contractor bulk purchases and solicits  and awards agreements with fuel suppliers. Fuel suppliers directly bill the  highway contractors for the fuel, and the Service subsequently reimburses  the highway contractors for the fuel used in fulfilling their obligations with  the Service.

A Service official stated  that the various fuel procurement methods in order of cost-effectiveness  are:  1.  Bulk fuel purchased through DESC is the least expensive method  because of DESC\u2019s ability to aggregate purchases, and the fuel is  purchased without any taxes included.  2.  Bulk fuel purchased for the highway contract routes because it is  bought wholesale.  3.  Voyager retail purchases because of the associated volume discounts,  rebates, and state excise tax exemptions.  4.

Largely through the Voyager card program,  which began in 2000, the Service has been able to more effectively apply  its exemption from paying the taxes at the pump and recoup tax payments  where taxes either were inadvertently paid or the tax exemption was not  allowable at the pump according to the applicable state law.", "Highway contractor bulk fuel: Savings are derived in one of two ways: (1)  the savings achieved when getting a contractor into the bulk fuel  program\u2014having them purchase fuel in bulk is less expensive for the  Service compared to purchasing it at retail; and (2) the costs that are  avoided when the Service finds that a highway contractor uses fewer  gallons than what is listed in its contractual agreement\u2014the Service does  not pay for the gallons that are not used, and thus avoids that fuel cost.", "Highway contractor retail: Savings are achieved in one of two ways, the  first of which is through a contract adjustment that occurs when the  Service brings highway contractors into the Voyager card program. Under  the previous system, these contractors claimed gallons as part of their fuel  expense line. The Service claims the gallons that they are no longer paying  for as part of this line item as savings. The second cost containment  strategy is similar to that for the highway contractor bulk fuel program, in  that the Service claims cost avoidance when highway contractors using  the Voyager card use fewer gallons than what was originally estimated in  their contractual agreement.", "Voyager rebates and discounts: The Service is able to achieve cost  reductions in two ways for its Postal-owned vehicle fleet fuel purchases  made using the Voyager card. First, the Service is able to qualify for  rebates from the GSA portfolio of government-sponsored credit cards  through the use of the Voyager card.

In a  2003 report, we noted that leading private-sector organizations reported  saving hundreds of millions of dollars due to leveraging their spending.", "Furthermore, vehicle fleet and facility energy managers from the General  Services Administration and fuel procurement specialists at DESC stated  that aggregating purchases has resulted in better prices and service from  fuel and energy suppliers.", "Enhancing organizational structure: We reported that leading companies  found it necessary to change their business processes, organizational  structure, and employee roles and responsibilities to effectively manage  and coordinate their purchases. Leading organizations provide clear and  strong leadership through such mechanisms as establishing goals and  prioritizing initiatives that will enhance accountability for performance.  We have also reported on the importance of establishing commodity- specific managers. Considering the fluctuations of fuel and utility prices, it  is important to have officials who are consistently monitoring and tracking  the market changes for these goods to make informed purchasing  decisions.", "Use public/private partnerships: We have reported that leading  organizations have found that more cooperative business relationships  with suppliers have improved their ability to respond to changing business  conditions and have led to lower costs. Over 20 years ago, federal  government agencies were encouraged to utilize an alternative source of  funding investments aimed at promoting energy-efficient projects. Under  these projects, a private contractor would identify, design, install, and  finance energy conservation measures in federal buildings in exchange for  a share of the resultant energy cost savings that would be paid back to the  contractor over a set period of time. These alternative funding  mechanisms take advantage of public/private partnerships to provide  incentives for cost savings and reduce energy consumption. These  contracts have been advocated by the President and the Department of  Energy as an effective energy conservation measure, and EPAct 2005  recently extended the authority for these financing mechanisms through  2016.", "Tracking and monitoring: A key principle applied by leading companies is  obtaining improved knowledge on what is being spent by an organization.  This knowledge is gained through the implementation of processes and  systems to collect, maintain, and analyze data. This data would provide the  organization the ability to track and monitor performance over time as  well as to identify cost saving opportunities.

Energy officials at the Service stated that it has advocated the use of these  contracts since 1992 as an effective alternative financing method and  energy conservation program, and that these projects are an investment  aimed at reducing consumption. The savings achieved as a result of these  projects would initially be used to pay back the private entity for the  installation costs\u2014typically over a 10-year period.

This lack of information results in the  Service not having the necessary fuel information to gain a complete  understanding of the extent to which consumption is changing, how  consumption has impacted overall fuel costs, and identify potential  opportunities to reduce consumption. On the transportation side, the  Service has no mechanisms or systems in place to monitor fuel usage,  except for fuel purchases through its Voyager and holiday jet fuel  programs (these purchases combined account for about 35 percent of its  annual transportation-related fuel expenses). For example, the Service  does not have consumption information for its nearly 55,000 delivery  routes served by its rural carriers who use their own personal vehicles.  The Service stated that it estimates fuel usage in some of these instances.  Furthermore, the air transportation contracts pose greater difficulties in  this area because fuel purchases are tied to a contract measure such as  cubic feet or pounds of cargo. These measures are needed to estimate fuel  consumption for the Postal-related cargo because these flights may not be  dedicated to Postal Service transportation. The Service also does not  centrally track the amount of fuel used to heat and operate its nationwide  facility network. For example, the Service currently has metering  equipment at only 25 of its over 34,000 facilities. The Service tracks and  monitors the costs that are paid for its electricity, natural gas, and heating  oil, but does not track consumption amounts.", "The Service has shown that in areas where it tracks and monitors fuel  information, positive results can be achieved. For example, the Service has  been able to increase its tracking and monitoring through the use of the  Voyager program and holiday jet fuel on the transportation side. The  Voyager program\u2019s ability to gather, track, and monitor data has resulted  in direct fuel cost savings for the Service. The card provides significant  amounts of transactional data such as cost, location, fuel type, timing, and  quantity that is fed into two information systems\u2014the eFleet program for  the Postal-owned fleet and the eFuel system for the highway contractor  fleet. According to Service officials, these systems require the monthly  reconciliation of all purchases and programs designed to monitor potential  fraud and abuse. These mechanisms contribute to cost savings and  avoidance. Furthermore, data collected from these systems has been used  by the Service to increase the accuracy of data for highway contractor fuel  consumption. Improved data tracking and monitoring for the Service\u2019s  holiday jet fuel has resulted in improved and more accurate contracting  and reported costs savings.", "On the facility side, the SES program requires specific tracking and  monitoring of the overall performance (costs, savings, and changes in  consumption) from these contracts. Furthermore, utility companies in the  Pacific and New York areas have provided the Service metering equipment  to track its fuel usage at designated Postal Service facilities. As discussed  earlier, the Service has set annual facility fuel-related cost-saving targets  that have allowed the Service to monitor and evaluate the performance of  these initiatives.", "Considering the positive results associated with the tracking and  monitoring under the Voyager card and SES programs, similar efforts  could be beneficial in obtaining additional fuel-related cost saving  opportunities. For example, a GSA building official stated that its efforts to  track consumption data showed that nearly 60 of its owned or leased  facilities accounted for almost half of its energy costs. GSA was able to  target these facilities for their energy efficiency investments. The  upcoming EPAct metering systems installation requirements provide an  opportunity for the Service to make additional progress in tracking and  monitoring its facility fuel consumption. The Executive Director for  Energy Initiatives stated that financial and operational considerations  need to be made due to the composition of the Service\u2019s facility network\u2014 34,000 facilities nationwide, many of which are less than 2,500 square  feet. The Executive Director stated that the Service has some fuel  information that provides guidance on which facilities are key candidates  for energy efficiency investments.

The Service has increased  its AFV fleet by nearly 20 percent from 2000 and currently possesses one  of the largest alternative-fuel capable fleets in the federal government with  nearly 40,000 AFVs. The majority of these vehicles are capable of  operating on ethanol or compressed natural gas (CNG), and also include  some that operate on electricity and liquefied petroleum gas. Most of the  Service\u2019s AFVs, however, do not operate using alternative fuels, but  primarily use gasoline and diesel fuel. Alternative fuels accounted for  roughly 1.5 percent of the total fuel consumed by the Service\u2019s internal  fleet in 2006.", "Financial and operational limitations associated with higher fuel and  vehicle prices, lower fuel efficiencies, and an insufficient nationwide  alternative fueling infrastructure have limited the Service\u2019s use of  alternative fuels. Postal Service officials stated these issues made  operating its fleet on alternative fuels cost prohibitive. For example these  officials stated that:    The Service found that the cost for a gallon of ethanol 85 (E85) is typically  17 percent more expensive than gasoline, is 26 percent less efficient, and  may result in higher maintenance costs because it is corrosive.", "There is a limited supply of AFVs available for purchase by the Service,  and those that are available to the Service that meet the EPAct  requirements contain larger engines than generally needed for delivery  operations. As such, these unnecessarily large engines lower fuel  efficiency when using gasoline or alternative fuels, and reduce the  Service\u2019s miles per gallon.", "The limited nationwide alternative fuel infrastructure has hindered some  of its previous alternative fuel efforts. For example, the Service converted  some of its vehicles to operate on CNG in the early 1990s. While this was  successful in the short term, manufacturers that the Service worked with  to produce the CNG vehicles went out of business or simply stopped  producing the vehicles, and many fueling stations that had provided CNG  stopped selling it, leading to a shortage in the fuel. Furthermore, even  where alternative fuel pumps are available, their distance from a Postal  Service facility may be too great to justify the costs to refuel at that pump.  Service officials stated that only 0.6 percent of service stations across the  country offer alternative fuels.", "Our past work, as well as officials from DOE and GSA have raised similar  financial and operational limitations. We recently issued a report on the  challenges associated with using alternative fuels, including that the  nationwide alternative fuel infrastructure is poor to nonexistent  throughout most of the country. For example, we reported that there are  a limited number of E85 fueling stations nationwide (mostly concentrated  in the upper Midwest), and that E85 cannot use the same infrastructure as  gasoline because it is more corrosive. As of January 2007, the DOE  Website indicates that only 1,003 E85 stations are located throughout the  country. Recent studies conducted by DOE have found similar decreased  fuel efficiency and increased cost results for ethanol. DOE is currently in  the process of finalizing guidance on a waiver to EPAct for federal fleets  based on factors that may include alternative fuel price and travel  distance.", "A Service engineering director stated that discussions with DOE,  automobile, fuel industry officials, and the Service about these financial  and operational limitations have taken place, but progress has been  difficult to achieve. This official stated that the Service\u2019s demand for AFVs  and alternative fuels is not large enough to result in significant changes to  the availability and price of AFVs or to the nationwide alternative fuel  infrastructure. We are continuing to look at issues surrounding the  nationwide alternative fuel infrastructure and plan on issuing a report in  the middle of 2007.", "Service officials also noted that they continue to look at alternative fuel  vehicles and other options to improve vehicle fuel efficiency. For example,  the Service has recently focused testing on hybrid vehicles. These officials  noted, however, that while the mail delivery tests using hybrid vehicles are  going very well and are conducive to the stop-and-go driving of mail  delivery routes, hybrid vehicles are not considered AFVs and are ineligible  for EPAct 2005 credit because they are powered primarily by standard  gasoline. Nevertheless, the use of hybrids is consistent with the President\u2019s  recent executive order requiring federal agencies to cut their energy  consumption by, among other actions, using hybrid cars. Officials also  noted that the Service takes other actions to increase fuel efficiency, such  as having regularly scheduled vehicle maintenance (oil changes, tire  pressure checks, etc.) that is consistent with the specifications of the  vehicle manufacturer. Another fuel efficiency option noted by a vehicle  operations official is that most of the larger vehicles in the Service\u2019s fleet  were installed with bypass filters to minimize the intervals between oil  replacements. However, he stated that using bypass filters on the smaller,  delivery vehicles would not be cost-effective due to more expensive  installation costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although the Service has taken some actions to mitigate fuel risk and  contain costs that are generally consistent with practices advocated by  leading organizations, it continues to be vulnerable to fuel price  fluctuations and challenged to meet the more stringent 2005 EPAct  requirements.

We recognized these issues in  our report and we are currently conducting additional work on alternative  fuel infrastructure issues that is scheduled to be completed in mid-2007.  The Service also commented on the financial challenges associated with  the EPAct 2005 advanced metering requirement. It stated that many of its  facilities are less than 10,000 square feet and requiring meters at all  locations would not provide a reasonable return on investment.

For our analysis, we established the following two  categories:  1.  Transportation-related fuel, which included fuel used for highway, air,  rail, and water transportation. The types of fuel included in this  category were gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, biodiesel, ethanol, compressed  natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity.  2.  Facility-related fuels, which included fuel used to heat and operate  Postal Service facilities. The types of fuel included electricity, natural  gas, heating oil, propane, steam, coal, and wood.

We also conducted a review of current  literature on these topics. Based on this information, we identified key  practices that focused on purchasing and consumption activities. The  purchasing-related leading practices we identified were aggregating  purchases to leverage buying power and size; enhancing organizational  structure; utilizing public/private partnerships; and tracking and  monitoring fuel information. The consumption-related leading practices  we identified were reducing reliance and use of petroleum-based fuels and  conserving energy use in facilities.", "We also discussed opportunities for further actions consistent with leading  practices with the Service\u2019s newly appointed Executive Director for  Energy Initiatives.

These procedures include actions that are taken to  achieve cost savings, cost avoidance, or cost reductions. The following  represent the definitions and methodology behind these three cost  categories used by the Service.", "Cost Savings: Identifiable and measurable reduction in expenditures or  costs that is the result of planned and deliberate supply chain management  actions that return quantifiable dollar savings to the Service\u2019s bottom line.  Cost savings are the difference between baseline spend (historical, current  market price or initial suppliers bid) accounted for in a prior or current  year budget and actual spend achieved through planned and deliberate  supply chain management actions for the same or comparable supplies,  equipment, services, facilities or other supply chain activities. Cost savings  are only recorded in the first year of supply chain management impact.  After the budget has been adjusted to reflect the cost savings, all  subsequent years of supply chain management impact related to these  efforts are counted towards cost avoidance (see the definition for cost  avoidance below.)", "Examples of cost savings include the following:    Example A: A purchase cost reduction achieved over a historical or  previously paid cost for the same products or services.", "Example B: An actual staffing or headcount reduction, which reduces    Example C: An ownership cost reduction resulting from the elimination of  expenses associated with receiving, holding, and/or distributing inventory.", "Savings related solely to general market trends, supplier price changes, or  reduced expenditures do not qualify as supply chain management impact.  Although these savings may have a bottom line benefit that is identifiable  and measurable, they do not result from the planned and deliberate action  or substantial involvement of supply management organizational area  enabling or leading the supply chain management initiatives.", "Cost Reductions: Cost reductions are identifiable and measurable cost  savings that are the result of a planned and deliberate supply chain  management action that returns measurable savings to the Service\u2019s  bottom line. However, instead of reducing the bottom line, the Service has  determined that these savings can be retained by the internal  client/program office and reinvested to enhance related or new program  initiatives.", "Cost Avoidance: Identifiable and measurable elimination of a new cost  that would have otherwise occurred except for planned and deliberate  supply chain management action. In all cases, cost avoidance results  where a contractual obligation on the part of the Service has not yet been  made. Cost avoidance is the difference between the average quoted,  relevant market price or other acceptable industry pricing benchmark or  baseline and the price paid, which could be more or less than the initial  proposed price. The relevant market price is the price the Service would  expect to pay in the absence of planned and deliberate supply chain  management action. Cost avoidance captures the value of those initiatives  that reduce the need for an expense or capital expenditure, which unless  the supply chain management action were taken, would have resulted in a  higher expense or capital cost to the Service. Examples of cost avoidance  include:    Example A: A price reduction for a unique or first time purchase, as well  as for a purchase for which there is inadequate price history.", "Example B: A total cost of ownership analysis supporting the reuse of  excess property and supplies versus purchasing new.", "Example C: A published supplier price increase that is negated or lowered  through a particular supply chain management technique.", "Cost avoidance does not qualify as cost savings because the avoided cost  is a \u201cnew\u201d cost and, by definition, not included in prior year spend (or  prior or current year budgets) and the avoidance has no direct dollar-for- dollar impact on the bottom line. Supply chain management impact is still  created, however, because the cost avoidance minimizes or eliminates the  negative impact on current or future year spend."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Teresa Anderson, Joshua  Bartzen, Kathy Gilhooly, Brandon Haller, Carol Henn, Daniel Paepke,  Emily Rachman, and Karla Springer made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
