For example, in 2012, EIA estimated that the amount of technically recoverable shale gas in the United States was 482 trillion cubic feet--an increase of 280 percent from EIA's 2008 estimate. However, according to EIA and USGS officials, estimates of the size of shale oil and gas resources in the United States are highly dependent on the data, methodologies, model structures, and assumptions used to develop them. In addition, less is known about the amount of technically recoverable shale oil than shale gas, in part because large-scale production of shale oil has been under way for only the past few years. Estimates are based on data available at a given point in time and will change as additional information becomes available. In addition, domestic shale oil and gas production has experienced substantial growth; shale oil production increased more than fivefold from 2007 to 2011, and shale gas production increased more than fourfold from 2007 to 2011.", "Oil and gas development, whether conventional or shale oil and gas, pose inherent environmental and public health risks, but the extent of these risks associated with shale oil and gas development is unknown, in part, because the studies GAO reviewed do not generally take into account the potential long-term, cumulative effects. For example, according to a number of studies and publications GAO reviewed, shale oil and gas development poses risks to air quality, generally as the result of (1) engine exhaust from increased truck traffic, (2) emissions from diesel-powered pumps used to power equipment, (3) gas that is flared (burned) or vented (released directly into the atmosphere) for operational reasons, and (4) unintentional emissions of pollutants from faulty equipment or impoundments--temporary storage areas. Similarly, a number of studies and publications GAO reviewed indicate that shale oil and gas development poses risks to water quality from contamination of surface water and groundwater as a result of erosion from ground disturbances, spills and releases of chemicals and other fluids, or underground migration of gases and chemicals. For example, tanks storing toxic chemicals or hoses and pipes used to convey wastes to the tanks could leak, or impoundments containing wastes could overflow as a result of extensive rainfall. According to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation's 2011 Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement, spilled, leaked, or released chemicals or wastes could flow to a surface water body or infiltrate the ground, reaching and contaminating subsurface soils and aquifers. In addition, shale oil and gas development poses a risk to land resources and wildlife habitat as a result of constructing, operating, and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to develop oil and gas; using toxic chemicals; and injecting fluids underground. However, the extent of these risks is unknown. Further, the extent and severity of environmental and public health risks identified in the studies and publications GAO reviewed may vary significantly across shale basins and also within basins because of location- and process-specific factors, including the location and rate of development; geological characteristics, such as permeability, thickness, and porosity of the formations; climatic conditions; business practices; and regulatory and enforcement activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the United States has relied on imports of oil and natural  gas to meet domestic needs. As recently as 2007, the expectation was  that the nation would increasingly rely on imports of natural gas to meet  its growing demand. However, recent improvements in technology have  allowed companies that develop petroleum resources to extract oil and  natural gas from shale formations, known as \u201cshale oil\u201d and \u201cshale gas,\u201d  respectively, which were previously inaccessible because traditional  techniques did not yield sufficient amounts for economically viable  production. In particular, as we reported in January 2012, new  applications of horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing\u2014a  process that injects a combination of water, sand, and chemical additives  under high pressure to create and maintain fractures in underground rock  formations that allow oil and natural gas to flow\u2014have prompted a boom  in shale oil and gas production. According to the Department of Energy  (DOE), America\u2019s shale gas resource base is abundant, and development  of this resource could have beneficial effects for the nation, such as job  creation. According to a report by the Baker Institute, domestic shale gas  development could limit the need for expensive imports of these  resources\u2014helping to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. In addition, replacing  older coal burning power generation with new natural gas-fired generators  could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and result in fewer air pollutants  for the same amount of electric power generated. Early drilling activity in  shale formations was centered primarily on natural gas, but with the  falling price of natural gas companies switched their focus to oil and  natural gas liquids, which are a more valuable product.", "As exploration and development of shale oil and gas have increased in  recent years\u2013\u2013including in areas of the country without a history of oil and  natural gas activities\u2013\u2013questions have been raised about the estimates of  the size of domestic shale oil and gas resources, as well as the  processes used to extract them. For example, some organizations have  questioned the accuracy of the estimates of the shale gas supply. In  particular, some news organizations have reported concerns that such  estimates may be inflated. In addition, concerns about environmental and  public health effects of the increased use of horizontal drilling and  hydraulic fracturing, particularly on air quality and water resources, have  garnered extensive public attention. According to the International Energy  Agency, some questions also exist about whether switching from coal to  natural gas will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\u2014based,  in part, on uncertainty about additional emissions from the development  of shale gas. These concerns and other considerations have led some  communities and certain states to impose restrictions or moratoriums on  drilling operations to allow time to study and better understand the  potential risks associated with these practices.", "In this context, you asked us to provide information on shale oil and gas.

Specifically, to determine what is known about the size of  these resources, we obtained information for technically recoverable and  proved reserves estimates for shale oil and gas from the EIA, the U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS), and the Potential Gas Committee\u2013\u2013a  nongovernmental organization composed of academics and industry  representatives. We interviewed key officials from these agencies and the  committee about the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate  the resource size. Estimates of proved reserves of shale oil and gas are  based on data provided to EIA by operators\u2014companies that develop  petroleum resources to extract oil and natural gas. To determine what is  known about the amount of shale oil and gas produced from 2007  through 2011, we obtained data from EIA\u2014which is responsible for  estimating and reporting this and other energy information. To assess the  reliability of these data, we examined EIA\u2019s published methodology for  collecting this information and interviewed key EIA officials regarding the  agency\u2019s data collection efforts. We also met with officials from states,  representatives from private industry, and researchers from academic  institutions who are familiar with these data and EIA\u2019s methodology. We  discussed the sources and reliability of the data with these officials and  found the data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. For all  estimates we report, we reviewed the methodologies used to derive them  and also found them sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "Operators may use hydraulic fracturing to develop oil and natural gas from formations  other than shale, but for the purposes of this report we focused on development of shale  formations.

For a number of studies, we  interviewed the author or authors to discuss the study\u2019s findings and  limitations, if any. We believe we have identified the key studies through  our literature review and interviews, and that the studies included in our  review have accurately identified currently known potential risks for shale  oil and gas development. However, it is possible that we may not have  identified all of the studies with findings relevant to our objectives, and the  risks we present may not be the only issues of concern.", "The risks identified in the studies and publications we reviewed cannot, at  present, be quantified, and the magnitude of potential adverse affects or  likelihood of occurrence cannot be determined for several reasons. First,  it is difficult to predict how many or where shale oil and gas wells may be  constructed. Second, the extent to which operators use effective best  management practices to mitigate risk may vary. Third, based on the  studies we reviewed, there are relatively few studies that are based on  comparing predevelopment conditions to postdevelopment conditions\u2014 making it difficult to detect or attribute adverse conditions to shale oil and  gas development. In addition, changes to the federal, state, and local  regulatory environments and the effectiveness of implementing and  enforcing regulations will affect operators\u2019 future activities and, therefore,  the level of risk associated with future development of oil and gas  resources. Moreover, risks of adverse events, such as spills or accidents,  may vary according to business practices which, in turn, may vary across  oil and gas companies, making it difficult to distinguish between risks  associated with the process to develop shale oil and gas from risks that  are specific to particular business practices. To obtain additional  perspectives on issues related to environmental and public health risks,  we interviewed federal officials from DOE\u2019s National Energy Technical  Laboratory, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) and Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA); state regulatory officials from Arkansas, Colorado,  Louisiana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas;  tribal officials from the Osage Nation; shale oil and gas operators;  representatives from environmental and public health organizations; and  other knowledgeable parties with experience related to shale oil and gas  development, such as researchers from the Colorado School of Mines,  the University of Texas, Oklahoma University, and Stanford University.

Conventional oil and natural gas are found in deep, porous rock or  reservoirs and can flow under natural pressure to the surface after drilling.

On  one extreme\u2014oil shale, for example\u2014the hydrocarbon trapped in the  shale will not reach a liquid form without first being heated to very high  temperatures\u2014ranging from about 650 to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014in a  process known as retorting. In contrast, to extract shale oil and gas from  the rock, fluids and proppants (usually sand or ceramic beads used to  hold fractures open in the formation) are injected under high pressure to  create and maintain fractures to increase permeability, thus allowing oil or  gas to be extracted. Other formations, such as coalbed methane  formations and tight sandstone formations, may also require stimulation  to allow oil or gas to be extracted.", "Most of the energy used in the United States comes from fossil fuels such  as oil and natural gas. Oil supplies more than 35 percent of all the energy  the country consumes, and almost the entire U.S. transportation fleet\u2014 cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes\u2014depends on fuels made from oil.  Natural gas is an important energy source to heat buildings, power the  industrial sector, and generate electricity. Natural gas provides more than  20 percent of the energy used in the United States, supplying nearly half of all the energy used for cooking, heating, and powering other home  appliances, and generating almost one-quarter of U.S. electricity supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Shale Oil and Gas Development Process", "paragraphs": ["The process to develop shale oil and gas is similar to the process for  conventional onshore oil and gas, but shale formations may rely on the  use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing\u2014which may or may not  be used on conventional wells. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  are not new technologies, as seen in figure 1, but advancements,  refinements, and new uses of these technologies have greatly expanded  oil and gas operators\u2019 abilities to use these processes to economically  develop shale oil and gas resources. For example, the use of multistage  hydraulic fracturing within a horizontal well has only been widely used in  the last decade.", "First, operators locate suitable shale oil and gas targets using seismic  methods of exploration, negotiate contracts or leases that allow mineral  development, identify a specific location for drilling, and obtain necessary  permits; then, they undertake a number of activities to develop shale oil  and gas. The specific activities and steps taken to extract shale oil and  gas vary based on the characteristics of the formation, but the  development phase generally involves the following stages: (1) well pad  preparation and construction, (2) drilling and well construction, and (3)  hydraulic fracturing.", "The first stage in the development process is to prepare and construct the  well pad site. Typically, operators must clear and level surface vegetation  to make room for numerous vehicles and heavy equipment\u2014such as the  drilling rig\u2014and to build infrastructure\u2014such as roads\u2014needed to access  the site.additives, water, and sand needed for hydraulic fracturing to the site\u2014 tanks, water pumps, and blender pumps, as well as water and sand  storage tanks, monitoring equipment, and additive storage containers .  Based on the geological characteristics of the formation and climatic  conditions, operators may (1) excavate a pit or impoundment to store  freshwater, drilling fluids, or drill cuttings\u2014rock cuttings generated during  drilling; (2) use tanks to store materials; or (3) build temporary transfer  pipes to transport materials to and from an off-site location.", "Then operators must transport the equipment that mixes the  The next stage in the development process is drilling and well  construction. Operators drill a hole (referred to as the wellbore) into the  earth through a combination of vertical and horizontal drilling techniques.  At several points in the drilling process, the drill string and bit are  removed from the wellbore so that casing and cement may be inserted.  Casing is a metal pipe that is inserted inside the wellbore to prevent high- pressure fluids outside the formation from entering the well and to prevent  drilling mud inside the well from fracturing fragile sections of the wellbore.  As drilling progresses with depth, casings that are of a smaller diameter  than the hole created by the drill bit are inserted into the wellbore and  bonded in place with cement, sealing the wellbore from the surrounding  formation.", "Drilling mud (a lubricant also known as drilling fluid) is pumped through  the wellbore at different densities to balance the pressure inside the  wellbore and bring rock particles and other matter cut from the formation  back to the rig. A blowout preventer is installed over the well as a safety  measure to prevent any uncontrolled release of oil or gas and help  maintain control over pressures in the well. Drill cuttings, which are made  up of ground rock coated with a layer of drilling mud or fluid, are brought  to the surface. Mud pits provide a reservoir for mixing and holding the  drilling mud. At the completion of drilling, the drilling mud may be recycled  for use at another drilling operation.", "Instruments guide drilling operators to the \u201ckickoff point\u201d\u2014the point that  drilling starts to turn at a slight angle and continues turning until it nears  the shale formation and extends horizontally. Production casing and  cement are then inserted to extend the length of the borehole to maintain  wellbore integrity and prevent any communication between the formation  fluids and the wellbore. After the casing is set and cemented, the drilling  operator may run a cement evaluation log by lowering an electric probe  into the well to measure the quality and placement of the cement. The  purpose of the cement evaluation log is to confirm that the cement has  the proper strength to function as designed\u2014preventing well fluids from  migrating outside the casing and infiltrating overlying formations. After  vertical drilling is complete, horizontal drilling is conducted by slowly  angling the drill bit until it is drilling horizontally. Horizontal stretches of the  well typically range from 2,000 to 6,000 feet long but can be as long as  12,000 feet long, in some cases.", "Throughout the drilling process, operators may vent or flare some natural  gas, often intermittently, in response to maintenance needs or equipment  failures. This natural gas is either released directly into the atmosphere  (vented) or burned (flared). In October 2010, we reported on venting and  flaring of natural gas on public lands. We reported that vented and  flared gas on public lands represents potential lost royalties for the federal  government and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically,  venting releases methane and volatile organic compounds, and flaring  emits carbon dioxide, both greenhouse gases that contribute to global  climate change. Methane is a particular concern since it is a more potent  greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.", "The next stage in the development process is stimulation of the shale  formation using hydraulic fracturing. Before operators or service  companies perform a hydraulic fracture treatment of a well, a series of  tests may be conducted to ensure that the well, wellhead equipment, and  fracturing equipment can safely withstand the high pressures associated  with the fracturing process. Minimum requirements for equipment  pressure testing can be determined by state regulatory agencies for  operations on state or private lands. In addition, fracturing is conducted  below the surface of the earth, sometimes several thousand feet below,  and can only be indirectly observed. Therefore, operators may collect   and natural fault  subsurface data\u2014such as information on rock stressesstructures\u2014needed to develop models that predict fracture height, length,  and orientation prior to drilling a well. The purpose of modeling is to  design a fracturing treatment that optimizes the location and size of  induced fractures and maximizes oil or gas production.", "To prepare a well to be hydraulically fractured, a perforating tool may be  inserted into the casing and used to create holes in the casing and  cement. Through these holes, fracturing fluid\u2014that is injected under high  pressures\u2014can flow into the shale (fig. 2 shows a used perforating tool).", "Fracturing fluids are tailored to site specific conditions, such as shale  thickness, stress, compressibility, and rigidity. As such, the chemical  additives used in a fracture treatment vary. Operators may use computer  models that consider local conditions to design site\u2010specific hydraulic  fluids. The water, chemicals, and proppant used in fracturing fluid are  typically stored on-site in separate tanks and blended just before they are  injected into the well. Figure 3 provides greater detail about some  chemicals commonly used in fracturing.", "The operator pumps the fracturing fluid into the wellbore at pressures  high enough to force the fluid through the perforations into the  surrounding formation\u2014which can be shale, coalbeds, or tight  sandstone\u2014expanding existing fractures and creating new ones in the  process. After the fractures are created, the operator reduces the  pressure. The proppant stays in the formation to hold open the fractures  and allow the release of oil and gas. Some of the fracturing fluid that was  injected into the well will return to the surface (commonly referred to as  flowback) along with water that occurs naturally in the oil- or gas-bearing  formation\u2014collectively referred to as produced water. The produced  water is brought to the surface and collected by the operator, where it can  be stored on-site in impoundments, injected into underground wells,  transported to a wastewater treatment plant, or reused by the operator in  other ways. Given the length of horizontal wells, hydraulic fracturing is  often conducted in stages, where each stage focuses on a limited linear  section and may be repeated numerous times.", "Once a well is producing oil or natural gas, equipment and temporary  infrastructure associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations  is no longer needed and may be removed, leaving only the parts of the  infrastructure required to collect and process the oil or gas and ongoing  produced water. Operators may begin to reclaim the part of the site that  will not be used by restoring the area to predevelopment conditions.  Throughout the producing life of an oil or gas well, the operator may find it  necessary to periodically restimulate the flow of oil or gas by repeating  the hydraulic fracturing process. The frequency of such activity depends  on the characteristics of the geologic formation and the economics of the  individual well. If the hydraulic fracturing process is repeated, the site and  surrounding area will be further affected by the required infrastructure,  truck transport, and other activity associated with this process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Framework", "paragraphs": ["Shale oil and gas development, like conventional onshore oil and gas  production, is governed by a framework of federal, state, and local laws  and regulations.

However, in some cases, federal agencies  oversee shale oil and gas development. For example, BLM oversees  shale oil and gas development on federal lands. In large part, the federal  laws, regulations, and permit requirements that apply to conventional  onshore oil and gas exploration and production activities also apply to  shale oil and gas development.", "Federal.

Operators may then sell the natural  gas liquids, which may give wet shale gas plays an economic advantage  over dry gas plays. Another advantage of liquid petroleum and natural  gas liquids is that they can be transported more easily than natural gas.

Estimates of  technically recoverable resources are dynamic, changing to reflect the  potential of extraction technology and knowledge about the geology and  composition of geologic formations.

As these  estimates are based on data available at a given point in time, they may  change as additional information becomes available. Also these  estimates depend on historical production data as a key component for  modeling future supply. Because large-scale production of oil in shale  formations is a relatively recent activity, their long-term productivity is  largely unknown. For example, EIA estimated that the Monterey Shale in  California may possess about 15.4 billion barrels of technically  recoverable oil. However, without a longer history of production, the  estimate has greater uncertainty than estimates based on more historical  production data. At this time, USGS has not yet evaluated the Monterey  Shale play.", "The amount of technically recoverable shale gas resources in the United  States has been estimated by a number of organizations, including EIA,  USGS, and the Potential Gas Committee (see fig. 6).

If necessary, operators may also construct access roads to  transport equipment and other materials to the site. As we reported in  February 2005, as with other construction activities, if sufficient erosion  controls to contain or divert sediment away from surface water are not  established then surfaces are exposed to precipitation and runoff could  carry sediment and other harmful pollutants into nearby rivers, lakes, and  streams.

Underground migration can occur as a  result of improper casing and cementing of the wellbore as well as the  intersection of induced fractures with natural fractures, faults, or  improperly plugged dry or abandoned wells. Moreover, there are  concerns that induced fractures can grow over time and intersect with  drinking water aquifers. Specifically:  Improper casing and cementing. A well that is not properly isolated  through proper casing and cementing could allow gas or other fluids to  contaminate aquifers as a result of inadequate depth of casing, inadequate cement in the annular space around the surface casing, and  ineffective cement that cracks or breaks down under the stress of high  pressures. For example, according to a 2008 report by the Ohio  Department of Natural Resources, a gas well in Bainbridge, Ohio, was not  properly isolated because of faulty sealing, allowing natural gas to build  up in the space around the production casing and migrate upward over  about 30 days into the local aquifer and infiltrating drinking water wells.  The risk of contamination from improper casing and cementing is not  unique to the development of shale formations. Casing and cementing  practices also apply to conventional oil and gas development. However,  wells that are hydraulically fractured have some unique aspects. For  example, hydraulically fractured wells are commonly exposed to higher  pressures than wells that are not hydraulically fractured. In addition,  hydraulically fractured wells are exposed to high pressures over a longer  period of time as fracturing is conducted in multiple stages, and wells may  be refractured multiple times\u2014primarily to extend the economic life of the  well when production declines significantly or falls below the estimated  reservoir potential.", "The depth for casing and cementing may be determined by state regulations.", "Natural fractures, faults, and abandoned wells. If shale oil and gas  development activities result in connections being established with natural  fractures, faults, or improperly plugged dry or abandoned wells, a  pathway for gas or contaminants to migrate underground could be  created\u2014posing a risk to water quality. These connections could be  established through either induced fractures intersecting directly with  natural fractures, faults, or improperly plugged dry or abandoned wells or  as a result of improper casing and cementing that allow gas or other  contaminants to make such connections. In 2011, the New York State  Department of Environmental Conservation reported that operators  generally avoid development around known faults because natural faults  could allow gas to escape, which reduces the optimal recovery of gas and  the economic viability of a well. However, data on subsurface conditions  in some areas are limited. Several studies we reviewed report that some  states are unaware of the location or condition of many old wells. As a  result, operators may not be fully aware of the location of abandoned  wells and natural fractures or faults.", "Fracture growth. A number of such studies and publications we reviewed  report that the risk of induced fractures extending out of the target  formation into an aquifer\u2014allowing gas or other fluids to contaminate  water\u2014may depend, in part, on the depth separating the fractured  formation and the aquifer. For example, according to a 2012 Bipartisan  Policy Center report,  the fracturing process itself is unlikely to directly  affect freshwater aquifers because fracturing typically takes place at a  depth of 6,000 to 10,000 feet, while drinking water tables are typically less   Fractures created during the hydraulic fracturing  than 1,000 feet deep.process are generally unable to span the distance between the targeted  shale formation and freshwater bearing zones.

The fractures are most  commonly vertical and may extend laterally several hundred feet away  from the well, usually growing upward until they intersect with a rock of  different structure, texture, or strength. These are referred to as seals or  barriers and stop the fracture\u2019s upward or downward growth. In addition,  as the fracturing fluid contacts the formation or invades natural fractures,  part of the fluid is lost to the formation. The loss of fluids will eventually  stop fracture growth according to this industry report.", "When a fracture grows, it  From 2001 through 2010, an industry consulting firm monitored the upper  and lower limits of hydraulically induced fractures relative to the position  of drinking water aquifers in the Barnett and Eagle Ford Shale, the  Marcellus Shale, and the Woodford Shale. that the results of the monitoring show that even the highest fracture point  is several thousand feet below the depth of the deepest drinking water  aquifer. For example, for over 200 fractures in the Woodford Shale, the  typical distance between the drinking water aquifer and the top of the  fracture was 7,500 feet, with the highest fracture recorded at 4,000 feet  from the aquifer. In another example, for the 3,000 fractures performed in  the Barnett Shale, the typical distance from the drinking water aquifer and  the top of the fracture was 4,800 feet, and the fracture with the closest  distance to the aquifer was still separated by 2,800 feet of rock.

During the study period\u2014 from 1993 through 2008\u2014multistaged hydraulic fracturing stimulations  were performed in over 16,000 horizontal shale gas wells. The  evaluation of the state investigations found that there were no  incidents of groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic  fracturing.", "In addition, regulatory officials we met with from eight states\u2014Arkansas,  Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and  Texas\u2014told us that, based on state investigations, the hydraulic  fracturing process has not been identified as a cause of groundwater  contamination within their states.", "A number of studies discuss the potential contamination of water from the  hydraulic fracturing process in shale formations. However, according to  several studies we reviewed, there are insufficient data for  predevelopment (or baseline) conditions for groundwater. Without data to  compare predrilling conditions to postdrilling conditions, it is difficult to  determine if adverse effects were the result of oil and gas development,  natural occurrences, or other activities. In addition, while researchers  have evaluated fracture growth, the widespread development of shale oil  and gas is relatively new. As such, little data exist on (1) fracture growth  in shale formations following multistage hydraulic fracturing over an  extended time period, (2) the frequency with which refracturing of  horizontal wells may occur, (3) the effect of refracturing on fracture growth  over time, and (4) the likelihood of adverse effects on drinking water  aquifers from a large number of hydraulically fractured wells in close  proximity to each other.", "Ongoing studies by federal agencies, industry groups, and academic  institutions are evaluating the effects of hydraulic fracturing on water  resources so that, over time, better data and information about these  effects should become available to policymakers and the public. For  example, EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development initiated a study in  January 2010 to examine the potential effects of hydraulic fracturing on  drinking water resources. According to agency officials, the agency  anticipates issuing a progress report in 2012 and a final report in 2014.  EPA is also conducting an investigation to determine the presence of  groundwater contamination within a tight sandstone formation being  developed for natural gas near Pavillion, Wyoming, and, to the extent  possible, identify the source of the contamination. In December 2011,  EPA released a draft report outlining findings from the investigation. The  report is not finalized, but the agency indicated that it had identified  certain constituents in groundwater above the production zone of the  Pavillion natural gas wells that are consistent with some of the  constituents used in natural gas well operations, including the process of  hydraulic fracturing. DOE researchers are also testing the vertical growth  of fractures during hydraulic fracturing to determine whether fluids can  travel thousands of feet through geologic faults into water aquifers close  to the surface.", "Oil and gas development, whether conventional or shale oil and gas,  poses a risk to land resources and wildlife habitat as a result of  constructing, operating, and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to  develop oil and gas; using toxic chemicals; and injecting waste products  underground.", "According to studies and publications we reviewed, development of oil  and gas, whether conventional or shale oil and gas, poses a risk to  habitat from construction activities. Specifically, clearing land of  vegetation and leveling the site to allow access to the resource, as well as  construction of roads, pipelines, storage tanks, and other infrastructure  needed to extract and transport the resource can fragment habitats. In  August 2003, we reported that oil and gas infrastructure on federal wildlife  refuges can reduce the quality of habitat by fragmenting it.Fragmentation increases disturbances from human activities, provides  pathways for predators, and helps spread nonnative plant species.", "In addition, spills of oil, gas, or other toxic chemicals have harmed wildlife  and habitat. Oil and gas can injure or kill wildlife by destroying the  insulating capacity of feathers and fur, depleting oxygen available in  water, or exposing wildlife to toxic substances. Long-term effects of oil  and gas contamination on wildlife are difficult to determine, but studies  suggest that effects of exposure include reduced fertility, kidney and liver  damage, immune suppression, and cancer. In August 2003, we reported  that even small spills may contaminate soil and sediments if they occur  frequently. Further, noise and the presence of new infrastructure  associated with shale gas development may also affect wildlife. A study  by the Houston Advanced Research Center and the Nature Conservancy  investigated the effects of noise associated with gas development on the  Attwater\u2019s Prairie Chicken\u2014an endangered species. The study explored  how surface disruptions, particularly construction of a rig and noise from  diesel generators would affect the animal\u2019s movement and habitat. The  results of the study found that the chickens were not adversely affected  by the diesel engine generator\u2019s noise but that the presence of the rig  caused the animals to temporarily disperse and avoid the area.", "A number of studies we reviewed identified risks to habitat and wildlife as  a result of shale oil and gas activities. However, because shale oil and  gas development is relatively new in some areas, the long-term effects\u2014 after operators are to have restored portions of the land to  predevelopment conditions\u2014have not been evaluated. Without these  data, the cumulative effects of shale oil and gas development on habitat  and wildlife are largely unknown.", "According to several studies and publications we reviewed, the hydraulic  fracturing process releases energy deep beneath the surface to break  rock but the energy released is not large enough to trigger a seismic  event that could be felt on the surface. However, a process commonly  used by operators to dispose of waste fluids\u2014underground injection\u2014has  been associated with earthquakes in some locations. For example, a  2011 Oklahoma Geological Survey study reported that underground  injection can induce seismicity. In March 2012, the Ohio Department of  Natural Resources reported that \u201cthere is a compelling argument\u201d that the  injection of produced water into underground injection wells was the  cause of the 2011 earthquakes near Youngstown, Ohio. In addition, the  National Academy of Sciences released a study in June 2012 that  concluded that underground injection of wastes poses some risk for  induced seismicity, but that very few events have been documented over  the past several decades relative to the large number of disposal wells in  operation.", "The available research does not identify a direct link between hydraulic  fracturing and increased seismicity, but there could be an indirect effect to  the extent that increased use of hydraulic fracturing produces increased  amounts of water that is disposed of through underground injection. In  addition, according to the National Academy of Science\u2019s 2012 report,  accurately predicting magnitude or occurrence of seismic events is  generally not possible, in part, because of a lack of comprehensive data  on the complex natural rock systems at energy development sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Risks Is Unknown and Depends on Many Factors", "paragraphs": ["The extent and severity of environmental and public health risks identified  in the studies and publications we reviewed may vary significantly across  shale basins and also within basins because of location- and process- specific factors, including the location and rate of development; geological  characteristics, such as permeability, thickness, and porosity of the  formations in the basin; climatic conditions; business practices; and  regulatory and enforcement activities.", "Location and rate of development. The location of oil and gas operations  and the rate of development can affect the extent and severity of  environmental and public health risks. For example, as we reported in  October 2010, while much of the natural gas that is vented and flared is  considered to be unavoidably lost, certain technologies and practices can  be applied throughout the production process to capture some of this gas,  according to the oil and gas industry and EPA. The technologies\u2019  technical and economic feasibility varies and sometimes depends on the  location of operations. For example, some technologies require a  substantial amount of electricity, which may be less feasible for remote  production sites that are not on the electrical grid. In addition, the extent  and severity of environmental risks may vary based on the location of oil  and gas wells. For example, in areas with high population density that are  already experiencing challenges adhering to federal air quality limits,  increases in ozone levels because of emissions from oil and gas  development may compound the problem.", "Geological characteristics. Geological characteristics can affect the extent  and severity of environmental and public health risks associated with  shale oil and gas development. For example, geological differences  between tight sandstone and shale formations are important because,  unlike shale, tight sandstone has enough permeability to transmit  groundwater to water wells in the region. In a sense, the tight sandstone  formation acts as a reservoir for both natural gas and for groundwater. In  contrast, shale formations are typically not permeable enough to transmit  water and are not reservoirs for groundwater. According to EPA officials,  hydraulic fracturing in a tight sandstone formation that is a reservoir for  both natural gas and groundwater poses a greater risk of contamination  than the same activity in a deep shale formation.", "Climatic conditions. Climatic factors, such as annual rainfall and surface  temperatures, can also affect the environmental risks for a specific region  or area. For example, according to a 2007 study funded by DOE, average  rainfall amounts can be directly related to soil erosion. Specifically,  areas with higher precipitation levels may be more susceptible to soil  compaction and rutting during the well pad construction phase. In another  example, risk of adverse effects from exposures to toxic air contaminants  can vary substantially between drilling sites, in part, because of the  specific mix of emissions and climatic conditions that affect the transport  and dispersion of emissions. Specifically, wind speed and direction,  temperature, as well as other climatic conditions, can influence exposure  levels of toxic air contaminants. For example, according to a 2012 study  from the Sustainable Investments Institute and the Investor Responsibility  Research Center Institute, the combination of air emissions from gas  operations, snow on the ground, bright sunshine, and temperature  inversions during winter months have contributed to ozone creation in  Sublette County, Wyoming.", "Business practices. A number of studies we reviewed indicate that some  adverse effects from shale oil and gas development can be mitigated  through the use of technologies and best practices. For example,  according to standards and guidelines issued jointly by the Departments  of the Interior and Agriculture, mitigation techniques, such as fencing and  covers, should be used around impoundments to prevent livestock or  wildlife from accessing fluids stored in the impoundments. example, EPA\u2019s Natural Gas STAR program has identified over 80  technologies and practices that can cost effectively reduce methane  emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, during oil and gas development.  However, the use of these technologies and business practices are  typically voluntary and rely on responsible operators to ensure that  necessary actions are taken to prevent environmental contamination.  Further, the extent to which operators use these mitigating practices is  unknown and could be particularly challenging to identify given the  significant increase in recent years in the development of shale oil and  gas by a variety of operators, both large and small.", "United States Department of the Interior and United States Department of Agriculture.

Shale oil and gas development is  regulated by multiple levels of government\u2014including federal, state, and  local. Many of the laws and regulations applicable to shale oil and gas  development were put in place before the increase in operations that has  occurred in the last few years, and various levels of government are  evaluating and, in some cases, revising laws and regulations to respond  to the increase in shale oil and gas development. For example, in April  2012, EPA promulgated New Source Performance Standards for the oil  and gas industry that, when fully phased-in by 2015, will require  emissions reductions at new or modified oil and gas well sites, including  wells using hydraulic fracturing. Specifically, these new standards, in part,  focus on reducing the venting of natural gas and volatile organic  compounds during the flowback process. In addition, areas without prior  experience with oil and gas development are just now developing new  regulations. These governments\u2019 effectiveness in implementing and  enforcing this framework will affect future activities and the level of  associated risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Energy, the  Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency for  review and comment.

Specifically, to determine  what is known about the size of these resources, we obtained information  for technically recoverable and proved reserves estimates for shale oil  and gas from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S.  Geological Survey (USGS), and the Potential Gas Committee\u2013\u2013a  nongovernmental organization composed of academic and industry  officials. We interviewed key officials about the assumptions and  methodologies used to estimate the resource size. Estimates of proved  reserves of shale oil and gas are based on data provided to EIA by  operators.

To assess the reliability of these data, we examined EIA\u2019s published  methodology for collecting this information and interviewed key EIA  officials regarding the agency\u2019s data collection and validation efforts. We  also interviewed officials from three state agencies, representatives from  five private companies, and researchers from three academic institutions  who are familiar with these data and EIA\u2019s methodology and discussed  the sources and reliability of the data.

The studies and  publications we reviewed included scientific and industry periodicals,  government-sponsored research, reports or other publications from  nongovernmental organizations, and presentation materials. We identified  these studies by conducting a literature search and by asking for  recommendations during our interviews with stakeholders. For a number  of studies, we interviewed the author or authors to discuss the study\u2019s  findings and limitations, if any. We believe we have identified the key  studies through our literature review and interviews, and that the studies  included in our review have accurately identified potential risks for shale  oil and gas development. However, given our methodology, it is possible  that we may not have identified all of the studies with findings relevant to  our objectives, and the risks we present may not be the only issues of  concern. The widespread use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  to develop shale oil and gas is relatively new. Studying the effects of an  activity and completing a formal peer-review process can take numerous  months or years. Because of the relative short time frame for operations  and the lengthy time frame for studying effects, we did not limit the review  to peer-reviewed publications.", "The risks identified in the studies and publications we reviewed cannot, at  present, be quantified, and the magnitude of potential adverse affects or  likelihood of occurrence cannot be determined for several reasons. First,  it is difficult to predict how many or where shale oil and gas drilling  operations may be constructed. Second, operators\u2019 use of effective best  practices to mitigate risk may vary. Third, based on the studies we  reviewed, there are relatively few that are based on evaluating  predevelopment conditions to postdevelopment conditions\u2014making it  difficult to detect or attribute adverse changes to shale oil and gas  development. In addition, changes to the federal, state, and local  regulatory environment and the effectiveness in implementation and  enforcement will affect operators\u2019 future activities. Moreover, risks of  adverse events, such as spills or accidents, may vary according to  business practices, which in turn, may vary across oil and gas companies  making it difficult to distinguish between risks that are inherent to the  development of shale oil and gas from risks that are specific to particular  business practices.", "To obtain additional perspectives on issues related to environmental and  public health risks, we interviewed a nonprobability sample of  stakeholders representing numerous agencies and organizations.
