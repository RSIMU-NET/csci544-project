Persistent deficiencies, such as inadequate management attention and review to ensure accurate and complete reporting, limited independent review and validation of data by audit services or other third parties, and inadequate training for those responsible for data gathering and reporting, continue to limit the quality of the 50-50 data submitted to Congress. GAO's previous reports over the last 7 years identified similar problems and recommended corrective actions, but DOD and the military services have failed to consistently implement corrective actions sufficient to resolve the deficiencies and alleviate data accuracy problems. The recurring nature of these problems indicates a management control weakness as defined under the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act. Reported projections do not represent reasonable estimates of public- and private-sector depot maintenance funding allocations for fiscal years 2005 through 2006 because some data errors and omissions in DOD's prior-year report are carried into the projected years. It is difficult to project out-year data due to factors such as changing depot maintenance requirements, the ongoing consolidation of maintenance facilities, and the trend toward more contractor logistics support for new and existing weapon systems. Although DOD's current 50-50 report to Congress satisfies the annual mandate, it lacks additional detail that might be useful to Congress as it exercises its oversight role. The report currently submitted by DOD contains data that are aggregated at a high level and provides no analysis of changes from the prior years or long-term trends. The report also does not identify actual funding and workload distribution variances from year to year, nor explain the reasons behind them.

The Secretary of Defense may waive the 50 percent  limitation if he determines the waiver is necessary for national security, and  he submits notification of the waiver along with the reasons for the waiver  to Congress.  For fiscal year 2004, DOD issued the report on April 1, 2005.

This  is the eighth year that we have evaluated and reported on DOD\u2019s annual 50- 50 report to Congress.  Specifically, this report discusses whether (1) the  military departments complied with the 50-50 requirement for public and  private sector depot maintenance funding allocations in fiscal year 2004  and (2) the projections for public- and private-sector depot maintenance  funding allocations in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 represent reasonable  estimates.

We assessed the reliability of  the reported depot maintenance workload funding allocations for fiscal  year 2004 for each of the military services.  To assess the reliability of  DOD\u2019s data, we undertook a number of steps, including conducting  variance analyses and limited testing on reported funding allocations.   Based on the significance of funding variance from previous years and  other factors, we selected specific locations and weapons systems for more  in-depth reviews.  We conducted site visits, interviewed service officials  responsible for data collection, and reviewed the data for accuracy and  completeness.  For example, we verified reported obligations using the  source documents provided by service officials.  We also reviewed the  results of internal studies conducted by the service audit agencies or other  third parties, and reconciled areas of concern identified during prior years\u2019  audits.  As discussed below, we found that the reported private- and public- sector allocation data are not reliable because of long-standing systemic weaknesses in DOD's financial systems and persistent deficiencies in 50- 50 data reporting processes.  Our analysis of projected allocations for fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 was limited because our initial audit efforts identified  significant recurring problems in these areas.

Adjustments to the Army\u2019s reported public work  amounted to a $397 million decrease. The most significant of the errors in  public-sector depot maintenance reporting, $399.4 million, was due to a  transcription error.  The Army also overreported an additional $9.6 million  due to double-counting and $7.8 million for misclassifying private-sector  workload as public. Additionally, the Army underreported $18.4 million in  public-sector depot maintenance funding at the Aviation and Missile  Command and the Communications and Electronics Command and did not  report nearly $0.9 million in depot maintenance funding for the FOX  vehicle. Adjustments to the Army\u2019s private sector workload resulted in a  net increase of $49.6 million mostly due to unreporting or underreporting.  The Army did not report private depot work for onetime repairs at a  nondepot aviation location in the amount of $20.7 million. The Army also  failed to report $2.2 million in private depot work at Anniston Army Depot  and $6.2 million in private depot work at a National Guard aviation  classification and repair depot.

(See table 4 in app. II for a detailed breakout of these adjustments.)", "The Navy\u2019s most significant data inaccuracies generally were due to  unreported private depot funding and overreported public depot funding.   For example, as we reported in past years, the Navy did not report  $80.3 million in depot maintenance funding for work accomplished during  the nuclear refueling of aircraft carriers, citing the exclusion of nuclear  refueling from the 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2460 definition of \u201cdepot maintenance.\u201d  We  continue to believe that depot maintenance repairs not directly associated  with the task of nuclear refueling should be reported because these types  of repair actions are reported by other organizations and it is possible to  identify the funding for these tasks in Navy contracts and financial systems.   The Navy also, as in prior years, inconsistently reported on inactivation  activities related to the servicing and preservation of systems and  equipment prior to their placement in storage or on inactive status.   Specifically, the Navy did not report $14.4 million of private-sector  allocations for inactivation work on non-nuclear ships, even though it  reported private-sector funding for the inactivation for nuclear ships.  The  Navy contends that the work for nuclear ship inactivation is complex while  the work for non-nuclear ships is not.  We maintain that all such depot-level  work should be reported, since the statute and implementing guidance do  not make a distinction based on complexity.  Additionally, the Navy\u2019s  public-sector depot maintenance allocation was overreported by  $357.6 million because of errors in reporting obligations for funds available  to be spent over multiple years.  Navy and OSD guidance requires that  commands only report the funds actually obligated in the fiscal year.  We  found that some Naval Sea Systems Command activities incorrectly  reported the funds available for obligation for depot maintenance in fiscal  year 2004 instead of the funds that were actually obligated.  As a result,  some of the amounts included in the Navy\u2019s 50-50 report were not obligated  during fiscal year 2004.  Additionally, multiyear funds from a prior year  appropriation that were obligated in fiscal year 2004 were not, but should  have been, included.", "Our review of the Marine Corps\u2019 2004 data found that it underreported the  public-sector total by about $1.3 million for maintenance work performed  at other military service depots.  In previous years, the Marine Corps\u2019 error  rate was relatively high compared to that of the other services despite its  smaller depot maintenance program.  Based on our recommendation from  last year, the Marine Corps addressed a key contributor to its high error  rate by appointing a 50-50 focal point for the Marine Corps Systems  Command, the command responsible for acquiring and upgrading weapon  systems.  The focal point is responsible for preparing and submitting a  consolidated report for the command\u2019s depot maintenance funding  allocation between the public and private sectors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Air Force", "paragraphs": ["Adjusting the Air Force\u2019s data on the basis of the specific inaccuracies we  identified would increase its total depot maintenance funding by  $0.3 million but would not change the percentage allocation between the  public and private sectors.

For example, we were unable to verify the total amount in private- sector workload funding allocation for air crew training devices used to  train active duty air crews.  According to the Air Force, all air crew training  devices are operated and maintained through contractor logistics support  contracts.  The depot maintenance portion for these contracts is computed  by taking a percentage of the cost incurred against a selected contract line  item or, in some instances, a percentage of the entire amount obligated for  the year.  DOD\u2019s 50-50 guidance allows algorithms to be used when precise  determinations cannot be made; however, the line items included and the  percentages used are largely determined by the contractor, and the Air  Force lacks access to the data needed to validate the percentages used.", "Additionally, the Air Force incorrectly reported amounts for depot  maintenance warranties in its fiscal year 2004 50-50 data.  The Air Force\u2019s  guidance states that onetime obligations for warranties over extended  periods will be prorated for each year over the life of the warranty.   However, OSD guidance states that although warranty support that occurs  prior to initial operating capability shall not be reported as depot  maintenance and repair, warranty support that is contracted for prior to  initial operating capability but occurs after initial operating capability shall  be reported.  Also, the total warranty costs for depot maintenance and  repair services are to be reported in the year in which the obligation  occurs.  Therefore, consistent with OSD guidance, the Air Force should  have reported all amounts obligated for warranties for depot maintenance  repair that cover periods after initial operating capability in the year the  obligations were made.", "Although we found the aforenoted inaccuracies, overall the Air Force\u2019s  data had the least problems.  Additionally, the Air Force correctly included  contract administrative and oversight costs in its fiscal year 2004 data.  In  previous years, the Air Force adjusted its reported amounts for contract  administration and oversight costs, which decreased the amount of funding  for the private sector and increased funding for the public sector.  We  repeatedly reported that this adjustment was not consistent with 50-50  guidance, which states that costs should be associated with the end  product (i.e., the repaired item), and that the costs should be treated as  contracting expenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Persistent Deficiencies Continue to Limit Accuracy of Reported Data", "paragraphs": ["Systemic weakness in DOD\u2019s financial systems and persistent deficiencies,  such as inadequate management attention and review to ensure accurate  and complete reporting, limited independent review and validation of 50-50  data by audit agencies or other third parties, and inadequate training for  those responsible for data collection and reporting continue to limit the  accuracy of the 50-50 data provided to Congress.

Of these recommendations 19 have been officially closed by GAO.  The 14  recommendations that remain open contain several recurring themes.   Table 2 summarizes the number of times these themes are mentioned in the  14 open recommendations as well as the number of times these themes  have been recommended throughout the course of the past 7 years of  reviewing DOD\u2019s 50-50 depot maintenance report.", "The problems in DOD\u2019s 50-50 data reporting processes have not been  disclosed in DOD\u2019s annual accountability reports to Congress, even though  the problems have been previously identified in prior audits, and in our  view result in more than a remote risk that significant misstatements will  not be prevented or detected.  As a result, managers or oversight officials\u2019  decisions based on this reporting\u2014to include workload or funding allocation decisions\u2014may be adversely affected.  Title 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c)  requires that management controls be in place to reasonably ensure that  obligations and costs comply with the applicable law; all assets are  safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, and misappropriation of  assets; and revenues and expenditures are properly reported and  accounted for.  Management controls are the organization, policies, and  procedures that help managers achieve results and safeguard the integrity  of their programs.  Title 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c) also requires agency heads to  provide an annual statement of assurance on the effectiveness of the  management controls and to identify and report on material weaknesses.   As defined in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123,  Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control, December 21, 2004  (effective for Fiscal Year 2006), materiality for financial reporting is risk  of error or misstatement that could occur in a financial report that would  affect management\u2019s or users\u2019 decisions or conclusions based on such  report.  An official from OSD\u2019s Materiel Readiness and Maintenance Policy,  the office responsible for submitting the 50-50 report to Congress each  year, told us they had never evaluated whether DOD\u2019s 50-50 reporting  should be included in DOD\u2019s annual accountability report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Management Attention and Review", "paragraphs": ["One of the primary reasons for the recurring inaccuracies in the military  services\u2019 50-50 data was inadequate management attention and review to  ensure accurate and complete reporting.

Additionally, little documentation is provided  to the military service\u2019s 50-50 data focal points or the reporting commands\u2019  focal points to support the data included in the 50-50 report.  In prior  reports we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the military  services to provide more management review at all levels in DOD to ensure  accurate and complete reporting.  Despite these recommendations, the  services have limited policies and procedures for such management review.   For example, an Army official told us that no one checks the accuracy of  the data or performs a variance analysis with previously reported data.  Our  variance analysis of the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2004 data compared with the  fiscal year 2003 data resulted in identifying nearly $400 million in  overreported public-sector workload funding allocations due to a  transcription error.

Moreover, during our review of the Navy\u2019s U.S. Pacific Fleet,  we found the Southwest Regional Maintenance Facility did not maintain  documentation to support the amounts it reported.  It took the facility more  than a month to recreate a list of the transactions to support the $339.3 million in workload funding allocation data reported for fiscal year  2004.  Additionally, the Naval Audit Service could not verify the amount of  public-sector depot maintenance workload funding allocation for the Puget  Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility.

The Army Audit Agency did not review  the accuracy of the 50-50 data submitted to Congress.  The Army hired a  consulting firm to review and validate its 50-50 data for fiscal year 2004.   The firm selected a statistical sample of the reported allocations to review.   However, due to time constraints, the Army did not correct several of the  errors identified by the consulting firm prior to submitting the report to  Congress.  Naval Audit Service identified errors in the Navy\u2019s data, which  were corrected before the 50-50 report went to Congress.  However, the  Naval Audit Service\u2019s review was limited to two activities, which accounted  for only 6 percent of the Navy\u2019s reported depot maintenance funding for  fiscal year 2004.  Furthermore, although it did not review 100 percent of  transactions, the results and errors found during the review were  considered an indicator that similar errors might exist at the other eight  Navy reporting organizations.  Due to time constraints, the Naval Audit  Service did not attempt to determine the underlying cause for the errors  identified.  Air Force Audit Agency focused its review on contractor  logistics support/interim contractor support maintenance programs, an  area where problems in 50-50 reporting had been identified in the past.  The  contracts reviewed by the audit agency represented about three-fourths of  the contractor logistics support/interim contractor support programs.   Errors identified by the Air Force Audit Agency were corrected prior to  submitting the report to Congress.

For example, while the Army projects that its private-sector depot  maintenance workload allocation will be around 46 percent, the magnitude  of the adjustments we made to the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2004 data\u2014increasing  the private-sector percentage by about 4.2 percentage points\u2014when  carried forward, could cause the Army to exceed the 50-50 limitation.   Similarly, the Navy projects that its private-sector depot maintenance  workload allocation for fiscal year 2006 will be around 48 percent.  The  magnitude of the adjustments we made to the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2004  data\u2014increasing the private-sector percentage by about 2.4 percentage  points\u2014when carried forward, could cause the Navy to exceed the 50-50  limitation.", "DOD has agreed that 50-50 data within 2 percentage points of exceeding the  50 percent threshold is a reasonable trigger for additional oversight and  management to ensure compliance with the 50 percent threshold.  Last  year, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct each military  department\u2019s secretary, within 30 days of reporting 50-50 data indicating  that past, current, or budget year data are within 2 percentage points of  exceeding the 50 percent threshold, to submit a plan to OSD that identifies  actions the military department shall take to ensure continued compliance,  including the identification of decisions on candidate maintenance  workload sourcing that could be made to support remaining within the 50 percent threshold.  To date, none of the services have provided such  plans because their reported data did not indicate that such submissions  were necessary.", "Additionally, increasing contractor maintenance support for military  operations and increasing the number of new weapon systems scheduled  to reach initial operational capability in fiscal year 2007 and beyond could  result in all the military departments exceeding the 50 percent threshold.   During our review, the Air Force provided evidence that it has integrated  50-50 reporting requirements into its source of repair decisions for new  weapon systems and major system modifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Current 50-50 Report Satisfies the Annual Mandate but Could Provide More Useful Data and Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD\u2019s current 50-50 report to Congress satisfies the annual  mandate, it lacks additional detail that might be useful to Congress as it  exercises its oversight role.  For example, the report provides no analysis  of the data to show how the fiscal year 2004 funding allocations compared  to prior years\u2019 figures.  Furthermore, the reported data are aggregated at  the service level.  The report also does not identify funding allocation  variances from year to year, nor explain the reasons behind them.   Additionally, the report does not contain analysis of long-term trends;  historical trend data must be calculated using previous 50-50 reports.  Finally, DOD\u2019s 50-50 report to Congress does not contain information about  the methodologies used to prepare the current and future year projections  or the reasons for projected funding variances and changes in workload  distribution.", "Because of the limited data provided in DOD\u2019s 50-50 report, we have  developed these types of information as part of our mandated work over  the past 8 years to better meet Congress\u2019s needs in exercising its oversight  role.  Our analysis of trend data shows that although reported depot  maintenance funding for fiscal year 2004 increased by about $700 million  over fiscal year 2003, only the Army\u2019s total funding and private-sector  workload allocation increased significantly.  Compared to the other  services, the Army reported the largest increase in total funding (almost  $1.8 billion) and the largest jump in workload funding allocation to the  private sector.  With this increase, the Army\u2019s reported private sector  allocation is on par with those of the other services.  The Navy shows the  biggest overall decrease in depot workload funding allocation (almost  $1.3 billion), and the Air Force shows little change.

As a result, the reported 50-50 data cannot  be relied on to provide an accurate measure of the balance of funding  between the public and private sectors or to determine if the military  services exceeded the statutory limitations set by Congress for private- sector depot-level maintenance funding allocations.  By disclosing the  persistent deficiencies in the 50-50 reporting processes as a management  control weakness, along with planned corrective actions, in future  accountability reports, DOD will increase the level of management  attention and help focus improvement efforts so that the data provided to  Congress are accurate and complete.", "The data DOD provides in its annual 50-50 report to Congress satisfy the  annual mandate but lack additional detail that may well be useful to  Congress as it exercises its oversight role.  Until DOD provides additional  information and analysis on changes in depot maintenance funding and  allocations, significant variances from the prior year\u2019s report, and  methodologies used to estimate workload allocation projections for the  current and ensuing fiscal years in its annual 50-50 report, Congress will  continue to be hindered in its ability to exercise effective oversight.   Additionally, the extent of the percentage adjustments we find each year,  coupled with the persistent lack of progress by the Army and the Navy  toward improving their reporting processes and data quality, indicate that  DOD cannot afford to wait until the services reach the 50 percent limit  before formulating and providing a plan that identifies actions the military  departments will take to avoid exceeding the threshold for private-sector  funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the accuracy and reliability of depot maintenance funding  allocation data submitted to Congress and to provide congressional  decision makers with better information on funding allocations, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following two actions.", "We recommend that the Secretary, in future accountability reports, disclose  a management control weakness in DOD\u2019s 50-50 data reporting processes  along with planned corrective actions to improve management control in  the following areas:  Management review, attention, and policies sufficient to ensure accurate  and complete 50-50 reporting.", "Independent review and validation of 50-50 data by service audit  agencies or other third parties, with auditor-identified data inaccuracies  corrected prior to submission of the annual report to Congress.", "Annual training on 50-50 policies and procedures for all individuals  participating in data gathering and reporting.", "We also recommend that the Secretary enhance DOD\u2019s annual 50-50 report  submitted to Congress.

DOD agreed there were errors in the 50-50 report and stated that  it is committed to providing accurate data in its annual report to Congress,  has made improvements in its reporting over the past several years, and  will continue to improve.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense, in future accountability reports, disclose a management control  weakness in DOD\u2019s 50-50 data reporting processes along with planned  corrective actions to improve management control.  However, DOD did not  indicate that it would disclose its 50-50 data reporting processes as a  management control weakness in future accountability reports.  Instead,  DOD stated that it currently reports internal management control  weaknesses in its annual accountability reports.  The currently reported  weaknesses, however, are not specific to DOD\u2019s 50-50 data reporting  processes, and we continue to believe that the recurring nature of the  deficiencies we have found in DOD\u2019s 50-50 reporting processes indicates a  management control weakness significant enough to be reported  separately in DOD\u2019s annual accountability reports.  Neither DOD nor the  military services have consistently implemented corrective actions  sufficient to resolve the deficiencies. As discussed in the report, during the  past 7 years we have made 33 recommendations for improving 50-50  reporting.  Of these recommendations, 19 have been officially closed by  GAO.  The 14 recommendations that remain open contain several recurring  themes, which include the need for increased management attention to  ensure accurate and complete 50-50 reporting, independent review, and  validation of data and annual training on 50-50 policies and procedures for  all individuals participating in data gathering and reporting.  Nevertheless,  in its comments DOD stated that systemic changes to the reporting process  have already been made in response to previous recommendations. DOD  noted that it instituted third-party review of data by service audit agencies  and corrected auditor-identified data inaccuracies prior to submission of  the annual report to Congress.  While we agree that DOD has made  improvements in its reporting processes over the past several years, our  work nevertheless has identified persistent deficiencies in these processes  that continue to prevent us from determining whether the military  departments complied with the 50-50 requirement. For example, as we  reported, although each of the military services obtained some level of  independent review and validation this year, the reviews were constrained  by time and limited in scope.  Moreover, not all of the errors were corrected  prior to submission to Congress.  Disclosing 50-50 reporting processes as a  management control weakness in future accountability reports could  increase DOD management emphasis on addressing the persistent  deficiencies that continue to limit the accuracy and usefulness of the depot  maintenance funding allocation data reported to Congress.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense enhance DOD\u2019s annual 50-50 report submitted to Congress.   However, DOD stated that producing the types of information suggested in  our recommendation would require a massive undertaking and may be of  limited value.  We disagree.  We have developed these types of information  as part of our annual mandated review of DOD\u2019s 50-50 report, and the  information has been valuable in understanding and evaluating DOD\u2019s  depot maintenance funding allocations.  For example, we compared fiscal  year 2004 reported allocations for specific programs and reporting centers  with fiscal year 2003 allocations, and followed up with the military services  to determine the reasons for significant differences.  The goal of this  recommendation is not to place an unnecessary burden on the department  but to provide additional information on depot maintenance funding that  would make the annual 50-50 report to Congress more informative and  useful as an oversight tool.  Furthermore, we believe that if DOD would  provide more detailed and analytical information to Congress, it would  place additional emphasis on assuring the accuracy of the data provided in  its annual 50-50 report.", "Because it does not appear to us that DOD\u2019s actions will address the  persistent deficiencies we identified in its 50-50 reporting processes or  improve the usefulness of the information provided to Congress, we have  added a matter for congressional consideration suggesting that Congress  require the Secretary of Defense to enhance the department\u2019s annual 50-50  report as stated in our recommendations.", "DOD also stated in its written comments that its 50-50 data quality has  improved, as shown by reductions in the Navy\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s private- sector corrections.  DOD further noted that the Army\u2019s one transcription  error accounted for 99.3 percent of its private sector corrections.  Our  report does not conclude that the department\u2019s data quality has improved.   On the contrary, we state as in past years that DOD\u2019s 50-50 data, with our  adjustments, provide only a rough approximation of the allocation of depot  maintenance funding between the public and private sectors.  We reported  that DOD\u2019s April 1, 2005, report to Congress contained errors, omissions,  and inconsistencies that if corrected, would increase the Army\u2019s and Navy\u2019s  percentages of funding allocations going to the private sector.  Additionally,  we did not conduct a detailed review of all reported 50-50 data; therefore,  there may be additional errors, omissions, and inconsistencies that were  not identified during our review. We agree that the Army\u2019s $399.4 million  transcription error was the single largest correction we identified.   However, this error involved a public-sector correction rather than a  private-sector correction as DOD stated.  We noted several other errors in  the Army\u2019s data for both the public and private sectors, as shown in table 3  of this report. We continue to believe that adequate management attention  and review of 50-50 data to ensure accurate and complete reporting would  have helped identify the transcription error and other errors prior to  submitting the data to DOD and Congress.", "DOD believes, based on guidance from the General Counsel\u2019s office in the  Department of the Navy, that it has properly excluded depot maintenance  associated with nuclear carrier refueling and inactivation work performed  on non-nuclear ships.  We have disagreed in prior years with DOD\u2019s  decision to exclude these types of depot maintenance repairs from its 50-50  reports.  As discussed in our report, we continue to believe that depot  maintenance repairs not directly associated with the task of refueling of  nuclear aircraft carriers should be included in DOD\u2019s annual report to  Congress.  We also continue to believe that inactivation work performed on  non-nuclear ships should be included in DOD\u2019s report.", "DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director,  Office of Management and Budget.

Certain programs, reporting centers, and maintenance  activities were identified for in-depth reviews.  In particular, we focused  on those reporting locations, programs, and issues that Department of  Defense (DOD) personnel and we identified as problem areas in current  and past reviews as well as those that had experienced significant funding  variances over time.  We did not conduct a detailed review of all reported  50-50 data; therefore there may be additional errors, omissions, and  inconsistencies that were not identified.", "As part of these in-depth reviews, we conducted site visits to departmental  headquarters, major commands, selected maintenance activities, and  reporting centers; interviewed the service officials involved with the data  collection; and reviewed the data utilized for accuracy and completeness.   Our data verification efforts included examining summary records,  accounting reports, budget submissions, and contract documents.  We also  reviewed DOD, military service, and command-specific guidance for  collecting and aggregating 50-50 data.

Additionally, we reviewed  prior years\u2019 recommendations to determine whether known problem areas  were being addressed and resolved.  We applied this knowledge to identify  additional areas for improving the reporting process and management  controls.  We examined the process used to compile the reports and the  data reported to determine that it was consistent and in compliance with  legislative requirements and to identify any errors, omissions, or  inconsistencies in the data reported.  We discussed with officials managing  and coordinating the reporting process their efforts to address known  problem areas and respond to recommendations by internal audit agencies  and GAO.", "Our analysis of the data for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 was limited because  our audit efforts identified significant recurring problems in this area of the  report.  To determine whether DOD\u2019s projected allocations for the current  fiscal year and ensuing fiscal year were reasonable, we performed certain  checks and tests, including variance analyses, to judge the consistency of  this information with data from prior years and with the future years\u2019  budgeting and programming data used in DOD\u2019s budget submissions and  reports to Congress.  We found repeated and significant changes, even  though the estimates were prepared only about 1 year apart.", "We used the results of our analysis of fiscal year 2005 and 2006 projections  to further discuss with officials, and analyze the reasons behind, changes in  reported data and percentage allocations between the 2004 and 2005 50-50  reports submitted to Congress.  Our current and past work on this issue has  shown that DOD\u2019s 50-50 data cannot be relied upon as a precise measure of  the allocation of depot maintenance funds between the public and private  sectors.  However, the mandate in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2466 requires (1) DOD to  report the data, which are the only data available and accepted and used  for DOD decision making and for congressional oversight, and (2) us to  submit our views on whether DOD has complied with the 50-50  requirement to Congress.  While DOD\u2019s data cannot be relied upon to  provide a precise measure of the funding between the public and private  sectors, the data, along with our adjustments, provide a rough  approximation of the allocations and some trends that may be useful to  Congress in exercising its oversight role and to DOD officials in managing  the depot maintenance program.  Concerns about the accuracy and  completeness of the 50-50 data available were considered and incorporated  into our methodology and approach to reviewing the fiscal year 2004  report.  Along with the limitations on the 50-50 data available from DOD,  the constrained time frame for our review limited the extent to which our  analysis could be relied upon to identify all the errors, inconsistencies, and  omissions in DOD\u2019s data.  We recognize that we have not been able to  comprehensively identify all of the errors and omissions in the 50-50 report  for fiscal year 2004.  However, we were able to conclude that the reported  depot maintenance workload funding allocations were not sufficiently  reliable for accurately determining whether the military departments  complied with the 50-50 requirement for fiscal year 2004.
