As  you know, however, VA has encountered persistent challenges in  managing IT to produce results and improve performance.", "When we testified before the subcommittee last April, a new secretary of  veterans affairs had just been confirmed and an executive-level security  officer had been hired.To his credit, the secretary readily seized upon the  seriousness of the issues that have been raised concerning VA\u2019s IT  program, and committed to reforming how the department uses  information technology.  Since then, VA has also hired a department-level  chief information officer (CIO) to lead its IT program.  We view this  executive leadership as a positive and significant step forward in the  department\u2019s attempt to achieve better returns on its IT investments.  However, VA\u2019s IT investment and management challenges are significant,  and its ability to resolve them with the right combination of people,  processes, and technology that are focused on achieving solid results will  take sustained time, effort, and commitment.", "At your request, we have been reviewing VA's continuing actions to  address critical weaknesses in its overall IT program.  Today, we will share  with you the results of our work to date regarding VA\u2019s actions since last  April to  develop an enterprise architecture;  implement the Veterans Benefits Administration's veterans service  network project that is intended to replace its existing compensation  and pension payment system with a new system;  extend the usage of, and standardize data collection for, the Veterans  Health Administration's decision support system, being used to  facilitate managers\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 analyses of patient care and cost of  providing health care services; and  implement jointly with the Department of Defense and Indian Health  Service, the government computer-based patient record initiative,  which was intended to allow physicians and users to access data in  each others\u2019 health information systems.", "In doing this work, we analyzed relevant documentation and interviewed  key agency officials to identify and assess VA\u2019s progress in implementing  specific actions since April 2001 related to developing an enterprise  architecture, improving information security, developing the Veterans  Benefits Administration\u2019s veterans service network compensation and  pension replacement system, extending usage of the Veterans Health  Administration\u2019s decision support system, and advancing data sharing via  the government computer-based patient record project.

As a result of their  leadership, VA has made important strides in raising corporate awareness  of the department\u2019s needs and in articulating and acting upon a vision for  achieving improvements in key areas of IT performance.  Despite this  progress, however, many aspects of VA\u2019s IT environment remain  troublesome, and our message today reflects concerns that we have long  viewed as significant impediments to the department\u2019s effective use of IT  to achieve optimal agency performance.  As such, VA has more work to  accomplish before it can point to real improvement in overall program  performance and be assured that it has a stable, reliable, and modernized  systems environment to effectively support critical agency decisionmaking  and operations.", "In an area of growing importance, VA has taken key steps in laying the  groundwork for an integrated, departmentwide enterprise architecture\u2014a  blueprint for evolving its information systems and developing new systems  that optimize their mission value.  Crucial executive support has been  established and the department has put in place a strategy to define  products and processes that are critical to its development.  VA is also  currently recruiting a chief architect to assist in implementing and  managing the enterprise architecture.  Significant work, nonetheless, is  still required before the department will have a functioning enterprise  architecture in place for acquiring and utilizing information systems across  VA in a cost-effective and efficient manner.  VA\u2019s success in developing,  implementing, and using a complete and enforceable enterprise  architecture hinges upon continued attention to putting in place a sound  program management structure\u2014including a permanent chief architect  and an established program office\u2014to facilitate, manage, and advance this  effort and to be held accountable for its success.  In addition, VA must  continue to take steps to identify and collect crucial information  describing essential business functions, information flows, strategic plans,  and requirements, and produce a well-thought-out sequencing plan that  considers management and organizational changes and business goals and  operations.  Success also hinges on having proactive management focused  on ensuring that investment management and systems development and  acquisition are closely linked with the enterprise architecture processes.  This integration must be done in a manner that best suits the agency\u2019s  particular organization, culture, and internal management practices.", "Information security management is another area in which VA has taken  important steps to strengthen its department-level program, including  mandating information security performance standards and, thus, greater  management accountability for senior executives.  It has also updated  security policies, procedures, and standards to guide the implementation  of critical security measures.  However, VA continues to report pervasive  and serious information security weaknesses.  Thus far, its actions toward  establishing a comprehensive computer security management program  have not been sufficient to ensure that the department can protect its  computer systems, networks, and sensitive veterans health care and  benefits data from unnecessary exposure to vulnerabilities and risks.  Moreover, VA\u2019s current organizational structure does not ensure that the  cyber security officer can effectively oversee and enforce compliance with  security policies and procedures that are being implemented throughout  the department.", "Beyond these two key areas of IT management concern, VA and its  administrations also have continued to pursue several critical information  systems investments that have consumed substantial time and resources,  with mixed success.  For example, after about 16 years and at least $335  million spent on modernization, the Veterans Benefits Administration  (VBA) is still far from a modernized system to replace its aging benefits  delivery network, needed to more effectively support its compensation  and pension and other vital benefits payment processes.  VBA has not  adequately addressed several longstanding concerns related to project  management, requirements development, and testing\u2014all of which raise  uncertainty about whether the ongoing veterans service network  (VETSNET) project will deliver a cost-effective solution with measurable  and specific program-related benefits.", "Conversely, the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA) managers and  clinicians have made good progress in expanding their use of the decision  support system (DSS) to facilitate clinical and financial decisionmaking.  The use of DSS data for the fiscal year 2002 resource allocation process  and a requirement that veteran integrated service network directors better  account for their use of this system have both raised awareness of and  promoted its utility among VHA facilities.  Moreover, VHA has begun steps  to further improve the accuracy and timeliness of DSS data. As VHA-wide  usage of DSS progresses, sustained top management attention will be  crucial to ensuring the continued success of this system.", "Lastly, VA has achieved limited progress in its joint efforts with the  Department of Defense and Indian Health Service to create an interface  for sharing data in their health information systems, as part of the  government computer-based patient record initiative. Strategies for  implementing the project continue to be revised, its scope has been  substantially narrowed, and it continues to operate without clear lines of  authority or comprehensive, coordinated plans. Consequently, the future  success of this project remains uncertain, raising questions as to whether  it will ever fully achieve its original objective of allowing health care  professionals to share clinical information via a comprehensive, lifelong  medical record."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Promising Beginning, but VA Remains Far from Implementing an Enterprise Architecture", "paragraphs": ["One of VA\u2019s most essential yet challenging undertakings has been  developing and implementing an enterprise architecture to guide the  department\u2019s IT efforts.

Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidelinesrequire VA and other federal agencies to develop and  implement enterprise architectures to provide a framework for evolving or  maintaining existing and planned IT. Guidance issued last year by the  Federal CIO Council in collaboration with us further emphasizes the  importance of enterprise architectures in evolving information systems,  developing new systems, and inserting new technologies that optimize an  organization\u2019s mission value.", "As this subcommittee is well aware, VA has been attempting to develop an  enterprise architecture for several years, but without much overall  success. Our prior reports and testimony have documented how VA\u2019s  previous attempts have fallen short of their intended purpose and did not  reflect an approach that would result in an integrated, departmentwide  blueprint. For example, VA\u2019s earlier strategy had called for each of its  administrations\u2014VBA, VHA, and the National Cemetery Administration\u2014  to develop its own logical architecture, which likely would not have  resulted in the department\u2019s having an integrated architecture, but rather,  at least three separate, unrelated architectures. In addition, VA\u2019s common  business lines had not been adequately involved in prior attempts to  develop an architecture. In July 1998 and August 2000, respectively, we  recommended that VA take actions to develop a detailed implementation  plan with milestones for completing an integrated, departmentwide  architecture, and that it include VA business owners in its architecture  development.

Its most recent set of  activities closely adhere to the Federal CIO Council\u2019s suggested guidance  on managing the enterprise architecture program.", "By effectively implementing an enterprise architecture, VA stands to  realize a number of important and tangible benefits. For example, an  enterprise architecture can  capture facts about the department\u2019s mission, functions, and business  foundation in an understandable manner to promote better planning  and decisionmaking;  improve communication among the department\u2019s business  organizations and IT organizations through a standardized  vocabulary; and  provide architectural views that help communicate the complexity of  VA\u2019s large systems and facilitate management of its extensive,  complex environments.", "Overall, effective implementation of an enterprise architecture can  facilitate VA\u2019s IT management by serving to inform, guide, and constrain  the decisions being made for the department, and subsequently decreasing  the risk of buying and building systems that are duplicative, incompatible,  and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface.", "As depicted in figure 1, developing, implementing, and maintaining an  enterprise architecture is a dynamic, iterative process of changing the  enterprise over time by incorporating new business processes, new  technology, and new capabilities. Depending on the size of the agency\u2019s  operations and the complexity of its environment, enterprise architecture  development and implementation requires sustained attention to process  management and agency action over an extended period of time.  Moreover, once implemented, the enterprise architecture requires regular  upkeep and maintenance to ensure that it is kept current and accurate.  Periodic reassessments are necessary to ensure that the enterprise  architecture remains aligned with the department\u2019s strategic mission and  priorities, changing business practices, funding profiles, and technology  innovation.", "A prerequisite to development of the enterprise architecture is sustained  sponsorship and strong commitment achieved through buy-in of the  agency head, leadership of the CIO, and early designation of a chief  architect. Further, the establishment of an architectural team is necessary  to define an agency-specific architectural approach and process. The cycle  for completing an enterprise architecture highlights the need for constant  monitoring and oversight of architectural activities and progress, and for  architecture development teams to work closely with agency business line  executives to produce a description of the agency\u2019s operations, a vision of  the future, and an investment and technology strategy for accomplishing  defined business goals. The architecture is maintained through continuous  modification to reflect the agency\u2019s current baseline and target business  practices, organizational goals, vision, technology, and infrastructure.", "In initiating its enterprise architecture process, VA has applied key  principles of the Federal CIO Council\u2019s guidance and has put in place  some core elements of the council\u2019s enterprise architecture framework.  For example, in the area of executive commitment, the department has  obtained crucial buy-in and support from the secretary, department-level  CIO, and other senior executives and business teams; this is essential to  raising awareness of and leveraging participation in developing the  architecture. As evidence of his commitment, last April the secretary  established a team made up of VA senior management business line and  information technology professionals to develop an enterprise  architecture strategy. The team met on weekends over the course of about  60 days and, in August 2001, issued an executive enterprise architecture  strategy that articulates the department\u2019s policy and principles governing  the development, implementation, and maintenance of VA\u2019s enterprise  architecture.", "VA is in the process of establishing committees to manage, control, and  monitor activities and progress in fully developing and implementing its  enterprise architecture. For example, VA\u2019s information technology board  has begun functioning as the department\u2019s enterprise architecture  executive steering committee, with responsibility for directing, overseeing,  and approving core elements and actions of the enterprise architecture  program. As part of VA\u2019s actions to develop and advance its enterprise  architecture, it has also chartered an enterprise architecture council\u2014  which when activated\u2014is expected to assist in developing project  priorities and performing management reviews and evaluations of IT  project proposals. In addition, VA is in the process of establishing an  enterprise architecture program management office and, over the last 8  months, has been recruiting a permanent chief architect to provide overall  leadership and guidance for the enterprise architecture program. These  management entities are essential for ensuring that the department\u2019s IT  investments are aligned with the enterprise architecture and optimize the  interdependencies and interrelationships among business operations and  the underlying IT that supports them.", "Further, as part of its enterprise architecture strategy, VA has chosen a  highly recognized enterprise architecture framework that will be used to  organize the structure of the architecture. To facilitate its selection of a  framework, VA consulted with experts from the private sector and  borrowed lessons learned from officials involved in architecture  development at other federal agencies.", "VA has begun defining its current architecture, an important step for  ensuring that future progress can be measured against such a baseline, and  is also developing its future (target) telecommunications architecture. In  addition, to assist in the management of new IT initiatives, VA is  considering using a system that it has designed to link the management of  its enterprise architecture program to the department\u2019s capital planning  and project management. It is also considering using a Web-based tool that  it has designed to collect data on business rules, requirements, and  processes that will be integrated into the enterprise architecture  management process.", "While VA has taken several important steps forward, it is important to note  that the department has many more critical work steps ahead in  implementing and managing its enterprise architecture. Using the Federal  CIO Council\u2019s enterprise architecture guide as a basis for analysis, table 1  illustrates some key steps that have been accomplished, along with  examples of the many critical actions VA must still address to implement  and sustain its enterprise architecture program. Accomplishing these  remaining steps will require continued and substantial time, effort, and  commitment.", "Among the key activities requiring immediate attention is establishment of  a program management office headed by a permanent chief architect to  manage the development and maintenance of the enterprise architecture.  VA has begun establishing such an office and is currently recruiting a chief  architect. However, until the department has an office that is fully staffed  with experienced architects and hires a chief architect with the requisite  core competencies, it will continue to lack the management and oversight  necessary to ensure the success of its enterprise architecture program.  Further, until the department has completed an implementation plan that  delineates how it will develop, use, and maintain the enterprise  architecture, it will lack definitive guidance for effectively managing the  enterprise architecture program.", "Further, a lot of work lies ahead related to VA\u2019s efforts toward developing  its baseline and target architectures. A crucial first step in building the  enterprise architecture is identifying and collecting existing products that  describe the agency as it exists today and as it is intended to look and  operate in the future. While VA has developed a baseline application  inventory to describe its \u201cas is\u201d state, it has not yet completed validating  the inventory, or completed detailed application profiles for the inventory,  including essential information such as business functions, information  flows, and external interface descriptions. Similarly, to define its vision of  future business operations and supporting technology, VA must still  collect crucial information for its target architecture, including  information on its proposed business processes, strategic plans, and  requirements.", "Beyond these planning and development activities, VA will also have to  ensure the successful transition and implementation of its enterprise  architecture. Evolving the agency from its baseline to the target  architecture will require concurrent, interdependent activities and  incremental development. As such, VA will need to develop and maintain a  sequencing plan to provide a step-by-step approach for moving from the  baseline to the target architecture. Development of this sequencing plan  should consider a variety of factors, including sustaining of operations  during the transition, anticipated management and organizational changes,  and business goals and operational priorities. Ultimately, VA\u2019s success in  using the architecture will depend on active management and receptive  project personnel, along with effective integration of the enterprise  architecture process with other enterprise life cycle processes.", "A key aspect of VA\u2019s enterprise architecture program is the integration of  security practices into the enterprise architecture. The CIO Council has  articulated guidelines for doing so. For example, the architecture policy  should include security practices and the architecture team should include  security experts. In its enterprise architecture strategy document, VA has  committed to including security in all elements of its enterprise  architecture. Further, VA\u2019s executive-level security officer served as a  member of its architecture team. As VA moves forward in developing,  implementing, and using its enterprise architecture, we would expect it to  include information security details relating to the design, operations,  encryption, vulnerability, access, and use of authentication processes. A  commitment to building information security into all elements of its  enterprise architecture program is essential to helping VA meet the  challenges that it faces in protecting its information systems and sensitive  data.", "As VA moves forward with its enterprise architecture management  program, it should ensure that remaining critical process steps outlined in  the federal CIO guidance are sufficiently addressed and completed within  reasonable timeframes. With the enhanced management capabilities  provided by an enterprise architecture framework, VA should be able to  (1) better focus on the strategic use of emerging technologies to manage  its information, (2) achieve economies of scale by providing mechanisms  for sharing services across the department, and (3) expedite the  integration of legacy, migration, and new systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Security Challenges Continue to Require Top Management Attention", "paragraphs": ["Information security continues to be among the top challenges that the  department must contend with.

For example, while VA has begun to develop an inventory of known  security weaknesses, it continues to be without a comprehensive, centrally  managed process that will enable it to identify, track, and analyze all  computer security weaknesses. Further, the updated security management  plan does not articulate critical actions that VA will need to take to correct  specific control weaknesses or the time frames for completing key actions.

Accordingly, a  contractor was hired in May 2001 to assess (1) whether the system  architecture will be capable of supporting VBA\u2019s projected future  workload, and (2) whether the system being developed will meet future  functional, performance, and security needs. The contractor reported last  September that the system architecture would be able to process VBA\u2019s  projected future workload.", "However, the contractor neither assessed nor reported on whether the  system will meet future functional business needs, and the scope of its  review did not generate sufficient information to fully evaluate and make  an informed decision on whether the project should proceed. The review  focused primarily on the system\u2019s ability to perform efficiently under a  heavy workload, and did not include user acceptance or the functional  testing that is needed to ensure that the system can fully satisfy user  requirements and that deployed software can be used without significant  errors. Further, the review did not fully address the security requirements  for the new system. VA\u2019s department-level CIO agreed that the scope of  the contractor\u2019s review had been limited to a technical review of whether  VETSNET could handle the anticipated workload. He also acknowledged  the need for functional testing and an integrated project plan.", "Similar concerns about VBA\u2019s strategy for the C&P replacement project  were also documented in an October 2001 report issued by the VA claims  processing task force. In its report, the task force emphasized that limited  user and functional testing posed a major problem for VBA in developing  and implementing its systems. The task force highlighted material  deficiencies in VBA\u2019s strategic planning and its implementation and  deployment of new and enhanced information technology products and  initiatives, as had been pointed out in an earlier report. Further, the task  force questioned whether VETSNET represented a viable long-term  solution, in part because it does not provide support for a redesigned and  integrated claims process across VA\u2019s administrations and offices.", "In commenting on these reports\u2019 findings, VBA\u2019s CIO stated that, by the  end of March 2002, her office anticipated completing a remediation plan  that will address the most critical concerns identified in the contractor\u2019s  review. She stated that the office is in the process of developing a  statement of work to obtain contractor support to develop additional  functional testing capability. The statement of work is scheduled for  completion in June 2002. In addition, the CIO is negotiating with relevant  VBA business groups to secure subject matter experts to validate business  requirements and assist with the functional testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VETSNET Deployment Delays Affect the Benefits Delivery Network", "paragraphs": ["If not promptly addressed, the problems and delays that have been noted  in implementing the VETSNET project could have critical cost  implications for the department and service delivery inefficiencies for the  veteran community. In particular, without a replacement system, VA must  continue to rely on the aging BDN to deliver its benefit payments, parts of  which were developed in the 1960s. Although the BDN was enhanced to  address year 2000 conversion issues, because of its anticipated  replacement, VBA has since made only limited investments in maintaining  it.", "Without additional maintenance, it is uncertain that the BDN will be able  to continue accurately processing the many benefits payments that VBA  must make. In its report, the claims processing task force warned that the  system\u2019s operations and support were approaching a critical stage, with  the potential for performance to degrade and eventually cease. The task  force recommended that the BDN be sustained and upgraded to ensure  that payments to veterans would remain prompt and uninterrupted until  VBA is able to field a replacement system. VBA officials have stated that  they are working on a plan to address this issue. This plan is expected to  include purchasing an additional mainframe computer to help extend the  system\u2019s operation until 2007\u2014the date by which new systems are planned  to be operational for all three benefits payment business lines.", "As you can see, Mr. Chairman, despite many years of work, VBA still has a  number of fundamental tasks to accomplish before it can successfully  complete development and implementation of the VETSNET project.  Before proceeding with this project, VBA must assess and validate users\u2019  requirements for the new system to ensure that business needs are met. It  also needs to complete testing of the system\u2019s functional business  capability, as well as end-to-end testing to ensure payments are made  accurately. Finally, it must establish an integrated project plan to guide its  transition from the old to the new system. Until VBA performs a complete  analysis of the initiative, as the secretary has indicated he would do, it is  questionable whether additional resources should be expended on  continued systems development activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Continues to Expand Its Use of DSS", "paragraphs": ["Unlike VBA\u2019s work on VETSNET, VHA continues to make progress in  expanding overall use of its decision support system (DSS). As you know,  DSS is an executive information system designed to provide VHA  managers and clinicians with data on patterns of patient care and patient  health outcomes, as well as the capability to analyze resource utilization  and the cost of providing health care services. VHA completed its  implementation of DSS in October 1998. However, in September 2000, we  testified that DSS had not been fully utilized since its implementation, and  noted that DSS was not being used for all the purposes intended.", "Last April, we testified that VHA had shown moderate progress in  increasing usage of DSS among its veterans integrated service networks  (VISN) and medical centers, and encouraged VA to continue providing top  management support to ensure that the system is fully utilized and that  financial and clinical benefits are realized. Our testimony noted several  efforts that VHA had undertaken to encourage greater use of DSS,  including using DSS data to support the fiscal year 2002 resource  allocation process and as a consideration in preparing VISN directors\u2019  year-end performance appraisals, requiring VISN directors to provide  examples of their reports and processes that rely on DSS data, and  ensuring that medical centers\u2019 processing of DSS data is current (no more  than 60 days old).", "VHA\u2019s initiatives to encourage greater use of DSS have yielded results. The  use of DSS data in the fiscal year 2002 allocation process has clearly raised  VHA\u2019s awareness about the importance of this information. VHA\u2019s most  recent DSS processing report, dated January 31, 2002, revealed that all 22  VISNs had completed processing fiscal year 2001 DSS data and that seven  VISNs had begun processing fiscal year 2002 data. Further, every VISN has  provided both clinical and financial examples of DSS usage, and this  information is now being considered in the quarterly reviews of the VISN  directors' performance. As a result, VHA\u2019s managers have grown more  knowledgeable about and have begun to make more informed decisions  regarding the cost of care being provided by their facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initiatives Are Being Taken to Improve the Accuracy, Timeliness, and Availability of DSS Data", "paragraphs": ["VHA continues to explore other initiatives to improve the accuracy and  completeness of DSS data. In response to a report issued by VA\u2019s inspector  general in March 1999,regarding the failure of some medical facilities to  follow the DSS basic structure for capturing workload data and associated  costs, VHA has taken several actions, including  implementing a VHA decision support system standardization  directive that requires annual standardization audits and the reporting  of consecutive repeat occurrences of non-compliance to the assistant  deputy under secretary for health;  developing an audit tool for use in determining a facility's compliance  with the DSS basic model for capturing workload data and associated  costs; and  performing a standardization audit in September 2001 to assess the  extent to which each facility\u2019s DSS departments and products  complied with national standards.", "Further, in response to managers\u2019 concerns that DSS data are not timely  and easy to access, the DSS program office initiated several actions. These  include establishing a working group last July to identify best practices  and recommend actions for improving processing efficiency and the  timeliness and availability of DSS data. To date, the working group has  provided all DSS sites with an updated monthly guide detailing each step  of the process, and has distributed a pharmacy rejects database and a step- by-step guide for processing these rejects. These products should help  increase the efficiency of the monthly processing and facilitate more  accurate and timely data. In addition, the program office has authorized  two sites to pilot test an application aimed at providing the end user or  manager with a user-friendly front end to display DSS information and  allow patient inquiry.", "In addition, several VISNs have independently begun exploring options for  providing easier access to DSS data. For example, one is examining the  feasibility of establishing a data warehouse where data extracted from  DSS can be transformed into a format that will facilitate queries and  reports that are simple to create and quick to run. Another has begun  building a data repository for use in creating an application to compile and  deliver data requested by managers or clinicians.", "Even with these accomplishments, however, top management involvement  and continued support will be critical to ensuring that VHA continues to  make progress in improving the operational efficiency and effectiveness of  DSS, and that it realizes the full clinical and financial benefits of this  system. In March 2001, oversight for the DSS program was transferred  from VHA\u2019s chief information officer to its chief financial officer. Since  that time, VHA has also assigned three different acting directors to lead  the program. However, VHA has not yet selected a permanent director to  provide consistent management and oversight. In addition, of 56 personnel  positions allotted to the DSS program office, 19 positions had not been  filled at the end of January 2002. Without a permanent director to lead the  DSS program or full staffing to support the system\u2019s operation, VHA runs  the risk that continued increases in usage of DSS, along with its associated  benefits, could be imperiled.", "Veterans integrated service network 13 (Minneapolis, Minnesota)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Government Computer-based Patient Record Initiative Is Moving Away From Its Original Goal", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, you also asked us to update you on VA\u2019s progress, in  conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Indian Health  Service (IHS), in achieving the ability to share patient health care data as  part of the government computer-based patient record (GCPR) project.  Having readily accessible data to facilitate services to our nations\u2019 military  personnel and others has proved particularly significant in light of recent  terrorist actions and the associated responses that have been required.", "The GCPR project developed out of VA and DOD discussions about ways  to share data in their health information systems and from efforts to create  electronic records for active duty personnel and veterans. As you know,  the patients served by VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s systems tend to be highly mobile,  and consequently, their health records may be at multiple federal and  nonfederal medical facilities, both in and outside of the United States. In  November 1997, the president called for the two departments to develop a  \u201ccomprehensive, life-long medical record for each service member,\u201d and in  August 1998\u20148 months after the GCPR project was officially  established\u2014issued a directive requiring VA and DOD to develop a  \u201ccomputer-based patient record system that will accurately and efficiently  exchange information.\u201d IHS later became involved because of its  expertise in population-based research and its longstanding relationship  with VA in caring for the Indian veteran population.", "As originally envisioned, GCPR was not intended to be a separate  computerized health information system, nor was it meant to replace VA\u2019s,  DOD\u2019s, and IHS\u2019s existing systems. Rather, it was intended to allow  physicians and other authorized users at these agencies\u2019 health facilities to  access data from any of the other agencies' health facilities by serving as  an electronic interface among their health information systems. The  interface was expected to compile requested patient information in a  temporary, \u201cvirtual\u201d record, that could be displayed on a user\u2019s computer  screen.", "In April 2001, we reported that expanding time frames and cost estimates,  as well as inadequate accountability and poor planning, tracking and  oversight, had raised doubts about GCPR\u2019s ability to provide the benefits  expected. In particular, we noted that the project\u2019s time frames had  significantly expanded and that its costs had continued to increase. In  addition, basic principles of sound IT project planning, development, and  oversight had not been followed, creating barriers to progress. For  example, clear goals and objectives had not been set; detailed plans for  developing, testing, and implementing the new software had not been  established; and critical decisions regarding goals, costs, and time frames  were not binding on all parties. Further, data exchange and privacy and  security issues critical to the project\u2019s success remained to be addressed.", "As a result of these concerns, we recommended that the three agencies (1)  designate a lead entity with final decisionmaking authority and establish a  clear line of authority for the GCPR project and (2) create comprehensive  and coordinated plans that included an agreed-upon mission and clear  goals, objectives, and performance measures, to ensure that the agencies  can share comprehensive, meaningful, accurate, and secure patient health  care data. In commenting on the report, VA, DOD, and IHS all concurred  with our findings and recommendations.", "Nonetheless, progress on the GCPR initiative continues to be  disappointing. The scope of the project increasingly has been narrowed  from its original objectives and it continues to proceed without a  comprehensive strategy. For example, in responding to our report, VA,  DOD, and IHS provided information on a new, near-term strategy for  GCPR. However, this revised strategy is considerably less encompassing  than the project was originally intended to be. Specifically, rather than  serve as an interface to allow data sharing across the three agencies\u2019  disparate systems, as originally envisioned, a first phase of the revised  strategy calls only for a one-way transfer of data from DOD\u2019s current  health care information system to a separate database that VA hospitals  can access. While even this degree of data sharing is a positive  development, VA\u2019s clinicians, nonetheless, will only be allowed to read,  but not perform any calculations on the data received. VA and DOD  officials had initially planned to implement this near-term capability in  November 2001, but recently stated that they now expect to do so by this  July 2002. Further, the officials stated that they plan to change the name of  the project to the Federal Health Information Exchange.", "Subsequent phases of the effort that were to further expand GCPR\u2019s  capabilities have also been revised. A second phase that would have  enabled information exchange among all three agencies\u2014VA, DOD, and  IHS\u2014is now expected to enable only a bilateral read-only exchange of  data between VA and IHS.", "Further, according to VA officials, plans for a third phase, which was to  expand GCPR\u2019s capabilities to public and private national health  information standards groups, are no longer being considered for the  project. Instead, the third phase is now expected to focus only on  expanding the data exchange between VA and IHS and allowing limited  data calculations and some translation of terminology between the two  agencies. Under the revised strategy, there are no plans for DOD to receive  data from VA.", "In addition, concerns expressed in our April 2001 report still need to be  addressed.  For example, the GCPR project continues to operate without  clear lines of authority or a lead entity responsible for final  decisionmaking. Last August, the VHA CIO informed us that a draft  memorandum of agreement, designating VHA as the lead entity, was being  considered within VA, DOD, and IHS.  However, this memorandum had  not been approved or implemented at the time that we concluded our  review. The project also continues to move forward without  comprehensive and coordinated plans, including an agreed-upon mission  and clear goals, objectives, and performance measures. Without clearly  defined lines of authority and a comprehensive and coordinated strategy,  even the revised GCPR initiative is destined to continue on an uncertain  course\u2014one that is unlikely to deliver substantial results.", "In summary, VA has made good progress toward addressing a number of  important information technology concerns, but it still has much work to  do. Its current leadership is to be commended for the dedication that it has  demonstrated regarding VA\u2019s information technology problems. However,  in totality, the steps taken to date have not been sufficient to overcome the  wide range of deficiencies that threaten VA\u2019s operational effectiveness.  Many of VA\u2019s problems are longstanding and pervasive, and can be  attributed to fundamental weaknesses in management accountability\u2014  some of which can only be overcome through serious restructuring of  current reporting relationships and lines of authority. Until VA makes a  concerted effort to ensure that all necessary processes and controls exist  to guide the management of its information technology program, it will  continue to fall short of its goals of enhancing operational efficiency and,  ultimately, improving service delivery to our nation\u2019s veterans.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
