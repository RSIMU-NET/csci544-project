This adversely affects training activities and jeopardizes the safety of military personnel. To ensure readiness, servicemembers must have access to capable ranges--a key DOD transformation goal--that enables them to develop and maintain skills for wartime missions. However, GAO observed various degraded conditions at each training range visited, such as malfunctioning communication systems, impassable tank trails, overgrown areas, and outdated training areas and targets. Whenever possible, the services work around these conditions by modifying the timing, tempo, or location of training, but officials have expressed concern that workarounds are becoming increasingly difficult and costly and that they compromise the realism essential to effective training. Without adequate ranges, DOD compromises the opportunity to achieve its transformation goal and assumes the risk that its forces will be less prepared for missions and subjected to hazards. DOD's progress in improving training range conditions has been limited and is partially attributable to a lack of a comprehensive approach to ensure that ranges provide the proper setting for effectively preparing its forces for warfare. First, while the services have individually taken a varying number of key management improvement actions, such as developing range sustainment policies, these actions lack consistency across DOD or focus primarily on encroachment without including commensurate efforts on other issues, such as maintenance and modernization. Second, even though the services cannot precisely identify the funding required and used for their ranges, identified range requirements have historically been inadequately funded, as evidenced by conditions GAO saw, and inadequately addressed. Service officials identified a variety of factors that have exacerbated funding limitations, such as ranges having a lower priority in funding decisions.

While encroachment issues have had high  visibility within the department and the Congress, much less attention has  been given to other training range constraints, such as those resulting from  inadequate maintenance and modernization, which also has an adverse  impact on training activities. DOD\u2019s 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review  Report states that one of the basic tenets needed to meet its training  transformation goal is to reverse the erosion of DOD\u2019s training range  infrastructure and ensure that ranges are sustainable, capable, and  available.

We initially  identified DOD support infrastructure as a high-risk area in the federal  government in 1997 and, in our latest high-risk series report, we pointed  out that we continue to believe that it remains a high-risk area. Our reports  on overall infrastructure conditions have frequently cited the  underfunding of maintenance and repairs, resulting in deteriorating  facilities. For the most part, our prior training range reports have focused  on encroachment rather than issues such as appropriate range  maintenance or modernization. A common theme in these reports has  been the need for more comprehensive planning to include, for example,  clearly establishing goals and milestones for tracking progress in  addressing issues, identifying the funding needed to accomplish tasks, and  assigning responsibility for managing and coordinating departmental  efforts.", "In view of the department\u2019s responsibilities to ensure the long-term  viability and utility of its training ranges as critical national assets to meet  the defense mission, we undertook this review to more closely examine  training range conditions related to the maintenance and modernization of  its ranges.

This report discusses (1) the current conditions of  military training ranges and their impact on training activities and (2) what  factors are affecting DOD\u2019s progress in improving training range  conditions.", "In performing our work, we collected and analyzed training range-related  information from officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD), the Joint Forces Command, the Special Operations Command, and  the headquarters and selected major commands of the military services.  We also visited eight active component training ranges located in the  continental United States between June and October 2004 to observe  training range conditions and discuss training impacts and actions taken  to improve range conditions. These ranges were selected by identifying  the major training ranges for each service and seeking input from service  range officials as to which ranges could best address our audit objectives.  We also reviewed relevant DOD studies and audit reports addressing  military training range condition and funding issues. From our review of  these data and discussions with DOD officials, we believe that the data  presented are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  conducted our work from August 2003 through March 2005 in completing  this report as well as fulfilling congressionally mandated reporting  requirements dealing with training range issues.

Until recent  years, DOD had no readiness reporting system in place for its defense  installations and facilities, including training ranges. In fiscal year 2000,  DOD reported to the Congress for the first time on the readiness of its  defense infrastructure as an integral element of its overall Defense  Readiness Reporting System. At the core of the system is a rating  classification, typically referred to as a \u201cC\u201d rating.

Training ranges fall within the operations and training  facility class. While the services provide overall assessments by facility  class, they may not always provide detailed separate ratings for  installation assets, such as training ranges, within a class. With respect to  training ranges, the Army and Marine Corps have data that provide  C-ratings for their ranges, but the Navy and Air Force do not.

Following the table is a discussion of degraded  conditions that we observed.", "While the overall C-rating of the Fort Hood ranges in 2004 was C-2,  53 percent of the assessed training areas were identified by installation  officials as having significant (C-3) or major (C-4) deficiencies that  preclude satisfactory mission accomplishment. According to Army  officials, the condition of Fort Hood\u2019s training ranges is understated  because the overall C-rating does not include all assessed training areas. In  addition, training range officials identified 364 (91 percent) of the  400 miles of their tank trails, which are not rated under training areas, as  unusable or hazardous because of deteriorated conditions (see fig. 1). As a  result, units typically detoured onto paved, public roads to travel to and  from training areas causing road damage and creating safety hazards to  the public who use the roads.", "In addition, the urban training facilities were outdated, having been  designed for Cold War scenarios that are not applicable to current military  operations. For example, the facilities at Fort Hood resemble European  villages with narrow streets. But in current military operations, tanks and  other military vehicles patrol Middle Eastern settings and downtown  cities. Also, while entrances to these European homes at Fort Hood are  immediately off the road and easily accessible, homes in the Middle East  are generally protected by tall, gated walls and designed around a  courtyard, making soldiers more vulnerable to enemy fire before entering  a home."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fort Stewart, Georgia", "paragraphs": ["While the overall C-rating of the Fort Stewart ranges in 2004 was C-3,  60 percent of the training areas were identified by installation officials as  having major (C-4) deficiencies that preclude satisfactory mission  accomplishment. In addition, range officials and units told us that the  convoy training area limits soldiers to shoot out of only one side of a  vehicle during ambush training exercises, although soldiers stated that in  actual military operations they could be attacked from multiple directions.  The range also lacks urban training facilities that accurately reflect the  needs of current military operations, such as Middle Eastern-style building  facades. A range official further stated that most of their ranges lack  running water and therefore do not have functioning restrooms or  showers, which leads to delays and inefficient use of training time. Similar  to Fort Hood, the range also has deteriorated training areas that pose  difficulties in maneuvering vehicles during training events (see fig. 2).", "There are numerous identified deficiencies at this range\u2014a primary site  for West Coast Navy units to train before deploying\u2014that adversely affect  the quantity and quality of training activities. Range and submarine  squadron officials told us that a major deficiency is the malfunctioning of  the undersea training area\u2019s communications system, which effectively  reduces the available training area to the southern portion of the range  (see fig. 3).", "This situation is further exacerbated because the southern portion of the  undersea training area overlaps with surface ship training areas, and so  concurrent training cannot be conducted. Range officials stated that this  and other deficiencies could also impede their ability to meet the  increased demand created by the Navy\u2019s revised ship deployment cycle,  which requires more carrier groups to be deployable at a given time.  Moreover, the range does not have an instrumented shallow-water  capability. A recent study on the range\u2019s capabilities for antisubmarine  warfare found that current range resources are sufficient to meet 90  percent of the minimally required training tasks. However, the study found  that the range does not provide a realistic training environment for 19 (63  percent) of 30 Navy training skills, primarily due to the lack of a shallow- water instrumented training range. The range also lacks adequate support  capabilities, such as piers, docks, and mooring buoys. For example,  although range officials stated that current fleet requirements necessitate  a minimum of eight mooring buoys, only two are in satisfactory condition.  As a result, these buoys are rarely available, which leads to reduced  training support and costly workarounds, such as travel to alternate  locations for the night. In addition, the lack of mooring or docking  capabilities has also resulted in damaged military property and canceled  training events. Range officials and users cited other deficiencies,  including an inadequate number and types of targets, electronic warfare  capabilities, and tracking systems for aircraft, as well as the lack of a  dependable secure high-capacity communication system. In commenting  on a draft of this report, the Navy stated that it is currently funding efforts  to establish dedicated shallow water training ranges on both coasts.

Additionally, OSD and the  services have not fully implemented specific actions identified in their  policy, management guidance, reports, and plans for improving training  range conditions.

Specifically, the policy does not clearly  define the maintenance and modernization responsibilities of the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and Special  Operations Command. Consequently, these organizations lack appropriate  assignment of responsibility and accountability for the military training  range improvements they oversee or manage. According to service  officials, the Army and Marine Corps are finalizing draft revisions of their  range sustainment policy, and the Air Force only recently started revising  its policy. Navy officials stated that the service has not yet developed a  policy to implement DOD\u2019s 2003 policy or to clearly define the roles and  responsibilities of the multiple Navy organizations responsible for  maintaining and modernizing its training ranges.", "Range sustainment programs\u2014As shown in table 2, OSD and some of  the services have initiated specific range sustainment programs to  integrate their individual components and commands.

In  June 2004, we reported that DOD\u2019s training range report to the Congress,  which was mandated by section 366 of the Bob Stump National Defense  Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003, did not, among other things, provide  a comprehensive plan to address training constraints caused by limitations  on the use of military lands, marine areas, and air space that are available  in the United States and overseas for training.

However, the working group does not include a representative from  Special Operations Command, although they are responsible for and  impacted by the maintenance and modernization of military training  ranges. Also, both the DOD-wide and Navy headquarters-level sustainable  range working groups are primarily focused on encroachment issues and  not on other issues that impact ranges and training, such as maintenance  and modernization. For example, the Navy\u2019s southwest regional range  director stated that his primary responsibility is encroachment and  munitions cleanup, and that he has not been assigned or been provided the  resources to address the maintenance and modernization of ranges in his  region.

However, only the Navy\u2019s draft range requirements document links its  ranges to special operations and joint training requirements to show the  potential impact on the special operation units\u2019 or combatant  commanders\u2019 needs, which is a key objective of DOD\u2019s training  transformation initiative. Also, none of the range requirement documents  identify range support facility needs, although facility conditions directly  impact the quantity and quality of training provided and the level of safety  on the ranges.", "Systematic assessment of range conditions and impacts\u2014At the time  of our review, we found that none of the services regularly assessed the  conditions of their ranges, including whether the ranges are able to meet  the specific training requirements of the service and combatant  commanders. While the Army and Marine Corps annually assessed the  physical condition of their training ranges, the services do not assess the  capabilities of the ranges or any impacts to training. While the Army\u2019s  assessment contained clearly defined criteria, local training range officials  stated that because the criteria are revised regularly, comparing  assessments across years is impossible. In addition, the overall assessment  of Army training ranges does not accurately reflect the condition of all  training areas on the range since it does not include the condition of a  number of training areas. Also, according to service officials, both the  Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 assessments are conducted by public works  officials who do not have the background or specific knowledge of range  infrastructure, as opposed to training range officials or training unit  representatives. In addition, local officials stated that the Marine Corps\u2019  assessment is highly subjective and does not provide the evaluator with  specific criteria. While the Navy and Air Force do not routinely conduct  annual assessments of their training ranges, the Air Force does perform  assessments from time to time and the Navy has completed some one-time  assessments on their ranges while developing local range complex  management plans. We also found that none of the services regularly  assess the impacts to training, and none of the services have linked their  funding resources to the results of the assessments.", "Web-based range information management system\u2014DOD reports and  officials have increasingly called for a range information management  system that would allow range offices and users to share information  within and across the services. Such a Web-based system would include  best practices, lessons learned, a scheduling tool, policies, points of  contact, funding information, and range conditions and capabilities. Local  range offices have undertaken a number of initiatives to ensure that their  ranges remain viable while trying to minimize the negative impact on  training, but they often lack an effective mechanism for sharing these  initiatives with other organizations. For example, the range officials at the  Fallon Range Training Complex routinely obtained targets and training  structures at no cost from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service  to enhance their training capability, but other training offices we visited  were having difficulty obtaining these items or were paying for the items  they were able to obtain. For example, figure 5 shows a mock airfield that  was constructed at the Fallon Range out of materials obtained from the  Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service.", "The Marine Corps has an active, centralized training range Web site to  provide information to units and ranges across the world, including related  service regulations, general and detailed information about each of its  ranges, and training range points of contact. The Web site also allows units  from any service to schedule their training events remotely, and provides  them with a map of each training range including photographs and, in  some instances, video footage to assist them in scheduling and designing  their training events. However, to date, the Marine Corps has not used its  Web site to exchange information, such as lessons learned and best  practices, between and among training range offices and military units.  Meanwhile, the Army has developed an initial Web site that provides  similar, but more limited, information about its sustainable range program.", "The Air Force has also established a training range Web site to share  information about its training ranges, but it has remained nonfunctional,  since the service did not enter information into the site. The Air Force\u2019s  Air Combat Command is developing a separate training range information  management system. While a cognizant command official stated that the  command plans on adding a chat room feature to exchange information,  the official stated that the system might not be Web-based, so the  information would not be available to other range offices or units within  and across the services. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD  stated that the Air National Guard is in the process of developing a Web- based range scheduling system that could meet some of the service\u2019s  needs, but additional funding is needed to complete this effort. While Navy  reports and officials recognize the need for a servicewide training range  management system, the service has not developed such a system.  However, the Southern California Offshore Range has its own  management system that is used for scheduling, identifying specific  training requirements for each training event, documenting reasons why  training is modified or canceled, tracking training range utilization rates by  specific units, and recording maintenance issues and resolutions. In  addition, the system allows the range office to compute the costs of  training each unit using specific training requirements and warfare areas.", "Local range complex management plans\u2014The Navy and Marine Corps  have started to develop local range complex management plans for their  training ranges, which, among other things, provide descriptions of the  training ranges, a strategic vision for range operations, and  recommendations for environmental planning; identify and analyze  required capability shortfalls derived from fleet training needs; and include  an investment strategy to address these deficiencies. Although most of the  Navy\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 local range offices have started to develop plans  with investment strategies, these strategies are not linked to any service  investment strategies. Also, due to funding expectations, current needs  have been pushed out 20 years. Consequently, today\u2019s training  requirements are being met with yesterday\u2019s ranges and tomorrow\u2019s  training requirements will be met with today\u2019s ranges. Further, six of the  Marine Corps\u2019 range complex management plans, including two of the  service\u2019s most significant training ranges, are currently unfunded. In  addition, the Army and Air Force ranges we visited have outdated plans.  The Army recently started developing standardized local range plans and  the Air Force is creating a management system to develop plans for its  ranges. However, the system is not scheduled to be operational until 2007.  While these key actions comprise elements of a comprehensive approach  to training range sustainment, they have focused primarily on  encroachment, have not been consistently implemented among the  services, or have not clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of all  officials. Such an approach should include, at a minimum, several key  elements, such as an overall comprehensive strategic plan that addresses  training range limitations, along with quantifiable goals and milestones for  tracking planned actions and progress. Other key elements include well- defined policies that address all factors impacting range sustainability,  servicewide plans that guide the timely execution of range sustainability  actions, range requirements that are geared to meet both service and joint  needs, and a commitment to the implementation of this approach.  (See app. II for a more comprehensive list of what we consider to be key  managerial elements of a comprehensive approach)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Have Not Adequately Funded Training Range Maintenance and Modernization", "paragraphs": ["Various documents and training range officials report that training range  requirements have not been adequately funded historically to meet  training standards and needs. According to service officials, a variety of  factors\u2014such as ranges having a lower funding priority amid competing  demands\u2014have contributed to or exacerbated funding limitations.  However, the military services lack adequate and easily accessible  information that could precisely identify the required funding and track  what is allocated to maintain and modernize its ranges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Available Data Reflect Funding Shortages for Range Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Available data indicate that funding for training ranges has historically  been insufficient to meet range requirements. For example, the 2003  Special Operations Command report on training ranges states that ranges  are inadequately funded for construction, maintenance, repairs, and  upgrades. In addition, a 2001 Navy range study states that both range  operation funds and base operation funds, which also support range  sustainment, were not adequate, thus adversely impacting utilization of the  Navy\u2019s ranges. A 2004 Naval Audit Service report also found that Navy  range accounts were not being adequately funded and thus were  dependent on funds from other accounts. Further, funding information  provided by training range officials during this review showed that funding  has not adequately met their requirements. For example, Fort Stewart  training data indicated that the installation\u2019s training range maintenance  account was funded approximately 44 percent for fiscal years 1998  through 2002. Similarly, Camp Pendleton data revealed that the overall  identified range needs were funded approximately 13 percent from fiscal  years 1998 through 2002. DOD reports and officials identified the following  as factors in the funding shortages:    Training ranges typically have a lower funding priority than many other  installation activities. Specifically, training ranges do not compete well for  funding against other installation activities that are more visible or related  to quality-of-life issues, such as gymnasiums, child care centers, and  barracks, and consequently training funds are often reallocated from the  range to support other base operations programs. For example, the 2003  Air Force training range assessment stated that critically needed  sustainment funds for ranges were often diverted to fund other base  requirements identified as more pressing.", "Service officials identified a number of organizational structure issues that  exacerbate the extent to which training range requirements are prioritized  and funded. While OSD\u2019s and the services\u2019 training range offices are  located in an operations directorate, this directorate does not prioritize or  fund base programs that provide resources for the sustainment,  restoration, and modernization of DOD infrastructure (including ranges).  Recognizing this as an issue, the Navy recently hosted a conference to  address the fragmented management for budgeting and allocating funds to  ranges. During the meeting, Navy officials agreed to 20 specific actions  that could be taken to minimize future funding issues. Also, while local  range personnel are responsible for maintaining and modernizing ranges,  some of these offices are not directly linked to the command that  prioritizes installation resources. For example, the range office at the  Southern California Offshore Range, which is an operational unit, is not  organizationally aligned with the installation management organization  that prioritizes sustainment funds for San Clemente Island. In addition,  although the majority of the Southern California Offshore Range\u2019s  exercises are fleet operations and not air operations, the range office is  aligned under a naval air command and not the fleet command.", "In addition, the relative position of training ranges in the organizational  framework affects the extent to which training range requirements are  prioritized and funded. Specifically, while some local range offices report  directly to the senior mission commander that prioritizes funding  resources, other range offices report to offices several echelons below the  commander. For example, the Air Force\u2019s Air Warfare Center commander  stated that since the range office for the Nellis Test and Training Range is  an Air Force wing, it has the same opportunity to identify its requirements  and deficiencies to him as have the other wings at Nellis Air Force Base,  Nevada. Conversely, although the Fallon Range Training Complex range  office used to report directly to the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center  commander, who sets funding priorities and requirements, the range office  has since been aligned to a lower echelon position, thus placing the office  at a less advantageous position in having its requirements and deficiencies  identified as priorities.", "A lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities can also result in  overlooked training range requirements as well. Specifically, several  training range officials stated that the Navy\u2019s regional installation support  structure lacks clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each of the  program directors within the structure, which results in overlooked  requirements at its training ranges. For example, because the Southern  California Offshore Range is only a portion of the San Clemente Island in  the Pacific Ocean, there are multiple officials responsible for the different  operations occurring on the island, including training ranges, port, airfield,  environmental, facilities, information technology, and safety. However,  according to training range officials, deficiencies on the island are  overlooked because the Navy has not issued guidance providing clearly  defined roles and responsibilities for each of these program directors.  Specifically, training range officials stated that they are unable to obtain  funds to maintain or modernize support facilities on the island, such as the  pier and roads, because program managers either tend to view the entire  island as a training range and therefore not their responsibility or to view  it as not one of their top priorities, since the adverse impact on their  primary missions is relatively limited. Nevertheless, the condition of these  support facilities directly impacts range activities.", "Various documented reports and testimonies of cognizant officials suggest  that range needs are understated to the Congress due to the following  factors: (1) installation real property inventories, which are used to  calculate the installations\u2019 sustainment funding requirements, do not  contain complete and accurate information needed to compute  requirements; (2) commands typically understate range needs because  they have come to expect lower funding amounts; and (3) ranges may  receive supplemental funding from units to help maintain conditions. For  example, the 2003 Special Operations Command training range report  found that Army installations had incorrectly categorized their range  facilities built with operations and maintenance funds as multipurpose  ranges, which are considered less costly to maintain than those specially  targeted for the command. Therefore, these installations underbudgeted  for the maintenance and repair of these facilities. In addition, Marine  Corps officials stated that they recently updated their installation real  property inventories and discovered numerous discrepancies that had  resulted in understatement of their ranges\u2019 needs. Also, officials at Fort  Hood stated that 30 percent of its tank trails are not included in its real  property records because the tank trails do not meet military construction  standards. As a result, Fort Hood is unable to obtain sufficient funds to  either sustain or improve the tank trails to an acceptable standard and add  them to the real property inventory. Further, officials stated that  commands understate range funding requirements because they have  come to expect lower funding levels. For example, officials at Fort Hood  stated that although their range modernization funding requirements  totaled at least $8 million, they had programmed and budgeted for only  $4 million. Also, the requirements and budget documents at the Southern  California Offshore Range office showed that the range\u2019s requirements  were understated by about 30 percent for fiscal years 2005 through 2007.  Consequently, range officials stated that even if this amount were fully  funded and not transferred to other accounts, their needs would be unmet.  Since the range has a management system that captures the cost to train  units on the range, the office reported that they would have to cancel  operations due to a lack of funds in May of each year, or eliminate all  command and control and battle group exercises, including 20 already  scheduled significant training events. In addition, a 2004 Naval audit found  that the regular transfer of funds from units to training ranges resulted in  understated requirements and senior Navy management, DOD officials,  and the Congress not having important information needed to efficiently  and effectively manage and fund Navy programs identified by the Congress  as significant to readiness.", "The services do not link funding for their training ranges to range  conditions, capabilities, impacts on training, or utilization. For example,  while the number of training hours on the Southern California Offshore  Range increased by 153 percent between fiscal years 1998 and 2001, range  funding data reflect that funding increased by less than 10 percent. As a  result, range officials told us that the training range requirements  continued to be underfunded, conditions continued to deteriorate, and the  capabilities continued to be lacking.", "Service officials across all commands lack adequate knowledge and  training about the various resources available for range maintenance and  how modernization impacts funding levels. For example, very few of the  training range officials that we met during our review were aware of  sustainment funds that were generated by the range property in the  installation\u2019s real property inventory systems.", "The services lack clearly defined range requirements that distinguish  special operations-specific range needs and servicewide range needs,  which results in confusion between which organization is responsible for  funding range maintenance and modernization. Specifically, the 2003  Special Operations Command training range report stated that when  Special Operations Forces are the primary users of a range funded with  service dollars, disagreement sometimes arises over responsibility for  maintenance costs. Consequently, there needs to be better clarification of  what comprises Special Operations-specific facilities and what comprises  service-common facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Lack the Capability to Accurately Capture Training Range Requirements and Funding Levels", "paragraphs": ["We found, and DOD recognizes, that the services lack the capability to  accurately and easily capture training range funding information. DOD\u2019s  sustainable range working group officials told us that the services were  unable to easily and precisely identify their funding requirements, funding  levels, and trends in expenditures on an annual basis. Consequently, the  group developed a subcommittee in 2004 to begin addressing this issue.  Also, the 2004 Naval audit on range operations funds found that the lack of  a range management system resulted in problems related to the visibility  of the amount and use of funds being provided. Further, while training  range officials for each of the services stated that they could identify some  training range requirements or funding amounts, none were able to  identify all of the funds that their ranges need and receive. For example,  while the Army was able to identify its range operations requirements and  funding levels, it was unable to identify its range sustainment requirements  and funding levels. Officials in these range offices stated that they should  have the ability to accurately identify all funding provided to their ranges if  they are going to be effective program sponsors. Local training range  officials were also unable to identify all their funding requirements and  levels. They noted that a centralized system would provide a mechanism  for service headquarters officials to identify funding requirements and at  the same time relieve them of the burden of responding to constant  requests for information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSD and the Services Have Not Fully Implemented Previously Recommended Actions", "paragraphs": ["Although policy, management guidance, reports, and plans have either  recommended or required specific actions, OSD and the services have not  fully implemented these previously recommended actions. For example,  although DOD\u2019s sustainable range policy requires OSD to, among other  things, provide oversight of training ranges and ensure that DOD-level  programs are in place to protect the future ability of DOD components to  conduct force training, a cognizant OSD official told us that OSD believes  it should be a facilitator rather than a provider of oversight. Without  adequate oversight, DOD-level initiatives, such as transformation efforts,  could be jeopardized. In addition, OSD has not established a means to  assess the readiness benefits of range sustainment initiatives, as required  by the policy. In response to DOD guidance stating that DOD was to  reverse the erosion of its training range infrastructure and ensure that  ranges are sustainable, capable, and available, the Senior Readiness  Oversight Council required the services, working with OSD, to prepare a  prioritized list of range sustainment and upgrade programs and estimated  costs for potential inclusion in the fiscal year 2003 budget. However, the  list was never developed and submitted for potential funding  opportunities. Defense officials could not provide us with an explanation  as to why no appropriate action was taken. In addition, the 2003 Special  Operations Command training range report identified a number of  recommendations that could improve the conditions of training ranges  units within the command use. For example, the report stated that all  special operations\u2019 components need to create master range plans that  address their current and future range issues and solutions; identify and  validate training requirements as well as facilities available and needed;  and define acceptable limits of workarounds. However, according to a  knowledgeable defense official, these recommendations have not been  implemented to date because of resource shortages. Also, in July 1995, the  Navy issued a tactical training range roadmap that, among other things,  applied training requirements to training range capabilities and identified  deficiencies to produce an investment plan for training range  development. Although the plan stated that it should be updated  biannually to remain current and accurately reflect fleet training  requirements and associated instrumentation needs, the Navy has not  updated the plan since that time. Without a commitment to  implementation, it is unlikely that the OSD and the services will be able to  ensure the success of their transformation efforts and long-term viability  of their training ranges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD training ranges are important national assets that have not been  adequately maintained or modernized to meet today\u2019s needs. While DOD  has undertaken a number of actions in an effort to maintain and  modernize its training ranges, it lacks a comprehensive approach to  address range issues. We have previously recommended and continue to  believe that DOD needs an overall strategic plan that identifies specific  goals, actions to be taken, milestones, and a process for measuring  progress and ensuring accountability. In turn, each service needs to  develop a comprehensive implementation plan if deteriorating conditions  are to be abated and overall training capabilities improved to meet today\u2019s  and tomorrow\u2019s requirements. Similarly, OSD and the services have issued  policies, conducted studies containing recommendations, identified range  officials at various command levels, and developed working groups.  However, not all relevant officials are included, their roles and  responsibilities are not clearly defined, the policies and recommendations  have been ignored or only partially implemented, and several of these  actions focus only on external encroachment issues. DOD needs to ensure  that OSD\u2019s comprehensive strategic plan, the services\u2019 implementation  plans, DOD\u2019s training transformation plan, DOD policies, and identified  recommendations include all relevant officials, clearly define their roles  and responsibilities, comprehensively address all sustainability issues,  including the maintenance and modernization of military training ranges,  and are fully implemented to ensure the long-term viability of these  national assets. Although military training ranges are generally in degraded  condition, which adversely affects the quantity and quality of training and  safety of the users, the military services do not accurately and  systematically assess their ranges, including whether the ranges are able  to meet the specific training requirements of the service and combatant  commanders. Without systematically assessing the conditions of their  ranges, the services cannot accurately identify the ranges where the  conditions negatively impact training and need improvements, the best  locations for training, or which training ranges best meet the needs of  DOD\u2019s training transformation plan and of service and combatant  commanders. Although local training range officials have undertaken a  number of initiatives to ensure that their ranges remain viable while trying  to minimize negative impact on training, the services have not provided  these officials or military units with a Web-based range information  management system.

Without this capability, the military services are constrained in  their ability to accurately plan, program, and budget for the maintenance  and modernization of their training ranges; provide complete and accurate  information to the Congress for appropriation and legislative decision  making; and obtain this information without constant requests for  information from multiple officials at different commands.
