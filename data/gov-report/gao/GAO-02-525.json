All United States military forces, including the approximately 240,000 military personnel stationed outside the continental United States (CONUS), conduct frequent training exercises to hone and maintain their war- fighting skills. About 110,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed in Europe and 130,000 in the Pacific, including the states of Hawaii and Alaska. (See app. I for maps showing the two theaters and what units are stationed there and app. II for a map of each location and its major training areas.) Concerned that growing restrictions by host governments are limiting the training opportunities available to U.S. military forces, you requested that we examine a number of issues related to the ability of non- CONUS-based forces to train. Accordingly, our objectives in this report were to assess (1) the types of training constraints that non-CONUS forces face and whether they are likely to increase in the future, (2) the impact these constraints have had on the ability of military units to meet their training requirements and on their reported readiness, and (3) alternatives that exist to increase training opportunities for these forces. As agreed with your office, we included all U.S. forces based outside the 48 contiguous states in our examination, which includes those based in Hawaii and Alaska. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in appendix III.", "This is the first of two assessments we have recently made of training limitations facing U.S. forces.  We are also nearing completion of a study of environmental and commercial development issues affecting military training ranges in the continental United States.

Historical experiences indicate that there is a correlation between realistic training and success in combat. Hence, training should be as realistic as possible to prepare troops for combat. Service training guidance emphasizes the importance of live fire training to create a realistic combat scenario and to prepare individuals and units for operating their weapons systems.", "U.S. forces are required to train for a variety of missions and skills. This training includes basic qualification skills such as gunnery and higher-level unit operational combat skills. Service training requirements typically require the use of air ranges for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, drop zones, and electronic warfare; live-fire ranges for artillery, armor, small arms, and munitions training; ground maneuver ranges to conduct realistic force-on-force training at various unit echelons; and sea ranges to conduct ship maneuvers for training. To achieve required training, non-CONUS forces use a variety of training areas and ranges that are generally owned by host governments.", "Ideally, forces conduct the majority of their required training at home station using local training areas or operating areas. However, non-CONUS forces have historically relied on a combination of instrumented training ranges away from home station, major training centers, CONUS training exercises, and multilateral training exercises with countries within their theater to obtain their required training. This includes the Navy and the Marine Corps, which have no permanently stationed combat forces in Europe and no fixed access to training ranges in the European theater.", "We have previously reported that the size of home station training areas available to units varies greatly, particularly between units stationed overseas and those in the United States. For example, we reported that local training areas for units stationed in Germany have historically varied in size from 3 acres to 8,000 acres, with divisional units not always housed at the same location. In the United States, we reported that individual installations vary, but far more land is available and typical installations may vary in size from just under 100,000 acres up to more than one million acres.", "While this report\u2019s focus is exclusively on training constraints outside CONUS, both we and the Department of Defense (DOD) are examining constraints on CONUS training. At the request of the House Committee on Government Reform, we are reviewing the effects of environmental and commercial development restrictions on key training areas within the 48 contiguous states and whether DOD is effectively working to address these issues. In addition, DOD is in the process of determining the extent of the training problems at CONUS facilities. DOD\u2019s Senior Readiness Oversight Council initiated a sustainable range initiative spearheaded by the Defense Test and Training Steering Group. The initiative\u2019s purpose is to develop and recommend a comprehensive plan of action to ensure that the department maintains range and airspace capabilities that support DOD\u2019s future training needs. In November 2000, the steering group submitted a sustainable range report to the Oversight Council followed by the publication of nine action plans that addressed eight training-related issues confronting CONUS training and an outreach plan. Currently, DOD\u2019s efforts have focused almost exclusively on CONUS training. There is no consolidated DOD-wide listing of non-CONUS training ranges and their associated limitations. Some services have started collecting this information, but a complete inventory is not yet available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forces Face Increasing Training Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Unlike CONUS-based forces, which conduct their company level and below training at home-station, none of the permanently stationed non- CONUS combat units are able to meet all their company-level and below training requirements at home station. According to service doctrine, home-station training should support company-level and below training requirements. Non-CONUS combat units have the most difficulty meeting their training requirements for (1) maneuver operations, (2) live ordnance practice, and (3) night and low altitude flying. These difficulties arise because both the European and Pacific units\u2019 home-station training locations are not large enough to conduct specific ground maneuvers on a regular basis; are limited in the types of munitions or use of live fire or both; and are restricted in terms of flight hours, altitudes, and electronic frequencies allowed. Some restrictions are long-standing, while others are more recent. In many cases, the increase in restrictions facing U.S. forces is the result of the growing commercial and residential development on or near previously established training areas and ranges. The construction itself, including residential and agricultural development within training ranges, has forced some ranges to close, reduced the training capability at others, and often delayed training on those that remain. Continued growth and host nation concerns may result in further restrictions in the future."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ground Maneuver Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["In many instances non-CONUS-based units\u2019 home-station local training areas are not large enough or are inappropriate for certain operations. To make training as realistic as possible, many exercises require specific terrain or large maneuver areas. However, in both Europe and the Pacific U.S. ground forces lack enough space and/or the appropriate terrain to train at their home stations. Following are several examples of such limitations.", "The Army in Germany has historically had limited local training areas available for units to engage in home-station training. The Army recognizes only 7 of the 61 identified local training areas as having all the characteristics of a local training area. Over the past decade, as part of the Army\u2019s practice of being a good neighbor, there has been a shift toward using designated areas as opposed to large open areas on private land, which has further lessened the amount of land available for training. Although, the Army has limited local training areas, it has been able to conduct all its required training using a combination of training areas within Germany. Figure 7 in appendix II is a map showing the locations of major units and training facilities in Germany.", "Army units in Italy also have a limited number of local training areas to conduct home-station training, and for some types of mission training the terrain there is inappropriate for the desired training.  Army officials based in Italy said that there were only a few instances where training was constrained at some local training areas.  One local training area does not allow the soldiers to train on their High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. A second local training area is coming under pressure from increased recreational use by the local population. Specifically, during summer 2001, a portion of this training area was completely closed because the area abutting it is becoming increasingly popular for hikers. Army officials expressed concern that they may lose more of the training area in the future. Regarding having the right terrain, while Army units in Italy are expected to operate in wooded areas, soldiers told us that during some exercises they pretended to be moving through a wooded area hiding behind trees when in actuality they were moving through an open field at their local training areas. Figure 8 in appendix II is a map showing the locations of major units and training facilities in Italy.", "In Korea, the Army\u2019s local maneuver areas are inadequate in size to support platoon and company training events, which has been a long- standing problem. While the local training areas have always been inadequate to support training events to Army standards, the areas available for training are shrinking as the population in or around the training areas increases. Figure 10 in appendix II is a map showing the locations of major units and training facilities in Korea.", "In Japan, local training areas on Okinawa are too small to support the Marine Corps\u2019 maneuver-training requirements. Only small-unit elements can maneuver together. Large force elements that would normally be in close proximity to each other and maneuver together must break into small groups, disperse among the island\u2019s training areas, and maneuver independently. Further, maneuver training that ideally would be conducted in a continuous, uninterrupted manner must be started and stopped as units move from one non-contiguous training area to another. Training constraints have further increased as a result of the 1996 Special Action Committee on Okinawa agreement, which returned the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield\u2014the site previously used to conduct parachute drop training\u2014to Japan and terminated nearly all artillery training on the island. Most battalion exercises and parachute drops, which require troops to conduct maneuver exercises after being dropped, have been relocated off Okinawa. Marine Corps officials told us that it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain maneuver training on Okinawa.

DOD officials have repeatedly expressed the need for live-fire to make training realistic preparation for combat. Many live-fire restrictions were implemented because development and population growth near the training ranges reduced the areas available for safety zones and led to noise complaints from nearby residents. Following are examples of such restrictions.", "In Germany, for decades Army unit-level personnel have had difficulty in conducting live fire training at home station except for small arms because of the prohibitions on live fire in those areas. Army units have historically gone to the Grafenwoehr Training Area\u2014the Army in Europe\u2019s principal live-fire training area\u2014to conduct live fire training on their major weapons such as tanks and artillery. Regarding Grafenwoehr\u2019s sufficiency for future advance munitions, Army officials told us that they plan to upgrade the training area to accommodate all munitions that will be used by Army in Europe units.", "Both the Army and the Air Force in Italy have restrictions on live fire training. There are such restrictions at nine of the Army\u2019s ten local training areas and firing ranges. The Air Force\u2019s fighter wing in Italy does not have a local air-to-ground range for bombing training although bombing is one of its primary missions. The lack of an air-to-ground range is a long- standing problem and prevents the wing from conducting surface attack training in Italy.", "The two F-15E squadrons in the United Kingdom cannot employ laser- guided bombs on any of their local ranges. Laser-guided bombs are the primary munitions used for air-to-ground attacks by these squadrons. Although these squadrons have regular access to air-to-ground ranges for non-laser-guided bombing, the ranges are not considered quality tactical training ranges that allow pilots to train for identifying and engaging targets. Figure 9 in appendix II is a map showing the locations of the fighter wing and training facilities in the United Kingdom.", "When in Europe, Navy units have limited access to training for live fire combined arms, supporting-arms coordination, and naval gunfire support\u2014all of which are capabilities that the Navy tries to maintain at a certain level while deployed in theater. As a result, they rely on bilateral exercises, use of other country\u2019s ranges or North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises to attain training.", "Both the Air Force and the Army in Korea face restrictions on live fire training. The capabilities at Koon-ni, the Air Force\u2019s only exclusive-use range, have steadily diminished over time. Prior to 1978, live bombs were dropped on the target island, practice bombs were dropped on the mainland, and strafing was conducted on a scored land target. In 1978, live bombing was discontinued. Over the years, commercial development has moved within the range\u2019s safety easement zone. By 1989, practice bombing was restricted to the target island and in 2000 the scored strafing pits were closed. Figure 1 is a photo of a steel mill constructed within the zone during the time that strafing was still allowed.  As of April 2002 only training ordnance is allowed and can only be used over water. For the Army, its live-fire Story Range Complex does not have a safety easement zone sufficient for some of its longer-range weapons, such as the Multiple- Launch Rocket System and the Palladin. In addition, farming and structures\u2014such as houses, a greenhouse, and power lines\u2014lie within the range\u2019s boundaries. Army officials said they frequently find farmers on the range, but they are working with the Korean government to fence this range to keep farmers out of those areas. Figure 2 shows a picture of a local farmer harvesting rice inside the impact area at the Story Range. These farmers have to be removed for obvious safety reasons before the Army can use the range, which causes delays in training.", "In Japan, the Navy\u2019s ships and aircraft face live-fire restrictions at their local training facilities. The Navy is unable to conduct two of its surface anti-air warfare exercises due to inadequate target support facilities. These exercises are for the Rolling Airframe Missile against a subsonic cruise missile target and for the standard missile against the Supersonic Sea Skimming Target.  The Navy ships typically use Farallon de Medinilla, a range about 1,400 miles from Tokyo, to train aircraft in their air to ground deliveries and for surface ship naval gunfire support.  Pacific Command officials said that in March 2002, a Federal judge held that the incidental killing of migratory birds at this range violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and that a hearing is scheduled for April 30, 2002, to determine if operations at this range will be enjoined.  Furthermore, the Pacific Command said that if the Navy loses use of this range, serious degradations in readiness will be expected within six months unless an alternative range is found. In addition, the Navy\u2019s carrier air wing faces constraints on its ability to conduct live fire training. Because of the close proximity of the wing\u2019s home base at Atsugi (a suburb of Tokyo) to the local population, live munitions are not allowed to be stored at Atsugi or to be carried by aircraft departing the runway. Consequently, the wing\u2019s aircraft have to take off from Atsugi, land at another base in Japan to load munitions, and then continue on to other ranges to conduct their live fire training.", "In addition to training constraints on mainland Japan, on Okinawa the Marines have limited live-fire range capabilities at their local training areas. For the Marines, the ranges throughout the island have fixed firing points that do not allow tactical firing. Figures 3 and 4 show examples of the fixed firing points at two of the ranges. As a result, Marines can train to fire in only one direction as opposed to firing in any direction, which would be the most likely situation in combat. While these ranges can help a new Marine become familiar with his weapon, they cannot provide realistic or qualification training. In addition, since the early 1990s, the Marines\u2019 ability to conduct artillery firing on Okinawa has steadily diminished and as previously noted was discontinued altogether in 1996. The government of Japan now pays for the Marines to conduct their artillery firing training on the Japanese mainland four times a year. However, Marine Corps officials told us that one of the artillery ranges used on the mainland, Camp Fuji\u2014a co-use training area in northern Japan\u2014is restricted and that artillery is not being trained as robustly as it was on Okinawa.", "Land limitations and environmental concerns restrict live fire training in Alaska and Hawaii. In Alaska, the artillery, mortar, and Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire Command-Link Guided missile (TOW) firing area at Fort Richardson is unavailable to units 6 months a year (during the warmer months). In addition, the local training areas are insufficient to support cavalry gunnery, air-defense artillery-platoon \u201cStinger\u201d missile ground-to-air gunnery, TOW, and the MK-19, an automatic grenade launcher. In Hawaii, the Makua live fire range complex on Oahu was closed from September 1998 to October 2001 because of environmental concerns raised by the local population. Consequently, during this time the Army and Marines were unable to conduct company live fire exercises at home station.  According to Army in the Pacific officials, the Makua range complex is now open for limited use under the terms of a lawsuit settlement.  According to these officials, it is unlikely that the Marines will be able to use this range for the next 3 years because the settlement agreement limits the number of annual training events."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airspace Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["Forces in both Europe and the Pacific are not able to conduct all their aviation training events using their local training areas due to a variety of airspace restrictions. For aviators in both theaters, air space restrictions limit the ability to accomplish required training; thus limiting pilots and aircrews\u2019 proficiency in some areas. Although some restrictions are long- standing, Air Force personnel told us that airspace throughout Europe and the Pacific is becoming increasingly congested, adding to the difficulty in completing training. Following are examples of airspace restrictions.", "The Air Force units stationed in Germany have limited local air space available, and altitude restrictions prohibit flying below 1,000 feet. Airspace is routinely available between 1,000 and 10,000 feet and the Air Force can obtain access to temporary reserved airspace above 10,000 feet,which is allocated to military training flights. The ability to train below 1,000 feet and above 10,000 feet is important because pilots are likely to engage in combat at both low and high altitudes. In addition, flying is limited to the hours between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Pilots are also prohibited from flying at supersonic speeds and employing chaffs and flares. The tactical ranges in Germany are limited in that only eight aircraft at a time can use them; this does not allow the pilots to train in a realistic formation.", "Air space restrictions in Italy are a major challenge for the Air Force wing located in Aviano. The wing does not have permanent air space for air-to- air training in Italy. Currently, the wing uses a number of small air spaces over the base and airspace over the Adriatic Sea; however, there is no binding agreement for continued use of this space. Since 1993, the Italian government has limited U.S. military aviation forces in Italy, including both the Air Force and the Army, to 44 sorties per day. According to wing personnel, it is impossible for the Air Force to meet all annual training events within the 44 sorties per day restriction. In addition to sortie limitations, the Air Force is faced with additional restrictions, such as restricted flying hours, which make it difficult to complete night training requirements; hot pit refueling, that is, refueling while the pilot is in the cockpit and the engine is running; employing chaffs and flares; and flying at low altitudes.", "For the Air Force, airspace in the United Kingdom is very congested and has restrictions on high altitude and supersonic training, both of which are necessary for pilots to accomplish prescribed air-to-air attacks. Limited night flying hours restrict pilots\u2019 ability to accomplish night vision training events. Pilots have limited radio frequencies in which they can operate their electronic equipment. The only air space dedicated for unrestricted air-to-air training\u2014including the ability to fly supersonic, employ chaff/flares, and fly at unlimited altitudes\u2014is at an Air-Combat Maneuvering-Instrumentation (ACMI) range over the North Sea operated by a private contractor. See appendix II figure 9 for the location of the North Sea ACMI range. To gain access to this range, the United States must have a contract that allows it to buy training slots; however, this contract lapsed after fiscal year 2001 because of a lack of funding. Electronic warfare training is also a challenge for the Air Force wing. It does not have access to electronic warfare ranges where it can fly against threat emitters and regularly be exposed to reacting to aircraft system alerts. Lastly, the lack of radio frequencies for uses such as communicating while training and transmitting training telemetry to ground stations is an issue in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. However, the United Kingdom and Italy have now approved frequencies for the Air Force in Europe\u2019s rangeless training technology although there is still a lack of radio frequencies for communicating while training In Korea, the ranges used by the Air Force at Koon-ni and Pilsung have several restrictions. Both ranges do not allow flying after 10 p.m. This makes it extremely difficult for pilots to meet night-flying requirements during the summer months. In addition, the physical locations of the ranges restrict the approaches that aircraft can use to enter the ranges and the angles of attack used to engage targets. In both these locations, the airspace has become increasingly congested over time. The construction of the Inchon commercial airport near Seoul and its expected traffic growth will have a negative impact on airspace availability for training at Koon-ni Range in the future.", "In Japan, Air Force and Naval aviators are unable to successfully complete training at home station. The size and capabilities of the Ripsaw Range in northern Japan do not support training for the Air Force wing\u2019s mission,which is suppression of enemy air defenses. The range has only two emitters, and the physical size of the range and airspace will not permit additional emitters. Further, frequency bands are extremely restricted in Japan and additional frequency approval would be very difficult even if the available range space would accommodate adding more emitters. Consequently, while the size and capability of this range has not changed, the wing\u2019s mission changed, rendering this range ineffective for current training requirements. For the Navy, prior to 1992, night landing practice was conducted at Atsugi Naval Air Field. However, due to noise complaints generated by the increased population from residential development that abuts the Air Field fence, in 1992 routine landing practice was discontinued at Atsugi. The interim solution has been to have the pilots use Iwo Jima, 674 nautical miles away. The base commander can get approval for night landing practice at Atsugi only if weather prohibits the use of Iwo Jima or if an emergency arises that requires the wing to deploy quickly. Furthermore, because the airspace around Atsugi has become extremely congested, landing patterns cannot be practiced to standard.", "In addition to constraints on mainland Japan, airspace on Okinawa is restricted, creating difficulties for Air Force and Marine Corps pilots. According to Air Force personnel, there is no electronic warfare training capability on the island. The closest range with electronic emitters is the previously discussed Ripsaw Range in northern Japan. Low altitude flying (below 1,000 feet) is prohibited over Okinawa. Good neighbor policies limit flying to between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Restrictions imposed to accommodate civilian air traffic have dramatically increased, and Marine Corps officials told us that as a result they cannot fly low altitude air defense missions effectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Constraints Adversely Affect Training, but the Effects Are Not Captured in Readiness Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Training constraints have a variety of adverse effects. These include (1) requiring workarounds\u2014adjustments to the training events\u2014that sometimes breed bad habits that could affect performance in combat, (2) requiring military personnel to be away from home more often, and (3) in some instances preventing training from being accomplished. Sometimes workarounds lack realism, and the procedures used during the workaround could lead to individuals practicing tactics that may be contrary to what would be used in combat. While all units have to deploy to obtain some of their higher-level combined arms training skills, we found that all non-CONUS units had to deploy to complete training that normally is performed at home station by CONUS units. While deployments allow the units to complete a great deal more of their training, they result in increased costs and more time away from home. Even with these actions, units are not always able to accomplish required training or accomplish the training to such a limited extent that it just minimally satisfies the requirement. However, the adverse effects of training constraints are often not being captured in readiness reporting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Workarounds May Provide Unrealistic Training", "paragraphs": ["Units employ workarounds to mitigate home-station training limitations. Although workarounds are preferable to forgoing the training, they often result in training that is of lower quality or that creates \u201cnegative\u201d training. Negative training is practicing procedures in a manner inconsistent with how an action would be performed in combat, which results in developing bad habits. In Europe, in some instances the Army adapts maneuver training to fit the land available and the Air Force flies unrealistic air-to- ground attack training missions. In the Pacific, the Air Force must perform workarounds in Korea and Japan. These workarounds include delaying weapons arming when approaching the training ranges and using substitute signals to replicate threat emitters. Following are examples of such workarounds.", "In Italy, one of the Army\u2019s local training areas is not large enough or wooded enough to accomplish its required training. For the unit to perform its required flanking maneuver, it does so in pieces so that the land will accommodate the event. To train on what to do after making contact with the enemy, soldiers told us that a member of the unit would hide behind a pile of sandbags in an open field. The other members move through the open field and at some point the hidden solider playing the role of the enemy initiates contact for the unit to react. This workaround does not provide realistic training, because there is only one possible place the \u201cenemy\u201d can be.  Army officials based in Italy said that this local training area is not the preferred place for units to conduct the type of training described and that other training areas are available and used between 150 and 220 times per year.", "Air Force pilots in the United Kingdom have to both simulate air-to-ground attacks using training lasers instead of real lasers and train at different altitudes than they would likely operate at in combat. According to personnel at the fighter wing, training lasers create bad habits, especially for younger, less-experienced pilots, because the training laser has a shorter range, which does not allow for training on the longer range targeting likely in combat. In addition, flying at altitudes that are different than the altitudes likely to be used in combat affects pilots\u2019 timing, habit patterns, situational awareness, and engagement times. For example, because air-to-air missiles have twice the range at high altitude than at low altitude, the inability to train at high altitudes does not allow pilots to practice firing missiles in a realistic combat scenario.", "In Korea, at the Koon-ni range pilots have to delay arming their weapons until final approach. According to Air Force personnel this is negative training because, in actual combat, weapons are armed well before the final approach.", "In Japan, to get practice against more than the two threat emitters at Ripsaw Range, pilots from the fighter wing must employ a \u201ctrick file\u201d to fool their aircrafts\u2019 on board electronic warfare systems to make the systems think that weather and other civilian radars are threat emitters. While this workaround enables the aircraft\u2019s sensors to pick up the radar signals as if they were threat systems, the training is not realistic. The commercial radars are always turned on, making them easy to find. In combat situations, adversaries keep their air defense radars off as much as possible, making them much more difficult to locate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deployments Allow Units to Meet Some, but Not All, Training Needs", "paragraphs": ["When units are unable to mitigate their training constraints with a workaround, the next course of action taken is to deploy to complete training requirements. While all units have to deploy to major training centers like the Army\u2019s Combat Maneuver Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany to obtain some of their higher-level collective training skills, we found that all non-CONUS units had to deploy to complete training that CONUS units normally conduct at home station. Non-CONUS units deploy to other locations within the country in which they are stationed; in Alaska and Hawaii to training facilities elsewhere in those states; to other countries within their theaters; or back to the United States to complete training. While deployments allow the units to complete a great deal more of their training, they result in increased costs and more time away from home, although both DOD and the Congress are trying to reduce time away from home.", "Data we collected from each of the military services\u2019 commands in Europe and the Pacific show that in many cases when an entire country\u2019s training facilities (including both U.S. and host-country-operated facilities) are considered, or in the case of Alaska and Hawaii all facilities in those states, units are able to meet many of their training requirements. Since some facilities are not located near where units are stationed, Army and Marine Corps ground maneuver units and some Navy aviation units and ships must deploy to training facilities elsewhere in the country or state in which the unit is based and sometimes to other locations in their theater of operations. Air Force wings, except those in Korea, must deploy outside the country or state in which they are based to complete their training.", "The following is a discussion by service of overall training capabilities. Tables 1-4 show each service\u2019s training capabilities and how well the Commands believe their training facilities in that country or state satisfy their training needs. At our request, the service commands graded their locations on a high, medium, or low scale. High (H) denotes that units can fully satisfy or satisfy a vast majority of the capability; moderate (M) denotes that most of the capability can be satisfied; and low (L) denotes that very few to none of the training requirements can be satisfied in country or within the state. Because each service has different training requirements, the capabilities being rated vary.", "As shown in table 1, Army units can meet most training needs in country or state. Army units mainly deploy within country or state to obtain maneuver, major gunnery, and combined arms live fire training at the company level or higher. Army units in Germany deploy to Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels training areas on an average of 28 days per year to accomplish this training. Army units in Italy deploy to Grafenwoehr twice a year for about one month and to Hohenfels once a year for about 25 days to accomplish this training. In Korea, Army forces do not deploy away from Korea for training because of their mission. However, units have always had to deploy to larger training areas within country to complete necessary maneuver training. For example, each of the five armor and mechanized battalions in Korea deploy on average about 7 weeks each calendar year for maneuver training and, in total, the division\u2019s four aviation battalions deploy for training on average about 2-1/2 weeks each calendar year. Army units in both Hawaii and Alaska deploy within their respective states to accomplish their training requirements. This is particularly true for live-fire combined-arms training. There are no Army combat units permanently stationed in Japan.", "As shown in table 2, Marine Corps units\u2019 ability to meet training requirements are more limited than the Army\u2019s. Units must deploy to achieve most of their combined-arms live-fire training requirements. In Japan, on the island of Okinawa, Marine Corps training is largely limited to small arms live-fire and maneuver training at company level and below. Units must deploy off Okinawa to maintain basic skill training. Since 1996, to conduct artillery live fire training, four times a year 150 to 700 Marines stationed on Okinawa deploy to the Japanese mainland for 30 days. Live- fire and maneuver training above the platoon and squad level and any integrated combined-arms live-fire training involving coordinated air and ground assault, also must be conducted away from Okinawa. For each of these training exercises, about 1,000 sailors and marines deploy for 40 days. In Hawaii, Marine Corps forces on Oahu must deploy to the Army\u2019s Pohakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaii, about 200 miles from Oahu, to conduct combined air and ground task-force training. Each deployment lasts between 25 and 30 days and involves a maximum of 2,100 Marines. Prior to September 1998, the Marines would have conducted most of this training at the Army\u2019s Makua military training area on Oahu, lessening both deployment days and cost. Principally because of transportation costs, the Marines estimate it costs $500,000 more per year to train at Pohakuloa than it does to train at Makua. There are no Marine Corps combat units permanently stationed in Europe.", "As shown in table 3, Navy units have limited ability to meet training requirements in Japan, including Okinawa. Deployments are often needed to drop live ordnance, obtain proper electronic warfare training, fly at low altitudes, or to participate in combined air and ground forces training. For example, in Japan the carrier wing stationed at Atsugi Naval Air Field in the Tokyo suburbs deploys to maintain certification and qualification for aircraft carrier landings. Since 1992, aircrews have had to deploy to Iwo Jima, about 674 nautical miles from Atsugi, 2 to 3 times per year for this training. It requires between 350 and 500 personnel for a 10-day period to accomplish this training, which must be done prior to each carrier deployment. Because of its remote location and lack of an alternate emergency airfield, practicing carrier landings at Iwo Jima requires a safety waiver. In addition, these aircrews must also deploy to complete air- to-ground warfare training by either going to a target island near Okinawa, nearly 950 nautical miles away, or to Farallon de Medinilla, which is nearly 1,400 miles from Atsugi. For electronic warfare training, Navy aircrews stationed in Japan usually deploy to Pilsung Range in Korea, nearly 650 miles from Atsugi. During our visit to Japan, naval aviators said that it was not uncommon for them to deploy in excess of 200 days per year. There are no ships or carrier air wings permanently stationed in Europe.", "As shown in table 4, other than in Korea and Alaska, Air Force units have limited ability to train in the locations in which they are stationed. Many units must deploy to the United States to fulfill their live ordnance, electronic warfare, and low altitude flying requirements. For example, they deploy to the United States to participate in combined air and ground forces training such as Red Flag exercises and to participate in weapons testing exercises. The Air Force wing in Italy relies on deployments to Red Flag and weapons testing and delivery exercises to accomplish required training such as air-to-ground attacks, munitions employment, and low altitude flying because they do not have access to an air-to-ground range. In contrast, for CONUS-based units Red Flag is the culmination of training, not an opportunity to obtain training not available at home station. The Air Force wing in the United Kingdom also deploys to the United States for live fire training using laser-guided bombs and to engage in air-to-ground training on tactical ranges. Additionally, United Kingdom based units rely on deployments to Red Flag exercises or weapons system evaluation programs to complete their electronic warfare training. The Air Force in Europe discontinued use of a joint British and U.S. electronic warfare training range, Spadeadam, in October 2000, and the range is currently available on a pay-as-you-use basis. As a result of the cost, the fighter wing did not utilize this range during fiscal year 2001. Furthermore, a second option, the electronic warfare training range available in Germany, is not utilized on a routine basis because the distance from the United Kingdom to the range requires tanker support to train there, which increases training cost. In Japan, the wing stationed at Okinawa, as in the United Kingdom, doesn\u2019t have access to an electronic warfare range. This wing deploys to Ripsaw Range in northern Japan or to Pilsung Range in Korea to perform electronic warfare training.

In Korea, fighter squadrons reported that they could not satisfy their night-flying requirements because aircraft are not allowed to fly with their wing lights off. This lowers combat capability because during training it is impossible for pilots to avoid looking at anti-collision or navigation lights, which would not be available during combat. In Japan, the wing stationed on Okinawa is unable to complete its electronic warfare or low altitude training requirements because there is no electronic warfare range near Okinawa and because low altitude overland flights are not permitted on Okinawa.", "In Japan, five U.S. surface ships stationed in Japan are unable to complete their training requirements because they cannot fire the rolling airframe missile. This adversely affects their readiness. The targets used to qualify this missile cannot be launched and controlled from sites on Okinawa or elsewhere in Japan.

For the units that reported low training readiness, we examined the specific reasons cited for the lowered training readiness and also reviewed the commanders\u2019 comments to ascertain whether they attributed any of their training readiness shortfalls to training range or host country restrictions.

In addition, commanders may submit their own remarks on any subject.", "Our analysis of unit-readiness reports of combat forces stationed in Europe and for most combat forces stationed in the Pacific showed that during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 these forces rarely reported low combat readiness. In the Pacific, with the exception of U.S. naval forces stationed in Japan, forces rarely reported low training-readiness. Units from both theaters that did report low training-readiness rarely attributed the degradation to inadequate training areas. Rather, other factors were cited such as personnel shortages or operational commitments. Further, in those instances in which Air Force units reported low training-readiness, Air Force commanders\u2019 never cited training area limitations or host country restrictions as contributing factors to their low training-readiness. Army and Marine Corps commanders did cite training area limitations or host country restrictions as contributing factors, but only infrequently.", "Naval forces stationed in Japan reported low training readiness more often than other forces, but still only a small proportion of the time. Inadequate training areas or ranges were the third most frequently cited reason for the degraded training readiness. Further, when commenting on their units\u2019 low training status, commanders of these units often cited the inadequacy of the ranges available to them and other restrictions that limited their ability to train. For example, one unit commander commented that the inability of his fighters to carry live munitions out of Atsugi Naval Air Field was a contributing factor to his lowered training readiness.", "The limitations of the Global Status of Resources and Training System are well known in DOD. For the most part, military officials in both theaters and office of the secretary of defense officials told us that the unit readiness report is subjective and is not a vehicle to report training shortfalls and the associated limitations or restrictions. Officials within the office of the secretary of defense also noted that the reporting system does not function as a detailed management information system objectively counting all conceivable variables regarding personnel, training, and logistics.  Rather, we were told that it asks commanders to report on whether or not their units are combat ready or could be combat ready in a comparatively short period of time. However, as noted earlier, the readiness reporting system contains what are called reason codes to indicate the cause of lower reported readiness. These reason codes include inadequate training areas.", "There is no overall training shortfalls report that would inform senior DOD leadership of a units\u2019 inability to obtain required training.

The Air Force is negotiating to increase sorties to 63 per day.  U.S. Army helicopters stationed in Italy are restricted to 12 sorties per day and on a weekly basis only 15 of these sorties can be low altitude.
