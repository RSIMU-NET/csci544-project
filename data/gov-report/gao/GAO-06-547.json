Energy also failed to maintain accountability for equipment purchased by contractors. Further, subcontractor agreements, which represented nearly $15 million in program charges, were not adequately assessed, nor were overall contract costs sufficiently monitored or properly reported. These fundamental control weaknesses made Energy highly vulnerable to improper payments. GAO identified $26.4 million in improper and questionable payments for contractor costs, including billings of employees in labor categories for which they were not qualified or that did not reflect the duties they actually performed, the inappropriate use of fully burdened labor rates for subcontracted labor, add-on charges to other direct costs and base fees that were not in accordance with contract terms, and various other direct costs that were improperly paid. Further, certain payments toward the end of the program for furniture and computer equipment may not have been an efficient use of government funds. These improper and questionable payments represent nearly 30 percent of the $92 million in total program funds spent through September 30, 2005, but could be even higher given the poor control environment and the fact that GAO only reviewed selected program payments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of  2000 (EEOICPA) was passed by Congress, in part, to provide for timely  compensation of former nuclear weapons workers who sustained illnesses  that could be linked to exposure to toxic substances while employed at a  Department of Energy (Energy) facility. Subtitle D of EEOICPA instructed  Energy to assist its contractors\u2019 employees by developing and submitting  state workers\u2019 compensation claim applications to an independent  physician panel for review of each claimant\u2019s potential eligibility for  workers\u2019 compensation benefits.

Further, in May 2004, we issued a report identifying issues with the claims  review process. For example, we reported that a shortage of qualified  physicians serving on the review panels continued to constrain Energy\u2019s  capacity to decide cases more quickly. In October 2004, EEOICPA was  amended to repeal Subtitle D and add a new Subtitle E to be administered  by the Secretary of Labor.", "Prior to the amendment of EEOICPA, in a letter dated August 30, 2004, you  asked us to review costs incurred by Energy in its administration of  Subtitle D by considering the design of internal controls over expenditures  and the propriety of program payments.

We primarily focused on payments to key contractors  that received approximately 60 percent of the $92 million in program  expenditures through September 2005. We reviewed the design of controls  over program payments, including payments made to contractors. We also  reviewed controls designed to monitor overall contractor costs. We used a  variety of forensic auditing techniques, including data mining, to identify  payments for detailed review. We requested comments on a draft of this  report from the Secretary of Energy and on selections of this report from  the Commanding Officer of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center,  New Orleans (SSC NOLA). We received written comments from Energy\u2019s  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Planning and Administration, Office of  Environment, Safety and Health and the Commanding Officer of SSC  NOLA.

The Department of Labor (DOL)  administers Subtitle B, which provides eligible workers who were exposed  to radiation or other toxic substances and who subsequently developed  illnesses, such as cancer and lung disease, a onetime payment of up to  $150,000 and covers future medical expenses related to the illness. The  benefits are payable from a compensation fund established by EEOICPA.  Subtitle B is not covered in this report. Prior to October 2004, Energy  administered Subtitle D to help its contractors\u2019 employees file state  workers\u2019 compensation claims for illnesses determined by a panel of  physicians to have been caused by exposure to toxic substances in the  course of employment at an Energy facility. This report covers payments  made to administer Subtitle D.", "To facilitate outreach to potential claimants and to help claimants obtain  work and medical records to initiate claims under EEOICPA, Energy established 11 regional resource centers. These resource centers were a  gateway for claimants applying for assistance under EEOICPA under both  Subtitle D, administered by Energy, and Subtitle B, administered by DOL.  Energy and DOL shared the resource centers\u2019 costs of operation, staffing,  and training. To achieve this, DOL reimbursed Energy for about half of the  costs of its contract with Eagle Research Group, Inc., the company that  staffed and operated most of the resource centers. Additionally, DOL  reimbursed Energy for a portion of other costs Energy paid directly, such  as those for the leased space for the centers.", "After EEOICPA claims were received through the resource centers and  headquarters, Energy requested its field offices to locate records that  would support the claims, such as employment, medical treatment, and  toxic substance exposure records. Energy forwarded the information  collected to claim developers and various assistants who assembled the  information into case files. A panel of physicians reviewed the case files to  determine whether exposure to a toxic substance during employment at an  Energy facility was at least as likely as not to have caused, contributed to,  or aggravated the claimed medical condition. In addition to the panel  physicians, other doctors performed quality assurance checks of the case  files before the claims were submitted to the physician panels and again  after the physician panels had made recommendations. All panel  determinations were finalized by a medical director employed by Energy.  Energy communicated with applicants through an EEOICPA hotline and  through letters.", "Energy began accepting applications for Subtitle D in July 2001 when the  majority of the resource centers opened, and began developing cases in the  fall of 2002 when its final administrative rule took effect. While Energy got  off to a slow start in processing cases, completing only 6 percent of  approximately 23,000 cases by December 31, 2003, Energy later increased  claim development activities, which resulted in a backlog of claims  awaiting review by the physician panels. In June 2004, Energy transferred  $21.2 million in funds to OWA in an effort to clear the backlog of claims.  During the same time, it increased the number of case developers and  physicians serving on the review panels. Legislation was also moving  through Congress as early as June 2004 to transfer the administration of  Subtitle D from Energy to DOL. Ultimately, in October 2004, Congress  repealed Subtitle D and created Subtitle E, to be administered by DOL. In  light of the potential transfer, Energy ceased hiring new case developers in  August 2004, then gave official instruction to cease claims processing in  November 2004. Energy received $112.6 million in appropriated funds  (including transfers) through fiscal year 2005 for its EEOICPA activities  and spent over $92 million.

The increase in program  spending followed a June 2004 transfer of $21.2 million to OWA. According  to Energy officials in a March 2004 testimony before the Senate Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources, Energy transferred the funds in part to  reduce the backlog of unprocessed applications by increasing the number  of case developers and assistants as well as the number of physicians  serving on the review panels.", "In July 2004, Energy ordered $748,409 of modular furniture that was to be  installed in new work space to be occupied by claims processing personnel  provided by SEA. However, by August 2004, OWA had initiated a hiring  freeze. According to the program manager at the time, Energy was unable  to cancel the furniture order and the furniture was received in September  2004. Energy paid $6,060 a month through fiscal year 2005 to store the  furniture at a storage facility, incurring costs of $72,720 for 12 months. (See  fig. 3.) We noted that Energy prepaid the manufacturer $50,000 of  installation charges in 2004 even though the furniture was in storage for 12  months and not installed until February 2006, over a year and a half later,  for use by another Energy program. Total costs associated with the  furniture were $821,129, which we have classified as a questionable use of  government funds.", "During this period of increased program spending, SEA more than tripled  its workforce supporting OWA at the direction of Energy. To equip these  personnel, SEA purchased and subsequently billed the government for 200  desktop computers, 5 laptop computers, 6 industrial copiers, and 4 fax  machines at a cost of $341,790. This equipment was ordered from June 21,  2004, through July 27, 2004, and SEA received all items by August 2004.  Because the program ceased new case processing and SEA began  downsizing its staff in November 2004, SEA only used these items in  support of the program for at most 5 months. According to Energy officials,  Energy took possession of the equipment from the contractor when SEA\u2019s  contract ended on December 31, 2004. At the time of our inquiry nearly 8  months later, however, 134 items, with a cost of $241,725, were still unused  and located in storage rooms at Energy or could not be located."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The questionable and improper payments we identified during our review  represent nearly 30 percent of total program funds spent through  September 30, 2005. Given the lack of fundamental internal control over the  payment, monitoring, and reporting of contractor costs, and the fact that  we did not review all program payments, the amount of improper and  questionable payments could be even greater. Further, the control  weaknesses at Energy and SSC NOLA could be indicative of more systemic  problems at both organizations that could put other program funds at risk.  Correcting these problems will require a major reassessment of existing  practices, policies, and procedures and the overall control environment.  The success of this effort will depend on the level of commitment by senior  management in setting the \u201ctone at the top\u201d and working proactively to see  that the needed changes are effectively implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making 16 recommendations to address the issues identified in this  report.

["In the letter transmitting its detailed written comments on a draft of this  report, Energy stated that it agreed with the spirit and intent of our  recommendations and that it will give careful consideration to each of  them. Energy also said it would revise its current policies or procedures as  appropriate and described corrective actions it had already undertaken to  improve its controls, including those over interagency contracting. In its  detailed comments, Energy agreed with some of our findings and disagreed  with others without specifically commenting on any of the 16  recommendations, including the 14 directed to Energy. In particular,  Energy (1) disagreed with our view that it was ultimately responsible for  the issues that we identified relating to payments and controls for SEA, a  contractor obtained through an interagency agreement; (2) stated that it  was engaging the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to audit the costs  of two contractors that we reported as having a number of issues related to  improper payments, and that it considers this to be a control that addresses  some of our findings; (3) disagreed with our findings that Energy  improperly paid $557,429 to Westwood for add-on rates and $98,305 to TDI  for base fees; and (4) stated that its June 2004 transfer of $21.2 million was  proper and that the large purchases of furniture and equipment near the  end of the program were also proper. Energy also observed that the  November 29, 2005, settlement and release between the government and  SEA would appear to preclude the recovery of any additional money from  the contractor for the improper and questionable payments that we  identified in this report.", "In written comments reprinted in appendix III, SSC NOLA stated that it  concurred with the two recommendations calling for it to reassess its  procedures for carrying out its responsibilities in connection with  interagency agreements and that it expects to complete actions on both  recommendations by August 1, 2006. SSC NOLA separately provided  technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "Energy took issue with a number of our findings related to SEA contract  payments because Energy did not agree that it had ultimate responsibility  for the contract with SEA. Energy stated that it was the responsibility of  the contractor to comply with the terms of its contract. Energy stated that  it is a customer of SSC NOLA and, as such, had no direct contractual  relationship with the contractor, SEA. Energy\u2019s position is that SSC NOLA  was responsible for conducting appropriate oversight and administration  of contractor costs and that it had relied on SSC NOLA and GSA to ensure  that SEA complied with the terms of its contract. Energy further stated that  it deferred to SSC NOLA and GSA on issues with the SEA contract such as  labor categories, billing rates, qualifications of personnel, and  subcontractor arrangements and that those issues were the responsibility  of SSC NOLA and GSA, not Energy.", "We disagree with Energy\u2019s position that it had no responsibility as it relates  to the propriety of the payments made to SEA. As discussed in the  Background section of our report, in cases where authority for contract  oversight and administration is delegated among multiple agencies,  ultimate responsibility for the contract rests with the customer agency  (receiving agency), in this case Energy. Energy cannot assign or delegate  away its responsibilities through interagency agreements; the ultimate  responsibility for ensuring the success of the contracted efforts as well as  the propriety of payments remains with the receiving agency. In particular,  the Economy Act requires that agencies ordering and paying for services  under Economy Act agreements are responsible for ensuring that they  receive the required services and pay for actual costs that were incurred by  the performing agency, in this case SSC NOLA. While Energy may not  have had sole responsibility for ensuring that payments made to SEA were  proper, Energy was responsible for making sure that others were  adequately conducting work on its behalf to ensure that program funds  were not used to make questionable and improper payments.", "Notwithstanding its stated view that it was the responsibility of others and  not Energy to conduct appropriate oversight and administration of the SEA  contract, Energy stated that it did conduct observations and monitoring of  SEA services. Energy further stated that it linked those observations to  amounts billed each month through multiple levels of metrics and the  contractor\u2019s monthly cost report. However, we found that Energy did not  receive any of the SEA billings under the interagency agreement. Also, we  found that Energy had no processes in place to link the cost reports, any  metrics it may have produced, or any observations it may have made to  amounts that the contractor billed each month. Further, because  information in the contractor\u2019s monthly cost report was not compared to  amounts billed each month, the procedures Energy described in its  comments would be of limited value as a control process against improper  payments and would not provide Energy with the necessary assurance that  amounts subsequently paid to the contractor were appropriate.", "In response to a number of our findings related to improper payments  made to Westwood and TDI, Energy stated that it is currently having DCAA  audit these contracts. Energy further stated that these audits were initiated  as part of its \u201cnormal course of business\u201d and anticipated that many of the  issues we cited would normally be identified as part of a DCAA audit. While  we agree that a DCAA audit of contract costs can provide a detective  control to help determine whether contractor costs were proper, reliance  on an after-the-fact audit is not an acceptable replacement for the type of  real-time monitoring and oversight of contractor costs-preventive controls- that we found to be lacking at Energy. Further, a DCAA audit of civilian  contractor costs is not automatic and requires an additional cost to the  government to procure. In addition, as stated in our report, the numerous  issues that we identified with Westwood and TDI occurred over a 4-year  period. It is important that Energy establish a control environment that  includes control activities that prevent questionable or improper payments  to begin with or that detects them soon after they occur so that they can be  resolved in a timely manner, thus ensuring program funds are fully  available to achieve the purposes of the program. Reliance on an audit by  DCAA in 2006 or later of contractor activity that began in 2001 is not an  efficient or effective approach to implementing proper internal controls  over payments to contractors.", "Energy disagreed with our findings that it improperly paid $557,429 to  Westwood in the form of a 12 percent add-on rate and also improperly paid  $98,305 to TDI for base fees. Energy stated that Westwood had an approved  rate of 13 percent for general and administrative expense that was verified  by the CO in a DCAA pre-award audit. However, we found that the 13  percent general and administrative expense that Energy refers to was  evaluated in the context of a price proposal for a cost plus contract.  Further, under time and materials contracts like this one, general and  administrative expenses are typically included in the hourly rate associated  with each labor hour. While FAR 52.232-7 allows for \u201creasonable and  allocable\u201d material handling costs, including general and administrative  expenses, for materials and subcontractors to the extent that they are  \u201cclearly excluded from the hourly rate,\u201d neither Westwood nor Energy  provided evidence during our review that any such costs were clearly  excluded from Westwood\u2019s labor rates. Therefore we stand by our  conclusion that the 12 percent add-on rate to Westwood\u2019s time and  materials contract was improper.", "With respect to the improper payment to TDI of $98,305 in base fees,  Energy stated that our approach of adding TDI\u2019s fee to the fees associated  with its subcontractor (Westwood) was not appropriate because there is no  \u201cbase fee\u201d in Westwood\u2019s contract. Energy\u2019s stated basis for its position was  that the TDI contract was a cost-plus-award-fee type while TDI\u2019s  subcontract with Westwood was a cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract, with  no base fee. However, as stated in our report, TDI did not have a  subcontract or other binding agreement with Westwood for services  Westwood provided to Energy that TDI subsequently included on its  invoices to Energy. Further, Energy\u2019s contract with TDI limited the amount  of base fees to $82,847 applied to the level of effort (i.e., labor hours billed)  provided by TDI and made no distinction between hours incurred by the  prime contractor or any contractor viewed as a subcontractor. Thus, the  contract terms necessitate considering, as we did, the base fees of TDI and  Westwood together. As stated in our report, Energy paid a total of $181,152  in base fees when the maximum should have been $82,847, thus resulting in  improper payments of $98,305.", "Energy stated that the information in our report showing that $21.2 million  in funds was transferred to OWA in June 2004 during the same time that  legislation was moving through Congress to transfer the administration of  the program to DOL implies that Energy\u2019s ramp-up activities were  unsupportable. Energy also stated that using these funds to purchase  furniture and equipment in the summer of 2004 was consistent with  congressional approval of its reprogramming actions.", "Our report does not imply that Energy\u2019s ramp-up activities were  unsupportable. Our report provides extensive background information on  the program, including the June 2004 transfer of $21.2 million in funds to  OWA in an effort to clear the backlog of claims. This background  information was provided for context. As discussed in our report, however,  we did identify $1,162,919 in purchases of furniture and equipment and  related storage costs that may not have been an efficient use of government  funds given that Congress was giving consideration to transferring  responsibility for the program to another agency. As discussed in the  report, Energy ordered $748,409 of modular furniture in July 2004 that was  to be installed in new work space to be occupied by claims processing  personnel provided by SEA. However, by August 2004, OWA had initiated a  hiring freeze and therefore placed the furniture in a storage facility,  incurring costs of $72,720 for 12 months. Further, Energy paid the vendor  $50,000 up front in 2004 for installation charges even though the furniture  was not installed until February 2006, over a year and a half later, for use by  another Energy program.", "Regarding our recommendation that Energy pursue opportunities for  recovery of labor and other SEA costs that we identified as improper or  questionable, Energy stated that the November 29, 2005, settlement  agreement and release between the government and SEA would appear to  preclude the recovery of any additional moneys for expenditures in support  of Energy\u2019s programs. Our report stated that we did not determine whether,  or to what extent, the terms of the November 29, 2005, settlement and  release with SEA may affect any potential additional monetary recoveries  by the government for the questionable and improper payments made to  SEA that we identified. We also stated in our report that the release clause  of the settlement is limited to \u201ccovered conduct\u201d investigated by the  government related to two areas: billing indirect labor costs as direct labor  costs and billing for employees in labor categories for which they were not  qualified. It is important that Energy consult with DOJ in order to  determine the recoverability of funds from SEA before concluding that the  funds are not recoverable.

Further, we reviewed  contractual agreements, including prime contracts with four contractors;  Energy\u2019s interagency agreement with the Space and Naval Warfare Systems  Center, New Orleans, (SSC NOLA); and certain subcontract agreements  provided by prime contractors.

See the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation section. 2. We have not included the acquisition letter attached to this letter in this  report. The letter can be found on Energy\u2019s Web site, www.doe.gov. 3. We did not assess or conclude on whether the government received  \u201cgood value\u201d from the contract with SEA. The scope of our work was to  determine whether internal controls over program payments were  adequately designed, and if program payments were properly  supported as a valid use of government funds. We addressed financial  management practices and procedures and whether payments were  proper, not the value or quality of services received.  4. We modified the report for this additional information.  5. We disagree. Our report stated that the contract with Westwood did not  fully reflect actual duties that were subsequently performed and  provided three examples of such. The quotation provided by Energy in  its comments is from the statement of work section of the Westwood  contract entitled \u201cAdvisory Committee Activities\u201d that only addresses  the work that Westwood should perform in support of the Advisory  Committee, and therefore this language does not address the other  activities Westwood performed.  6. Energy states that a complete cost proposal was obtained from  Westwood.  However, Energy does not address that our report stated  that Westwood\u2019s cost proposal was not incorporated into the prime  contact with TDI nor was any other binding agreement created  between Energy and Westwood relative to its cost proposal. Thus, as  our report also stated, without an effective contractual agreement,  including negotiated rates, it was not possible for Energy to adequately  review the amounts TDI billed for costs attributed to what Energy  characterizes as the subcontractor, Westwood. We reaffirm this  position.   7. A formal agreement between a prime and a subcontractor not only  protects the interests of the parties involved, but also those of the  government. Additionally, as discussed in the Agency Comments and  our Evaluation section of our report, after-the-fact detective controls,  such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency audits are not a  replacement for real-time monitoring and oversight of contract costs.  8. At the time of our first inquiry, Energy told us it was still updating and  finalizing the locations and conditions of the government-owned  equipment that SEA purchased. On September 29, 2005, the Director of  the Office of Information Management within the Office of  Environment Safety and Health stated that \u201cthe identification and  recording process is still underway.\u201d This was 8 months after expiration  of the SEA contract in December 2004. Our report also stated that an  inventory of contractor-purchased, government owned equipment that  Westwood purchased was not conducted until December 2005, nearly 9  months after Westwood\u2019s contract expired, which Energy does not  dispute.   9. We did not review Energy\u2019s work in 2006 to address the missing items.  10. We do not agree with Energy\u2019s statement that \u201cat no time did Energy  exceed a contractually negotiated and established contact ceiling.\u201d Our  report stated that Energy did not establish internal control monitoring  practices to effectively manage overall contract costs, including using  contract ceilings to manage and encourage cost-effectiveness. We  found, for example, that Westwood was paid amounts that exceeded  the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d ceiling on other direct costs each year under its first  contract, which covered the 3 \u00bd  year period August 2001 through  February 2005 as well as under the second contract that began in  September 2004. As a specific example, the other direct cost ceiling  was $600,000 in year 3, but Westwood was paid $2,421,176, or  $1,821,176 more than the \u201cnot to exceed\u201d limit per the contract.  11. Our report stated that the scope of our work was to determine whether  internal controls over program payments were adequately designed and  if program payments were properly supported as a valid use of  government funds. The furniture purchases were considered by us in  the context of both objectives. 12. Our report recognized that there are different interpretations of the  time and material payment clause (FAR 52.232-7). For purposes of our  report, we have based our findings on the literal application of this  clause. Further, as also stated in our report, we found that neither  Energy nor SSC NOLA for SEA exercised sufficient management  oversight to be fully informed of the nature, extent, scope of services,  and terms of billing to the government for subcontracted services. In  addition, we found inconsistencies in the  application of what Energy  refers to in its comments as its \u201cmethod established for T&M contracts  of requiring both primes and subcontractors to be reimbursed for direct  labor based on their own established fully burdened labor rates.\u201d  13. Energy originally told us that the hiring freeze instituted in August 2004  was because of the combination of a probable continuing resolution  and the possible transfer of the program to DOL. We modified the  report based on Energy\u2019s written comments. 14. We modified the report to reflect that the $50,000 of up-front  installation charges were paid in 2004 even though the equipment \u201cwas  not installed until February 2006.\u201d Notwithstanding this, the furniture  installation fee, like the furniture, did not benefit OWA but rather  another Energy program.   15. We did not review the procedures described as a corrective action to  address our finding that Energy\u2019s monitoring of services provided  under the Westwood contract was insufficient. However, it will be  important that changes are made to comprehensively address the  conditions we found at the contractor and at Energy. Our report stated  that the productivity measures used by the contractor to monitor work  performed by physician panel members were developed based on the  hours actually billed on the invoices submitted by the physicians, and  therefore Energy had no independent baseline to measure productivity  or to assess the reasonableness of hours billed on the invoices  submitted by the physicians. Further, our report stated that doctors  who performed a quality check function on claims were also not  sufficiently monitored. Energy did not systematically observe the hours  worked and compare any observations to the amounts paid for those  hours, nor did it determine that Westwood was adequately monitoring  these services as a basis for its billings.  16. The contracting officer\u2019s representative told us that supporting  documentation for Westwood\u2019s invoices was not requested because of  the \u201cvoluminous amounts\u201d of paper that Westwood would need to copy  and transmit to Energy each month. Our report stated that one of the  elements of the control weakness for other direct costs was that the  contractor was not required to report a detailed breakdown of its other  direct costs as stipulated by its contracts. Without this level of  information, it was not possible for Energy officials to effectively  review and approve these invoices for payment. Further, a substantial  portion of the amount billed by Westwood for other direct costs was for  temporary labor, and Energy\u2019s controls would not, therefore, be  enhanced by the corrective action put in place covering purchases of  $50 or more. According to the implementation memo, this action is  intended to address purchases such as government-owned equipment  and travel, but does not specifically state whether temporary labor  would be covered. It will be important for Energy to take further  corrective actions that address enforcing its requirements for a detailed  breakdown of other direct costs as well as controls specifically  designed for temporary labor that are not covered by its new policy on  purchases.   17. We disagree. Our report stated that Energy improperly assigned the  costs of OWA services provided by Westwood to other program  reporting units, in effect using other programs\u2019 funds to pay for OWA  activities. We found that these practices occurred throughout the 4  years of the program for both the Westwood and TDI contracts, not just  for \u201ca short period\u201d as Energy stated in its written comments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, New Orleans", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, staff members who made key  contributions to this report include Robert Owens, Assistant Director;  Marie Ahearn; Sharon O.
