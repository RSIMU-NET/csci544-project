Agencies have made progress addressing previously identified weaknesses in response to changes in law, GAO recommendations, or agencies' own internal identification of them. For instance, the area of export controls has seen significant action for reform, based on an April 2010 framework announced by the administration. Other programs, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, have undergone reform through legislative requirements. As shown in the table below, multiple agencies have responsibility for these eight programs designed to protect critical technologies.", "However, some of these eight programs have additional challenges that remain to be addressed. For example, the Department of Defense (DOD) has not yet completed an evaluation of the Militarily Critical Technologies List or potential alternatives in response to GAO recommendations regarding the need to determine the best approach for meeting users' requirements for a technical reference. Further, DOD and the Department of Homeland Security still need to take additional actions to improve shipment tracking and verification procedures of arms sales to foreign allies for the Foreign Military Sales program.", "Both existing mechanisms and some new initiatives among the critical technologies programs support collaboration, but collaboration among lead and stakeholder agencies remains a challenge. GAO's September 2012 work on interagency collaboration mechanisms notes that many of the meaningful results the federal government seeks to achieve require the coordinated efforts of more than one federal agency. Recent initiatives have resulted in improved interagency collaboration. For example, DOD offices now communicate with non-DOD agencies through a formally instituted group to discuss potential technology transfers to foreign governments. However, current collaboration mechanisms do not involve direct communication among all the programs in the protection of critical technologies portfolio. Improved collaboration among the programs and agencies involved in the protection of critical technologies could help increase their efficiency and effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To ensure a consistent and collaborative approach to the protection of critical technologies, GAO recommends that agencies with lead and stakeholder responsibilities take steps to promote and strengthen collaboration mechanisms among their respective programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Technological superiority is critical to U.S. military and foreign policy  strategy.

Because State and Commerce have different restrictions on the items  they control, determining which agency controls exported items is  fundamental to the effectiveness of the U.S. export control system. Over  10 years ago, we found that both departments had claimed jurisdiction  over the same items, such as certain missile-related technologies, and  the administration noted that these types of jurisdictional issues were still  present in 2010, when they began Export Control Reform. Such  jurisdictional disagreements and problems in the past have often resulted  from the departments\u2019 differing interpretations of the regulations and from  minimal or ineffective coordination among the departments. As part of the  reform initiative, a task force created new export control criteria to  determine which items and technologies should be controlled by  Commerce and which by State, thus helping to reduce uncertainty. In  implementing this process, Commerce, State, and Defense officials  involved in the reform initiative are working to reach agreement on the  appropriate controls over items in the 21 categories of State\u2019s U.S.  Munitions List and the corresponding controls for items Commerce, State,  and Defense officials determine should be moved to the Commerce  Control List.", "Since the first set of revised rules went into effect in 2013, 15 of the 21  categories of the U.S. Munitions List have been reviewed and final rules  have been issued to clearly identify the jurisdiction of controlled items.  These revisions are intended to move certain less sensitive items from  State\u2019s U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List, while leaving  high-risk and high-priority items and information on State\u2019s list. The  moved items are subject to Commerce\u2019s more flexible Export  Administration Regulations. The aim of these revisions is to enhance  national security by increasing interoperability with allies, maintaining the  U.S. defense industrial base, and enabling the U.S. export control  agencies to focus on items and destinations of greater concern. For  example, military aircraft instrument flight trainers not specially designed  to simulate combat have been transitioned from the U.S. Munitions List to  the Commerce Control List. An additional three categories of the U.S.  Munitions List, pertaining to arms and ammunition, are on hold because  they relate to the politically sensitive issue of gun control policy, according  to senior level export administration officials at both State and Commerce.  The final three categories are still under review.", "Current efforts have focused on transitioning less sensitive items from the  U.S. Munitions List to a new section of the Commerce Control List called  the 600 Series, which was added in order to provide a separate  classification for munitions newly under Commerce\u2019s jurisdiction.  According to Commerce\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Export Administration,  the completion of all of these revisions is expected by late 2015. As a  result of the control list revision process, however, licensing staff and  industry are contending with three general types of controls\u2014the U.S.  Munitions List, the 600 Series controls on the Commerce Control List, and  the dual-use controls on the Commerce Control List. This is intended as  an intermediary step on the path to a single list, but an official from  State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls noted that, for now, some  exporters are confused by the multiple lists. This confusion among  exporters, although typically expected when there are various lists, could  delay or impair achievement of the Export Control Reform\u2019s goal of  overcoming the inefficiencies of the previous export control system until  the final integration to a single list is completed.", "These changes to the lists are also affecting export control enforcement  actions that rely on processing of commodity jurisdictions\u2014which  determine whether an item is controlled by State or Commerce\u2014by the  Department of State, according to enforcement agency officials. Two  officials from the Department of Justice, as well as the Deputy Assistant  Director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Homeland  Security Investigations Counter-Proliferation Investigations Program, told  us that it is taking longer for State to issue decisions, including commodity  jurisdiction determinations, because of the recent changes to the control  lists. They stated that the changing jurisdiction of items is resulting in a  greater need for investigators to obtain timely commodity jurisdictions  than in the past. Consequently, these officials noted that, given the time it  is taking to complete the commodity jurisdiction decision\u2014upwards of 6  months in some cases, which is well beyond State\u2019s goal of 60 days\u2014it is  difficult for law enforcement to build a case and receive timely information  to take specific enforcement actions, such as authorization to execute a  search warrant or to obtain criminal indictments. The Deputy Assistant  Director of DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations Counter-Proliferation  Investigations Program also noted that commodity jurisdictions often  involve review by other agencies, such as DOD technical experts in  addition to the licensing agencies of State and Commerce, and that this  involvement, in addition to the limited staff at the State Department  available to conduct commodity jurisdictions for law enforcement  agencies, may be contributing to the length of time taken. Compliance  officials at State indicated that they try to prioritize commodity jurisdiction  requests from law enforcement, but increases in the frequency of these  requests and duplication of requests has made it difficult for them to keep  up with law enforcement needs.", "According to the Department of Justice officials, the length of time it takes  to receive the certification necessary from the State Department to  proceed with their enforcement actions, such as search warrants, results  in cases losing momentum. These delays also contribute to increased  difficulty in keeping witnesses interested and available if and when the  case goes to trial. In addition, the Deputy Assistant Director of DHS\u2019s  Homeland Security Investigations Counter-Proliferation Investigations  Program told us that DHS is experiencing the same challenge in  conducting enforcement activities. Officials with both Homeland Security  Investigations and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys stated that  these delays are having an adverse effect on numerous cases and  investigations. DHS documents show that the number of requests for  support by State that would include a commodity jurisdiction have  doubled since 2008, reaching more than 250 requests in 2014. Further,  two officials from the Department of Justice told us that in this transitional  period, the revisions to the control list are creating some degree of  confusion and it is becoming more subjective to prosecute cases. The  burden of export control cases is to establish that the individual or entity  willfully and knowingly intended to violate the law, and the increased  confusion can complicate efforts to prove that intent. These officials  stated that they are beginning to collect information on the impact of this  confusion; and according to officials at State, DHS, and Justice, they are  working together to develop updated procedures for requesting  commodity jurisdictions that will facilitate the process on both sides and  reduce confusion.

Prior  to these changes, many cases were taking upwards of one year to  conduct reviews and put FOCI measures in place for companies that  conduct classified work for the U.S. government. According to the head of  the Defense Security Service\u2019s FOCI Operations Division, these changes  in staffing and taking a risk-based approach have reduced the backlog of  reviews of new companies handling classified information. The Analytic  Division now conducts FOCI reviews of all of the roughly 1300 new  companies seeking clearance each year. For previously cleared facilities,  officials stated that this risk-based approach allowed Defense Security  Service staff to complete security vulnerability assessments at about half  of the roughly 13,500 cleared facilities under their purview in 2014. They  told us that this process also allows staff to prioritize and target those  reviews to higher risk facilities; for example, in 2014, they conducted  reviews at 586 of the roughly 600 cleared facilities that have FOCI  mitigation in place.", "NISP had previously used the MCTL to categorize the types of classified  information by technology that was being targeted in cleared facilities by  foreign entities. However, according to the officials with Defense Security  Service\u2019s Counterintelligence Directorate, MCTL was not broad enough to  cover non-defense-related technologies, in fields such as agriculture.  With the transition away from MCTL, the Defense Security Service  developed the Industrial Base Technology List to better cover the range  of categories of concern to NISP; and according to these officials,  Counterintelligence continually updates this list to include new  technologies requiring oversight as they are developed, as well as  including non-defense technologies that fall under the purview of NISP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States Faces Changes in the Risks It Must Address", "paragraphs": ["CFIUS is an interagency committee that serves the President by  overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the  U.S. economy. CFIUS is chaired by Treasury, and includes members  from other federal agencies such as Commerce, Defense, Energy,  Homeland Security, Justice, and State, among others. CFIUS reviews  foreign acquisitions, mergers, or takeovers of a U.S. business to  determine whether it poses a threat to the national security of the United  States. CFIUS may also enter into an agreement with, or impose  conditions on, parties to mitigate national security risks. One component  of this review involves discussion of any relevant critical technologies and  the potential impacts of foreign ownership of, or access to, such  technologies. In 2008, in response to Congressional action partially driven  by findings and recommendations that we raised in earlier reports,  CFIUS implemented reforms increasing its efforts on national security- related topics and defining categories of transactions subject to review,  such as those resulting in control of critical U.S. infrastructure by a foreign  person. In 2012, the growing number of investments in the United States  by Chinese firms sparked concerns by a number of groups over the  economic and security impact of the investments, according to a report by  the Congressional Research Service.", "The scope of potential national security risks presented by foreign  investment in the United States has evolved beyond ownership and  control concerns. Specifically, the issue of proximity has broadened to  consideration of the geographic location of foreign-owned businesses and  their capability to collect intelligence on U.S. military installations. For  example, the CFIUS review process came under increased scrutiny after  the attempted purchase by a Dubai company, Dubai Ports World, of a  company that operated various U.S. port facilities. Although initially  allowed to proceed by CFIUS in 2006, subsequent congressional and  media attention ultimately caused the company to sell the U.S. portion of  the business to another U.S. company. In addition to the Dubai Ports  case, according to a Congressional Research Service report, an  investment by a Chinese firm in a wind farm project in Oregon recently  attracted public and congressional attention. CFIUS recommended that  the company stop operations until an investigation could be completed as  a result of objections by the U.S. Navy over the placement of wind  turbines near or within restricted Naval Weapons Systems Training  Facility airspace where unmanned aerial vehicles are tested. After a full  investigation, CFIUS recommended that the President block the  investment and he issued an Administrative Order stating that there was  credible evidence that the acquisition threatened to impair U.S. national  security; the case is under appeal. Further, in December 2014, we  issued a report that examined DOD military installations and critical  infrastructure which included information on the proximity of foreign- owned businesses near military bases. Although this report did not have  any findings or recommendations related to the CFIUS process, it  identifies foreign-owned businesses near military bases as another  potential area for CFIUS consideration."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Interagency Collaboration Exists among Agencies but Improvements Could Be Made", "paragraphs": ["Recent initiatives in response to identified weaknesses in the critical  technologies programs have resulted in improved interagency  collaboration.

In some cases, these  programs promote interagency collaboration through formal and long- standing mechanisms. Most notably, CFIUS was established as an  interagency body to review transactions that could result in a foreign  party\u2019s gaining control over a U.S. company. Under the CFIUS process,  CFIUS member agencies work toward reaching a consensus on  decisions. The consensus-based decision-making process ensures that  representatives of each stakeholder agency are aware of the basis of the  decision, including any future actions that CFIUS might be relying on  each agency to take to address national security risks. CFIUS, or a lead  agency, may negotiate agreements with any party to a covered  transaction in order to mitigate the national security risks that may result  from the transaction, when other provisions of law do not adequately  address these risks. The CFIUS lead agency on the transaction is  responsible for monitoring the agreement to ensure compliance with it.  GAO has not recently examined CFIUS agencies\u2019 efforts to enforce these  security agreements, and we are not aware of any ongoing changes or  initiatives that involve CFIUS.", "We also found that agencies have fostered new opportunities to promote  interagency collaboration in their shared goal of protecting critical  technologies. For example, the creation of the ATTR SSG created new  opportunities for regular communication, through monthly meetings,  among DOD offices and between DOD and State, while preserving  DOD\u2019s control over the coordinating body. A new office, the Technology  Security and Foreign Disclosure Office, serves as the administrative arm  of the ATTR SSG and participates in creating and disseminating policies  in this area. State Department officials from the Regional Security and  Arms Transfers office and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  participate in the ATTR SSG as observers. These State representatives  have raised concerns about individual transactions at the ATTR SSG and  initiated policy discussions, but are considered non-DOD participants;  therefore they do not have voting rights within the group.", "In 2014, DOD organized a new office within the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, devoted to improving the strategic  posture of DOD security cooperation activities by, among other things,  coordinating DOD\u2019s use of legal authorities, including Foreign Military  Sales and the National Disclosure Policy, for transfers to foreign partners.  To this end, the office facilitates the inclusion of key stakeholders in its  strategic initiatives, including those involved in critical technologies  protection and foreign disclosure within DOD, as well as at State. At this  point, it is too early to determine what effects this office will have on intra-  and inter-agency coordination.", "In addition to the formal coordinating bodies discussed above, the  agencies also make use of informal processes to ensure an ongoing flow  of information. As part of the administration\u2019s Export Control Reform  initiative, State and Commerce regularly consult with DOD officials and  subject matter experts about revisions to export control regulations. DOD  and State also have plans to detail staff to their counterpart\u2019s offices in  order to improve communication on their shared programs, particularly  Foreign Military Sales. Officials stated that this should enable them to  learn about how information is handled at the other agency and about one  another\u2019s practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration among Lead and Stakeholder Agencies Remains a Challenge Across the Critical Technologies Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have taken steps to collaborate with other agencies to manage  their individual critical technologies programs; however, current  collaboration mechanisms do not involve direct communication among all  the programs in the protection of critical technologies portfolio. For  example, although the ATTR SSG has developed processes for  interagency collaboration on security cooperation programs, it does not  provide a forum for direct communication among all programs with critical  technologies responsibilities, such as Commerce\u2019s export control officials.  All of the eight critical technology programs in this portfolio share a goal of  protecting national security. In January 2007, when we designated the  protection of critical technologies as high risk, our body of work on  programs designed to protect critical technologies showed fragmentation,  including poor coordination among the multiple agencies involved. The  agencies responsible for many of these programs have since made  progress toward improving coordination and reducing fragmentation,  individually, and in some instances collectively. Past work on interagency  collaboration notes that many of the results that the federal government  seeks to achieve require the coordinated efforts of more than one federal  agency and often more than one sector and level of government.", "Both Congress and the executive branch have recognized the need for  improved collaboration across the federal government, as stated in our  September 2012 report on interagency collaboration. In a June 2010  report on interagency collaboration in national security, we also  concluded that when multiple agencies are managing similar information,  challenges may exist among agencies regarding redundancies in  information sharing, unclear roles and responsibilities, and data  comparability.including differences in agencies\u2019 structures, planning processes, and  funding sources\u2014can hinder interagency collaboration.", "That report also noted that organizational differences\u2014 According to officials involved in administering critical technologies  programs, different programs use different terminology, and the usage  and understanding of terms can vary. Under the administration\u2019s Export  Control Reform initiative, State and Commerce have worked together to  revise regulatory definitions of key terms, and this collaboration is  ongoing. Across the broader portfolio of critical technologies programs,  however, definitions may not always be clearly aligned, and categories  such as critical technologies may be understood in different ways at  different programs. Best practices for interagency collaboration include  using consistent terminology to establish a common understanding and  improve collaboration among the various programs. In some cases, distinct uses of the same or similar terms may be appropriate, but make it  more important that the programs have a plan for sharing these  distinctions to ensure a common understanding. As the use of the U.S.  Munitions List and the Commerce Control List expands to areas beyond  export controls, taking steps to apply the concepts and terms used by the  lists consistently would help eliminate confusion and facilitate  collaboration. State\u2019s export compliance officials noted that the U.S.  Munitions List sets out a procedure for assessing items to determine  whether they are subject to State\u2019s export control regulations, and that  other potential users of this list need to understand how this procedure  works in order to avoid confusion.", "Some impediments to collaboration could be addressed when the  implementation of certain initiatives is completed. For example, DOD\u2019s  use of Better Buying Power 2.0\u2019s Defense Exportability Features enables  DOD to more clearly inform acquisition programs about their  responsibilities for critical technologies programs such as Anti-Tamper  Policy and Foreign Military Sales at the design stage, rather than waiting  until decisions are made about where to deploy or sell a system. DOD  plans to continue the Defense Exportability Features initiative in Better  Buying Power 3.0, which launched in September 2014. In addition, the  establishment of the E2C2 was a step toward addressing concerns about  collaboration we had raised in prior reports, and the E2C2\u2019s deconfliction  process provides significant opportunities for improved information  sharing. However, the full benefit of export enforcement coordination is  limited until all of the standard operating procedures are completed,  including the one that allows for greater collaboration between the  enforcement and intelligence communities.", "In a September 2014 meeting with senior representatives of the agencies  involved in the protection of critical technologies, we discussed their  efforts to address our designation of this area as high risk and also  discussed the possibility of having one agency in charge of this area.  These agencies expressed concern over their distinct roles and  responsibilities and which agency would take the lead for coordinating  efforts to protect critical technologies. In subsequent discussions with  these agencies, the officials responsible for the operations of these  programs generally agreed with the need for better collaboration among  the programs, including actions not currently being taken. Such actions  could include holding an annual meeting of the programs designed to  protect critical technologies to discuss the technologies they are  protecting, their programs\u2019 intent, and any new developments or changes  planned for their programs. For example, the Director of DOD\u2019s Defense  Technology Security Administration stated that, even within DOD, these  programs expand beyond any one organization and initiatives are  occurring within these programs. Interagency collaboration mechanisms  for various agencies involved in common goals, such as the protection of  critical technologies, are essential to avoid the potential for a patchwork of  activities that could waste scarce funds and limit the overall effectiveness  of federal efforts. Cross agency collaboration may strengthen the alliance  of these programs and create common understanding of these  technologies and better ensure that they are provided to foreign entities in  a manner consistent with U.S. interests. For these reasons, it is important  that the agencies responsible for the protection of critical technologies  continue to promote and strengthen mechanisms for effective  collaboration, both within their programs and agencies, as well as across  the interagency community."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the 8 years since critical technologies programs were added to the  GAO high-risk list, the agencies responsible for their implementation have  taken positive steps and developed a number of initiatives to improve  their individual programs. The critical technologies portfolio is a complex  array of programs, subject to a myriad of laws, regulations, and policies,  and administered by multiple offices across several departments.  Effective coordination across the portfolio of programs is important to  mitigate national security risks, and interagency collaboration is essential  to realizing the potential effectiveness of the programs. This is especially  true in light of the initiatives under way and the changing nature of issues  related to the protection of critical technologies. It is important that  collaboration and information sharing is optimized among agencies, not  just within each agency. Doing so would improve their ability to protect  critical technologies and national security interests. Within individual or  closely related programs, ensuring that a consistent approach is taken by  the lead and stakeholder agencies in meeting the program goals would  help coordinating bodies to ensure that the protecting of critical  technologies remains up to date and effective. Ongoing improvements to  the individual programs may help to address some of these coordination  issues, but interagency collaboration across the portfolio remains an  important challenge as these changes occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure a consistent and more collaborative approach to the protection  of critical technologies, we recommend that the Secretaries of  Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, State, and the Treasury; as  well as the Attorney General of the United States, who have lead and  stakeholder responsibilities for the eight programs within the critical  technologies portfolio, take steps to promote and strengthen collaboration  mechanisms among their respective programs while ongoing initiatives  are implemented and assessed.
