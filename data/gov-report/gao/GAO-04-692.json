In some cases, however, DOE has only partially addressed the Academy's recommendations. For example, one recommendation suggested that DOE develop three plans--namely, headquarters level, plant-complex level, and site level--that address and integrate the decontamination and decommissioning of the facilities. Only one plant has developed a plan, however. Additionally, DOE is pursuing an accelerated, risk-based cleanup strategy at the plants that it believes will reduce cleanup costs. According to DOE officials, an accelerated, risk-based strategy will accelerate time frames for cleanup, and establish \"realistic cleanup criteria\" in DOE's regulatory cleanup agreements. Despite DOE efforts to reduce costs, we found that based on current projected costs and revenues, the Fund will be insufficient to cover the cleanup activities at the three plants. Specifically, our Baseline model demonstrated that by 2044, the most likely time frame for completing cleanup of the plants, costs will have exceeded revenues by $3.5 billion to $5.7 billion (in 2004 dollars). Importantly, we also found that the Fund would be insufficient irrespective of which model we used, including models that estimated the final decommissioning at the plants under (1) accelerated time frames, (2) deferred time frames, or (3) baseline time frames, and with additional revenues from federal government contributions as authorized under current law. Because the Paducah and Portsmouth plants are now estimated to cease operations by 2010 and 2006, respectively, extending the Fund by an additional 3 years would give DOE an opportunity to develop plans, including more precise cost estimates, for the cleanup of these plants and to better determine if further Fund extensions will be necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Decontaminating and decommissioning the Department of Energy\u2019s three  uranium enrichment plants\u2014located near Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Paducah,  Kentucky; and Portsmouth, Ohio\u2014will cost billions of dollars and could  span several decades. These plants, which encompass more than 30 million  square feet of floor space, miles of interconnecting pipes, and thousands of  acres of land, are contaminated with radioactive and hazardous materials.  The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Office of Environmental Management  is responsible for cleanup of the three plants. Cleanup activities include  assessing, treating, and disposing of the contamination found at the plants  and the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of inactive facilities.  DOE conducts its cleanup activities under the requirements of several  federal environmental laws and compliance agreements with relevant  regulatory authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency and  state regulatory agencies.

The Congress authorized annual contributions  to the Fund for 15 years (ending in 2007), to be made by government  appropriations and payments from domestic utility companies that utilized  the enriched uranium produced by these plants for nuclear power  generation. The Congress specified that any unused balances in the Fund  be invested in Treasury securities and any interest earned be made  available to pay for activities covered under the Fund. In creating the Fund,  the Congress also required the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) to  undertake a study to assess the opportunities for cost reduction in carrying  out the D&D work at the three plants.

DOE was also generally unable to provide information  regarding the cost savings, if any, achieved by implementing these actions.  To determine other steps DOE has taken to reduce cleanup costs, we  visited all three plants and interviewed DOE and contractor officials from  DOE headquarters, the Oak Ridge Operations Office, the Lexington Office,  and the site offices at each of the three plants.

The Energy Policy Act  authorized the collection of revenues for 15 years to pay for authorized  cleanup costs. The revenues are derived from: (1) an assessment on  domestic utilities of up to $150 million annually, based on a ratio of their  purchases of enriched uranium to the total purchases from DOE, including  those for defense; and (2) federal government appropriations for the  difference between the authorized funding under the Energy Policy Act and  the assessment on utilities.

Table 1 shows the focus and status of the  Academy\u2019s recommendations.", "As table 1 shows, DOE took actions that address 6, or almost half, of the  Academy\u2019s 13 recommendations. For example, the Academy recommended  that DOE convert depleted uranium hexafluoride\u2014a byproduct of the  uranium enrichment process\u2014to a more stable chemical form for storage  or disposal. DOE recently awarded a contract to construct and operate  conversion facilities at both Paducah and Portsmouth. In March 2004, DOE  began shipping the cylinders of depleted uranium hexafluoride stored at  Oak Ridge to Portsmouth for conversion.", "For another 6 recommendations, DOE took actions that partially  implemented the recommendations\u2014either initially taking actions that  implemented the recommendation and then later modifying its approach,  or taking actions that addressed only a portion of the recommendation or  only one of the three plants. For example, the Academy recommended that  DOE develop three plans\u2014namely, headquarters level, plant-complex level,  and site level\u2014that address and integrate the D&D of the facilities,  environmental remediation activities, and the management of depleted  uranium hexafluoride. DOE has not developed a headquarters-level or  plant complex-level D&D plan that addresses and integrates D&D of all  three plants with other DOE activities. Oak Ridge is the only plant with an  agreed-upon D&D plan that incorporates D&D, other cleanup activities,  and the management of depleted uranium hexafluoride. The Paducah plant  currently has a plan that lays out DOE\u2019s approach for a portion of its  cleanup, but the plan does not address final D&D. DOE does not have a  D&D plan for the Portsmouth plant.

However, in most cases they were not able to quantify the cost savings  achieved because the actions taken were either improvements to processes  or procedures already in place or because they have not quantitatively  evaluated the savings. For example, the Academy recommended that DOE  consider the technical and management approaches successfully used for  the D&D of the Capenhurst uranium enrichment plant in the United  Kingdom. According to DOE officials, they considered the technical and  management approaches used at both the Capenhurst plant and other U.S.  D&D projects before beginning D&D efforts at Oak Ridge and have, in  several cases, contracted with experienced environmental management  contractors (who have participated in decommissioning activities at these  sites) to take advantage of their expertise and knowledge. However, DOE  has not quantitatively evaluated the financial savings from these efforts.", "In one instance, DOE has not taken action to implement the Academy\u2019s  recommendation because the recommendation made by the Academy is no  longer applicable. The Academy recommended that DOE establish a  modest research program to develop methods to decontaminate diffusion  barrier material effectively. According to DOE officials, such research is  no longer needed because the material is placed into an on-site disposal  facility, eliminating the need for decontamination. DOE has constructed an  on-site disposal facility at Oak Ridge, and similar facilities are being  considered for both Paducah and Portsmouth.

Adopted after a 2002 review of DOE\u2019s environmental  management program found that only about one-third of the program\u2019s  budget went to actual cleanup work, this accelerated cleanup strategy is  intended to reduce the time needed to complete the cleanup of sites.   DOE says that by implementing cleanup actions more quickly, it can reduce  the amount it spends on maintenance, fixed costs, and other activities  required to support safety and security. At the Oak Ridge plant, DOE plans  to accelerate the plant\u2019s cleanup and closure time frame from 2016 to 2008.  DOE estimates that this acceleration in cleanup and closure could achieve  cost savings of $465 million. DOE has also proposed an accelerated  cleanup plan for the Paducah plant. This plan, submitted to state and  federal regulatory authorities for approval in November 2003 and approved  in April 2004, establishes (1) a series of prioritized response actions, (2)  ongoing site characterizations to support future response action decisions,  and (3) decontamination and decommissioning of the currently operating  gaseous diffusion plant once it ceases operations. DOE\u2019s plan reduces the  time frame for completing the prioritized response actions from 2030 to  2019 and could, according to DOE estimates, save about $288 million. DOE  is continuing negotiations with state and federal regulatory authorities in  hopes of further reducing the time frame for completion of the prioritized  response actions. However, as we reported in April 2004, the total scope of  the cleanup at Paducah is unclear.  Furthermore, DOE has not yet  determined when D&D of the plant facilities currently in use will begin.", "DOE is also revisiting each plant\u2019s envisioned end state to determine if  cleanup at each plant is based on a technical risk assessment appropriate  for the sites\u2019 future land use. The 2002 environmental management review  found that the current cleanup approach and, in some cases,  interpretations of DOE\u2019s policy orders and requirements, as well as laws,  regulations, and cleanup agreements, were too conservative and created  obstacles to achieving the timely cleanup of the plants. As a result, DOE  required each of its environmental management sites, including the three  plants, to develop a risk-based \u201cvision\u201d to identify acceptable risk levels  consistent with the site\u2019s future land use, including an analysis that  identified the differences between the current end state and one that is  based on a risk assessment. Each of the uranium enrichment plants has  developed a draft risk-based end state vision that is currently under review  by DOE headquarters, state and federal regulatory officials, and local  stakeholders. Once these visions are approved, the plants will re-evaluate  their strategic approaches and cleanup activities to determine if  renegotiating cleanup agreements is appropriate. According to DOE  officials, if it is determined that changes are necessary, any changes would  be made in accordance with all applicable requirements and procedures,  including public involvement and regulatory approval. However, state and  federal regulators with whom we spoke are concerned that if the plants are  required to renegotiate cleanup agreements as a result of proposed  changes, the cleanup process could be delayed, in turn resulting in  increased costs. For instance, federal and state regulatory officials at Oak  Ridge are concerned that, given the amount of work remaining and the  short time frame for the plant\u2019s closure, DOE might be unable to meet its  projected 2008 closure date if respective parties have to renegotiate already  agreed-upon cleanup standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Based on Current Projected Costs and Revenues, the Fund Will Not Be Sufficient to Complete Cleanup at the Three Plants", "paragraphs": ["Despite DOE efforts to reduce costs, we found that based on current  projected costs and revenues, the Fund will be insufficient to cover  authorized activities.

Importantly, we found that the Fund would be insufficient irrespective of  which estimates we used, including models that estimated the final cleanup  work at the plants under (1) accelerated time frames, (2) deferred time  frames, or (3) baseline time frames, and with additional contributions to  the Fund equaling the difference between the amounts that have been  appropriated to date and the total amount authorized under the Energy  Policy Act. Given the numerous uncertainties surrounding the cleanup  work at the nation\u2019s three uranium enrichment plants, it is not possible to  more precisely determine the total resources needed to cover the Fund\u2019s  authorized activities until DOE has better information about such factors  as the dates for beginning and completing the decommissioning work at the  Paducah and Portsmouth plants.", "Our Baseline model demonstrated that by the time all cleanup at the plants  is completed, costs will have exceeded revenues by $3.5 billion to $5.7  billion (in 2004 dollars). The Baseline model was developed using cost  estimates that assumed cleanup, including the decontamination and  decommissioning of all facilities (final D&D), would occur by 2044. This  time frame was developed in consultation with DOE officials about what  the most likely cleanup time frames would be. It is important to note,  however, that DOE has not yet made a decision about when the final D&D  will occur at the Paducah and Portsmouth plants.", "Because DOE has not determined when final D&D will begin at the  Paducah and Portsmouth plants, we also developed two alternative  models\u2014Accelerated and Deferred\u2014to assess whether the timing of the  final D&D work at these plants would have a significant impact on the total  costs. Total cleanup time was reduced by 20 years in the Accelerated model  and increased by 8 years in the Deferred model. The timing of D&D can  affect total cleanup costs because, among other things, each plant must pay  significant annual security and maintenance costs that will be incurred as  long as DOE maintains facilities on the sites. For example, at the Paducah  plant, the safeguarding and security costs after the plant is shut down are  projected to be more than $26 million annually (in 2004 dollars).", "We found that irrespective of what model we used\u2014Accelerated or  Deferred\u2014the Fund will be insufficient to cover the projected cleanup  costs at the uranium enrichment plants. In present value, the Fund  deficiency would range from a high of $3.8 billion in the Accelerated model  to a low of $0.63 billion in the Deferred model. Thus, while accelerating or  deferring the cleanup at the Paducah and Portsmouth plants could affect  overall costs, the Fund would still be insufficient to cover the total cleanup  costs irrespective of the time frames of final D&D at the Paducah and  Portsmouth plants.", "Because federal contributions to the Fund have been less than the  authorized amount, we also developed two models to assess the affect of  additional contributions from government appropriations. First, we  developed a model\u2014Revenue Added\u2014that continued government  contributions to the Fund until they equaled the total amount authorized  under the Energy Policy Act. Building on this model, we developed an  additional Revenue Added Plus Interest model that calculated and added to  the Fund the interest that would have been earned if all authorized  government contributions had been made. We found that under both  models, despite additional revenues, the Fund would still be insufficient to  cover all cleanup costs. In present value, the Fund deficiency would range  from a high of $2.6 billion in the Revenue Added model to a low of $0.09  billion in the Revenue Added Plus Interest model. Even if the full amount of  funds authorized by law were appropriated, and interest accrued on this  additional amount, cleanup costs would still exceed revenues.", "While our analysis was able to capture several uncertainties surrounding  the Fund\u2014including interest rates, inflation rates, cost and revenue  variances, and the timing of final D&D\u2014there are additional uncertainties  we were unable to capture, including uncertainties due to possible changes  in the scope of the cleanup; whether the Fund will be required to pay for  additional activities, such as long-term groundwater monitoring once the  plants are closed; as well as potential litigation costs the Fund would have  to support. Significant changes in the scope of the cleanup work could  impact the costs of cleanup activities at the plants. For example, a recent  risk analysis exercise completed by DOE for the Paducah plant indicated  that such changes could increase cleanup costs by more than $3 billion and  extend the time frame for cleanup to more than 30 years past the original  scheduled end date of 2019. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding waste  disposal at the Paducah and Portsmouth plants could significantly impact  cleanup costs. Current DOE cost estimates assume that on-site disposal  facilities will be built, which would minimize waste transportation costs.", "These facilities have yet to be constructed at the plants or agreed upon by  regulatory authorities. However, if DOE is not able to build these on-site  facilities, waste disposal costs could increase substantially. For example, at  the Portsmouth plant, contractor officials estimated that if they have to  ship all of the waste off site, disposal would cost at least $515 million (in  2002 dollars) more than the projected cost of disposing of the waste in an  on-site facility.", "Further, there may be additional activities the Fund is required to support  that are not currently included in DOE\u2019s cost projections. For example,  after each site has completed all of the necessary cleanup work, there will  be long-term stewardship costs at the plants, such as continual  groundwater monitoring. Currently, DOE officials assume these long-term  stewardship costs will be covered by a separate funding source. Similarly,  the costs to store and dispose of each plant\u2019s depleted uranium  hexafluoride are currently covered by a separate appropriation. However,  DOE officials acknowledge that if another funding source is not available  for these costs, they may be required to use resources from the Fund.", "Finally, litigation costs supported by the Fund are another source of  uncertainty. Future litigation costs could vary depending on the extent to  which lawsuits are pursued and whether the actions are decided in favor of  the federal government. Various legal claims related to domestic utility  company assessments have been made against the Fund. All of the actions  decided to date have been in favor of the federal government.

We also estimated the  interest that could be earned by unused balances of the Fund each year,  and included these earnings in the annual Fund balance. Our analysis  began with the Fund balance at the end of fiscal year 2003 and continued  until all cleanup work at the three uranium enrichment plants was  projected to be completed.

Using the Crystal Ball program in concert with the Excel  model, we were able to expand our capability to explore a wide range of  possible values, instead of one single value, for such variables as interest  rates, inflation rates, and cleanup costs. The Crystal Ball program uses a  process called Monte Carlo simulation. That is, it repeatedly and randomly  selects values for interest rates, inflation rates, and costs from distribution  ranges that we prespecified for these variables. Using these values for the  appropriate cells in the spreadsheet model, Crystal Ball then makes the  calculations and forecasts the results. Repeating the same process, Crystal  Ball can calculate the results based on hundreds or thousands of such  trials. Our simulation results were based on 1,500 different trials.

For Fund  revenues, we generally assumed the Fund would receive contributions as  authorized by current legislation. DOE also provided us with the time  frames for completing the cleanup work at each of the plants and, when  possible, contingency estimates for the costs. Since DOE\u2019s cost data were  provided in different dollar values, we converted all cost data to 2004  dollars using either the inflation rates used by DOE or the Consumer Price  Index. More specific sources of data and assumptions to the modeling  work were as follows: Revenues to the Fund. To construct the Baseline model, we assumed  contributions to the Fund would come from three sources: federal  government appropriations, payments from domestic utility companies,  and interest earned on investments of Fund balances. We assumed that  government contributions would continue from fiscal years 2004 through  2007, as authorized by the Energy Policy Act. However, for the federal  government contributions in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, we used actual  appropriations and the President\u2019s budget request, respectively; for the  remaining years, we assumed contributions would be at the level  authorized in the current legislation. For payments from domestic utility  companies, we assumed the assessment would remain unchanged at the  fiscal year 2004 level, and assumed payments would continue through  fiscal year 2007, as authorized by the Energy Policy Act. Additionally, as  required by law, the Fund can accrue interest income from investing the  unused balance of the fund in government securities. Therefore, we  estimated the investment earnings of the Fund annually and included it in  the available Fund balances. To calculate investment earnings, we used a  range of different interest rates based on the Fund\u2019s previous earnings. We  assumed that the real interest rate earned on the Fund investment has a  triangular distribution, with minimum and maximum values based on  historical performance of the Fund\u2019s investments since 1994. Similarly, we  used the performance of the Consumer Price Index since 1994 to develop a  triangular distribution for price indices to adjust the data where necessary.", "Costs of the Fund. DOE, in conjunction with its contractor officials  responsible for conducting the cleanup work at the three uranium  enrichment plants, provided cost estimates for all anticipated activities that  will be paid for from the Fund starting in fiscal year 2004, and that will  carry forward until all cleanup activities have been completed at each of  the three plants. Cost estimates included (1) reimbursements to uranium  and thorium licensees and (2) costs to complete the cleanup at the three  uranium enrichment plants.  1. Reimbursements to uranium and thorium licensees. The Energy  Policy Act authorized reimbursements to uranium licensees not to  exceed $350 million and reimbursements to the thorium licensee not to  exceed $365 million for the portion of their cleanup costs associated  with the sale of these materials to the federal government. The  remaining unused authorized amounts are adjusted annually based  upon the Consumer Price Index. We assumed that the annual  reimbursement amount will be fixed at the fiscal year 2004 level and  will carry forward until the total amount authorized by law has been  allocated. Based on the current balance of the Fund, anticipated  revenues, and the total available reimbursement amount remaining, we  determined that the Fund would be sufficient to cover the  reimbursements to the uranium and thorium licensees.   2. Cleanup costs at the three uranium enrichment plants. Cleanup costs  for decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) work were kept  separate from all other cleanup cost activities, which include remedial  actions, waste management, surveillance and maintenance, and other  (including all other activities the Fund supports such as litigation fees  and funds to support site-specific advisory boards). Cleanup costs were  broken out annually and by each plant. Due to the different  uncertainties surrounding these costs, D&D costs were then further  segregated for process buildings (the large buildings where uranium is  enriched) and all other remaining D&D costs. The Baseline model costs  for the cleanup activities at the three plants were developed under the  assumption that the final D&D (all D&D and other required cleanup  actions at the plants once the facilities cease operations) would occur  between 2004 and 2008 at the Oak Ridge plant; between 2018 and 2032  at the Paducah plant; and between 2010 and 2044 at the Portsmouth  plant. These are the most likely time frames for completing the final  D&D work, based on discussions with DOE and contractor officials.", "Cost Uncertainties. To capture uncertainties inherent in the data, we used  the Crystal Ball program in concert with the Baseline model we developed.  With the Crystal Ball program, we could assign a range of values, rather  than a single value, to each cell of the spreadsheet model. We developed the  range of values for each cost category based on extensive discussions with  DOE and its contractor staff who provided the cost estimates. After  considering their recommendations and input, we assumed that all cleanup  costs at the three uranium enrichment plants, with the exception of D&D of  the process buildings at the Paducah and Portsmouth plants, could  increase by a uniform probability of up to 20 percent. Given the  considerable uncertainty associated with costs for D&D of the process  buildings and the experience to date at the Oak Ridge plant, we assumed,  based on the values provided by DOE, the costs for this work at Paducah  and Portsmouth could increase by a uniform probability of up to 85  percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Models", "paragraphs": ["Because not all uncertainties could be incorporated into one model, we  developed several alternative models to our Baseline model.

The completion of all D&D activities in the Accelerated  model was reduced by 20 years from 2044 to 2024, and increased by 8 years  in the Deferred model to 2052.", "The Accelerated cost series was developed under the assumption that final  D&D could be completed faster than under the Baseline model, given  unconstrained funding.

Thus, Deferred time frames were  determined by DOE, assuming that all work would be completed at the  Portsmouth plant first and then initiated at the Paducah plant.

For  the Revenue Added model, we assumed that government contributions to  the Fund would continue annually at the authorized level until the total  government contributions as authorized by law had been met, which would  occur in fiscal year 2009. For the Revenue Added Plus Interest model, we  built on the Revenue Added model to include the effect of forgone interest  that the Fund could have earned if the government had contributed the full  authorized amount. In other words, we continued government payments  into the Fund until the total amount authorized (regardless of amounts  actually appropriated), as well as interest on the unpaid portion of the  authorized amount, is paid to the Fund.

In the figures, each bar  shows the value by which costs could exceed revenues in billions of 2004  dollars. The height of each bar is the probability that the costs would  exceed the revenues by that exact amount. Even though the probability of  one specific amount is low, there is a 100 percent probability that the actual  amount will fall somewhere within the range (e.g. for the Baseline model,  minus $3.5 billion to minus $5.7 billion).
