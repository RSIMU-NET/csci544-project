GAO's recent report on a sample of drugs purchased from Internet pharmacies echoed these concerns. CBP and FDA officials at mail and private carrier facilities inspect and interdict some packages that contain prescription drugs. However, according to officials, because of resource constraints, many other packages containing prescriptions drugs are either not inspected and are released to addressees or are released after an inspection. CBP and FDA target certain packages for inspection based on the packages' countries of origin and whether the packages are suspected of containing certain prescription drugs. However, packages that are not targeted typically bypass inspection and are released to addressees without an assessment of their contents or admissibility. FDA officials have acknowledged that tens of thousands of packages, containing drug products that may violate current laws and pose health risks to consumers, have been released. They said that time-consuming processing requirements and resource constraints limit their ability to perform more inspections. Agency efforts to deal with imported prescription drugs are evolving. Two interagency task forces were established to study prescription drug importation and address related law enforcement issues, respectively. Also, to overcome differences in the way officials target and interdict shipments of unapproved prescription drugs at various mail and private carrier facilities, FDA has begun implementing new procedures to promote more uniformity across facilities.

Much of our  work to date has focused on the efforts of the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Department  of Health and Human Service\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to  inspect and interdict prescription drugs that are being imported via the  U.S. mail or private carrier, such as FedEx or DHL, for personal use. In  this statement, I make the following points:    CBP and FDA officials said that the amount of unapproved prescription  drugs illegally entering the country is large and increasing. The overall  healthfulness and safety of these imported drugs is not assured, and  limited testing showed that some of these drugs pose risks to  consumers.", "CBP and FDA interdict some packages that contain prescription drugs,  but many other packages containing these drugs are released to  addressees\u2014either not inspected and released or released after  inspection.

CBP inspectors can target certain packages for inspection or randomly  select packages for inspection. CBP inspects for, among other things,  illegally imported controlled substances, contraband, and items\u2014like  personal shipments of prescription drugs\u2014that may be inadmissible. CBP  inspections can include examining the outer envelope of the package,  using x-ray detectors, or opening the package to physically inspect the  contents. Each year the IMBs and carrier facilities process hundreds of  millions of pieces of mail and packages. Among these items are  prescription drugs ordered by consumers over the Internet, the  importation of which is prohibited under current law, with few exceptions.", "Two acts\u2014the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Controlled  Substances Import and Export Act\u2014specifically regulate the importation  of prescription drugs into the United States. Under the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, FDA is responsible for ensuring the  safety, effectiveness, and quality of domestic and imported drugs and may  refuse to admit into the United States, any drug that appears to be  adulterated, misbranded, or unapproved for the U.S. market as defined in  the act. Under the act and implementing regulations, this includes foreign  versions of FDA-approved drugs because, for example, neither the foreign  manufacturing facility nor the manufacturing methods and controls were  reviewed by FDA for compliance with U.S. statutory and regulatory  standards. The act also prohibits reimportation of a prescription drug  manufactured in the United States by anyone other than the original  manufacturer of that drug. According to FDA, prescription drugs imported  by individual consumers typically fall into one of these prohibited  categories. However, FDA has established a policy that allows local FDA  officials to use their discretion to permit personal importation of  prescription drugs that do not contain controlled substances under  specified circumstances, such as importing for treatment of a serious  condition a small quantity, generally not more than a 90-day supply, of a  drug not available domestically. The importation of unapproved foreign  versions of prescription drugs like Viagra (an erectile dysfunction drug) or  Propecia (a hair loss drug), for example, would not qualify under the  personal importation policy because approved versions are readily  available in the United States.", "In addition, the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, among  other things, generally prohibits personal importation of those  prescription drugs that are also controlled substances, such as Valium or  codeine. (See app. II for general description of controlled substances.)  Under the act, the importation of controlled substances is prohibited  unless the importer is registered with DEA, and such registration is  generally not available for importation for personal use. The act and  implementing regulations permit an individual traveler under certain  circumstances to carry a personal use quantity of a controlled substance  (except a substance in Schedule I) across the U.S. border, but they do not  make a similar exception for importation by mail or private carrier.", "CBP inspects packages for prescription drugs on behalf of DEA and FDA.  Upon inspection, CBP is to seize illegally imported controlled substances  on behalf of DEA. CBP may take steps to destroy the seized and forfeited  substance or turn the seized substance over to other federal law  enforcement agencies for further investigation. CBP is to turn over  packages suspected of containing prescription drugs that are not  controlled substances to FDA. FDA investigators may inspect such  packages and hold those that appear to be adulterated, misbranded, or  unapproved, but must notify the addressee and allow that individual the  opportunity to present evidence as to why the drug should be admitted  into the United States. If the addressee does not provide evidence that  overcomes the appearance of inadmissibility, then the item is refused  admission.", "Figure 1 illustrates the two acts that specifically govern the importation of  prescription drugs into the United States.

Generally, these were one-time, targeted efforts to identify  and tally all of the packages containing prescription drugs at certain time  periods. The limited data collected have shown wide variations in volume.  For example, CBP officials at one IMB estimated that approximately 3,300  packages containing prescription drugs entered the facility in one week. In  2004, CBP officials at another IMB determined that 4,300 packages  containing prescription drugs entered the facility in one day.

Additionally, FDA  officials indicated that consumers who purchase prescription drugs from  foreign-based Internet pharmacies are at risk of not fully knowing the  safety or quality of what they are importing. FDA officials also have stated  that while some consumers may purchase genuine products, others may  unknowingly purchase counterfeit products, expired drugs, or drugs that  were improperly manufactured.", "CBP and FDA have conducted special operations to do limited  assessments of the nature of some imported prescription drugs, and these  operations have raised questions about the safety of some of the drugs  analyzed. For example, during an operation undertaken in 2003 at four  IMBs, CBP and FDA inspected 1,153 packages that contained prescription  drugs. According to a CBP report, 1,019, or 88 percent, of the drug  products were violative because they were prohibited for import,  including Lipitor (a cholesterol-lowering drug), Viagra, and Propecia. A  CBP laboratory analyzed 180 drug samples. This analysis showed that the  majority of the drugs were never approved by FDA. Furthermore, the  operation showed that many of the unapproved drugs could pose safety  risks. The samples included drugs that were withdrawn from the U.S.  market for safety reasons; animal drugs not approved for human use; and  drugs that carry risks because they require careful dosing, initial  screening, or periodic patient monitoring. In addition, other drugs tested  were found to contain controlled substances prohibited for import, and  some of the drugs contained no active ingredients.

Our  work showed that most of these drug samples, all of which we received via  consignment carrier shipment or the U.S. mail, were unapproved for the  U.S. market because, for example, the labeling or the foreign  manufacturing facility, methods, and controls were not reviewed by FDA.  Of the 21 samples:    None included dispensing pharmacy labels that provided instructions  for use, and only about one-third included warning information.", "Thirteen displayed problems associated with the handling of the drug;  three samples that should have been shipped in a temperature- controlled environment arrived in envelopes without insulation; and  five samples contained tablets enclosed in punctured blister packs,  potentially exposing them to damaging light or moisture.", "Two were found to be counterfeit versions of the products we ordered,  and two had a significantly different chemical composition than that of  the product we had ordered.", "We found fewer problems among 47 samples purchased from U.S. and  Canadian Internet pharmacies. Although most of the drugs obtained from  Canada were of the same chemical composition as that of their U.S.  counterparts, most were unapproved for the U.S. market.

For example, at one IMB we visited, FDA provided CBP with a list  of targeted countries\u2014the composition of which changed periodically. A  recent list targeted seven countries and specific areas in one other  country. FDA officials asked that CBP hold the packages they suspected of  containing prescription drugs that were from the targeted countries.  Typically, CBP officials told us that when packages containing  prescription drugs were detected, but were not from one of the targeted  countries, they were released to the addressee without an assessment of  their admissibility. Accordingly, CBP officials stated that packages  containing prescription drugs unapproved for import were released daily  without FDA review.", "According to CBP and FDA officials at the carrier facilities we visited,  packages containing prescription drugs sent through these facilities may  also be released without inspection. Unlike packages at IMBs, packages  arriving at carrier facilities we visited were preceded by advance manifest  information, which included the shipper\u2019s declaration describing the  contents and its value. CBP and FDA officials review the manifest  information to target packages for inspection before their arrival. Agency  officials at two carrier facilities we visited told us that FDA officials were  not typically on-site and electronically reviewed the manifests and  targeted incoming packages declared as prescription drugs. FDA officials  noted that packages containing prescription drugs could potentially avoid  their review if the manifest information was not accurate. CBP and FDA  officials told us there were no assurances that the shipper\u2019s declarations  were accurate.

However, the FDA officials estimated that in one week, they could  open and fully inspect about 140 packages. In making the decision  regarding what to inspect, two FDA investigators considered whether the  packages contained prescription drugs considered to be an enforcement  priority, including injectable drugs and certain controlled substances, such  as steroids. The FDA officials told us that they typically released packages  that did not contain a priority drug, even though the packages were  believed to contain other prescription drugs that were not approved for  import.

For  example, after viewing an x-ray image of a package, CBP performed a  visual inspection of the outer container of a medication, labeled as a  treatment for ulcers, determined that it appeared to contain 90 pills, and  released it. At this same facility, FDA officials told us that every week CBP  turned over to FDA hundreds of packages. CBP told us that these  packages contained quantities of prescription drugs that appeared to be  more than a 90-day supply. However, the FDA officials stated that they  were able to process a total of approximately 20 packages per day. As a  result, the FDA officials told us they returned many of the packages to  CBP, citing an inability to process every package. The CBP officials said  that most of the returned packages were released to the addressees.

FDA  processing requirements include identifying the drugs, measuring the  volume, entering this information into a FDA database, taking pictures of  the drugs, preparing the drugs for temporary storage, and sending  notification to the addressees to provide evidence regarding the  admissibility of the drug. Processing time varies depending on the quantity  and variety of drugs in the package.", "In addition, processing time increases if research is required to determine  the drug type. For example, FDA officials at one IMB stated that some  prescription drugs are not immediately identifiable, particularly when  shipped without labels or with labels in a foreign language. Figure 4  illustrates an example of drugs that was sent without labeling.", "FDA officials at the IMBs we visited stated that considering these many  factors, processing a single package can take anywhere from a few  minutes to several hours. FDA officials who are responsible for reviewing  manifest information for drugs shipped through the private carriers stated  that it can take several days to process a package, particularly if they need  to obtain additional information regarding the shipment.", "FDA headquarters officials said that packages that contain prescription  drugs that appear to be unapproved for import cannot be automatically  refused and returned because of the statutory requirement that FDA hold  the package and give the addressee the opportunity to provide evidence of  admissibility. Officials said that this requirement applies to all drug  imports with few exceptions. According to FDA investigators, in most  instances, the addressees did not present evidence to support the drugs\u2019  admissibility, and the drugs were ultimately provided to CBP or the U.S.  Postal Service for return to sender.", "CBP officials at two IMBs told us that they could not turn over all  packages they suspected of containing prescription drugs because FDA  officials were not able to process all of the packages. FDA officials at one  IMB stated that the processing time affected the number of packages they  could inspect and was the reason many of the packages that were held up  by CBP were ultimately released to the addressee without inspection. A  FDA headquarters official stated that considerable storage space is needed  to hold the detained packages, while the notice, opportunity to respond,  and the agency\u2019s decision are pending. For example, one FDA IMB official  told us that space limitations have affected the number of packages they  are able to store, including those packages held on-site awaiting a  response from the addressee.

CBP officials  at one IMB told us that in recent months they have observed substantial  increases in the volume of prescription drugs containing controlled  substances being sent through the international mail because, in their  view, of the increased incidence of consumers ordering drugs over the  Internet. Although CBP officials had been seizing substantially more of  these drugs in recent months, they had also accumulated a sizable backlog  of controlled substances awaiting seizure because, according to officials,  they did not have the resources to begin the seizure process. By June 2004,  CBP at this IMB had accumulated 123 bins of mail, containing over 40,700  packages of Schedule IV controlled substances\u2014including the tranquilizer  Valium, antidepressants, and painkillers.

In June, a CPB official said that CBP IMB  officials asked CBP headquarters for permission to send the products back  to the senders as an alternative to seizure, and to keep these drugs from  entering U.S. commerce. According to this official, CBP\u2019s headquarters  office granted them permission to send most of the drugs back to the  sender because the backlog would have taken months to resolve. One  CBP official said that the ability to return the controlled substances  enabled CBP to clear the backlog in two to three weeks rather than the  one to two years they projected it would have taken had CBP been  required to begin seizure proceedings for each item. Officials at the facility  said that they are now seizing controlled substances as they arrive at the  facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Efforts to Address the Importation of Prescription Drugs Are Evolving", "paragraphs": ["Our preliminary work revealed a number of efforts, including interagency  initiatives that are being undertaken in response to concerns raised about  the importation of prescription drugs.

The conference report (House Report 108-391) enumerated questions  to be addressed in this study including, among other things:    assessing the scope, volume, and safety of unapproved drugs, including  controlled substances, entering the United States via mail shipment;  and    estimating agency resources, including additional field personnel,  needed to adequately inspect the current amount of pharmaceuticals  entering the country.", "In February 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Services appointed a  task force, chaired by the Surgeon General, on drug importation. It  included members representing the department, CBP, DEA, Department of  Justice trial attorneys, and the Office of Management and Budget. Between  March and May, the task force held public hearings to gather information  to address the questions posed by Congress.

The task force, which includes  managers and senior managers from CBP, FDA, DEA, the Office of  National Drug Control Policy, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, as well as legal counsel from the Department of Justice and  other agencies, meets every two months. According to the CBP official, the  task force has established five interagency working groups designed to  tackle specific issues identified by the task force. The working groups,  which meet more frequently, are focused on improving information  sharing and law enforcement targeting criteria, increasing public  awareness of potential dangers of imported pharmaceuticals, reviewing  and enhancing mail and express mail consignment procedures, working  cooperatively with industry, and legal issues. The groups report the results  of their enforcement efforts to the task force, which makes suggestions for  future efforts.", "Our preliminary discussions with CBP about the activities of the working  groups revealed initiatives currently under way by two of the groups. In  one instance, the working group on mail and express mail consignment  procedures has been involved in recent interagency enforcement  operations at selected international mail facilities. During these  operations, the interagency group targeted and found mail containing  nonscheduled prescription drugs as well as controlled substances.  According to the CBP official, these operations resulted in investigations  of commercial shipments of the prescription drugs by agents from the task  force and working group and helped the law enforcement agencies  identify Internet addresses for purposes of future investigations. The CBP  official told us that, in another instance, the working group focused on  increasing public awareness of the potential dangers of imported  pharmaceuticals had developed public service announcements that are to  be posted on the Internet. Appendix III shows one of these  announcements that was recently posted on the CBP web site.", "Individual agencies are also taking steps to enhance their ability to deal  with inspection and interdiction issues associated with imported  prescription drugs. As discussed earlier, during our visits to the three  IMBs, we noted that CBP and FDA officials at those facilities had adopted  different approaches for targeting and interdicting prescription drugs. FDA  headquarters officials also recognized this and in response indicated that a  more uniform approach was needed. According to these officials, FDA has  drafted a set of standard operating procedures that will apply to the  handling of imported prescription drugs consistently across the 13  International Mail Branches. FDA officials said that these procedures have  been developed to apply to the handling of prescription drugs nationwide,  but will also give officials at individual facilities some flexibility to adopt  procedures that address uniquely local conditions. FDA headquarters  officials told us they have begun implementing the procedures at selected  IMBs and plan to implement them at more locations. FDA officials also  said that they were developing a similar set of standard operating  procedures that would apply to the inspection and interdiction of  imported prescription drugs at the consignment carrier facilities. CBP  officials told us that CBP expects that these guidelines will also discuss  CBP responsibilities for handling imported prescription drugs.", "In closing, Mr. Chairman, it has been discussed in the media and elsewhere  that American consumers are purchasing prescription drugs for  importation in increasing numbers. Our preliminary observations indicate  that CBP and FDA face considerable challenges inspecting and  interdicting these drugs to help ensure compliance with current law.  Currently data are unavailable to estimate the volume of prescription  drugs entering the country, and the overall health and safety risks of these  drugs are unknown. CBP and FDA are inspecting and interdicting some of  the unapproved prescription drugs that are entering the country, but  others bypass inspection and are sent to consumers who purchased them,  often because, according to CBP and FDA officials, time-consuming  processing requirements and staffing constraints limit their ability to  perform more inspections. Although agencies like CBP, FDA, and DEA  have begun initiatives to deal with various aspects of the drug importation  issue, it is too early to tell whether these efforts will adequately address  every dimension of the law enforcement and safety issues associated with  the importation of prescription drugs.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
