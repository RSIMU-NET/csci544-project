Specifically, 4 of the 15 Air Force contracts and 13 of the 15 Army contracts GAO reviewed were incorrectly recorded in FPDS-NG as personal services contracts. Defense officials agreed with this assessment. Further, the fiscal year 2014 inventories of contracted services at Air Force, Army, and Navy contained personal services contracts not captured in FPDS-NG, as shown in the figure below. Apart from the inaccuracies of the reported data, GAO observed and agency officials agreed that additional undercounting could exist since some contracts for nonpersonal services could become personal services contracts, depending on whether the contract involves direct supervision by government employees. In the absence of accurate data, proper management of personal services and other contracts becomes more difficult.", "Military departments and USAID use personal services contracts differently.

As permitted under its regulations, USAID uses personal services contracts for a broader range of functions such as program management, security analysis, and logistics, some of which are considered tasks that only government employees should perform\u2014inherently governmental activities. Federal regulations that prohibit contractors from performing such activities do not apply to authorized personal services contracts. DOD's practice is not to use personal services contracts for inherently governmental tasks.

For example, many of the  contracts involved the contractor performing critical tasks, with  performance occurring in a government workspace. While the statement  of work required the contractor (not the government) to provide  supervision, given the critical nature of the tasks performed and co- location of contractors and government personnel, there is an opportunity  for government officials to exercise continuous supervision and control  over the contractor so that the contract would become a personal  services contract. Contracting officials for these contracts emphasized  that these contracts were not personal services contracts since they did  not entail the relatively constant supervision of the contractor staff by  government officials.

We selected contracts, excluding  modifications, identified as personal services contracts based on the  product service code of R 497\u2014a product service code reserved for  personal services contracts\u2014for contracts awarded in fiscal years 2011  through 2015. Fiscal year 2015 was the latest year with certified FPDS- NG data at the time we started our review. We identified 11 agencies or  departments that reported obligations for personal services contracts. We  analyzed the data and identified the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as the  two agencies that reported the highest obligations for personal services  contracts in fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Although we identified  inaccuracies in some of the data in FPDS-NG, as discussed in this report,  we discussed the data and its limitations with agency officials and  determined that the data from FPDS-NG were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of selecting the agencies with the highest obligations on  personal services contracts and obtaining a sample of contracts.", "We also identified the four agencies\u2014the Air Force, Army, and Navy  within the Department of Defense (DOD), and the United States Agency  for International Development (USAID)\u2014with the highest obligations for  personal services contracts using FPDS-NG data. These agencies  account for nearly 60 percent of the spending on such contracts in fiscal  year 2014. We reviewed a nongeneralizable random sample of 60  contracts coded as personal services contracts in FPDS-NG, 15 contracts  from each agency (Air Force, Army, Navy, and USAID). The 60 contract  random nongeneralizable sample was drawn from all contracts in fiscal  year 2014 that reported obligations for personal services contracts equal  to or greater than $10,000. We reviewed the files to determine the  specific statutory authority cited for awarding the personal services  contract, the tasks performed by the contractor, supervision provided, and  the duration of the contract including options. We also obtained policy  documents and supplemental regulations from the agencies detailing  agency responsibilities with respect to personal services contracts and  interviewed agency officials. We compared the data reported in FPDS- NG, such as the contract number and award value, to information in the  selected contract files and determined that the FPDS-NG data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of selecting our sample.", "We determined that a number of contracts identified by the Army and the  Air Force as personal services contracts were miscoded as personal  services contracts based on documentation in the contract file and  discussions with agency officials. To obtain additional information on the  extent to which agencies use personal services contracts, we also  examined the data on personal services contracts from the publically  available inventories of contracted services for the Air Force, Army, Navy  and USAID for fiscal year 2014. Fiscal year 2014 was the latest year with  certified inventory data, at the time of our review. These inventories are  congressionally required compilations of services contracts intended to  provide insight into the kinds of services purchased and the number of  contractor personnel involved. We discussed the preparation of the  inventories with agency officials and reviewed our prior reports on  inventories. However, examination of the inventory of contracted services  data for the Air Force, Army and Navy did not resolve discrepancies we  found between DOD\u2019s FPDS-NG data and the inventory of contracted  services data.", "Based on our review of the FPDS-NG data, reviews of the selected  service contract inventory data, selected contract files, and interviews  with DOD and USAID officials, we determined that the FPDS-NG data are  not sufficiently reliable for comparing obligations from year to year for  personal services contracts or for determining the extent to which DOD  awarded personal services contracts. We present data on obligations for  illustrative purposes only.", "To determine how DOD and USAID use personal services contracts, we  reviewed contract files to determine the authority cited for awarding the  contracts and analyzed the statements of work, which define the kinds of  services required under the contracts. To further explore the differences  in how these agencies use personal services contracts and other types of  service contracts, we also reviewed a different nongeneralizable random  sample of 40 contracts that were coded as engineering and technical  services, or other professional services contracts awarded by the Air  Force, Army, Navy, and USAID in fiscal year 2014 (10 contracts from  each agency). We selected these categories of services because they are  similar to the types of services performed by personal services  contractors and constituted a majority of the services contracts awarded  by DOD and USAID. We did not review contractor performance or  contract administration for this report. We compared the data reported in  FPDS-NG, such as the contract number and award value, to information  in the selected contract files and determined that the FPDS-NG data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of selecting our sample. The sample  of contracts both personal and nonpersonal included in our review is not  generalizable to a larger universe, but is designed to provide illustrative  examples of characteristics and use of personal service contracts at the  selected agencies and components, and for comparison of characteristics  of personal and nonpersonal services contract awards.", "We reviewed the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), obtained  supplemental regulations and policy documents from the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget,  and from the agencies we reviewed that detailed agency responsibilities  with respect to personal services contracts. We interviewed agency  personnel concerning their responsibilities for awarding personal services  contracts, for preparing the data entered in FPDS-NG, for preparing the  annual inventory of contracted services, and reviewing the contracts  subsequent to inventory preparation.", "To gain further insight into FPDS-NG, agency-specific service contract  inventories, and contract files, we interviewed officials from the Air Force,  Army, Navy, USAID, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD),  including OSD General Counsel and OSD\u2019s Total Force Manpower and  Resources Directorate. We also interviewed officials from the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s OFPP regarding the government-wide use of  personal services contracts.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to July 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the United States Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Penny Berrier, Assistant Director;  John Beauchamp; Stephanie Gustafson; Kristine Hassinger; Julia  Kennon; Carol Mebane; Jean McSween; Kate Pfeiffer; Roxanna Sun; and  Abby Volk made significant contributions to this review."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Contractors hired under personal services contracts operate like government employees. The federal government reported spending about $1.5 billion on personal services contracts for FYs 2011-2015. The Air Force, Army, Navy, and USAID together were responsible for most of this reported spending.", "We found that USAID spent over $123 million on these contracts in FY 2015. However, we could not confirm how much DOD spent on them because the Air Force and Army did not record these contracts accurately in federal databases.", "We recommended that the Air Force and Army take steps to ensure that personal services contracts are recorded accurately."]}
