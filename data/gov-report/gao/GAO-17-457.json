Instead, they have primarily focused on efforts to obligate funds before they expire, as well as competition rates and small business participation. In 2014, one of the Army's key strategic planning documents established that contracting operations should adhere to schedule, cost, and performance objectives, but Army leaders have not established the timeliness, cost savings, and contractor quality metrics needed to evaluate contracting operations against such objectives. Without adequate metrics, Army leaders will not have the information needed to determine whether Army contracting operations are meeting the department's objectives. Since 2012, Army leaders, including successive Assistant Secretaries of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) (ASA(ALT)), have acknowledged a need for improvements in contracting and have taken positive intermittent steps, but GAO found that these leaders did not sustain the efforts or\u2014alternately\u2014provide a rationale for not doing so. GAO has previously found that leadership must provide clear and consistent rationales to effectively drive organizational transformations. If Army leadership does not document its rationale for key decisions, the Army's contracting organizations may be missing critical information to effectively improve operations going forward.", "Top Army leaders have not evaluated the effects of major organizational changes on contracting operations despite repeatedly changing reporting relationships across contracting organizations since 2008, when the Secretary of the Army created the Army Contracting Command. The number of changes has increased since 2012, with five major changes in 2016.", "Some Army leaders made organizational changes to centralize contracting decision-making, while others made changes intended to improve support to field operations. When Army leaders made these changes, they did not establish measurable objectives in accordance with federal standards for internal control, and officials from eight different Army organizations told GAO that the numerous changes disrupted contracting operations and caused confusion. Further, GAO found that disagreements over the associated risks and benefits have increased tensions among officials in the ASA(ALT) office and at the Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Specifically, in October 2015, we found that the  Army had extensively used bridge contracts\u2014extensions to existing  contracts or new, short-term sole source contracts to incumbent  contractors to avoid a gap in service when an existing contract is set to  expire but the follow-on contract is not ready to be awarded. These sole  source contracts effectively decreased competition and increased the risk  that the government was paying too much. We subsequently issued a  management letter to the Executive Director responsible for the contracts  and recommended training to contracting officers about the appropriate  use of bridge contracts. The Department of Defense concurred with our  recommendation and indicated that the Army would issue guidance  reminding contracting professionals about the proper use of bridge  contracts, but the department has not yet taken the actions necessary to  address the recommendation. Separately, in December 2015, we found  that the Army Materiel Command (AMC) did not have enough contracting  professionals due to several cost-cutting actions taken by the Army since  fiscal year 2011 to implement mandated reductions and caps on future  spending. We made four recommendations to ensure that the  Department of Defense has the right people with the right skills to meet  future needs. The department concurred with all four recommendations  but has not yet addressed them.

Therefore, the model could produce  misleading results and understate the number of contracting officers  needed to meet the Army\u2019s demands. The Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2019s  representatives stated that the model will not account for changes in  these variables because it is intended to serve as an initial baseline. They  acknowledged that the current model is not the final solution for  determining the Army\u2019s contracting workforce requirements and that it is a  work in progress.

Individual reviews of contracting offices  culminate in an overall organizational risk assessment of low, medium, or  high; and corrective action plans to address findings and  recommendations. This program is formally defined in the Army\u2019s Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement, which states that it shall be  implemented in a tiered manner, with the PARCs, HCAs, and DASA(P)  conducting complimentary assessments.

Similarly, at the beginning of fiscal year 2017, DASA(P) approved  an ACC request for a 12-month extension to complete its reviews due to  personnel shortages. Four years earlier, in fiscal year 2013, ACC did not  conduct a review due to budget constraints. In another case, a DASA(P)  representative told us that USACE did not submit an Annual Summary  Health Report for fiscal year 2015 and did not provide DASA(P) a reason  for not doing so. Further, when we reviewed 12 Annual Summary Health  Reports provided by DASA(P)\u2014spanning fiscal years 2013 through  2015\u2014we found that some contracting offices within ACC, NGB, and  USACE had not been sufficiently evaluated during the previous 36  months.

DASA(P) officials stated that  they could not produce holistic assessments of Army contracting during  that time because of staffing shortages. Because DASA(P) did not  implement the program in accordance with Army guidance during this  time, the HCAs or PARCs self-reported their compliance ratings to the  ASA(ALT) without independent DASA(P) reviews, as intended. This may  have increased the likelihood that their findings contained errors or bias,  and that the PARCs\u2019 corrective action plans did not fully reflect the  DASA(P)\u2019s perspective. Previously, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011,  DASA(P) had identified that more than 30 percent of the contracting  offices they independently reviewed were at risk of serious adverse  impacts to contracting operations. The deficiencies causing the adverse  impacts could include violations of policies and statutes, as well as  missing documentation. To resume the independent reviews, at the  beginning of 2017, DASA(P) representatives said that they hired a new  staff member to produce the holistic assessments, and that this staff  member will initially produce an assessment covering fiscal years 2014  through 2017 to account for years that DASA(P) previously missed.

Subsequently, ASA(ALT) officials proposed centralizing  all contracting authority across Army contracting under the Office of the  ASA(ALT), specifically in DASA(P). DASA(P) argued that centralizing  HCA authority across Army contracting would better delineate contracting  and command authority, retain contracting decisions within the  contracting chain, encourage responsiveness to customer needs, and  promote the independence of the contracting function. In order to  centralize HCA authority into a single office, the ASA(ALT) would have  rescinded the HCA authority for all the HCAs, including the AMC  commander. AMC officials said they strongly opposed this proposal and  told us it would degrade communication and integration between its  subordinate units, displace the mission command of the Army, and  ultimately lead to the isolation of subordinate contracting units.", "Ultimately, in December 2016, the ASA(ALT) instead reassigned HCA  authority from three commanders, including the AMC commander, to  contracting professionals within their organizations. As noted earlier, the  ASA(ALT) did so to help ensure that the HCAs are individuals with  contracting experience who can focus on contracting issues, rather than  commanding generals who have broader responsibilities and do not  necessarily have contracting expertise. Officials at AMC were receptive to  the change, but its benefits are not universally recognized. According to  DASA(P) officials, one of the two other commanders that lost HCA  authority was strongly opposed to the change, and the lack of measurable  objectives deprives proponents of quantitative data that could be used to  address such concerns.", "In such an environment\u2014characterized by a lack of measurable  objectives and authoritative data, and increased tensions between  officials in the ASA(ALT) office and at AMC\u2014some of the Army\u2019s key  contracting leaders and requirements generators are concerned about the  effectiveness of the current organizational structures. We found that Army  personnel at six organizations were concerned that the OPORD created  the potential for LCMC commanders to sway contracting to favor their  own requirements or goals when it gave the LCMC commanders  operational control over three PARCs. Army officials at two of those six  organizations expressed concern that LCMC commanders might prioritize  their own contracting requirements ahead of requirements from other  organizations that depend on the three PARCs to meet their contracting  requirements\u2014particularly PEOs. Further, we heard officials voice  concerns that LCMC commanders might pressure the PARCs to act  against their best judgment in order to meet LCMC goals. For instance,  officials expressed concerns that LCMC commanders might pressure  PARCs to rush contract negotiations in order to more quickly acquire  spare parts for fielded systems. In addition, some PARCs were  concerned about the changes in rating chains, as LCMC commanders are  now responsible for rating the three PARCs\u2019 performance but have a  limited understanding of contracting issues and the work the PARCs do  for customers other than LCMCs. Officials told us that these concerns  have not been realized to date, but, given the relatively short amount of  time that has passed since the AMC commander issued the OPORD, it is  still possible that they may be realized in the future.

Some senior Army leaders have taken intermittent steps to  improve the department\u2019s contracting operations, but inconsistent  oversight reviews and leadership turnover have stalled key efforts.  Leadership turnover will continue in the future, and, for this reason, it is  critical that senior leaders\u2014particularly ASA(ALT)s\u2014document rationales  for key decisions, especially when these decisions run counter to their  predecessors\u2019 thinking.", "Finally, when senior leaders make organizational changes intended to  improve operations, they must also establish measurable objectives that  will allow them to assess progress toward their ultimate goals. In the  absence of such measures, it is unclear whether issues that necessitated  the organizational changes have been addressed, and whether  contracting outcomes are improving or getting worse.

We also obtained and examined all of  the Army\u2019s quarterly Contracting Enterprise Review (CER) briefings for  fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and documentation of the action items the  ASA(ALT) issued following the second quarter fiscal year 2016 briefing;  these were the only CER action items Army officials had documented  through fiscal year 2016. The DASA(P) office develops the CER briefings  in order to provide the ASA(ALT) and DASA(P) quarterly assessments of  the overall health of Army contracting and to allow management to drive  improvements. The CER briefings contain data DASA(P) officials obtain  directly from source systems, such as the Federal Procurement Data  System \u2013 Next Generation, and self-reported information from the Army\u2019s  Principal Assistants Responsible for Contracting (PARC).", "In order to assess the reliability of the data in the CER briefings, we  reviewed the data from each of the quarterly documents from fiscal years  2015 and 2016, made comparisons, and identified discrepancies. We  also reviewed source documents, such as the Annual Summary Health  Reports and the 2013 Army contracting study. Further, we interviewed  DASA(P) officials responsible for coordinating, compiling, and reviewing  the CER data, and officials from Army contracting organizations that  provided data and information presented in the CER briefings. We  determined that the data contained in the CER briefings were not  sufficiently reliable for examining the Army\u2019s contracting operations, and  our discussion in the report of CER data focuses on these limitations.", "In order to obtain contextual information about the Army\u2019s contracting  evaluations, we interviewed officials from Army contracting organizations  that provide DASA(P) officials data and information presented in the CER  briefings, as well as DASA(P) officials responsible for coordinating,  compiling, and reviewing the CER data.", "To assess the extent to which Army leaders have evaluated the effects of  organizational changes on contracting operations, we identified major  changes Army leaders made from 2007 through 2016. We focused on  this time period because it accounts for the changes Army leaders made  following the Gansler Commission\u2019s 2007 report on the Army\u2019s  contracting, including the creation of ACC. We reviewed key documents  surrounding these changes, including the 2009 general order from the  Secretary of the Army that created ACC. We also reviewed memos  ASA(ALT)s issued between 2007 and 2016, including six that rescinded,  consolidated, and reassigned HCA authority; and others that focused on  the implementation of new processes and practices for contracting  operations. In addition, we reviewed a memorandum assembled by  ASA(ALT) representatives that provided perspectives on the OPORD  AMC issued in February 2016. It included observations from 7 Deputy  Assistant Secretaries of the Army and 12 PEOs.", "In order to obtain different perspectives on the Army\u2019s organizational  changes, we interviewed Army leaders from the Office of the ASA(ALT)  and AMC, HCAs, PARCs, and requirements generators. In particular, we  interviewed Army officials from the three contracting centers affected by  the February 2016 AMC OPORD, as well as LCMCs, PEOs, and Army  Sustainment Command.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2016 to June 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Army", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact listed above, W.

Instead, they have primarily focused on efforts to obligate funds before they expire.", "We recommended that the Army develop metrics to determine whether its contracts are meeting schedule, cost, and performance goals; and that it assess the impact of its frequent organizational changes (such as centralizing decision-making) on contracting operations."]}
