To encourage federal agencies to pursue the potential efficiencies associated with cloud computing, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a \u201cCloud First\u201d policy in 2011 that required agency Chief Information Officers to implement a cloud-based service whenever there was a secure, reliable, and cost-effective option.", "GAO was asked to assess agencies' progress in implementing cloud services. GAO's objectives included assessing selected agencies' progress in using such services and determining the extent to which the agencies have experienced cost savings. GAO selected for review the seven agencies that it reported on in 2012 in order to compare their progress since then in implementing cloud services; the agencies were selected using the size of their IT budgets and experience in using cloud services. GAO also analyzed agency cost savings and related documentation and interviewed agency and OMB officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Each of the seven agencies reviewed implemented additional cloud computing services since GAO last reported on their progress in 2012. For example, since then, the total number of cloud computing services implemented by the agencies increased by 80 services, from 21 to 101. The agencies also added to the amount they reported spending on cloud services by $222 million, from $307 million to $529 million. Further, the agencies increased the percentage of their information technology (IT) budgets allocated to cloud services; however, as shown in the table, the overall increase was just 1 percent.", "The agencies' relatively small increase in cloud spending as a percent of their overall IT budgets, is attributed in part, to the fact that these agencies collectively had not considered cloud computing services for about 67 percent of their investments. With regard to why these investments had not been assessed, the agencies said it was in large part due to these being legacy investments in operations and maintenance; the agencies had only planned to consider cloud options for these investments when they were to be modernized or replaced. This is inconsistent with Office of Management and Budget policy that calls for cloud solutions to be considered first whenever a secure, reliable, and cost-effective option exists regardless of where the investment is in its life cycle. Until the agencies fully assess all their IT investments, they will not be able to achieve the resulting benefits of operational efficiencies and cost savings.", "The agencies collectively reported cost savings of about $96 million from the implementation of 22 of the 101 cloud services. These savings included both one-time and multiyear savings. For example, the General Services Administration saved $2.6 million by migrating to a cloud customer service solution, and Homeland Security saved $1.2 million from fiscal years 2011 through 2013 by implementing a cloud-based collaboration service. Agency officials cited two major reasons for why the other services they had implemented did not save money. First, a motivation for changing to some of the cloud-based services was not to reduce spending, but to improve service. Second, in selected cases, the cloud computing service opened up a new service or provided a higher quality of service; while this provided useful benefits to the agency, the associated costs negated any savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending, among other things, that the seven agencies assess the IT investments identified in this report that have yet to be evaluated for suitability for cloud computing services.

As a result, cloud computing offers potential  increased benefits, including faster service and reduced IT costs,  compared to traditional IT processes currently being used by federal  agencies and others.", "To encourage federal agencies to begin taking advantage of cloud  computing services, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued  guidance in December 2010 on implementing these services. The  guidance identified cloud computing as having the potential to play a  major part in achieving operational efficiencies in the federal  government\u2019s IT environment, including improving asset use and reducing  duplicative systems. To help achieve these efficiencies, OMB developed  a \u201cCloud First\u201d policy (dated February 2011) that required each agency\u2019s  chief information officer (CIO) to implement a cloud service whenever  there was a secure, reliable, cost-effective option.

We  analyzed documentation from the agencies, including data on the number  of and funding for current cloud services and compared this with the  results from our 2012 report. In addition, we interviewed agency officials  responsible for cloud services to corroborate progress.

To accelerate the shift, OMB required agencies to  identify, plan, and fully migrate three services to a cloud-based one by  June 2012.", "In February 2011, OMB issued the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy,  as called for in its 25-Point Plan.

We noted  that, while OMB, GSA, and NIST had initiated efforts to ensure secure  cloud computing services, OMB had not yet finished a cloud  computing strategy; GSA had begun a procurement for expanding  cloud computing services, but had not yet developed specific plans for  establishing a shared information security assessment and  authorization process; and NIST had not yet issued cloud-specific  security guidance. We recommended that OMB establish milestones  to complete a strategy for federal cloud computing and ensure it  addressed information security challenges. These include having a  process to assess vendor compliance with government information  security requirements and division of information security  responsibilities between the customer and vendor. OMB agreed with  our recommendations and subsequently published a strategy in  February 2011 that addressed the importance of information security  when using cloud computing, but it did not fully address several key  challenges confronting agencies, such as the appropriate use of  attestation standards for control assessments of cloud computing  service providers, and division of information security-related  responsibilities between customer and provider. We also  recommended that GSA consider security in its procurement for cloud  services, including consideration of a shared assessment and  authorization process. GSA generally agreed with our  recommendations and has since developed its FedRAMP program,  an assessment and authorization process for systems shared among  federal agencies. Finally, we recommended that NIST issue guidance  specific to cloud-based computing security. NIST agreed with our  recommendations and has since issued multiple publications that  address such guidance.", "In April 2012, we reported that more needed to be done to implement  OMB\u2019s 25-Point Plan and measure its results.

Specifically, officials from  OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government & Information Technology told us that  they initially had established goals for the agencies but instead granted  them the latitude to annually assess all their investments and identify  those investments that were appropriate for their agency to migrate. As a  result, some agencies have been more aggressive than others in moving  services to the cloud.", "In addition, the agencies\u2019 relatively low percentage of budget allocated to  cloud spending is due in large part to the fact that the agencies have not  assessed a majority of their investments, although OMB\u2019s guidance calls  for agencies to assess all their IT services for migration to the cloud  irrespective of where each investment is in its life cycle. Specifically, as  shown in table 4, the agencies collectively had not assessed about 67  percent of their 2000 investments.

Agency officials added that it was a challenge to assess and  ultimately replace such legacy systems because agency personnel were  often reluctant to cede direct control of mission-critical IT resources.  While we recognize the cultural challenge to moving investments to the  cloud (which is discussed in more detail later in this report), OMB  guidance nonetheless calls for agencies to continually assess all  investments irrespective of where they are in their life cycle. Agency  officials were aware of the OMB guidance and said they had plans to  assess their unevaluated investments in the near future. Nevertheless,  the agencies for the most part were not able to provide us with specific  dates for when assessments of these investments were to be performed.

DHS had a cumulate savings of $1.2  million through fiscal year 2013 for its collaboration platform that is used  to build applications and manage documents, which was implemented in  fiscal year 2011.", "According to agency officials, two major factors governed why the  remaining services (79) did not achieve savings. First, a motivation for  changing to some of the cloud-based services was not to reduce  spending, but to improve service. Second, in selected cases, the cloud  computing service opened up a new service or provided a higher quality  of service; while this provided useful benefits to the agency, the  associated costs negated any savings.", "In addition to these cost savings, agency officials identified the following  benefits from migrating systems and services to a cloud computing  service.", "Decreased time to deploy: A cloud computing service can be  deployed more quickly and migrating a system to a cloud allows an  agency to run it for a short period of time and then shut it down,  without having to develop a unique infrastructure for it.

Of the five, two  challenges\u2014meeting federal security requirements and overcoming  cultural barriers\u2014were previously identified and discussed in our 2012  report.", "According to the officials, meeting federal security requirements was a  continuing challenge because the requirements for new services are a  moving target (i.e., the requirements are regularly being updated to  address new threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies, and vendors may  not be able to meet them). For example, NIST recently made revisions to  its cloud security requirements and agencies are still in the process of  getting familiar with them. As a result, agencies fear making mistakes that  could negatively impact the security of systems and data. With regard to  overcoming cultural barriers, DHS officials said that shifting to a new  business model from a legacy business model requires cultural change,  which continues to be a challenge at the department. In addition, GSA  officials said that, as they move the management of servers and software  off site, a continuing challenge is getting agency staff to adapt to an  operational environment where they do not have direct control and  access to agency IT resources.", "In addition to the two challenges repeated from 2012, officials reported  these three new challenges.", "Meeting new network infrastructure requirements. Current  network infrastructure, topology (network configuration), or bandwidth  (data transmission rate) is often insufficient to meet new infrastructure  needs when agencies transition to cloud computing services. For  example, officials at State said that legacy systems with a particular  infrastructure designed to meet certain federal requirements will need  to be reengineered to work in a multi-tiered cloud environment. USDA  officials stated that they would need to consider redesigning their  network topology to accommodate new cloud service bandwidth  requirements and traffic streams.", "Having appropriate expertise for acquisition processes. Migrating  legacy systems to cloud computing services requires knowledgeable  acquisition staff and appropriate processes. For example, HHS  officials stated that while the department has the capability to  purchase cloud services, it has found post award management to be a  challenge. These officials added that to respond to this challenge,  HHS is working with its personnel as well as other stakeholders, such  as GSA, to develop best practices for cloud post award management  and related acquisition activities. In addition, DHS officials said that  efforts to transition from legacy systems to cloud computing services  require streamlining their IT services supply chain, which requires an  evaluation of the component processes and time to fully implement  this transformation.", "Funding for implementation. Funding for the initial implementation  of a cloud service can be a significant cost to agencies. For example,  officials at State said that the cost of migrating an application to a  cloud service poses a challenge in the current budget environment  where IT budgets are declining. In addition, GSA officials stated that  initial implementation requires additional funding that has not been  made available.", "While these challenges are formidable, OMB and GSA have provided  guidance and services to help agencies address many of these  challenges. For example, GSA developed FedRAMP, which is a program  to create processes for security authorizations and allow agencies to  leverage security authorizations on a governmentwide basis in an effort to  streamline the certification and accreditation process. GSA also provides  continuous monitoring services for cloud computing services for all  federal agencies.", "In addition, OMB\u2019s Federal Cloud Computing Strategy addresses how  agencies can overcome redesign and implementation challenges. In  particular, the strategy states that agencies should ensure that their  network infrastructure can support the demand for higher bandwidth  before migrating to a cloud service. The strategy also directs agencies to  assess readiness for migration to a cloud service by determining the  suitability of the existing legacy application and data to either migrate to  the cloud service (i.e., rehost an application in a cloud environment) or be  replaced by a cloud service (i.e., retire the legacy system and replace  with a commercial equivalent).", "Further, GSA provides services to assist agencies with procuring and  acquiring cloud services. Specifically, GSA established contracts that the  agencies can use to obtain commodity services such as cloud  infrastructure as a service and cloud e-mail; these contracts\u2014which were  established in October 2010 and September 2012, respectively\u2014are  intended to reduce the burden on agencies for the most common IT  services. GSA also created working groups to support commodity service  migration by developing technical requirements for shared services to  reduce the analytical burden on individual government agencies.", "Regarding funding, the strategy recommends that agencies reevaluate  their technology sourcing strategy to include consideration and  application of cloud computing services as part of their budget process.", "Officials stated that they consult the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy to  guide them in their efforts to move services to the cloud.

While the  collective and individual agency gains in implementing such services are  commendable, the seven agencies are still only investing a small fraction  of their IT budgets on cloud computing. The agencies\u2019 modest level of  cloud investment is attributable in part to the large number of legacy  investments\u2014nearly two thirds of all investments\u2014that have yet to be  considered for cloud migration. This is due in part to the agencies\u2019  practice of not assessing these investments until they are to be replaced  or modernized, which is inconsistent with OMB\u2019s direction. Nonetheless,  the large number of agency investments to be assessed provides ample  opportunities for additional progress and substantial cost savings. An  important step to realizing this progress and savings is ensuring these  investments are assessed, which includes establishing milestones for  when the assessments are to be performed.
