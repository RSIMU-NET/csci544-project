However, federal data show workers\u0092 access to plans remains limited, leaving many without a work-based plan to save for retirement. For this report, GAO examined (1) characteristics of small employers that are more or less likely to sponsor a plan for their employees, (2) challenges small employers face in establishing and maintaining a plan for their employees, and (3) options to address these challenges and attract more small employer plan sponsors. GAO defined small employers as forprofit firms that employ 100 or fewer employees. GAO analyzed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of Labor (Labor) data, interviewed agency officials and experts, held discussion groups with small employers, and reviewed relevant federal rules, literature, and retirement plan proposals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on available data, about 14 percent of small employers sponsor some type of retirement plan. Overall, GAO found that the likelihood that a small employer will sponsor a retirement plan largely depends on the size of the employer\u0092s workforce and the workers\u0092 average wages more than on the industry in which the employer operates and the geographic region in which the employer is located. GAO found the greatest likelihood of plan sponsorship was among small employers with larger numbers of employees and those paying an average annual wage of $50,000 to $99,999. GAO also found that the most common plans sponsored by small employers are 401(k)s and Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE) Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRA)\u0097an employer-sponsored IRA designed for small employers\u0097at 46 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of total plans. However, IRS currently does not have the means to collect information on employers that sponsor another type of IRA plan designed for small employers, the Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA plan, which limits what is known about employers that sponsor these plans.", "Small employers and retirement experts identified several challenges to starting and maintaining retirement plans. Many small employers said they feel overwhelmed by the number of retirement plan options, administration requirements, and fiduciary responsibilities. For example, many are concerned about the potential risks associated with sponsoring a plan. Although federal agencies conduct education and outreach on retirement plans, a number of small employers and other stakeholders said small employers were unaware of these initiatives. For example, Labor, IRS, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) collaborate to develop and disseminate information and guidance online but do so through separate websites and in a largely uncoordinated fashion. Small employers and other stakeholders also cited other challenges to plan sponsorship, including a lack of financial resources, time, and personnel. However, some small employers said their employees prioritized health benefits over retirement benefits. To address some of the challenges to plan sponsorship, some small employers said they use contracted service providers that perform plan administration tasks.", "Small employers and other stakeholders offered options for addressing some challenges and reducing the complexity of plan sponsorship for small employers. Options included simplification of federal requirements for plan administration, such as easing or eliminating certain plan testing requirements. Some stakeholders said increasing the tax credit for plan startup costs could further defray costs and help boost plan sponsorship. Some stakeholders also said that the federal government could conduct more education and outreach efforts to inform small employers about plans. Pension reform proposals in the United States, along with certain features of pension systems in other countries, may provide additional options that could increase plan sponsorship and increase workers\u0092 access to retirement plans. For example, asset pooling is a feature that allows small employers to pool resources for economies of scale, which can lower plan costs. In light of the variety of options, Labor, the Department of the Treasury, IRS, and SBA should jointly evaluate existing options and develop new proposals with the goal of mitigating barriers to small employer plan sponsorship."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Labor convene an interagency task force with Treasury, IRS, and SBA to coordinate existing research, education, and outreach efforts to foster small employer plan sponsorship. GAO also recommends that IRS consider modifying tax forms to gather complete, reliable information about SEP IRAs. Agencies generally agreed with GAO\u0092s recommendations; however, Labor disagreed with GAO\u0092s recommendation to create a single webportal for federal guidance. However, because federal resources are scattered across different sites, GAO believes consolidating plan information onto one webportal could benefit small employers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 42 million workers, or about one-third of all private-sector  employees, work for small employers, and recent federal data suggest  many of these workers lack access to a work-based retirement plan to  save for retirement. An estimated 51 percent to 71 percent of workers at  employers with fewer than 100 workers do not have access to a work- based retirement plan compared to an estimated 19 percent to 35 percent  of those who work for employers with 100 or more workers.", "Over the years, the federal government has taken steps to encourage  small employers to sponsor retirement plans, and Congress has enacted  legislation that has established incentives such as plan types with fewer  federal reporting requirements, higher plan contribution limits, and a tax  credit for plan startup costs. The Department of Labor (Labor) and the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  have also increased education and outreach to these employers.  However, small employers continue to face a number of barriers to  starting and maintaining plans for their workers. In 2008, GAO reported  on challenges that can limit small employer sponsorship of Individual  Retirement Arrangement (IRA) plans, including administrative costs,  contribution requirements, and eligibility based on employee tenure and  compensation, among others. Other research also suggests that a  difficult economy and concerns about the overall cost of retirement plans  may be factors for some small employers that are less likely to sponsor  plans. For example, a recent survey found that difficult business  conditions were a top reason employers reported for being unlikely to  sponsor a retirement plan.", "Certain characteristics associated with small employers may also  contribute to the challenges of starting and maintaining a plan. When  compared with large employers, small employers are more likely to  encounter higher rates of employee turnover and higher costs per  employee to comply with federal regulations. Further, small employers\u2014 especially start-ups\u2014rely heavily on owner investment and bank credit,  and operating revenue can be uncertain from year to year. Federal data suggest that about half of all new businesses (nearly all of which are  small) do not survive for more than 5 years. All these conditions can  make it difficult for small employers to focus on providing retirement  benefits for their workers.", "In light of these ongoing challenges, GAO was asked to examine issues  related to retirement plan sponsorship among small employers. We  answered the following questions:", "What characteristics are associated with small employers that are  more likely or less likely to sponsor a retirement plan for their  employees?", "What challenges do small employers face in establishing and  maintaining a retirement plan for their employees? and", "What options exist to address these challenges and attract more small  employer plan sponsors?", "To answer these research questions, we combined and analyzed  retirement plan data from Labor and IRS data on 5.3 million small  employers. We performed regression analyses to identify characteristics  of small employers that are most likely to sponsor plans. We conducted  literature reviews and interviewed retirement experts, organizations  representing small employers, agency officials, and others on challenges  faced by small employers in establishing and maintaining plans, and  options for addressing those challenges. In addition, we conducted  structured interviews with groups of small employers that did and did not  sponsor plans. These interviews were conducted in five cities, which were  judgmentally selected for geographic diversity. We also reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations. Additional details regarding our  methodology can be found in appendix I. We conducted this performance  audit from October 2010 to March 2012 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To encourage employers to establish and maintain retirement plans for  their employees, the federal government provides preferential tax  treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for plans that meet  certain requirements. In addition, the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, sets forth certain protections  for participants in private-sector retirement plans and establishes  standards of conduct for those that manage the plans and their assets,  generally called fiduciaries. To the extent they qualify as fiduciaries  under the law, plan sponsors assume certain responsibilities and  potential liability under ERISA. For example, a fiduciary must act  prudently and solely in the interest of plan participants and their  beneficiaries, which may require documenting decisions relating to the  plan, including hiring outside professionals or service providers that  advise and help administer plans. Small employers may choose a plan for  their employees from one of three categories: employer-sponsored IRA  plans; defined contribution (DC) plans; and defined benefit (DB) plans   Appendix II presents  (often referred to as traditional pension plans).information provided by Labor and IRS about some of the various types of  retirement savings plans available to small employers.", "Employer-sponsored IRA plans: Employer-sponsored IRA plans allow  employers and, in some cases, employees to make contributions for  deposit in separate IRA accounts for each participating employee. These  plans generally have fewer administration and reporting requirements  than other types of plans. Participating employees bear the full  investment risk of their account assets. There are two types of employer- sponsored IRA plans. Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees  (SIMPLE) IRA plans require employers to either match their eligible  employees\u2019 voluntary salary reductions (typically up to 3 percent of  compensation) or to contribute 2 percent of compensation for each  eligible employee. The second type is the Simplified Employee Pension  (SEP) IRA plan, which can be sponsored by an employer of any size,  and has higher employer contribution limits than the SIMPLE IRA plan. In  a SEP IRA plan, employer contributions are voluntary and employee  salary reductions are not permitted.", "Defined contribution plans: DC plans allow employers, employees, or  both to contribute to individual employee accounts that are grouped under  a single plan. Employee salary reductions, if provided under the plan,  may be pretax or after-tax, in some cases. As with employer-sponsored  IRA plans, employees participating in DC plans bear the full risk of  investment and will realize any returns (gains or losses) on those  investments. DC plans tend to have higher limits for employee  contributions but also more rules and reporting requirements than  employer-sponsored IRA plans. For example, some DC plans may be  required to conduct annual testing in order to ensure that the  contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate  against rank-and-file workers in favor of highly compensated  employees,. In addition to nondiscrimination testing, some DC plans  may also be subject to top-heavy requirements and be required to  conduct further testing to ensure a minimum level of benefits are provided  to rank-and-file workers in plans that are sponsored by owner-dominated  firms, where the majority of benefits accrue to \u201ckey\u201d employees, such as  owners and top executives. As we have previously reported, top-heavy  requirements are intended to address a greater potential for tax-shelter  abuses in such plans. Top-heavy requirements are most likely to affect  smaller plans (fewer than 100 participants), according to the IRS. The  most common type of DC plan is a 401(k) plan. In 401(k) plans,  employees can defer a portion of their salary\u2014pretax or after tax, if  permitted by the plan\u2014for deposit into a separate retirement account.  Employers may also choose to make additional contributions (such as  contributing a percentage of each eligible employee\u2019s salary), match the  amount contributed by the employee, or both. One type of 401(k) plan,  the safe harbor 401(k) plan, is not subject to some of the requirements  associated with traditional 401(k)s that generally require annual plan  testing. However, under safe harbor 401(k) plans, employers are required   Another type  to make certain contributions to each participant\u2019s account.of tax-qualified DC plan, the profit sharing plan, gives the employer the  discretion to determine annually whether and how much to pay into the  plan, within certain maximum limits.

Operating DB plans typically requires the expertise of an actuary.", "Over the years, Congress has responded to concerns about lack of  access to workplace retirement plans for employees of small businesses  with legislation to lower costs, simplify requirements, and ease  administrative burden. For example, The Revenue Act of 1978 and the  Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 established the SEP IRA  plan and the SIMPLE IRA plan respectively, featuring fewer compliance  requirements than other plan types. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) also included a number of  provisions that affected small businesses. For example, EGTRRA  eliminated top-heavy testing requirements for safe harbor 401(k)s,  increased contribution limits for employer-sponsored IRA plans and  401(k) plans, and created a tax credit for small employers to offset startup  costs, including the cost of educating employees about a new plan.  EGTRRA also created a tax credit for individuals within certain income  limits who make eligible contributions to retirement plans. The Pension  Protection Act of 2006, among other changes, made these EGTRRA  provisions permanent and established additional provisions that support  retirement plan participation by rank-and-file employees, such as  automatic enrollment.", "To help encourage plan sponsorship, federal agencies conduct education  and outreach activities and provide information about retirement plans for  small employers. Labor, IRS, and the Small Business Administration  (SBA)\u2014which maintains an extensive network of field offices\u2014have  collaborated with each other and with national and local organizations to  develop information on small employer retirement plans and conduct  outreach with small employers.

Further, the  sponsorship rate for small employers with 26 to 100 employees exceeded  75 percent when average wages were $50,000 or higher. In contrast,  small employers with 1 to 4 employees reached their highest sponsorship  rate of 13 percent when average annual wages were $50,000 or more;  however, sponsorship rates were still about one-sixth the rate for small  employers with 26 to 100 employees in the same wage category. Our  analysis showed the sponsorship rate for employers with one to four  employees lowered the overall sponsorship rate in the average annual  wage categories.

For example, some small employers  and retirement experts said that the number of plan types and features  make it difficult for small employers to compare and choose plans.  Representatives of a plan service provider said that too many plan options  overwhelmed small employers, making it more difficult for them to choose a  plan and, ultimately, less likely that they will sponsor one. Some  stakeholders also described the administrative burden of plan paperwork,  such as reviewing complicated quarterly investment reports or complying  with federal reporting requirements\u2014like those associated with required  annual statements\u2014as particularly burdensome. For example, one small  employer with a DB plan described a dense and highly technical quarterly  investment report for his plan that ran 50 pages, making it difficult to glean  summary financial information about the plan. Another small employer who  previously sponsored a 401(k) with a company match said the amount of  required plan paperwork, including generating annual reports, was a key  reason he terminated it. Stakeholders also identified interim amendment  requirements as burdensome for plan administration. Plan sponsors  generally submit plan documentation to IRS periodically to ensure that  plans are up to date and compliant with relevant federal statutes and  regulations. However, when statutes and regulations change, some  sponsors may be required to modify plan documentation and resubmit their  plan documents to IRS. Some stakeholders, including small employers, a  small business advocacy organization, and plan service provider, said that  complying with interim amendment requirements can be costly and time  consuming for small employers. IRS has recognized that interim  amendment requirements pose a burden to plan sponsors. However, an  IRS official noted that most small employer plans are likely based on plan  designs that are preapproved by IRS, and interim amendment  requirements are likely to entail little administrative burden for most small  employer sponsors.", "Fiduciary responsibilities: A number of stakeholders indicated that  understanding and carrying out a sponsor\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities with  respect to their qualified retirement plans presents significant challenges to  some small employers. Plan sponsors may qualify as fiduciaries under  ERISA, for example, if they have discretionary authority or control over the  management of the plan or control the plan assets. Fiduciaries have a  number of responsibilities, such as the duty to act prudently, in the sole  interest of the participants and beneficiaries, and to diversify the  investments of the plan. Some small employer sponsors found the selection of investment fund options for their plans particularly challenging.  A small employer with a 401(k) plan described the difficulties of selecting  appropriate investment options, with an appropriate balance of risk, for a  workforce that includes younger and older workers. A number of small  business advocates and retirement experts said that not all small  employers have an adequate understanding of their fiduciary duties and  are not always aware of all their responsibilities under the law. For  example, a retirement expert said that small employers that do not consult  with plan professionals often lack the time and expertise to understand  complicated fiduciary rules under ERISA. One service provider explained  that some small employers mistakenly believe that all fiduciary  responsibilities and liabilities are transferred to a service provider when  they are hired. Another expert noted that some small employers have an  exaggerated sense of the liabilities that being a fiduciary carries, and may  avoid sponsoring a plan out of fear of being sued by their employees.", "Top-heavy requirements: Top-heavy requirements are most likely to  affect smaller plans (fewer than 100 participants), according to IRS. A  number of stakeholders said compliance with the requirements is often  burdensome and poses a major barrier to plan sponsorship for small  employers. Small employers with high employee turnover may face an  even greater likelihood of becoming top-heavy. According to some experts,  employee turnover alone can force some small employers out of  compliance with top-heavy requirements as they replace departing  employees. Over time, rank-and-file employees separate and take their  plan assets with them, while long-term employees, such as business  owners or executives, continue to contribute to the plan, eventually leading  to a top-heavy imbalance of plan assets. For example, one small employer  with a 401(k) plan stated that, because two of the four owners had worked  for the company for about 25 years and their retirement accounts made up  the majority of the total plan assets in the 401(k) plan, the plan had become  top-heavy.", "To comply with the top-heavy requirements, sponsors of certain plansare required to test their plans annually. An employer\u2019s failure to make  certain adjustments to a plan deemed top-heavy can result in it losing its  tax-qualified status and the associated tax advantages for the employer  and employees. A number of stakeholders stated that top-heavy  compliance is confusing and can pose significant burdens on some small  employers. For example, some retirement experts said that small  employers whose plans are found to be top-heavy may encounter a  number of additional costs in the effort to make their plans compliant,  such as hiring a plan professional to make corrections to the plan  document and instituting a minimum top-heavy employer contribution for  all participating rank-and-file employees. According to one expert, in  some cases, the costs of mandatory contributions to employees\u2019 accounts  may prevent owners from making contributions to their own retirement  accounts, and may make some small employers reluctant to sponsor a  plan, or may drive those that sponsor a plan to terminate it. Sponsors can  avoid top-heavy testing by adopting a safe harbor 401(k) plan with no  additional contributions, which is not subject to top-heavy requirements.  However, safe harbor 401(k) plans require the employer to make either  specified matching contributions or a minimum 3 percent contribution to  each participant\u2019s account. According to representatives of the accounting  professional, the additional cost to the employer of required contributions  under a 401(k) safe harbor plan may offset the advantages of sponsoring  such a plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Guidance Is Available to Address the Complexities Associated with Plan Sponsorship but May Lack Visibility among Small Employers", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies provide guidance that can assist small employers in  addressing some of the challenges of starting and maintaining retirement  plans. Labor and IRS, often in collaboration with SBA, have produced  publications, conducted workshops, and developed online resources,  among other efforts, to assist small employers in understanding options,  requirements, and responsibilities of running a plan. For example, Labor  and IRS jointly published a guide that compares various features of  different plan types, including IRA, DC, and DB plans. Both agencies have  also developed websites and online tools to help small employers navigate  plan information and make informed decisions about plan options. For  example, IRS\u2019s Retirement Plans Navigator is a key component of its  education efforts for small employers and is designed for employers that  are less likely to hire a service provider. According to IRS, the navigator is  intended to lead a novice through basic information on retirement plans  and compliance. Similarly, Labor, in collaboration with the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), developed an interactive  website highlighting small employer retirement options. The website  introduces employers to a number of plan options from simpler IRA plans  to more complex automatic enrollment 401(k) plans, and describes the  advantages and features of various plan types. According to Labor,  employers with as few as two employees can find options using the tool.", "However, a number of stakeholders suggested that many small  employers are unaware of federal resources on retirement plans. For  example, the Advisory Committee on Tax Exempt and Government  Entities (ACT) recognized that, despite the numerous IRS retirement  plan resources available, many small employers and other stakeholders  in the small business community are unaware of these resources. ACT  indicated these resources could go a long way in addressing the needs of  the small employers were it not for their lack of visibility. The lack of  visibility of federal guidance on small employer plan options may be due,  in part, to difficulties in finding useful, relevant information across federal  websites. For example, while Labor\u2019s webpage on small employer  retirement plan options contains links to relevant topics, such as  compliance assistance, participants\u2019 rights and fiduciary responsibilities, it  is easy to navigate away from but difficult to return to the content  developed for small employers because there is no consistent page  navigation menu for small employer information. Furthermore, while the  Labor website includes guidance on selecting and monitoring plan service  providers, there is no link to the guidance on the small employer plan  options page. IRS\u2019s Retirement Plans Navigator is located on a separate  website from the rest of the agency\u2019s online plan resources for small  employers. When navigating from the page on small employer retirement  plan resources on IRS\u2019s main portal to the agency\u2019s Retirement Plans  Navigator, a message alerts users that they are leaving the IRS website  and entering another government website. IRS officials noted that small  employers who participated in focus groups on IRS plan resources  reported challenges to understanding plan-based information when  navigating these resources. Furthermore, Labor and IRS present their  online content separately, which makes it necessary for an employer to  navigate both agencies\u2019 websites to gather complete information about  starting and maintaining a retirement plan. For example, to review  information on fiduciary responsibilities, users must visit Labor\u2019s website,  and to review information on nondiscrimination and top-heavy testing,  users must visit IRS\u2019s site. Neither agency maintains a central web portal  for all information relevant to small employer plan sponsorship, though  such portals exist for federal information resources in other areas such as  healthcare. Consolidating Internet-based services and information is  also consistent with one of the purposes of the E-Government Act of 2002  to promote interagency collaboration in providing electronic government  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Employers Identified Lack of Financial Resources, Time, and Personnel as Deterrents to Sponsoring Retirement Plans", "paragraphs": ["Small employers that lack sufficient financial resources, time, and  personnel may be unwilling or unable to sponsor retirement plans. In  particular, stakeholders stated that plan sponsorship may be impractical  for smaller or newer firms that are unable to undertake the commitment to  sponsor a plan. For example, one expert noted that the first priority of a  small employer is remaining in business, and this focus may preclude  sponsoring a retirement plan as a benefit to employees until the firm  becomes more established.", "Financial resources: Small employers, especially those with lower profit  margins or an unstable cash flow, could be less willing or less able to  sponsor a retirement plan because of the one-time costs to start a plan  and the ongoing costs involved with maintaining the plan. These costs  can result from start-up activities, complying with reporting and testing  requirements, and fees paid to an outside party for administration tasks.  Stakeholders stated that these expenses can make sponsoring a plan  unappealing. For example, one small employer stated that as a new  business owner, she thinks it is better for her business to proceed  cautiously and avoid adding to her fixed cost structure. Additionally, any  requirement for small employers to match employee contributions or to  make mandatory contributions to an employee\u2019s account can also  increase costs. Further, small employers stated that general economic  uncertainty makes them reluctant to commit to such long-term expenses  and explained that they needed to reach a certain level of profitability  before they would consider sponsoring a plan. For example, one small  employer stated that he wanted to be able to expect consistent profits  over several years before he would consider investing in a plan. Another  small employer stated that she wanted to triple her business revenue to a  little less than $1 million before she would consider sponsoring a  retirement plan.", "Time and personnel: Some small employers stated they may not have  sufficient time to administer a retirement plan themselves or lacked the  personnel to take on those responsibilities. For example, one small  employer said that he was not prepared to assume the burden of  managing a plan as he thought it would require almost daily attention and  did not have the staff to devote to it. Further, a plan service provider  described how the focus of the small employer would not be on absorbing  the additional time that starting and maintaining a plan would require.  Additionally, a plan sponsor employer stated that, since her business did  not have a dedicated human resources person or accountant, she  performed these duties herself, as she would ultimately be responsible for  any mistakes. Further, small employers may not have time to develop the  expertise to investigate or choose financial products, select the best  investment options, or track their performance.

A service provider observed that the cost  of mandatory contributions\u2014such as those associated with safe harbor  401(k) plans\u2014can discourage small employers, since the cost of the  contributions can outweigh the benefit to the owners.", "Low employee demand for an employer-sponsored retirement plan may  also be a challenge for small employers. For example, a number of small  employers stated that employees prioritized health care benefits over  retirement benefits. One small employer thought that, given the limited  funds available to contribute towards benefits, his employees would  prefer those resources be applied toward lowering the employees\u2019 share  of health insurance premiums. Small employers emphasized that offering  health care benefits was necessary to attract quality employees. Further,  one small employer stated that his employees perceived a more  immediate need for health care benefits, while perceiving retirement  benefits as a future concern. Additionally, some small employers, such as  those who described having younger workforces, stated that their  employees were less concerned about saving for retirement and, as a  result, were not demanding retirement benefits. Other small employers  told us that employees, particularly those with low pay, do not have any  interest in retirement benefits because they live paycheck to paycheck  and are less likely to have funds left over to contribute to a plan. For  example, one small employer discontinued his plan when too few of his  employees\u2014most of whom he described as low wage\u2014participated in  the plan. Another small employer noted that even senior-level managers  in his business did not participate in the plan. However, a retirement  expert stated that, while some employees might not be interested in  participating in a retirement plan, he believed the perceived lack of  demand to be exaggerated. He added that he believed some businesses  may use lack of employee demand as an excuse when the small  employer was not interested in sponsoring a plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Service Providers Help Small Employers Meet Some but Not All Retirement Plan Needs", "paragraphs": ["A number of small employers indicated that they use plan service  providers to address various aspects of plan administration, which  enabled them to overcome some challenges of starting and maintaining a  plan.

For  example, one service provider said a small employer could sponsor a  plan for an administrative fee as low as $1,200 annually. They and other  retirement industry representatives said they are able to provide plan  options at affordable rates because they market and administer IRS pre- approved standard plans in high volume, thereby reducing the costs of  administration. Even so, while some small employers said the fees  service providers charge were affordable, others said they were too high.  Further, some stakeholders pointed to other limitations of using service  providers, such as the difficulties of choosing a provider, setting up a new  plan through a provider, and switching to a new provider, as well as the  significant plan responsibilities that remain with the sponsor. For example,  a small employer described the process of finding a service provider and  setting up a plan as particularly difficult, especially for an employer with  little knowledge of retirement plans or experience in working with a  service provider. Another small employer said she was not satisfied with  the services of her current service provider but would not consider  switching to a new one because of the administrative hardships that  would entail.

Another small  employer who sponsored a 401(k) plan said federal regulators should  \u201cjust keep it simple.\u201d One proposal from a national small business  association would simplify plan requirements by reducing the frequency of  statements sent to certain plan participants, from quarterly to once per  year, and allowing some required disclosures to be made available solely  online. Another proposal, advocated by IRS, would simplify plan  requirements by streamlining interim amendment requirements\u2014an  aspect of plan administration that stakeholders identified as particularly  burdensome for some small employers. Each year since 2004, IRS has  published a cumulative list of changes in plan qualification requirements  that must be incorporated by plan sponsors. An IRS official stated that  IRS is proposing to replace a requirement for some interim amendments  with a requirement for notices to be sent directly to employees. These  notices would explain how a plan intends to comply with changes to  relevant laws and regulations and could reduce the burden for plan  sponsors by reducing the number of times plan documents must be  amended. The amendments that would be subject to the less-stringent  requirement would be those triggered by changes to laws and regulations  but that do not affect plan benefits.", "Revise or eliminate top-heavy testing: A number of stakeholders  proposed revising or eliminating top-heavy testing to ease administrative  and financial burdens.

However, a stakeholder cautioned that the credits must be sufficient to  offset the costs of plan sponsorship, which a service provider said can  amount to $2,000 or more per year. Currently, small employers may claim  an annual tax credit of up to $500 based on plan startup costs for each of  the first 3 years of starting a qualified plan. A national organization  representing small employers cited tax credits as a top factor in an  employer\u2019s decision to sponsor a plan; however, an organization official  said the likelihood of an employer doing so often depends on whether the  tax credit offsets a significant portion of administrative and startup costs  of sponsoring plans. Some small employers stated that larger tax credits  could ease the financial burden of starting a plan by offsetting plan- related costs, thus creating greater incentives for an employer to sponsor  a plan. Other stakeholders said that existing plan startup tax credits are  insufficient to encourage plan sponsorship. Officials at another national  small business association cautioned that short term tax credits do not  provide sufficient incentives for a small employer to make the long-term  commitment of sponsoring a plan.

Officials of a service provider to small businesses stated that,  because clients are generally not aware of the retirement plan options  available to them, the federal government should provide more education  and outreach to improve awareness of the plan types available and rules  that apply to each. Another large service provider mentioned the federal  government should provide educational materials that help small  employers find quality service providers. In addition, in its 2011 report,  ACT made numerous recommendations calling for better publicity of IRS  resources.

By pooling funds, small employers realize economies of  scale because plan administration is simplified and administrative costs  and asset management fees are reduced. Pooling also creates larger  plans, which are more likely to attract service providers that previously  may have found it uneconomical to service smaller individual plans. One  proposal by the Economic Policy Institute, which incorporates the concept  of asset pooling, would create a federally managed and federally  guaranteed national savings plan. Generally, participation in the  program would be mandatory for workers, and employers and  employees would be required to make equal contributions totaling 5  percent of employees\u2019 earnings. Funds would be pooled and  professionally managed, and benefits would be paid out in the form of  annuities to ensure that workers do not outlive their savings. In addition,  Automatic IRAs\u2014which are individual IRAs instead of employer- sponsored plans\u2014are another proposal that draws from several elements  of the current retirement system: payroll-deposit saving, automatic  enrollment, and IRAs. The automatic IRA approach would provide  employers that do not sponsor any retirement plans with a mechanism  that allows their employees to save a portion of their pay in an IRA. For  most employees, payroll deductions would be made by direct deposit,  and enrollment would be automatic unless employees choose to opt out  of participation.", "However, as we reported in 2009, some of these proposals that call for  broader systemic reforms pose other trade-offs. For example, proposals  that mandate participation would increase plan sponsorship and coverage  for workers. However, mandatory participation may create burdens for  some employers, and employers might compensate for the costs of  contributing to workers\u2019 retirement plans by reducing workers\u2019 wages and  other benefits. Proposals that guarantee investment returns can protect  workers from market fluctuations and can ensure a minimum level of  benefits; however, significant costs to the government might result if the  guarantee were unsustainable.

NEST also permits  plan participants to take their retirement accounts with them throughout  their working life, which eliminates ongoing administration of those  accounts by former employers when a worker leaves a company.
