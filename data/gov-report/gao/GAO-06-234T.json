GAO has reported on inefficiencies and inadequate accountability across DOD's major business areas, resulting in billions of dollars of wasted resources annually. Of the 25 areas on GAO's 2005 list of high-risk federal programs and operations that are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse or mismanagement and in need of reform, 8 are DOD programs or operations, and 6 are government-wide high risk areas for which DOD shares responsibility. The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 required DOD to satisfy several conditions relative to its approach to managing its business system modernization program, including developing an enterprise transition plan, which GAO is currently assessing. DOD also recently established a Business Transformation Agency intended to advance defense-wide business transformation. GAO was asked to testify on DOD's business transformation, including its preliminary observations on 1) DOD's efforts to satisfy fiscal year 2005 defense authorization act requirements; 2) the Business Transformation Agency; and 3) DOD's efforts to provide the leadership, structures, and plans needed to effect transformation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's preliminary observation based on its ongoing work is that DOD has made progress in establishing needed business system modernization management capabilities and appears to have complied with some of the act's provisions, but more needs to be done. To comply with the act's requirement that it develop a business enterprise architecture and transition plan meeting certain requirements, DOD approved Version 3.0 of its architecture and associated transition plan on September 28, 2005. GAO's work so far suggests that this version of the architecture may satisfy the conditions of the act to some extent, but not entirely. For example, while Version 3.0 includes a target architecture, as required, it does not include a current architecture. Without this element, DOD could not analyze the gaps between the two architectures--critical input to a comprehensive transition plan. In addition, the transition plan appears to include certain required information (such as milestones for major projects), but it appears to be inconsistent with the architecture in various ways, such as including some systems that are not in the target architecture and vice versa, and it does not include system performance metrics aligned with the plan's strategic goals and objectives. Finally, GAO's preliminary work suggests that DOD may have satisfied some of the act's requirements regarding the review and approval of investments in business systems, but it either has not satisfied or is still in the process of satisfying others. For example, it has delegated authority and largely established review structures and processes as required. However, some of these structures do not yet appear to be in place, and some reviews and approvals to date may not have followed the criteria in the act. GAO expects to report on these issues shortly. DOD's Business Transformation Agency offers potential benefits relative to the department's business systems modernization efforts if the agency can be properly organized, resource, and empowered to effectively execute its roles and responsibilities and is held accountable for doing so. The agency faces several challenges, including standing up a functioning acquisition organization within a short period of time. As DOD moves forward with implementing this agency, it will be important for it to address these issues. DOD has taken several actions intended to advance transformation, such as establishing management structures like the Business Transformation Agency, and developing the enterprise transition plan. While these steps are positive, their primary focus appears to be on business system modernization. Business transformation is much broader and encompasses planning, management, structures, and processes related to all key business areas. As DOD continues to evolve its transformation efforts, critical to successful reform are sustained leadership, structures, and a clear strategic and integrated plan that encompass all major business areas. GAO believes a chief management official, responsible for business transformation, could provide the strong and sustained executive leadership needed in this area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss business  systems modernization and overall business transformation at the  Department of Defense (DOD)\u2014two areas that are on our high-risk  list of federal programs and activities that are at risk of waste, fraud,  abuse, or mismanagement and in need of broad-based  transformation.

While  DOD maintains military forces with significant capabilities, it  continues to confront pervasive, decades-old management problems  related to its business operations, including outdated and ineffective  systems and processes that support these forces. At a time when  DOD is challenged to maintain a high level of military operations  while competing for resources in an increasingly fiscally  constrained environment, DOD\u2019s business area weaknesses  continue to result in reduced efficiencies and effectiveness that  waste billions of dollars every year. Of the 25 areas on our 2005  high-risk list, 8 are DOD programs or operations and 6 are  governmentwide high-risk areas for which DOD shares some  responsibility. These areas touch on all of DOD\u2019s major business  operations.

At that time, the Secretary  established the Business Management Modernization Program, or  BMMP, to effect this change. Since then, we have reported a litany  of program weaknesses and made scores of recommendations. Our  latest reports on this program, which were issued about the same  time as this Subcommittee\u2019s last oversight hearing in April 2005 on  DOD business transformation and financial accountability, were  quite critical of the program, observing that after investing about 4  years and $318 million on the BMMP, the department had made very  little progress.", "To its credit, the Congress, and this Subcommittee in particular, has  become increasingly focused on improving DOD\u2019s business  operations by holding several oversight hearings, such as this one,  and enacting legislation.

OMB and DOD are working together to  develop a plan to improve supply chain management that could  place the department on the path toward removal of this area from  our high-risk list. For example, OMB and DOD are also consulting  GAO as they develop action plans for other high-risk areas as well as  a business architecture and related enterprise transition plan.

For more than a decade, we have promoted the use of  architectures to guide and constrain systems modernization,  recognizing them as a crucial means to a challenging goal: agency  operational structures that are optimally defined in both the  business and technological environments. The Congress has also  recognized the importance of an architecture-centric approach to  modernization: the E-Government Act of 2002, for example,  requires OMB to oversee the development of enterprise  architectures within and across agencies.", "In brief, an enterprise architecture provides a clear and  comprehensive picture of an entity, whether it is an organization  (e.g., a federal department) or a functional or mission area that cuts  across more than one organization (e.g., financial management).  This picture consists of snapshots of both the enterprise\u2019s current or  \u201cAs Is\u201d environment and its target or \u201cTo Be\u201d environment. These  snapshots consist of \u201cviews,\u201d which are one or more architecture  products (models, diagrams, matrices, text, etc.) that provide logical  or technical representations of the enterprise. The architecture also  includes a transition or sequencing plan, based on an analysis of the  gaps between the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments; this plan  provides a temporal roadmap for moving between the two that  incorporates such considerations as technology opportunities,  marketplace trends, fiscal and budgetary constraints, institutional  system development and acquisition capabilities, the dependencies  and life expectancies of both new and \u201clegacy\u201d (existing) systems,  and the projected value of competing investments. Our experience  with federal agencies has shown that investing in information  technology (IT) without defining these investments in the context of  an architecture often results in systems that are duplicative, not well  integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface.", "A corporate approach to IT investment management is also  characteristic of successful public and private organizations.  Recognizing this, the Congress developed and enacted the Clinger- Cohen Act in 1996, which requires OMB to establish processes to  analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results of major capital  investments in information systems made by executive agencies. In  response to the Clinger-Cohen Act and other statutes, OMB  developed policy for planning, budgeting, acquisition, and  management of federal capital assets and issued guidance. We have  also issued guidance in this area, in the form of a framework that  lays out a coherent collection of key practices that, when  implemented in a coordinated manner, can lead an agency through a  robust set of analyses and decision points that support effective IT  investment management. This framework defines institutional  structures, such as investment review boards, and associated  processes, such as common investment criteria. Further, our  investment management framework recognizes the importance of  an enterprise architecture as a critical frame of reference for  organizations making IT investment decisions: specifically, it states  that only investments that move the organization toward its target  architecture, as defined by its sequencing plan, should be approved  (unless a waiver is provided or a decision is made to modify the  architecture). Moreover, it states that an organization\u2019s policies and  procedures should describe the relationship between its  architecture and its investment decision-making authority. Our  experience has shown that mature and effective management of IT  investments can vastly improve government performance and  accountability, and can help to avoid wasteful IT spending and lost  opportunities for improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Reviews of DOD\u2019s Business System Modernization Efforts Have Raised Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, we have regularly reported on DOD\u2019s efforts to (among  other things) develop an architecture and to establish and  implement effective investment management structures and  processes.

To do so, this version focused on six  Business Enterprise Priorities (see table 1), which DOD states are  short-term objectives to achieve immediate results. According to the  department, these priorities will evolve and expand in future  versions of the architecture.", "In addition to focusing version 3.0 on these priorities, according to  DOD, the department also limited the extent to which the  architecture was to address each priority, focusing on four  questions:  \u25cf  Who are our people, what are their skills, and where are they  located?  \u25cf  Who are our industry partners, and what is the state of our  relationship with them?  \u25cf  What assets are we providing to support the warfighter, and where  are these assets deployed?  \u25cf  How are we investing our funds to best enable the warfighting  mission?", "To produce a version of the architecture within the above scope,  DOD created 12 of the 23 recommended products included in the  DOD Architecture Framework\u2014the structural guide that the  department has established for developing an architecture. These  12 products included all 7 products that the framework designates  as essential. For example, one essential product is the Operational  Node Connectivity Description, which is a graphic showing  \u201coperational nodes\u201d (organizations) and including a depiction of  each node\u2019s information exchange needs.", "Our preliminary work suggests that Version 3.0 of DOD\u2019s business  enterprise architecture may partially satisfy the major conditions  specified in the act. For example, Version 3.0 could enable DOD\u2019s  compliance with many but not all federal accounting, financial  management, and reporting requirements. To this end, the  architecture includes the Standard Financial Information Structure  (SFIS) and the Standard Accounting Classification Structure  (SACS), which together could allow DOD to standardize financial  data elements necessary to support budgeting, accounting,  cost/performance management, and external reporting. Both SFIS  and SACS are based upon mandated requirements defined by  external regulatory entities, such as the Treasury, OMB, the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board, and the Joint Financial  Management Improvement Program. Moreover, SFIS has in tur been used to develop and incorporate business rules in the  architecture for such areas as managerial cost accounting, general  ledger, and federally owned property. Business rules are important  because they explicitly translate important business policies and  procedures into specific and unambiguous rules that govern what  can and cannot be done.", "However, it is not apparent that the architecture provides for  compliance with all federal accounting, financial, and reporting  requirements. For example, it may not contain the information  needed to achieve compliance with the Treasury\u2019s United States Standard General Ledger or a strategy for achieving this  compliance.", "As another example, Version 3.0 may partially enable DOD to  produce timely, accurate, and reliable financial information for  management purposes. Specifically, according to the architecture,  financial information is to be produced through (1) SFIS, which can support data accuracy, reliability, and integrity requirements for  budgeting, financial accounting, cost and performance manageme and external reporting across DOD, and (2) a \u201cManage Business  Enterprise Reporting\u201d system function, which is intended to supp the reporting of financial management and program performance  information, including agency financial statements.", "However, timely, accurate and reliable information depends, in part,  on using standard definitions of key terms, which the architecture  does not appear to include in all cases. For example, in Version 3.0  of the architecture, terms such as \u201cbalance forwarded\u201d and \u201creceipt  balances\u201d were not defined in the integrated dictionary although  these terms were used in process descriptions. In the absence of  standardized definitions, components (military services, defense  agencies, and field activities) may use terms and definitions that are  locally meaningful but which cannot be reliably and accurately  aggregated to permit DOD-wide visibility, which is critical to  achieving DOD\u2019s stated business enterprise priorities. This inability  to aggregate has historically required DOD to create information for  management purposes using inefficient methods, such as data calls  and data conversions, that have limited the information\u2019s reliability  and timeliness.", "Our preliminary work also suggests that Version 3.0 may partially  satisfy the act\u2019s requirement that it be consistent with OMB policie and procedures. For example, Version 3.0 appears to include  information flows and relationships, as required by OMB guid ance.  OMB guidance also requires the architecture to describe the \u201cAs Is\u201d  and \u201cTo Be\u201d environments and a transition plan; however, Version  3.0 does not include an \u201cAs Is\u201d environment. Without this element,  DOD would not be able to develop a gap analysis identifying  performance shortfalls, which as discussed in the next section , is a  critical input to a comprehensive transition plan. In addition, OMB  guidance requires that the architecture include, among other things a description of the technology infrastructure; such a description is  not apparent in Version 3.0, in that it does not identify such needed  technology components as wide-area networks, databases, and  telecommunications. Similarly, Version 3.0 does not appear to  include a security architecture, although OMB guidance require agencies to incorporate security into the architecture of their  information and systems to ensure the security of agency busin operations.", "Version 3.0 may also contain other limitations. For example, it may  not yet be fully integrated with the enterprise transition plan. In  particular, we are currently attempting to determine why 21 syste identified in the architecture are not included in the \u201cMaster List of  Systems and Initiatives\u201d in the transition plan (the master list serves as the baseline of currently planned\u2014\u201dTo Be\u201d\u2014systems that begin  to address the transformational objectives of the program). In  addition, DOD has itself disclosed certain limitations. For example,  ms  it reported that the architecture is not adequately linked to the  component architectures and transition plans. This omission is particularly important given the department\u2019s newly adopted  federated approach to developing and implementing the  architecture. In addition, according to DOD, the architect ure must  be improved to better designate enterprise data sources, business  services, and IT infrastructure services, such as enterprise data  storage. This is important because each of these greatly affects t scope and design of specific systems.", "According to DOD officials, the department is taking an incremental  approach to developing the architecture and meeting the act\u2019s  requirements. Accordingly, they said that Version 3.0 was  appropriately scoped to provide for that content which cou produced in the time available to both lay the foundation for fullymeeting the act\u2019s requirements and provide a blueprint for deliveri near-term capabilities and systems to meet near-term business  enterprise priorities. Based on these considerations, they assert that Version 3.0 fully satisfies the intent of the act.", "We support DOD\u2019s taking an incremental approach to developing  the business enterprise architecture, as we recognize that adopting such an approach is both a best practice and a prior GAO  ts that  recommendation.

Further, it includes detailed information on about 60 business systems (ongoing  programs) that are to be part of the \u201cTo Be\u201d architectural  environment, as well as an acquisition strategy for each system.  However, the plan does not appear to be based on a top-down capability gap analysis between the \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cTo Be\u201d s  architectures that describes capability and performance shortfall and clearly identifies which system investments (such as the 60 identified programs) are to address these shortfalls. This important because a transition plan is to be an acquisition strategy  that recognizes timing and technological dependencies among  planned systems investments, as well as such other consider as market trends and return on investment.", "Similarly, our preliminary work suggests that the plan identifies  some of the legacy systems that are to be replaced by ongoing  programs (for example, it identifies the Defense Cash Accountability  System as a target system and lists several legacy systems that it  would replace), and it provides a list of legacy systems that will be  modified to provide capabilities associated with the target  architecture environment. However, the plan\u2019s listings of legacy  systems that will and will not be part of the target architecture do  not appear to be complete. For example, the plan identified 145  legacy systems that would be migrating to one target system (the  Expeditionary Combat Support System), but other DOD  documentation shows that this target system includes over 659  legacy systems, suggesting that 514 systems may not be accounted for.", "Finally, the plan appears to include some of the required  information on milestones, performance metrics, and resource  needs. The plan includes key milestone dates for the 60  systems/programs identified (such as the Defense Travel System),  but it does not show specific dates for terminating or migrating  many legacy systems (such as the Cash Reconciliation System), and  it does not include milestone dates for some ongoing programs  (such as the Navy Tactical Command Support System). Similarly,  although the plan includes performance metrics for some systems,  it does not include for each system measures and metrics, focused  on benefits or mission outcomes that can be linked to the plan\u2019s  strategic goals. In addition, according to program officials, the  resource needs in the transition plan for some programs are not  current, as these needs are reflective of the fiscal year 2006 budget,  which was developed before a recent reevaluation of how these  programs will fit into the \u201cTo Be\u201d environment.", "Our preliminary work also suggests that in addition to the  limitations just described, the plan may be missi and be inconsistent with the architecture in various ways.

This situation arose because  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget submission was submitted in  February 2005, when the department did not yet have a single  inventory of all of its business systems.  As a result, DOD offi could not guarantee that all business systems were included in submission. Currently, the department is updating its single  database for its inventory of business systems, as we had  recommended, which is scheduled to be completed by Sept 30, 2006. Finally, DOD officials stated that the fiscal year 2 budget submission will be derived from a separate DOD  authoritative IT budget database.", "There may be additional areas of u completeness of DOD\u2019s IT budget submission. One source of  uncertainty is inconsistencies in the way that DOD classifiessystems: as business systems or as national security systems.example, as we previously reported, DOD reclassified 56 sys its fiscal year 2005 budget request from business systems to nationa security systems, resulting in a decrease of approximately $6 billion  in the fiscal year 2005 budget request for business systems and  related infrastructure. Similarly, in the fiscal year 2006 submission,  13 systems previously classified as business systems were  reclassified as national security systems, and 10 systems previously  classified as national security systems were reclassified as  business  systems. We understand that DOD is currently reviewing its  reclassifications.", "Our preliminary w that budget requests for all business systems identify the type of  funding\u2014by appropriation\u2014being requested and whether the  funding was for current services or modernization. In the fiscal ye 2006 budget submission, systems identified are categorized by  type of funding (appropriation) being requested and whether the  ork also indicates that DOD may not have ensured  the  funding is for current services or modernization; however, not all  systems may be identifiable. In particular, it is not clear what is  covered by one funding type or category referred to as \u201cAll Other.\u201d For fiscal year 2006, this category totaled about $1.2 billion and  included, for example, about $22.6 million specifically for financial  management. According to DOD officials, budget includes system projects that do not have to be identified by this category in the IT name because they fall below the $2 million reporting threshold fo r  budgetary purposes.", "Finally, our preliminar IT budget submission identifies the designated approval authority  for most systems, but not all. In particular, the approval authorities  for 57 systems in the submission were not apparent. For example,  the Navy\u2019s C2 On-the-Move Network Digital Over-the-Horizon Relay  system and the Defense Commissary Agency\u2019s Enterprise Business  System have a designated approval authority of \u201cOther.\u201d   y work indicates that DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006  Full compliance with the act\u2019s conditions relative to budge disclosure is an important enabler of informed budgetary decision  making and oversight. Without such disclosure, whether incorre ct  system classification, or mere oversights, the department\u2019s efforts t improve its control and accountability over its business systems  investments are hindered, and the department and the Congress are  constrained in their ability to effectively monitor and oversee the billions of dollars spent annually to maintain, operate, and  modernize DOD\u2019s business systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Review and Appr", "paragraphs": ["GAO-04-615. \u25cf  Delegate the authority and accountability for defense business  systems to designated approval authorities within the Office of  the Secretary of Defense.  \u25cf  By March 15, 2005, require each approval authority to establish  an investment review process to review the planning, design,  acquisition, development, deployment, operation, maintenance,  modernization, and project cost benefits and risks of all defense  business systems for which the approval authority is responsible.  \u25cf  Effective October 1, 2005, obligate funds for a defense business  system modernization project with total cost exceeding  $1 million after the approval authority designated for that system  certifies to the Defense Business Systems Management  Committee (DBMSC) that the system project meets specific  conditions that are called for in the act, and the certification by  the approval authority is approved by the DBSMC.", "On the basis of our preliminary work, it appears that DOD has  satisfied some aspects of these conditions, and is potentially in the  process of satisfying other aspects. First, on March 19, 2005, the  Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum that  delegated the authority for the review, approval, and oversight of  planning, design, acquisition, deployment, operation, maintenance,  and modernization of the department\u2019s business systems.  Designation of these approval authorities is consistent with the act.  Further, our research and evaluations, as reflected in the guidance  that we have issued, shows that clear assignment of senior  executive investment management responsibilities and  accountabilities are key aspects of having an effective institutional  approach to IT investment management.", "Second, DOD has established investment review structures and  processes, including a hierarchy of investment review boards with  representation from across the department, as well as a standard set  of investment review and decision-making criteria for these boards  to use to ensure compliance and consistency with the business  enterprise architecture. Further, the DBSMC was chartered in  February 2005 as the highest ranking system modernization  governance body, as required by the act. Further, DOD has  designated the chair and membership of the boards consistent with  the act, and all but one of designated approval authorities have  established investment review boards for their areas of  responsibility, which the act requires each to do. The one approval  authority that does not appear to have established a review process  is the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information  Integration)/Chief Information Officer.", "To support its investment review structures, DOD has also  established investment review processes that include, among other  things, the use of business enterprise architecture compliance  procedures, common decision criteria, threshold criteria to ensure  appropriate levels of review and accountability. Notwithstanding  these investment review structures and processes, it remains  uncertain to what extent DOD components have established similar  investment review bodies and will adopt common investment  review and decision-making processes. DOD components are  expected to establish their own structures and processes. Under the  department\u2019s concept of \u201ctiered accountability,\u201d significant  responsibility and accountability for business system investments is  to reside with the military services and defense agencies. The extent  to which the components establish and consistently implement  common investment management structures and processes is  important, because doing so is a best practice. Without such  structures and processes, investment decisions could potentially  perpetuate the existence of overly complex, error-prone,  nonintegrated system environments and limit introduction of  corporate solutions to long-standing business problems.", "Finally, our preliminary work indicates that the department is in the  process of ensuring that defense business system modernizations  costing greater than $1 million are certified and approved in  accordance with the act. Specifically, the department has identified  210 systems with costs greater than $1 million, thus requiring  certification and approval. Of these 210, DOD reports that 166 were  certified and approved in accordance with the act before September  30, 2005. This means that 44 were not, and according to the act, the  department cannot make further obligations for any of these other  than with funding left over from previous fiscal years, until they are  certified and approved.", "One potential issue with regard to the department\u2019s system  certification and approval efforts to date is whether it has identified  all business system modernizations with costs greater than $1  million. Doing this requires, among other things, proper  classification of systems as national security systems or as business  systems. If a business system is improperly classified, it may not be  reviewed, certified, and approved in accordance with the act. As  stated earlier, questions persist regarding whether the department  has properly classified all business systems as such.", "Another potential issue is whether DOD has followed the act\u2019s  criteria for DBSMC review and approval in all of the aforementioned  166 systems. Specifically, it appears that the DBSMC approved the  certification of at least six business systems in August 2005 that had  been previously reviewed in accordance with earlier criteria;  however, the current criteria under the act do not provide for the  DBSMC to approve a certification based upon such previous  certification. According to DOD officials, these six systems will go  through the current review process no later than February 2006. In  addition to these six, DOD officials told us that several other  systems investments, which were certified and approved on the  grounds that they were mission essential, will also be resubmitted  for DBSMC approval."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Business Transformation Agency Could Help Strengthen Systems Modernization Management and Oversight if it is Effectively Implemented", "paragraphs": ["On October 7, 2005, DOD established the Business Transformation  Agency (BTA) to advance defense-wide business transformation  efforts in general but particularly with regard to business systems  modernization.

In addition, the BTA is  to be responsible for integrating and supporting the work of the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) principal staff assistants,  who include the approval authorities that chair the business system  investment review boards.", "In our view, BTA offers potential benefits relative to the  department\u2019s business systems modernization efforts, if the agency  can be properly organized, resourced, and empowered to effectively  execute its roles and responsibilities, and if it is held accountable  for doing so. In this regard, the agency faces a number of challenges  as described below.", "According to DOD, this agency is expected to have a functioning  acquisition organization by November 21, 2005. While such a  timeline is daunting in and of itself, it is particularly challenging  given that DOD is estimating up to 12 months to establish a  permanent director. Moreover, there are numerous key acquisition  functions that would need to established and made operational to  effectively assume 28 DOD-wide projects, programs, systems, and  initiatives, and our experience across the government shows that  these functions can take considerable time to establish.", "Among other things, the agency is to be responsible for ensuring  consistency and continuity across the department\u2019s core business  missions with respect to, for example, business process re- engineering and related business system matters. While the agency  should be able to accomplish this relative to the DOD-wide efforts  that it can control, it does not appear to have the requisite authority  to carry out this responsibility relative to DOD component system  investments, which it does not have investment control over. At  best, the agency will be able to support the DBMSC in its efforts to  ensure such consistency and continuity.", "As currently structured, the agency does not include support to an  OSD principal staff assistant and approval authority\u2014the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Networks Integration and Infrastructure,  who is responsible for DOD information technology infrastructure,  such as wide-area networks, local-area networks,  telecommunications, and security services. In addition, the agency\u2019s  relationship to the Defense Information Systems Agency, which is  also responsible for certain DOD-wide system capabilities and  services, is not specified.

Over the last 3 years, GAO has made several  recommendations that if implemented successfully could help DOD  move forward in establishing the means to successfully address the  challenges it faces in transforming its business operations. For  example, as the Comptroller General testified before this  subcommittee earlier this year, DOD needs a full-time CMO position,  created through legislation, with responsibility and authority for  DOD\u2019s overall business transformation efforts. The CMO must be a  person with significant authority and experience who would report  directly to the Secretary of Defense. Given the nature and  complexity of the overall business transformation effort, and the  need for sustained attention over a significant period of time, this  position should be a term appointment and the person should be  subject to a performance contract.", "The Secretary of Defense, Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense, and  other senior leaders have clearly shown commitment to business  transformation and addressing deficiencies in the Department\u2019s  business operations. As I discussed earlier, DOD has taken several  actions, including setting up the DBSMC, publishing a business  enterprise transition plan and most recently, establishing the  Business Transformation Agency. Moreover, DOD is examining  various aspects of its business operations as part of the ongoing  Quadrennial Defense Review. While these management structures  and plan are positive steps, their primary focus, at this point,  appears to be on business systems modernization. Clearly,  maintaining effective and modern business systems is a key enabler  to transformation. However, business transformation is much  broader and encompasses not only the supporting systems, but also  the planning, management, organizational structures, and processes  related to all DOD\u2019s major business areas. Such areas include  support infrastructure management, human capital management,  financial management, weapon systems acquisition, contract  management, planning and budgeting, and supply chain  management. Recognizing that DOD is continuing to evolve its  efforts to plan and organize itself to achieve business  transformation, critical to the success of these efforts will be  management attention and structures that focus on transformation  from a broad perspective and a clear strategic and integrated plan  that, at a summary level, addresses all of the department\u2019s major  business areas. This strategic plan should contain results-oriented  performance measures that link institutional, unit, and individual  goals, measures and expectations, and would be instrumental in  establishing investment priorities and guiding the department\u2019s  resource decisions.", "Finally, the lynchpin to ensure successful business transformation is  the presence of strong and sustained executive leadership with  appropriate responsibility, authority, and accountability. The central  authority we had envisioned to allow for strong and sustained  executive leadership over DOD\u2019s business management reform  efforts is a full-time, executive-level II position for a CMO, who  would serve as the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Management.  This position would divide and institutionalize the functions of the  Deputy Secretary of Defense by creating a separate Deputy  Secretary of Defense for Management. As we envision it, the CMO  would feature a term of office that spans administrations, which  would serve to underscore the importance of taking a professional,  nonpartisan, institutional, and sustainable approach to the overall  business transformation effort. As I understand it, DOD\u2019s position is  that the Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense, who also serves as the  chair of the DBSMC, has the requisite position, authority, and  purview to perform the functions of a CMO. Under the Acting  Deputy\u2019s leadership, DOD expects to be able to demonstrate  progress towards achieving business reform. Comptroller General  Walker continues to believe a CMO is necessary to provide the  sustained leadership needed to achieve true business  transformation. In light of DOD\u2019s position, we would encourage the  Subcommittee to require DOD to periodically report on its efforts,  including describing the specific goals and measures against which  it is measuring its progress in achieving business reform.   - - - - -  In closing, the department as made important progress in the last 6  months in establishing the kind of business systems modernization  management capabilities that our research and evaluations show are  essential to a successful modernization program\u2014namely, an  architecture, a transition plan, and system investment decision- making structures and processes. But more needs to be done to  complete each of these areas, and most importantly, to ensure that  they are reflected in how each and every business system  investment is managed. While the new business transformation  agency can help get this done, much remains to be accomplished  before this agency is functioning as intended. Beyond systems  modernization, overall business transformation remains a major  challenge. The creation of a CMO position, and the development of a  strategic transformation plan to integrate and guide the  department\u2019s people, process, and technology change initiatives,  would go a long way in helping the department meet this challenge.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared statement.
