In fiscal year 2003, TSA spent 81 percent of its $21 million transportation security R&D budget for aviation projects, and DHS spent about half of its $26 million for projects related to more than one mode of transportation. In fiscal year 2004, TSA continued to budget most of its $159 million for aviation, and DHS also budgeted most of its $88 million for aviation. According to the National Research Council, federal R&D programs should include some basic research, but TSA and DHS do not appear to be funding any basic research for transportation security. TSA and DHS have not estimated deployment dates for the vast majority of their R&D projects. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also funded some transportation security R&D projects. Several members of an expert panel on transportation security and technology that GAO convened believed the distribution of R&D projects by transportation mode was reasonable, while others believed that aviation has been overemphasized at the expense of maritime and land modes. TSA and DHS have made some progress in managing their transportation security R&D programs according to applicable laws and R&D best practices, but neither agency has fully complied with the laws or implemented the best practices. For example, neither agency has prepared a strategic plan for R&D that contains measurable objectives. In addition, although TSA has completed threat assessments for all modes, it has not completed vulnerability and criticality assessments. DHS also has not completed risk assessments of the infrastructure sectors. Furthermore, both TSA and DHS lack complete, consolidated data for managing their R&D projects.

The Homeland Security Act of 2002, passed a year later, established DHS;  transferred TSA and many other federal agencies to DHS; and made DHS  responsible for homeland security, including transportation security. The  act specified, however, that TSA would remain a distinct entity within DHS  until November 25, 2004.

For this review, we  considered transportation security R&D to encompass the research,  development, testing, and evaluation of technologies to protect the nation\u2019s  transportation system from terrorist attacks or major crimes. The  transportation system consists largely of (1) infrastructure, such as  airports, seaports, border crossings, rail stations, transit stations,  highways, bridges, tunnels, and pipelines, and (2) vehicles, such as aircraft,  ships, ferry boats, trucks, buses, automobiles, and trains. We refer to the  key modes of transportation as aviation, highways, maritime, pipeline, rail  (passenger and freight), and transit (buses and subways). Because TSA and  DHS each has its own R&D portfolio, we discuss the two agencies\u2019  transportation security-related R&D programs separately in this report.

After the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress enacted legislation that  resulted in changes in the federal organization and funding for  transportation security R&D. In November 2001, the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act created TSA within DOT and transferred the  Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) aviation security R&D program to  TSA. The act also required TSA to meet a December 31, 2002, deadline for  deploying explosives detection systems to screen all checked baggage. One  year later, the Homeland Security Act created DHS and transferred TSA  from DOT to DHS. This legislation also transferred to DHS several other  agencies that conducted transportation security R&D, including the U.S.  Customs Service (now part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection) and the  U.S. Secret Service from the Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Coast  Guard from DOT. In addition, the Homeland Security Act extended the  deadline for deploying new checked baggage screening equipment for  certain airports to December 31, 2003, and transferred certain chemical and  biological research programs that have potential transportation security  applications from the Department of Defense and DOE to DHS.

Although TSA is responsible for addressing the security needs of  all modes of transportation, in fiscal year 2003, TSA spent about $17  million, or about 81 percent, of its R&D funding for projects related to  aviation security. For fiscal year 2004, TSA has budgeted about $126 million  on aviation security, or about 79 percent of its R&D budget. This increase  reflects, in part, a $55 million appropriation for R&D related to air cargo  screening. According to TSA, it has spent the majority of its R&D funding  on aviation security because aviation was the greatest concern following  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and because Congress directed  TSA to use R&D funding to enhance aviation security. In fiscal year 2004,  TSA increased its budget for multimodal R&D projects from about $4  million in fiscal year 2003 to about $22 million. This increase is due, in part,  to a $5.6 million increase for the Manhattan II project and about $6.4  million for development of a walk-through trace portal for detecting  explosives on aviation, maritime, and rail passengers. In fiscal year 2004,  TSA also increased its budget for rail security R&D projects from $169,000  in fiscal year 2003 to about $1.1 million. This increase reflects the $1.1  million that was budgeted for the Transit and Rail Inspection Pilot (TRIP).TSA also increased maritime security R&D funding from zero in fiscal year  2003 to about $9 million in fiscal year 2004; this increase is due, in part, to  $3.6 million for a project to develop equipment to screen vehicles on  ferries. Finally, TSA did not spend any money for highway, pipeline, or  transit R&D projects. Several members of our panel of transportation  security and technology experts commented that R&D for rail and transit  security warrants additional funding. Congress is considering legislation to  increase funding for these as well as other modes of transportation in fiscal  year 2005. For example, the Rail Security Act, S. 2273, which has been  passed by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, would authorize $50 million in each of fiscal years 2005 and  2006 for an R&D program for improving freight and intercity passenger rail  security. computed tomography explosives detection system that is smaller and  lighter than systems currently deployed in airport lobbies. The new  system is intended to replace the systems currently placed in airport  lobbies, including both larger, heavier explosives detection systems and  explosives trace detection equipment. The smaller size of the system  creates opportunities for TSA to transfer screening operations to other  locations, such as airport check-in counters. TSA expects to certify this  equipment later this year. TSA is also working with a contractor to  integrate technologies, such as quadrupole resonance, with its  existing explosives detection systems to improve processing speed and  detection capability and to reduce false alarm rates and human  resource requirements.", "Aviation Checkpoint: To address the limitations of its current metal  detectors for screening passengers and of X-ray machines for screening  carry-on baggage, TSA, in fiscal year 2003, obligated about $1 million  and has budgeted $18 million for fiscal year 2004. For example, during  the summer of 2004, TSA installed and began testing explosives trace  detection portals at four airports and had scheduled to test the portal at  a fifth airport in the near future. Passengers who enter a checkpoint lane  with a trace portal machine will proceed through the metal detector  while their carry-on baggage is being screened by X-ray. Each passenger  will then be asked to step into the trace portal and to stand still for a few  seconds while several quick puffs of air are released, as shown in figure  2. The portal will analyze the air for traces of explosives as the  passenger walks through, and a computerized voice will tell the  passenger when to exit the portal.", "To help focus its screening resources on the highest risk passengers, in  fiscal years 2003 and 2004, TSA worked to develop the Computer  Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II). CAPPS II is  intended to identify terrorists and other high-risk individuals before  they board commercial airplanes. Originally, TSA intended to conduct a  risk assessment of each passenger using national security information,  commercial databases, and information provided by the passenger  during the reservation process\u2014specifically, the passenger\u2019s name,  date of birth, home address, and home telephone number. In our  February 2004 report on CAPPS II, we found that TSA was behind  schedule in testing and developing initial increments of CAPPS II and  had not yet completely addressed other issues, including concerns  about privacy and the accuracy of the data used for CAPPS II. In  August 2004, a DHS official said that DHS was revising the program  with an emphasis on fully protecting passengers\u2019 privacy and civil  liberties.", "Aviation Cargo: To enhance the security of the nation\u2019s air cargo  system, TSA obligated about $700,000 in fiscal year 2003 for cargo  security R&D and has budgeted about $53 million for fiscal year 2004.  For example, as part of its Air Cargo Strategic Plan, TSA plans to  develop a prescreening system to identify high-risk cargo and to work  with the appropriate stakeholders to ensure that all such cargo is  inspected. To complete its inspection of high-risk cargo, TSA has a  number of R&D projects, one of which is a project budgeted at $19.5  million for fiscal year 2004 to research and develop equipment for the  detection of threats in containerized air cargo and mail. Under this  project, TSA is considering funding several technologies, including high\u00ad power computed tomography and X-ray combined with pulsed fast  neutron analysis.", "In its July 2004 report, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon  the United States expressed concerns about checked baggage, checkpoint,  and cargo security.The commission recommended that TSA and  Congress give priority attention to improving the ability of screening  checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers. The commission also  stated that TSA should (1) expedite the installation of advanced in-line  baggage screening equipment; (2) require that every passenger aircraft  carrying cargo deploy at least one hardened container to carry any suspect  cargo; and (3) intensify its efforts to identify, track, and appropriately  screen potentially dangerous cargo in both aviation and maritime modes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Maritime and Land Security R&D Projects Funded by TSA", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its R&D projects to enhance aviation security, in fiscal years  2003 and 2004, TSA spent or budgeted R&D funds for projects to improve  security for maritime and land transportation, including the following:", "The Transit and Rail Inspection Pilot will assess the feasibility of using  emerging technologies to screen passengers and their checked baggage  and carry-on items for explosives at rail stations and aboard trains.

In light of this information from TSA, we did not change our  recommendation.", "Recommendation: TSA and DHS should (1) complete strategic plans  containing measurable objectives for TSA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s transportation  security R&D programs and (2) complete risk assessments for all  modes of transportation, and use the results of the risk assessments to  help select and prioritize R&D projects. DHS said that in 2004, it  finalized its strategic plan, which defined missions and goals for all of  the agencies under it, including TSA. DHS also said that the strategic  plan being developed by TSA\u2019s Office of Security Technology would  include measurable goals and milestones for R&D projects. However,  DHS\u2019s strategic plan does not specifically address transportation  security R&D and neither TSA nor DHS has completed an R&D strategic  plan containing measurable objectives. Therefore, we did not revise this  recommendation.", "Recommendation: TSA and DHS should develop a database that will  provide accurate, complete, current, and readily accessible project  information for monitoring and managing their R&D portfolios. DHS  said that TSA had developed a system to track R&D projects\u2019 goals and  milestones, acquisition, funding, testing, and deployment information.  While such a project tracking system could address our  recommendation, TSA struggled as recently as of August 2004 to provide  us with basic information on many of its R&D projects and, in the end,  was unable to do so for a significant number. Therefore, we retained this  recommendation.", "Recommendation: TSA should develop a process with DOT to  coordinate transportation security R&D, such as a memorandum of  agreement identifying roles and responsibilities, and share this  information with transportation stakeholders. DHS said that TSA is  already working with DOT to avoid duplicative R&D efforts. In addition,  DHS said that TSA would assess the benefits associated with a  memorandum of agreement with DOT to determine whether one should  be initiated. We continue to believe that a memorandum of agreement  between TSA and DHS is the proper vehicle for coordinating R&D\u2014not  only to avoid duplication, but also to leverage resources and identify  unmet needs. Furthermore, DOT concurred with our finding that there  is room for significant improvement in coordination between DOT and  TSA and between DOT and DHS. DOT also agreed with our  recommendation that a memorandum of agreement with DHS is the  appropriate vehicle for improving the coordination of transportation  security R&D.", "Recommendation: TSA and DHS should develop a vehicle to  communicate with the transportation industry to ensure that their  R&D needs have been identified and considered. DHS said that TSA  does and will continue to communicate with the transportation industry.  Although DHS noted some actions that TSA is taking to reach out to the  transportation industry, as we reported, most transportation industry  officials we interviewed said that TSA and DHS had not reached out to  them to obtain information about their transportation security R&D  needs. Therefore, we did not change this recommendation.", "DHS, this conclusion is contradicted by evidence contained in our report,  namely, that the report underscores the difficulties of integrating multiple  new agencies missions, resources, and approaches. However, we believe  that the report\u2019s evidence of incomplete strategic planning and risk  assessment, inadequate information management, and insufficient  coordination supports the conclusion. Given that DHS generally concurred  with all of the recommendations, which address these issues, and said they  were key to a successful R&D program, we believe that implementing them  will strengthen TSA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s ability to provide Congress with  reasonable assurance that the hundreds of millions of dollars that are being  invested in transportation security R&D are being invested cost-effectively  to address the highest priority transportation security risks.", "In its comments on the draft report, DOT said that its efforts to coordinate  research planning with DHS and TSA support our finding that there is room  for significant improvement. According to DOT, it offers substantial  transportation expertise that could provide critical input for identifying and  prioritizing the transportation security R&D agenda. DOT also said that it is  anxious to work with DHS and TSA to create a mutually beneficial working  environment that taps its transportation experience and expertise while the  department benefits from DHS\u2019s security expertise. DOT believes that  through effective interagency coordination, it could work with DHS and  TSA to ensure that important research needs are met in areas such as  critical transportation infrastructure protection, as well as in responding  to, and recovering from, a terrorist attack on the transportation system.  Finally, DOT said that coordinating R&D activities represents an area that  could benefit by being included in an annex to an overall memorandum of  agreement between DOT and DHS such as we recommended. DOT said it  fully supports the completion of a comprehensive memorandum of  agreement with DHS and is working to bring one to fruition. available to others upon request.

There are many types of microsensors, some of which have the potential  to detect explosives. In fiscal year 2003, TSA funded R&D at two  national laboratories and NASA on several different types of  microsensors. A TSA official said that several universities are currently  doing work on other types of microsensors that have potential to meet  TSA\u2019s needs, but that TSA did not fund any of this work in 2004.", "Automated detection algorithms are computer software that processes  data obtained by detection systems and automatically indicates the  presence of an explosive or weapon. Although TSA has funded the  development of such software for its currently deployed computed  tomography explosives detection systems, it has not yet funded the  development of such software to process images produced by emerging  detection technologies, such as X-ray backscatter and millimeter wave.A TSA official believes that incorporating automated detection  algorithms could substantially reduce the operational cost of future  detection systems by reducing the need for screeners.
