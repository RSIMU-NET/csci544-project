In addition, there was concern among Interior officials about the department's ability to leverage limited resources for security. Since September 11, 2001, Interior has improved security at high-profile sites, created a central security office to oversee its security efforts, developed physical security plans required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, and developed a uniform risk management and ranking methodology. As Interior moves forward, linking the results of its risk rankings to security funding priorities at national icons and monuments is an important next step. Also, given Interior's complex and often contentious environment, setting forth the guiding principles by which the department balances its core mission with security could have benefits. Other organizations have used guiding principles to foster greater transparency in complex environments. GSA also faces a range of major challenges, some similar to Interior's, that include balancing security and public access, addressing jurisdictional and competing stakeholder issues, securing federally leased space, and adjusting to the transfer of the Federal Protective Service (FPS) from GSA to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Actions GSA has taken to address the challenges include working to develop security standards for securing leased space and establishing a memorandum of agreement with DHS on security at GSA's facilities. However, despite these actions, GSA lacks a mechanism--such as a chief security officer position or formal point of contact--that could serve in a liaison role with FPS and tenant agencies, work to address the challenges GSA faces related to security at its buildings, and enable GSA to better define its overall role in security given the transfer of FPS to DHS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.

These assessments identified a  number of steps that needed to be taken before visitors could be allowed  back into the Statue. In addition, the primary threats included aerial attacks  and explosives detonated inside the structure.", "In August 2004, the Park Service reopened the Statue to visitors with  access restricted to the top of the pedestal and the exterior observation  deck. The security improvements were primarily aimed at preventing  would-be terrorists from gaining access to the interior of the Statue and its  grounds. Under this revised plan, visitors are able to tour the Statue of  Liberty Museum, see close-up views of the statue from the promenade,  view the inside structural elements of the statue, and experience a 360- degree panoramic view of New York Harbor from the observation deck. In  addition, the Park Service and Park Police implemented other  improvements, including more rigorous visitor screening, better explosive  detection capabilities, improved fire safety, and enhanced communications.  Park Service officials also noted that new barriers were installed at the  Ellis Island service bridge and that Park Service and Park Police staffing  has been increased since September 11 to implement the improved security  plan. The Park Service reported in mid-2004 that, to make these  improvements, it had invested $19.6 million and was anticipating an  additional $9 million in future spending.

A major  reason for limiting access to the Statue was the need to adhere to building  codes related to fire safety. For example, the Statue did not meet standards  for exits and fire suppression capability. However, Interior and Park  Service officials were also concerned with the security vulnerabilities of  the Statue and the fact that knowledge of these vulnerabilities could make  the Statue an even more attractive target.

Complicating oversight, the Park Service owns the land that  covers the three blocks known as Independence Mall, and the city of  Philadelphia owns the Independence Hall building and the Liberty Bell. The  city and the Park Service operate under a cooperative agreement for the  management and operation of Independence Mall. Also, the focus on  security in this area of Philadelphia is further heightened because of the  presence of other federal assets. Within a few block radius of INHP are  multiple federal buildings, including the U.S. Mint, the Federal Reserve  Bank of Philadelphia, and a federal courthouse that houses the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.", "Park Service officials reported that prior to September 11, INHP managed  its law enforcement and security operation consistently with the majority  of urban parks across the nation. After the Oklahoma City bombing, a blast  assessment focused primarily on Independence Hall was conducted and  influenced the design of the new Liberty Bell Center. Aside from this  assessment, no comprehensive risk assessment had been completed that  addressed overall threat potential. Following September 11, the Park  Service decided to keep the park open but added staff patrols from parks  around the country to support INHP staff for approximately 6 to 9 months.  A perimeter consisting of temporary fencing and concrete jersey barriers  was also placed around the two city blocks containing the Liberty Bell and  Independence Hall and, with the approval of city officials, Chestnut Street  was closed on December 12, 2001. With these security improvements, staff  coverage was roughly doubled, but the Park Service had to have rangers  work overtime to allow for 24-hour coverage. The Park Service also  implemented security measures that included the use of magnetometers  and individual hand searches conducted at Liberty Bell Center and  Independence Hall.", "After September 11, the Park Service also contracted with a private firm to  conduct a threat assessment, which used a pre-existing blast assessment.  Park Service officials added that the blast assessment, however, was too  narrowly focused, and the lack of a comprehensive assessment of threats  and vulnerabilities limited their ability to identify the full range of security  measures that were needed to fully protect the park. In early 2005, an  Interior security official told us that a comprehensive assessment  conducted in compliance with HSPD-7 had been completed, and Interior  officials are evaluating this assessment to determine additional security  enhancements.", "Interior officials told us that jurisdictional issues at INHP and the political  sensitivity of related disagreements have been the greatest challenges in  terms of implementing security enhancements since September 11. These  officials said that although there is a standing operational agreement  between the Park Service and the city of Philadelphia, there is no current  MOU regarding law enforcement and security. INHP security officials  stated that their ability to effectively secure the park is limited by a lack of  authority over Chestnut Street and consensus among stakeholders as to  how to provide the best protection. This challenge is evidenced most  clearly by the ongoing disagreement between INHP and the city of  Philadelphia over the closure of Chestnut Street, the street that carries  both pedestrian and vehicular traffic between Independence Hall and the  Liberty Bell Center. INHP officials said that the city reopened Chestnut  Street on April 1, 2003, after local residents and business owners made the  case to the city that the closure would have an adverse impact on business.  Chestnut Street currently remains open to pedestrians and traffic with the  use of a controlled pedestrian intersection at Sixth and Chestnut Streets  managed by Park Service security staff and contract guards to monitor  park visitors transiting from the Liberty Bell Center to Independence Hall.

IMBARC was created for  the purpose of challenging the closure of Chestnut Street. IMBARC\u2019s  chairman told us that IMBARC members are united in their belief that the  security measures implemented at INHP since September 11 are excessive  and aesthetically unappealing. In addition, potential street closures  surrounding Independence Mall also affect the Southeastern Pennsylvania  Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the regional transit provider. Chestnut  and Sixth Street are considered thoroughfares through the city\u2019s  downtown, and Park Service officials said that major changes to the traffic  patterns would likely meet additional resistance. We did not evaluate the  competing views of the Park Service, the city of Philadelphia, or IMBARC  regarding the Park Service\u2019s security efforts at INHP.

This  assessment examined potential threats and alternate methods of both  prevention and protection. Additionally, the Park Service identified specific  protection criteria and designated key areas with the highest vulnerability  as priority status for increased security. According to Interior and Park  Service officials, they have used the report\u2019s findings to determine where to  allocate appropriated funds and implement security upgrades for high-risk  structures.", "The Park Service has pursued a number of security enhancements to the  Washington Monument and Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, which were  the focus of our review. Construction is currently under way on a  landscape security solution for the grounds of the Washington Monument.  When construction is complete, a 30-inch-high granite retaining wall along  newly constructed pedestrian pathways will surround the monument. The  wall will serve as a vehicle barrier while also providing visitor seating. In  addition, the monument grounds will receive nearly 800 new shade and  flowering trees, upgraded lighting, and granite paving on the plaza. The  Park Service closed the monument to the public in September 2004 to  complete the final phase of the security enhancement project and reopened  it on April 1, 2005. At the Lincoln Memorial, the Park Service plans to  construct a 35-inch-high granite retaining wall at the edge of the roadway  around the north, west, and south sides of Lincoln Memorial Circle, and  install retractable bollards for a portion of the circle that does not handle  everyday traffic. The Park Service is also developing an alternative to a 715- foot line of jersey barriers on the memorial\u2019s east side, facing the Mall.  Figure 7 shows the temporary jersey barriers and fencing on the east side  of the memorial.", "For the Jefferson Memorial, the Park Service has proposed the  construction of a security barrier, closure of a U-shaped driveway next to  the monument to create a pedestrian plaza, and creation of additional  parking away from the monument to improve security by limiting vehicular  access. The Park Service\u2019s proposal includes the elimination of parking  adjacent to the monument. According to the Park Service\u2019s environmental  assessment of various options, the options under consideration would have  adverse impacts on historic structures and the cultural landscape because  the proposed security barrier would introduce a new element within the  historic scene. However, the Park Service also said that the historic  structures, cultural landscape, and aesthetic and visual quality would  benefit due to the removal of the existing security measures that currently  compromise the views, vistas, and historic scene. According to the Park  Service, safety and security would be improved because the barrier would  provide a first line of defense from the potential threat of a vehicle bomb  and would serve as a deterrent to terrorists. Figure 8 shows a jersey barrier  and temporary snow fencing at the memorial. According to Park Service  officials, the snow fencing is used to control pedestrian flow to and from  the memorial.", "In addition to these improvements at the monuments, the Park Service has  upgraded its security camera capabilities in and around the Mall. The  camera system began its initial test run in July 2002 and was fully  operational by the fall of 2002. Park Service officials reported that the  system consists of cameras mounted in and around the Mall that digitally  record footage. It is designed for redundancy; if one camera fails, another  camera could quickly cover the same area. Park Service officials stated that  in the near future, they would like to expand coverage and progressively  upgrade the camera system.

DHS\u2019s mission includes preventing terrorist attacks  within the United States, reducing the vulnerability of the United States to  terrorism, and minimizing the damage and assisting in the recovery from  attacks that do occur. The creation of DHS centralized the government\u2019s  homeland security efforts, including policy setting with regard to  protecting national icons and monuments. As discussed earlier, several of  Interior\u2019s assets are highly visible and symbolic icons, monuments, and  critical infrastructure such as dams.

The President\u2019s  February 2003 National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical  Infrastructures and Key Assets provides a statement of national policy to  remain committed to protecting critical infrastructures and key assets\u2014 including national monuments, icons, and dams that Interior is responsible  for\u2014from terrorist attacks and is based on eight guiding principles. These  principles include establishing responsibility and accountability and  encouraging and facilitating partnering among all levels of government and  between government and industry. The strategy also establishes three  strategic objectives, which are to (1) identify and ensure the protection of  the most critical assets, in terms of national level public health and safety,  governance, and economic and national security and public confidence; (2)  ensure protection of infrastructures and assets facing specific, imminent  threats; and (3) pursue collaborative measures and initiatives to ensure the  protection of other potential targets that may become attractive over time.", "The critical infrastructure strategy identifies Interior as the lead federal  entity for taking actions in a number of areas, in conjunction with DHS,  related to protecting icons, monuments, and other key assets. These  actions include developing guidance and standards for determining  criticalities and protection priorities, conducting threat and vulnerability  assessments, exploring opportunities for using technology to protect  visitors at monuments, and collaborating with state and local governments  and private foundations to ensure the protection of symbols and icons  outside the federal domain. In our prior work, we assessed these plans and  in February 2004 testified that the national strategy related to critical  infrastructure contained the most desirable characteristics among the  strategic plans for homeland security that the administration has produced  since September 11. These characteristics included addressing such areas  as purpose, scope, and methodology; problem definition and risk  assessment; and organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination.", "While the 2002 and 2003 national strategies identified a broad framework  for homeland security as it relates to critical infrastructure, HSPD-7, which  the administration issued in December 2003, establishes a national policy  for federal agencies to identify and prioritize critical U.S. infrastructure and  key resources and to protect them from terrorism. The directive identified  several critical infrastructure sectors, such as agriculture, water systems,  public health, and national monuments and icons. For several of the  sectors, the directive identifies lead agencies that have sector-specific  knowledge, including Interior for national icons and monuments. SSA  responsibilities include collaborating with all relevant federal entities, state  and local governments, and the private sector; conducting or facilitating  vulnerability assessments of the specific sector; and encouraging risk  management strategies to protect against and mitigate the effects of  attacks. Section 35 of the directive also requires, on an annual basis, that  sector-specific agencies report on their efforts to identify, prioritize, and  coordinate the protection initiatives in their respective sectors. In addition,  section 34 of the directive requires that all federal departments and  agencies develop physical and cyber security plans for the assets they own  or operate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Interior\u2019s Actions Have Been Positive, and Further Steps Could Strengthen Its Efforts in the Security Area", "paragraphs": ["After September 11, the Secretary of the Interior took steps to address  serious organizational and management problems in the law enforcement  and security components of the department. Of particular concern,  according to Interior\u2019s IG, was the lack of coordination among these  components and the absence of a meaningful single point of contact that  the Secretary and senior managers could depend upon for reliable  information and advice. The Secretary approved a Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Law Enforcement and Security in July 2002, established the  security office named OLES, and approved the implementation of the  additional 24 recommendations from a January 2002 Inspector General  report. OLES oversees the department\u2019s security efforts and seeks to  ensure consistent application across bureaus and offices. OLES has  responsibilities related to (1) coordinating the development of policies and  standards, (2) coordinating and overseeing implementation of policies and  standards, (3) representing the department externally, (4) conducting  compliance reviews, and (5) providing leadership during incidents.  Because Interior was designated as an SSA, OLES prepared a sector- specific security plan for icons and monuments, as required by section 35  of HSPD-7. Interior also developed a physical security plan for the assets it  owns and operates in response to section 34 of HSPD-7. These plans  recognize many of the major challenges facing Interior, including security  versus access, jurisdictional considerations, security in remote locations,  and security staffing issues.", "In response to HSPD-7\u2019s requirement that Interior formulate a plan for  identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and developing protective programs for  critical assets within the national icons and monuments sector, Interior  developed a uniform risk assessment and ranking methodology called the  National Monuments and Icons Assessment Methodology (NM&I  methodology). According to information from Interior, the NM&I  methodology is specifically designed to quantify risk, identify needed  security enhancements, and measure risk-reduction benefits at icon and  monument assets. The NM&I methodology has a consequence assessment  phase and a risk assessment phase. During the consequence assessment  phase, there is an asset tier ranking process, in which each asset\u2019s iconic  significance is subjectively determined. Specific attack scenarios\u2014such as  chemical/biological, aircraft, or improvised explosive device\u2014are used to  evaluate security at each asset and score attack consequences.  Consequence categories include casualties, economic impact, and length of  disruption. During the risk assessment phase, Interior uses the  methodology to determine the effectiveness of existing security systems  for preventing or mitigating the specified attack scenarios. Using risk  values calculated from this comparison, Interior assigns asset risk ratings  of high, medium, or low, and specific mitigation recommendations are  formulated. To date, Interior has applied this methodology to assets that  fall under the purview of the Park Service. Interior officials said that BOR  has used a risk assessment methodology for dams for several years. These  officials said that BOR\u2019s methodology is similar, but also takes into account  several factors that are unique to dams, such as downstream population at  risk, structural vulnerability, and the economic impact if the asset were to  be destroyed.", "Interior has made significant progress in the risk assessment area,  particularly regarding the new methodology for national icons and  monuments. Before the development of this approach, Interior did not have  a uniform, comprehensive risk management approach for icons and  monuments. It relied instead on the judgment of senior officials in  determining where resources should be directed, and the risk assessments  completed at individual sites were done by a number of external experts  using different methodologies. Given the range of challenges Interior faces,  particularly with regard to limited resources, it is especially important that  Interior\u2019s funding priorities are linked with its risk rankings so that decision  makers\u2014including Interior, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and  Congress\u2014can direct resources where they will have an optimal return on  investment in terms of better protection. Setting funding priorities for  protecting assets using a uniform approach is the foundation of the  National Strategy for Homeland Security and the National Strategy for  the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets. For  example, the section of the National Strategy related to critical  infrastructure calls for DHS and stakeholders like Interior to develop a  uniform methodology for identifying facilities, systems, and functions with  national level criticality to help establish priorities.", "Government agencies often face a variety of interests whose competing  demands force policymakers and managers to balance stakeholders\u2019  concerns and other factors such as quality, cost, and customer satisfaction.  For Interior, the trade-offs that have to be made between security and its  cultural mission are often difficult, which was apparent at the sites we  visited. Full transparency regarding the basis for its decisions on security  matters could, in our view, improve Interior\u2019s ability to achieve mutually  acceptable and consistent outcomes with stakeholders. As Interior  continues with the implementation of security measures, a clearly defined  set of guiding principles for balancing security with its core cultural  mission could also be beneficial due to the complex and often contentious  environment in which Interior operates. Such principles could be used in  conjunction with the broader guiding principles the administration set  forth in the national strategy for critical infrastructure and efforts by the  department to define its guiding principles in other areas that are already in  place. For example, the Park Service\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2001 to  2005 identifies a set of guiding principles for achieving its mission that  include excellent service, productive partnerships, and citizen  involvement.", "Guiding principles have been used by other organizations to improve  transparency and thus allow stakeholders to better understand the basis  for decisions. For example, the administration has outlined guiding  principles for postal reform given the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s financial  difficulties and a complex operating environment that involves multiple  competing interests and stakeholders.   These principles relate to best  practices, transparency, flexibility, accountability, and financial self- sufficiency. In another example that relates directly to security, the  government of Canada has identified guiding principles that are part of its  long-term plan for the Parliament Precinct area in Ottawa.

In addition, a GSA official said that at the request  of the building\u2019s largest federal tenant, every individual entering the  building must be screened. Additionally, the building also operates a mail  facility to screen all mail, packages, and deliveries.", "Due to security concerns following the September 11 attacks, FPS, along  with GSA and the building\u2019s largest federal tenant, assessed the building\u2019s  risk and began to develop and implement a comprehensive security  program. FPS conducted a threat assessment of the building and  determined the building to be classified as a Level IV property. Once the  building had been assessed and classified, agency officials from the  building\u2019s largest federal tenant, GSA, and FPS began developing a plan for  security program development and implementation. The program plan  included armed contract guards manning magnetometers and X-ray  machines, random spot checks of vehicles entering the parking garage, and  close monitoring of visitor badges.", "Additionally, a GSA official said that technology advancement has changed  since September 11. The leased building\u2019s security program incorporates its  newest technology, the E-Pop system. The E-Pop system can be controlled  by security officials; in the event of an emergency, it is able to connect to  computers in the building and deliver emergency messages communicating  evacuation instructions. Furthermore, E-Pop allows tenants to be  immediately informed of an incident, thereby increasing their chances of  exiting the building safely. The leased building is also considering  implementing smart card technology, a building access system that uses  plastic identification cards containing an individual\u2019s personal and  biometric data. This is the same system used at the federal building in New  York City.", "A GSA leasing official stated that ISC\u2019s development of leased space  security standards, which will be discussed later, has been useful in  effectively communicating increased physical security needs to private  owners and involving them directly in the process of security program  development for their buildings. This official said that the standards have  established the credibility and validity of increased security measures,  where no or few guidelines existed before. A GSA official said that even  though the commercial real estate community in the capital area has  become attuned to the needs of the federal government in the post- September 11 security environment, challenges still exist. According to  GSA and security officials, one challenge in leasing space in property  mixed with federal agency and private sector tenants is incorporating  increased security standards while balancing occupants\u2019 varying interests  and needs. Some private owners and their private sector tenants may not  want random car checks conducted or magnetometers placed at the  entrances to their buildings because this may, in some way, adversely affect  their business. GSA officials also noted that negotiating the need and costs  of increased security standards in leased properties is still a significant  challenge, as security demands for privately owned buildings are still  relatively new."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Transfer to DHS Poses a Challenge for GSA", "paragraphs": ["The Homeland Security Act transferred FPS to DHS, effective March 1,  2003. FPS\u2019s transfer to DHS was intended to improve law enforcement  and related security functions by centralizing building security activities  with other homeland security functions. Under the act, DHS became  responsible for protecting buildings, grounds, and property owned,  occupied, or secured by the federal government that are under GSA\u2019s  jurisdiction, as well as other DHS facilities. A March 2003 operational  memorandum of agreement between GSA and DHS made FPS responsible  for the same types of security services that FPS provided for GSA  properties prior to the transfer to DHS. These include, among other things,  performing risk assessments, managing the installation of some security  equipment, conducting criminal investigations, and managing the contract  guard program. Although law enforcement and security related functions  were transferred to DHS from GSA, GSA officials said that it still assists  FPS and tenant agencies in implementing various security measures that  FPS recommends, and incorporating enhanced security measures into new  space it constructs or leases. In October 2003, GSA and DHS agreed on a  number of interim support services GSA would provide to FPS during the  transition in a separate memorandum of agreement. In July 2004, we  reported on the challenges FPS was facing related to the transfer, including  its expanding homeland security mission and related increase in  responsibility; unresolved issues related to how it would be funded,  because its funds at that time were tied to the rent GSA charges tenant  agencies; and, difficulties with transferring mission-support functions for  FPS from GSA to DHS. DHS concurred with our findings and related  recommendations and agreed to take action.", "In addition to the challenges facing FPS, our work for this review showed  that GSA is facing its own management challenges because it no longer has  control over the law enforcement and related security functions of its  properties. GSA officials expressed concern about their ability to track  security expenditures and stay informed about FPS protection activities in  GSA buildings. These officials also expressed concern about not having a  formal mechanism for communicating with FPS and for ensuring that FPS  is meeting its responsibilities with regard to security enhancements and  services. The Deputy Commissioner of GSA\u2019s Public Buildings Service said  that since the departure of FPS, GSA has had difficulty adjusting to not  having responsibility for protecting its own buildings and is still trying to  define its overall role in security. This official said that GSA\u2019s new role  should be that of a coordinator between FPS and the tenant agencies and  that GSA was examining the MOU between GSA and DHS to determine if  GSA\u2019s role and visibility in facility protection could be enhanced. Concerns  about the departure of FPS were identified by GSA\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General (IG) in its August 2004 updated assessment of GSA\u2019s major  management challenges. The GSA IG identified protection of federal  facilities and personnel as one of seven major management challenges  facing the agency. The GSA IG said that although FPS was transferred to  DHS, GSA will have a continual need to closely interact with security  personnel due to GSA\u2019s mission of housing federal agencies. The GSA IG  concluded that ensuring federal employees have a secure working  environment and that building assets are adequately safeguarded must  remain a primary concern of GSA. \u201cTraditionally, what has previously been lacking is a single position at the senior governance  level having the responsibility for crafting, influencing, and directing an organization-wide  protection strategy. In many organizations, accountability is dispersed, possibly among  several managers in different departments; with potentially conflicting objectives\u2026.the  diversity of today\u2019s risks comes in a complex matrix of interrelated threats, vulnerabilities,  and impacts, the safeguards for which must, therefore, be interdependent.

FPS is able to use a series of input screens and queries to  maintain pertinent data that can be adjusted as threats and vulnerabilities  change. The tool allows the user to enter information on each asset,  identify existing countermeasures, assign an impact of loss and a  vulnerability rating to each threat, and input countermeasure upgrade  alternatives and their associated costs.", "As mentioned earlier, HSPD-7 requires, on an annual basis, that sector- specific agencies report on their efforts to identify, prioritize, and  coordinate the protection initiatives in various critical infrastructure  sectors. Although GSA was not given responsibility for any of the sectors  identified in the directive, all federal departments and agencies are  required, under the directive, to develop physical and cyber security plans  for the assets they own or operate. However, in a July 2004 letter to the  Director of OMB, GSA stated that \u201cno GSA owned or leased space meets  the definitions for critical infrastructure and/or key resources.\u201d The letter  went on to say that \u201cGSA owns and leases many buildings where important  activities take place, but GSA is unable to make a determination as to  whether these tenant activities are critical infrastructure.\u201d", "GSA officials said that OMB has not commented on GSA\u2019s response to  HSPD-7 regarding a physical security plan. The Executive Director of ISC\u2014 which has responsibility for reviewing agencies\u2019 HSPD-7 plans for the  administration\u2014said that ISC has not completed its review of agencies\u2019  plans, including GSA\u2019s response to HSPD-7. We are deferring to ISC on  whether GSA\u2019s decision not to prepare a physical security plan is  reasonable.

In this environment, Interior has a critical role in  protecting our national icons and monuments and ensuring the safety of  the millions of people who visit them. National icons such as the Statue of  Liberty and Mt. Rushmore could be attacked for symbolic reasons. Since  September 11, Interior has made significant progress in improving security  by doing vulnerability assessments of high-profile sites that are likely  targets and implementing various security measures. For example, at the  individual icons and monuments we visited, steps clearly had been taken to  improve security since September 11, such as the Washington Monument  perimeter landscaping project, the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorial security  projects, the visitor screening system at the Statue of Liberty, increased  staffing at Mt. Rushmore, and the rerouting of Interstate 93 at Hoover Dam.", "In addition, Interior has made management changes, including creating a  central security office, intended to enhance its homeland security  initiatives, and has recently developed a uniform risk management  methodology for national icons and monuments. These actions should help  Interior address the major challenges it faces\u2014which include balancing  security and Interior\u2019s mission related to access and education; addressing  jurisdictional and competing stakeholder issues; securing icons and  monuments in rugged, remote areas; and leveraging limited staff and  funding resources.", "As Interior moves forward, it could link the results of its risk assessments  and related risk rankings to its security funding priorities. This could allow  for well-informed decisions by stakeholders\u2014such as Interior, OMB, and  Congress\u2014about where to direct resources so that they have an optimal  return on investment in terms of better protection. Also, a set of guiding  principles for balancing security with its core cultural and educational  mission\u2014which Interior lacks but other organizations with complex  environments have developed\u2014could help in addressing the challenges. A  set of guiding principles could provide decision makers and Interior\u2019s other  stakeholders with greater transparency regarding the rationale for security  decisions. An approach with these components should yield results that  would allow decision makers both within and external to the department to  better gauge and consider competing priorities.", "Since September 11, security at office buildings has remained a concern, as  evidenced by threats revealed by DHS in August 2004 that al Qaeda was  targeting several office buildings in New York, northern New Jersey, and  Washington, D.C. GSA has taken action to address the challenges it faces as  the owner and landlord of federal office buildings. These challenges  include balancing security and public access, addressing jurisdictional and  competing stakeholder issues, securing federally leased space, and  adjusting to the transfer of FPS to DHS. These actions have included  working with ISC to develop security standards, continuing with upgrades  that GSA began implementing after the Oklahoma City bombing, and  establishing a memorandum of agreement with DHS related to FPS.  Despite these actions, GSA lacks a mechanism such as a chief security  officer position or formal point of contact to coordinate security efforts for  its federal office building portfolio.
