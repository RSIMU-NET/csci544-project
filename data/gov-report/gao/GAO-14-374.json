Since 2004, the number of STEM jobs increased 16 percent from 14.2 million to 16.5 million jobs in 2012, and non-STEM jobs remained fairly steady. The trends in STEM degrees and jobs varied across STEM fields. It is difficult to know if the numbers of STEM graduates are aligned with workforce needs, in part because demand for STEM workers fluctuates. For example, the number of jobs in core STEM fields, including engineering and information technology, declined during the recession but has grown substantially since then.", "Almost all of the 124 federal postsecondary STEM education programs that responded to GAO's survey reported that they considered workforce needs in some way. For example, the most common program objective was to prepare students for STEM careers. Some of these programs focused on occupations they considered to be in demand and/or related to their agency's mission. Many postsecondary programs also aimed to increase the diversity of the STEM workforce or prepare students for innovation. Most STEM programs reported having some outcome measures in place, but GAO found that some programs did not measure an outcome directly related to their stated objectives. As GAO recommended in 2012, the National Science and Technology Council recently issued guidance to help agencies better incorporate STEM education outcomes into their performance plans and reports. As agencies follow the guidance and focus on the effectiveness of the programs, more programs may measure outcomes directly related to their objectives.", "Of the 30 kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) STEM education programs responding to GAO's survey, almost all reported that they either directly or indirectly prepared students for postsecondary STEM education.

While some researchers have concluded that the United States  has a sufficient supply of STEM workers, others have found that the  educational system is not producing enough STEM graduates to fill the  jobs available in STEM occupations or in the increasing number of jobs  in other fields that may require STEM competencies (such as analytical  skills). In light of this disagreement, we were asked to review the  alignment between STEM and workforce needs. Specifically, we reviewed  (1) recent trends in the number of degrees and jobs in STEM fields, (2)  the extent to which federal postsecondary STEM education programs  take workforce needs into consideration, and (3) the extent to which  federal kindergarten-12th grade (K-12) STEM education programs  prepare students for postsecondary STEM education.", "To address our first objective, we analyzed three federal data sources to  examine trends in STEM degrees and jobs over the past decade: (1) the  Department of Education\u2019s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data  System to examine trends in STEM degrees, (2) the Bureau of Labor  Statistics\u2019 Occupational Employment Statistics data to examine  employment and wage trends among STEM workers, and (3) the Census  Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey data to examine unemployment  rates of STEM workers and the relationships between educational  background and occupation among STEM workers. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report by  reviewing relevant documentation and conducting electronic testing of the  data. We also conducted a regression analysis with the American  Community Survey data to examine differences in wages and  unemployment rates between STEM and non-STEM workers, controlling  for some demographic details.", "To address our other objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations and conducted and analyzed the results of a survey. We  surveyed 158 K-12 and postsecondary STEM education programs about  how they address STEM workforce needs and prepare students for future  STEM education or careers. A total of 154 federal STEM education  programs responded to our survey, representing a 97 percent response  rate.

We  also found that federal agencies\u2019 limited use of performance measures  and evaluations may have hampered their ability to assess the  effectiveness of individual programs as well as the overall federal STEM  education effort. We recommended that as the Office of Science and  Technology Policy leads the government\u2019s STEM education strategic  planning effort, it should work with agencies to better align their activities  with a government-wide strategy, develop a plan for sustained  coordination, identify programs for potential consolidation or elimination,  and assist agencies in determining how to better evaluate their programs.", "The Office of Science and Technology Policy has taken steps to address  some of our recommendations. Regarding our recommendation on  potential elimination or consolidation of programs, the Committee on  STEM Education released its interim strategic planning progress report in  February 2012, which noted that STEM education programs had been  identified to be potentially overlapping and encouraged agencies to  streamline programs where appropriate. In addition, the President\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 budget called for a major restructuring of federal STEM  education programs through the consolidation of programs and the  realignment of STEM education activities. Since our prior report on  STEM, the number of STEM education programs dropped from 209 in  2010 to158 in 2013.

Subject matter specialists and federal officials we  interviewed also noted that employer needs in STEM fields are difficult to  predict because they may change with technological or market  developments.", "Furthermore, the supply of STEM workers in the United States may not  match the demand at any given point in time because of the time it takes  to educate a STEM worker. Research suggests that students\u2019 decisions  about which fields to study may be influenced by the economic conditions  and future career prospects they perceive in those fields. Favorable  economic conditions in a STEM field may encourage students to pursue  degrees in that field. However, it may take them several years to  complete their degrees, so changes in the domestic supply of STEM  workers may lag behind changes in the domestic demand.", "In addition, the number of students graduating with STEM degrees may  not be a good measure of the supply of STEM workers because students  often pursue careers in fields different from the ones they studied. Figure  9 shows the educational background of workers in selected STEM  occupations in 2012 up to the bachelor\u2019s level.

They  either majored in a different STEM field or a non-STEM field in their  undergraduate education, or they did not receive a bachelor\u2019s degree.  As a result, it is difficult to estimate the supply of workers in a STEM  occupation from information on the number of bachelor\u2019s degrees  awarded in a STEM field.", "Further evidence of the difficulty in estimating the size of the STEM  workforce from information on the number of STEM degrees is the  substantial portion of workers with STEM bachelor\u2019s degrees who work in  non-STEM occupations\u2014 62 percent in 2012 (see fig. 10).

For example, of the 13 K-12 programs that reported having a  stated program objective to prepare students for postsecondary STEM  education, 10 programs said they did not track student educational  attainment or the number of students who pursued coursework in STEM  fields. Of the 18 programs that reported that improving the ability of K-12  teachers to teach STEM content was a stated program objective, 6  programs said they did not monitor teacher improvement and  performance in STEM education instruction or the number of qualified  teachers teaching STEM.", "K-12 STEM education program grantees we met with monitored some  programmatic outcomes. For example, an official from an Upward Bound  Math-Science program we visited told us that each program is required to  submit an annual report to Education, including data on performance  outcomes such as the number of participants who graduate from high  school, pursue postsecondary degrees in STEM fields, and graduate from  college within 6 years. The official said that all but one of the  participants in the program\u2019s first cohort graduated from high school and  enrolled in college.

The initial phase of the analysis, based on teacher self-reporting, found  that the students whose teachers had participated in the program  outperformed their peers in several STEM subjects. In addition, officials  from the museum exhibit in California funded by the Advancing Informal  STEM Learning program said assessments were planned for every stage  of the project, including a summative evaluation to review the extent to  which it may have influenced Latino youth awareness of and engagement  with STEM content.

There  is not a one-to-one match between STEM graduates in a specific field  and corresponding STEM jobs because not all people with STEM  degrees pursue careers in their fields of study, whether by choice or  because of limited employment opportunities in the field. Regardless of  career choices, the rigor of a STEM education may help promote a  workforce with transferable skills and the potential to fuel innovation and  economic growth. Federal postsecondary STEM education programs may  help develop a workforce that will address issues that affect the  population as a whole, such as researching diseases or improving  defense capabilities. Additionally, federal K-12 STEM education programs  may generate interest in STEM fields early in life, which could usher more  students into the STEM pipeline and increase the likelihood that they will  pursue STEM education and careers.", "Although the administration has taken steps to consolidate and  coordinate STEM education programs, numerous programs\u2014spread  across 13 agencies\u2014remain. As the administration continues to  consolidate and eliminate STEM education programs, it risks making  decisions without considering the efficacy of these programs because  many federal STEM education programs are not measuring their  outcomes.

STEM is one of five allowable activities, and grantees can choose to focus their projects on any of  these five activities.
