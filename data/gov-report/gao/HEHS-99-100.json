HIPAA instituted minimum standards of protection to improve access to health insurance for people obtaining coverage through employment as well as for those purchasing it as individuals. For example, HIPAA limits the time that preexisting conditions may be excluded from coverage for many people changing jobs (portability) and guarantees access to coverage for certain individuals losing group coverage (group-to-individual portability). Since the enactment of HIPAA, the Congress has enacted additional federal health insurance requirements, including minimum standards affecting mental health, maternity and newborn, and reconstruction after mastectomy benefits.", "Last year, we reported that the initial months of HIPAA implementation had posed some challenges for consumers, insurers, and regulators. We noted that eligible consumers attempting to exercise their new rights to guaranteed access to individual insurance were hindered in some cases by insurance carrier practices and pricing as well as by their own misunderstanding of the law; issuers of health coverage, including employers and insurance carriers, were concerned about administrative burdens and unanticipated consequences of the law, as well as the potential for consumer abuse of certain protections; federal regulators faced a greater-than-expected role under HIPAA; and state regulators sought additional guidance in interpreting the regulations.", "Since additional HIPAA provisions have come into effect over the last year and consumers, insurers, employers, and regulators have had an additional year to adapt to these requirements, you asked us to provide an update on the implementation status of HIPAA provisions in the group insurance market; the price of coverage for certain individuals losing group coverage; the extent of consumer understanding of HIPAA as well as federal, state, and private efforts undertaken to educate consumers about the law\u2019s protections; and federal efforts undertaken to ensure HIPAA compliance.", "To provide this information, we visited five states and interviewed regulators, carriers, employers, agents, trade organizations, and benefit consulting firms. In collaboration with the National Association of Health Underwriters (NAHU), we surveyed agents to obtain premium quotes in states that are using HIPAA\u2019s standards to guarantee eligible individuals access to individual market coverage and compared these quotes with premium data from states using an alternative method to do so. We conducted our work between September 1998 and April 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I provides more details about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title I of HIPAA established standards for health coverage access, portability, and renewability that apply to employer-sponsored plans in the group market and, to a more limited extent, to the individual market.Group market provisions include limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods; a requirement that previous coverage be credited to reduce or eliminate a new employee\u2019s preexisting condition exclusion period; restrictions against excluding an employee from the health plan on the basis of his or her health status; and special enrollment opportunities for certain employees, such as those who did not enroll because they were previously covered under a spouse\u2019s health plan.", "With limited exceptions, carriers must renew all group coverage at the employer\u2019s request, regardless of the health status or historic health costs of the employee members. HIPAA also requires carriers in the small group market to guarantee coverage to all small employers (defined as those with 2 to 50 employees) that apply.", "In the individual market, HIPAA guarantees that eligible individuals losing group coverage have access to at least two individual market insurance products. This provision is referred to as group-to-individual portability. States may comply with this provision using either the federal rules\u2014which require individual market carriers to guarantee access to certain insurance policies to eligible individuals\u2014or an \u201calternative mechanism.\u201d Under an alternative mechanism, states may, within broad federal parameters, design other approaches to provide eligible individuals with a choice of coverage. Twelve states are operating under the federal rules, and 38 are using an alternative mechanism. Of the latter, 22 are using a high-risk pool to provide coverage to these eligible individuals. A high-risk pool is a state entity that offers comprehensive health insurance to individuals with preexisting health conditions who are otherwise unable to obtain coverage in the individual market or who may be able to obtain coverage only at a cost-prohibitive rate. (App. II contains a summary of HIPAA access, portability, and renewability standards by market segment.)", "HIPAA was signed into law on August 21, 1996, and by the end of June 1998, all substantive provisions were effective for almost all plans. HIPAA regulations were issued on an interim final basis, and federal agencies issued most of the implementing regulations on April 8, 1997. Enhancements and clarifications to the regulations followed and will continue in 1999. Officials expect to finalize HIPAA regulations in 2000. Finally, after HIPAA was enacted, three additional federal laws\u2014the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), the Newborns\u2019 and Mothers\u2019 Health Protection Act, and the Women\u2019s Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA)\u2014imposed federal standards on private insurance coverage of mental health, maternity and newborn, and reconstruction after mastectomy benefits.", "Carrier and employer officials we interviewed expressed concerns about the lead time given them to comply with HIPAA and subsequent federal insurance reforms. The adoption of the new standards requires issuers to perform various tasks, including educating staff, issuing notices to enrollees, revising premium prices and marketing materials, and retooling information systems. Carrier officials consistently said that such changes require at least 6 months\u2019 lead time or, preferably, 1 full year. Regulations implementing HIPAA were issued less than 2 months before certain provisions became effective, although carriers and employers have generally overcome the early start-up hurdles. Neither the MHPA nor the WHCRA had statutory provisions that provided for lead times of 6 months or more. Although the MHPA was signed into law in September 1996, its implementing regulations were not issued until December 22, 1997\u2014only 9 days before some group plans became subject to the law. Similarly, while the WHCRA was signed into law on October 21, 1998, issuers were required to begin issuing notices to enrollees less than 3 months later, by January 1, 1999. Federal agencies, recognizing the short lead time, provided for a period during which no MHPA enforcement action would be taken against issuers making a good-faith effort to comply.", "Responsibility for enforcing HIPAA standards is divided among three federal agencies and the states. The Department of Labor is responsible for ensuring that employer-sponsored group health plans comply with HIPAA\u2014an extension of Labor\u2019s current regulatory role under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In states that do not adopt and enforce statutes or regulations that meet or exceed the HIPAA standards, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014through HCFA\u2014is responsible for directly enforcing HIPAA standards for carriers in the group and individual markets. The Department of the Treasury enforces HIPAA requirements for group health plans by imposing an excise tax under the Internal Revenue Code as a penalty for noncompliance with the HIPAA standards.

The Director of the Department of Labor\u2019s health care task force said the Department has uncovered no systemic problems in the group market related specifically to HIPAA. A senior Labor field official told us that large employers and insurance companies are generally informed about HIPAA and make good-faith efforts to comply, although questions of interpretation still arise. The field office had no formal investigations related to HIPAA pending at the time of our visit in December 1998. Similarly, large employers and health benefit consultants we interviewed reported few ongoing problems in adopting HIPAA portability standards.", "Many carriers and large employers we interviewed said that their health plans tended to require few changes to comply with HIPAA. This was probably the case because many large employer plans had already incorporated portability protections similar to those of HIPAA. For example, many large employers had not excluded preexisting conditions from coverage before HIPAA became law. Many more have since dropped preexisting condition exclusion periods, partly because of the increased complexity of administering them under HIPAA. Table 1 shows that less than half of all group plans offered by employers with more than 200 employees continue to include preexisting condition exclusion periods.Further, a large midwestern telecommunications company official told us that before HIPAA, the company\u2019s health plans (1) did not exclude preexisting conditions from coverage, (2) did not exclude individuals from the plan because of health status, and (3) provided later enrollment opportunities for those initially declining coverage. Thus, few changes were necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questions Exist About the Extent of Compliance Among Small Employer Plans", "paragraphs": ["The degree of compliance with HIPAA portability provisions among small employer group plans has not been measured, but health insurance agents and regulators suspect noncompliance to be more common among these plans than among medium and large group plans. Whereas medium and large employers rely on carriers, third-party administrators, or a health benefits professional staff to implement HIPAA requirements, small employers may have fewer resources and may rely largely on carriers and agents to learn about changes in health benefits required by law. Further, observations made by health insurance agents and others suggest that some small employers either misunderstand the HIPAA requirements or are entirely unaware of them. In addition, several of the agents we surveyed volunteered that many of their colleagues do not understand HIPAA. An official of a small employer whom we interviewed in California told us an anecdote that illustrates this point. The individual responsible for human resource issues at this company with about 80 employees relied exclusively on the company\u2019s insurance agent to learn about HIPAA\u2019s certificate issuance requirement. The agent told the human resources staff person that certificates need be issued only upon the request of the employee; this is contrary to the law, which requires that certificates be issued automatically to anyone losing coverage. The discrepancy became apparent only as a result of our visit. Moreover, an agent in Florida indicated that perhaps 25 percent of her clients, most commonly the smaller employers, are not in compliance with one or more HIPAA provisions and are not making an effort to comply.", "Department of Labor officials also expressed concern about compliance among smaller employers. One field office official said that smaller employers know far less than larger employers about HIPAA and are more likely to be in violation of it. This field official is particularly concerned about small employers that self-fund their health plans and do not use the services of a third-party administrator. While this arrangement is not common, such employers have virtually no contact with health benefits professionals and, according to Labor officials, are very likely to be uninformed. Officials from another Labor field office noted that the Department\u2019s experience in overseeing employer pension plans suggests that smaller employers are more likely to be in violation of requirements than larger employers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Guarantees of Coverage for Small Employers Have Affected States Differently", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which HIPAA\u2019s guaranteed issue provision affects market access for small employers in a given state is largely dependent on the extent of state reforms preceding HIPAA. Most states had already passed laws requiring carriers in the small group market to guarantee access to at least one health insurance plan for any small employer that applied. While most of these state laws were more limited than HIPAA, a substantial minority were equally or more stringent.", "In 13 states, reforms that preceded HIPAA required all products in the small group market to be guaranteed to be accessible to all small employers, just as HIPAA now does. Moreover, these states defined a small employer at least as inclusively as HIPAA. Therefore, HIPAA imposed virtually no changes in the way small group coverage is sold in these states. In 26 states, existing reforms included small group market guaranteed issue provisions that were more limited than the HIPAA provisions. Often, state reforms defined small employers as having 3 to 25 employees, as opposed to HIPAA\u2019s 2 to 50 employees. These states also imposed the guaranteed issue provision on fewer health plans. Thus, in these states, HIPAA\u2019s impact was to modify, to varying degrees, the existing regulations. In 11 states and the District of Columbia, a guaranteed issue provision applicable to all carriers did not exist in the small group market. Here HIPAA imposed significant changes on the regulation of the small group market.", "Figure 1 shows the requirements of the 50 states and the District of Columbia for small group guaranteed issue coverage before HIPAA.", "The effects of HIPAA\u2019s small group market guaranteed issue provision on cost and access to coverage have not been evaluated, and, among the health insurance agents we surveyed, observations on its effects varied widely. Asked a general question about the effects of the provision, 46 percent of the agents we surveyed in states where existing guaranteed issue reforms were more limited than HIPAA\u2019s said that access had improved: for example, the choices of products available to small employers had increased. Agents also noted that, because every small employer has access to every small group product on the market, employers are better able to compare carriers\u2019 products and rates. Conversely, 44 percent of the agents said that HIPAA had not improved access for small groups. Many agents observed that while access is now guaranteed to groups that were previously excluded from coverage\u2014high-risk groups\u2014these groups may be unable to afford the available coverage.", "Carrier representatives we interviewed generally corroborated agent observations concerning increased comparison shopping by agents among all carrier products and high premiums for high-risk groups. Several carrier representatives said that small group market premiums have risen overall, but these representatives could not determine what proportion of the increase might be attributable to HIPAA\u2019s guaranteed issue provision. Several carrier officials also pointed out that the guaranteed issue requirement limits carriers\u2019 flexibility in designing benefit plans. Because every plan offered must be available to every small employer group, these carriers have reduced the number of plans they offer and are less able to customize plans to specific groups. Further, one carrier was concerned that very small employer groups might change health plans to obtain certain benefits, such as maternity coverage, when one or more individuals in the group needed that coverage. Another carrier cited concerns that very small groups tend to obtain coverage only when it becomes apparent that it will be needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HIPAA Has Improved Access, but Not Price, for Certain Individuals Losing Group Coverage", "paragraphs": ["HIPAA\u2019s group-to-individual portability provision ensures that people who are losing group coverage are guaranteed access to at least two individual market products, although these individuals, if in poor health, will probably pay more than the standard rate.

Our survey showed that in states using the federal rules, an individual in poor health would usually pay a premium greater than 200 percent of the standard rate, while in states using a high-risk pool, the increase was never greater than 200 percent of the standard rate.

Thus, premiums charged to individuals eligible for coverage under HIPAA, especially those in poor health, are often substantially higher than carriers\u2019 standard rates\u2014the rates healthy individuals pay. The extent of the increase in the premium rate is largely dependent upon whether a state restricts the amount carriers can vary premium rates and on the state\u2019s approach to complying with HIPAA\u2019s group-to-individual portability provision. Our premium survey of selected carriers in states using federal rules to guarantee group-to-individual portability under HIPAA showed that a particular individual eligible for HIPAA, with a preexisting condition, would be charged between 100 and 464 percent of the standard rate for a commonly sold product. In terms of monthly premiums, the rates quoted ranged from as low as $149 for a health maintenance organization (HMO) product in California to $951 for a preferred provider organization (PPO) product with a $500 deductible in the District of Columbia. As table 2 shows, the premium quotes provided by almost half of the carriers for this individual were 300 percent or more of their standard rates.", "As the table demonstrates, carriers in these states almost always charge an individual in poor health who is eligible for coverage under HIPAA a higher-than-standard monthly premium, which is similar to what unhealthy people without HIPAA portability rights experience if accepted for individual coverage in states without premium rate restrictions. Before HIPAA, however, many unhealthy people in these states could have been rejected outright for any type of individual private health insurance or could have faced an exclusion for their preexisting condition.", "In the 22 states using a high-risk pool as an alternative mechanism,individuals in poor health who are HIPAA-eligible also pay a higher premium, although the amount of the increase is generally less than in the states using federal rules, because the risk-pool coverage is subsidized. All 22 states using their high-risk pool as an alternative mechanism impose a premium cap for coverage in the pool of 200 percent of the standard rate or less, and about half cap premiums at 150 percent of the standard rate or less. The actual cost of covering these individuals is subsidized, most commonly by assessments on carriers. In several of these states, this assessment is offset against state premium or income taxes. As table 3 indicates, monthly premiums for the same individual discussed above for the most commonly sold product in each state ranged from $107 for a $1,000 deductible, fee-for-service plan in Minnesota to $336 for a $1,000 deductible, PPO plan in Louisiana.

For example, one of the agents we surveyed said that out of 10 applications he received for individual coverage from former group enrollees, only 3 qualified for a HIPAA-guaranteed access product. The remaining seven were ineligible for such reasons as failing to select or exhaust COBRA or having a lapse in coverage of more than 63 days.

Others believe HIPAA eliminates the use of preexisting condition exclusion periods altogether. Still others believe that portability allows them to carry their current health benefits with them when they change or lose jobs, according to regulators.

First, it does not explicitly inform consumers that they may have a group-to-individual portability right, nor does it highlight any of the restrictions placed on this right. Second, the certificate does not explicitly inform consumers changing jobs that they may not have to fulfill another preexisting condition period under their subsequent employer\u2019s health plan. Consequently, consumers who receive certificates may not understand their purpose and may discard them, never realizing their connection to HIPAA\u2019s access and portability rights. The experiences of employers and carriers seem to indicate that this is indeed the case: according to employer and carrier estimates, few enrollees have a certificate at the time they apply for coverage either because they discarded the certificate provided by a prior employer or carrier or never received one.", "Carriers and employers continue to question the value of certificates for proving creditable coverage. They point out that since most enrollees do not have a certificate, the law requires carriers and employers to otherwise verify prior coverage, as was generally the practice in states with portability laws predating HIPAA.

In states that do not adopt and enforce statutes or regulations that meet or exceed HIPAA standards, HCFA is responsible for directly enforcing them. To do this, HCFA has had to assume responsibilities typically undertaken by state insurance regulators, such as providing guidance to carriers, reviewing carrier policy forms, and monitoring carrier marketing practices. To date, HCFA\u2019s regulatory and enforcement activities have been limited primarily to the five states known not to have passed statutes or regulations that fully conform to HIPAA: California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and Rhode Island. Further, the extent of HCFA\u2019s efforts within four of the five states remains limited, still consisting largely of responding to consumer queries and complaints. Also, HCFA has yet to comprehensively evaluate the extent to which the other 45 states conform to HIPAA.", "We reported in July 1998 that the extent of HCFA\u2019s efforts in the direct enforcement states varied. For example, in California, Missouri, and Rhode Island, HCFA developed guidance that delineated state and federal regulatory responsibilities; HCFA also held informational meetings with carriers in Missouri and Rhode Island. Further, while HCFA had begun to review carriers\u2019 policies sold in Missouri to ensure compliance, it had not initiated any regulatory activities beyond responding to consumer inquiries and complaints in Massachusetts and Michigan. Since that report, the extent of HCFA\u2019s enforcement efforts has not dramatically changed; however, HCFA has awarded three external contracts to assist in enforcement tasks, and regional officials have held informational meetings in California. Enforcement efforts in the direct enforcement states remain largely complaint driven except for policy reviews in Missouri where carriers voluntarily submit policies for review.", "Further, HCFA has not determined the extent to which the remaining states have passed conforming legislation, and regional officials said they are just beginning to determine how they can identify any gaps in state laws and what their role should ultimately be in states in which gaps are identified. Although evidence suggests that most of these states have standards in place that meet or exceed HIPAA requirements, isolated gaps are likely to remain.

According to agency officials, the enforcement regulations will clearly delineate these standards and processes to the regulated community, thereby enhancing HCFA\u2019s ability to carry out necessary enforcement actions. Although officials had anticipated publishing the regulations by late 1998, they remain unpublished.", "HCFA officials also attribute their limited efforts to insufficient staff capacity. When HIPAA was originally passed, the Congress did not provide any additional resources for HCFA to implement the provisions of the law. Thus, the agency initially reassigned staff from other functions to assist in HIPAA\u2019s implementation. HCFA did receive a supplemental appropriation of $2.2 million in May 1998. Although these funds allowed the agency to hire and train 22 additional regional staff, including some who have specialized expertise in health insurance, they were not sufficient to allow the agency to move forward with the \u201cfull range of HIPAA enforcement activities,\u201d according to the HCFA Administrator. Given the current level of resources, HCFA intends to focus on (1) completing the enforcement regulations and (2) conducting direct enforcement responsibilities in the states that have not passed conforming legislation.

The law\u2019s provisions, which were intended to improve consumers\u2019 access to private health insurance, are now applicable to nearly all group and individual private health plans. Consequently, minimum standards of protection now apply to group (both fully insured and self-funded) and individual insurance coverage sold in all states. As a result of these new federal standards many consumers face fewer preexisting condition exclusions, enrollees should be able to more easily renew their health plans, employees may not be excluded from group health plans on the basis of small employers must have guaranteed access to all coverage sold in the small group market, and high-risk individuals losing group coverage may have better access to either individual health insurance or a subsidized high-risk pool.", "Nonetheless, some concerns persist. High-risk individuals and some small groups may continue to face high premiums for guaranteed coverage because HIPAA does not constrain carriers\u2019 rating practices beyond existing state laws. Partly because of this, relatively few eligible high-risk individuals who lost group coverage appear to have purchased HIPAA-guaranteed individual insurance.", "Consumers\u2019 lack of awareness or understanding of HIPAA can in some cases impede their ability to exercise the rights afforded by the law. Federal agencies and others are attempting to target education efforts at consumers in employment transition, but such efforts could take years, as was the case with educating consumers about COBRA. One potentially effective education tool is the certificates of creditable coverage that the law requires be issued to every enrollee who loses insurance coverage. The certificates\u2019 value as an educational tool, however, is diminished because model guidance on these certificates does not explicitly and comprehensively outline the protections provided by HIPAA.", "Finally, both HCFA and Labor have become better equipped over the last year to oversee compliance with HIPAA. Nonetheless, both agencies recognize that further efforts are needed, including targeting consumer education efforts; proactively ensuring employers\u2019 compliance; and, for HCFA, ensuring that all states\u2019 insurance regulations fully conform with the federal standards. Moreover, HCFA recognizes that its ability to fully perform its new regulatory role will be enhanced when enforcement regulations are issued.
