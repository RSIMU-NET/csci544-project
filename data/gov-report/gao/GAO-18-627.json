GAO has found that unrealistic requirements have contributed to poor program outcomes at the Department of Defense (DOD), and that the Army's requirements development workforce decreased by 22 percent from 2008 to 2017.", "Competition and Pricing: The Panel said that competition can help reduce prices. GAO's work shows that competition rates have remained steady government-wide, and declined at DOD. See figure below.", "GAO has also found that agencies are sometimes using bridge contracts\u2014which GAO has generally defined as either extensions to existing contracts or new short-term, sole-source contracts\u2014to avoid a lapse in service caused by delay of a follow-on contract award. In some instances, bridge contract awards delay opportunities for competition and can place the government at risk of paying higher prices for multiple years. The figure below depicts how an Army bridge contract for computer support services planned for 12 months was extended to 42 months.", "Contractor Oversight: The Panel raised questions about the capacity of federal agencies to oversee contractors. GAO has found that agencies continue to award contracts warranting increased management attention at a steady rate, such as contracts for management support services. With contracts like those for management support services, there is an increased risk that contractors may perform tasks reserved for the government. Additionally, GAO found that heavy workloads at the Department of Veterans Affairs have made it difficult for officials who oversee contractors to ensure contractors adhere to contract terms.", "Three of the key issues, and the corresponding challenges, cut across all the phases of the contracting life cycle:", "Acquisition Workforce: The Panel found that the federal acquisition workforce faces workload and training challenges. GAO's work has shown that DOD has enhanced its workforce, but some workforce gaps endure at DOD and across agencies.", "Federal Procurement Data: The Panel found that the government's primary repository for acquisition data contained some unreliable data. Also, GAO has found that the system has demonstrated limitations. For example, guidance from the Office of Management Budget (OMB) required that agencies collect specific contract award data, but the system did not have the capability to do so.", "Small Business Participation: The Panel found a number of challenges hindering agencies' efforts to meet small business goals. GAO has found small business participation has increased, but many agencies are not in full compliance with requirements governing Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs). For example, the directors of these offices should report directly to agency heads or their deputies, but not all agencies have established this type of direct reporting relationship."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report, but it has made numerous recommendations in the past.

Federal statute, policy and best practices emphasize the need for valid,  clear, and achievable requirements early in the acquisition process. An example of a  requirement for a major weapon system could include the range that a missile must be  able to travel, while a requirement for a service acquisition could include an engineer\u2019s  experience and education.   In 2007, the Panel found that defining requirements is key to achieving the benefits of  competition because procurements with clear requirements are far more likely to  produce competitive, fixed-price offers that meet customer needs. The Panel also found  that the government invested in requirements definition less than the private sector, and  that better requirements definition would help facilitate implementation of performance- based acquisition (PBA). PBA is a preferred acquisition approach that focuses on  contractors\u2019 deliverables rather than how they perform the work.", "We have found that federal agencies continue to face challenges  involving acquisition requirements definition.", "Congress passed a defense acquisition reform law with requirements- related provisions in 2009, but our work shows that DOD often begins  programs with unrealistic requirements.", "Agencies have not consistently complied with OMB\u2019s requirements  relating to key provisions from an information technology (IT)  acquisition reform law.", "Numerous efforts have been made to improve and encourage  commercial item procurements in an attempt to take advantage of  market innovations and reduce acquisition costs.", "DOD and GSA have taken steps to improve how personnel define  requirements for service acquisitions, and to focus more on  contractors\u2019 deliverables than on how the contractors perform the  work, but officials told us that some acquisition officials are reluctant  to cede control of the acquisition to contractors.", "We elaborate on these points below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2009 Defense Acquisition Reform Law Included Provisions Related to Requirements Definition, but DOD Still Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The 2009 Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) included  provisions related to requirements definition for major defense acquisition  programs.

It also suggested that the requirements  system focus on capabilities needed to  achieve strategic objectives instead of  predefined systems.", "However, we have also observed and reported that DOD has struggled to  adequately define requirements for its largest acquisition programs. For  example, in 2014, we found that cost and schedule growth in major  acquisition programs can, in part, be traced to a culture in which the  military services begin programs with unrealistic requirements. This cost  and schedule growth decreases DOD\u2019s buying power, reducing the  aggregate military capability the department can deliver over time.", "In 2017, we found that the Army\u2019s requirements development workforce  had decreased by 22 percent since 2008, with some requirements  development centers reporting more significant reductions.

Federal agencies can purchase commercial items to  meet many requirements, from the relatively simple, such as office  furnishings and housekeeping services, to the more complex, such as  maintenance services and space vehicles. Further, contracting officers  can use streamlined solicitation procedures\u2014which can reduce the time  needed to solicit offers from vendors\u2014if they determine that the product  or service being procured is commercial.  We reported that federal  agencies used commercial item procedures for over $100 billion of goods  and services in 2015.", "The issue of commercial item procurements has been a concern of  Congress for a number of years. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, and four  of its predecessor acts, Congress specified how DOD is to define and  purchase commercial items. For example, a fiscal year 2017 provision  set a preference for certain commercial services, such as facilities-related  or knowledge-based services, by prohibiting defense agencies from  entering into non-commercial contracts above $10 million to meet those  requirements without a written determination that no commercial services  can meet the agency\u2019s needs.", "Section 809 Panel  In its January 2018 report, the Section 809  Panel proposed a new approach for using  commercial items to meet requirements. The  panel proposed that Congress and the  Department of Defense (DOD) tailor the  department\u2019s acquisition approach based on  the level of customization a given product  entails. For readily available commercial  items, or those requiring minor customization,  the panel stated that DOD should be willing  and able to reduce management and  oversight to capitalize on the nondefense  marketplace.  In its June 2018 report, the Section 809 Panel  suggested additional statutory and regulatory  changes to simplify commercial item  procurements.", "In January 2018, DOD revised its regulations and corresponding  procedures, guidance, and information related to the procurement of  commercial items to reflect recent legislative changes. DOD also  updated its acquisition regulations to provide guidance to contracting  officers for making price reasonableness determinations, promoting  consistency in making commercial item determinations, and expanding  opportunities for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with  DOD. The Department also updated its Guidebook for Acquiring  Commercial Items, which includes information on how to define,  determine, and price commercial items, to reflect the regulatory  changes.", "DOD has also created six commercial item Centers of Excellence to  provide analytical support and assist in both the timeliness and  consistency of commercial item determinations.

The centers also provide training and  assistance to the DOD acquisition community on various techniques and  tools used to evaluate commercial items and commercial item pricing.", "Finally, the fiscal year 2018 NDAA directed GSA to establish a program to  procure commercial items through commercial e-commerce portals,  which can generally be described as online marketplaces.

We\u2019ve also previously reported that  services contracts are sometimes awarded for professional and  management support services that can put contractors in a position to  inappropriately influence government decisionmaking if proper oversight  is not provided. As we previously reported, in 2009, DOD\u2019s Defense  Acquisition University introduced a Services Acquisition Workshop to  provide training and guidance on developing service acquisition  requirements. The workshop brings together the key personnel  responsible for an acquisition to discuss the requirements and how they  will know if a contractor has met those requirements. During the  workshop, the teams develop the language that will articulate the  requirements, and by the end of the process, the goal is to have draft  acquisition documents. We reported in 2013 that DOD mandated the use  of the workshop for service acquisitions valued at $1 billion and above,  and encouraged its use for acquisitions valued at $100 million or more.", "Performance-based acquisition (PBA) is, as the Panel reported in 2007, a  preferred commercial technique. PBA focuses on contractors\u2019  deliverables rather than how they perform the work. Rather than using  traditional statements of work that define requirements in great detail,  PBA uses performance work statements (PWS) that define requirements  more generally based on desired outcomes. We have reported that  defining requirements this way has been a struggle for DOD for several  years. Additionally, we have found that implementing PBA can be  particularly challenging when acquiring certain services. Services differ  from products in several aspects and can offer challenges when  attempting to define requirements and establish measurable,  performance-based outcomes.", "In 2012, we found that the Defense Acquisition University developed an  Acquisition Requirements Roadmap Tool, which is an online resource  designed to help personnel write requirements for PBA and create pre- award documents, including requirements documents, using a  standardized template. Additionally, in 2018, GSA updated its Steps to  Performance-Based Acquisition guidance for managing PBAs and made  sample PBA planning documents available to contracting officers across  the federal government. The updated PBA guidance is a start-to-finish set  of instructions for planning and executing a PBA, and the planning  documents include examples of requirements documents, such as  performance work statements, which set forth the contractor\u2019s expected  outcomes for the acquisition.", "During the course of this review, we identified that some cultural  resistance to PBA has endured. Under PBA, which is structured around  the results to be achieved as opposed to the manner in which the work is  to be performed, a PWS may be prepared by a contractor in response to  an agency\u2019s statement of objectives. A PWS is a type of statement of  work that describes the required results in clear, specific and objective  terms with measurable outcomes. While some DOD and GSA officials  reported that PBA has become an increasingly standard approach, other  DOD officials told us that some acquisition officials are still reluctant to  give contractors control over how agencies\u2019 requirements will be met  under PBA because they fear that they may not get what they need. The  officials we spoke with asserted it is difficult to overcome decades of  conducting federal acquisition using government-drafted statements of  work that outline\u2014often in precise detail\u2014how an agency expects a  contractor to perform work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Issue Area 2: Competition and Pricing", "paragraphs": ["Issue Area Context  Federal regulations generally require that agencies determine that the prices proposed  by contractors are fair and reasonable before purchasing goods or services. Agencies  normally establish a fair and reasonable price through competitions where multiple  offerors submit proposals. Competition is considered the cornerstone of a sound  acquisition process and a critical tool for the government. It helps agencies achieve the  best prices and return on investment for taxpayers.   Federal statutes and regulations permit agencies to award contracts noncompetitively  in certain circumstances. Under those circumstances, agencies may obtain other types  of data\u2014for example via market research\u2014to determine whether prices proposed by  contractors are fair and reasonable.   In 2007, the Panel found that the private sector relied heavily on competition and  rigorous market research to effectively and efficiently buy products and services. The  Panel also found the federal government could improve competition and pricing through  greater adoption of commercial practices. Further, the Panel cited our prior findings  about interagency contracting\u2014a contracting approach in which an agency either  places an order directly against another agency\u2019s indefinite-delivery contract, or uses  another agency\u2019s contracting operation to obtain goods or services. This approach can  reduce the prices the government pays for goods and services, but we had found that  interagency contracts did not always adhere to federal procurement laws, regulations,  and sound contracting practices.", "We have found that federal agencies\u2019 efforts to increase competition and  improve pricing have had limited success.", "OFPP and DOD have taken steps to increase competition rates, but  the government-wide competition rate has remained steady, while  DOD\u2019s rate has declined over the past 5 years.", "Agencies facing acquisition planning obstacles are sometimes using  bridge contracts, which we have generally defined as extensions to  existing contracts or new short-term, sole-source contracts to avoid a  lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a follow-on contract.

Obtaining adequate  data rights, such as unlimited rights in technical data, for instance, can  allow the government to use, modify, and release the technical data  used to design, produce, support, maintain, or operate an item,  among other things. A long-standing factor impacting DOD\u2019s  competition rate has been its reliance on original equipment  manufacturers throughout the life cycle of a program because of a  previous decision not to purchase adequate data rights.", "In 2013, we found that DOD may be missing opportunities to  effectively facilitate competition in future acquisitions for products and  services previously acquired non-competitively. We reviewed  justifications for why awards were non-competitive and found that  some of them provided limited insight into reasons for the  noncompetitive award, or did not fully describe actions that the  agency could take to bring about competitive awards in future  acquisitions of the same goods or services. We recommended that  DOD identify, track, and consider the specific factors that affect  competition when setting competition goals and develop guidance to  apply lessons learned from past procurements to help achieve  competition in the future.

Congress has established, and the Small Business  Administration (SBA) maintains, goals for small business participation in federal  contracting. SBA also manages several programs targeted at increasing participation  by particular business types, including: Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Businesses, and  those in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone). Agency-specific goals  are established through negotiation between SBA and the respective agency.   In 2007, the Panel found a number of challenges hindering agencies\u2019 efforts to achieve  small business participation goals. In particular, the Panel made recommendations  focused on a lack of parity across small business types (identifying that some statutes  appeared to prioritize certain small business programs over others), consolidation or  bundling of contract requirements, and how small businesses are prioritized under  multiple award contracts (contracts awarded to two or more contractors under a single  solicitation).", "We found that small business participation in government contracting has  increased over the past few years, but small business advocates report  emerging concerns, and agencies struggle with policy compliance.", "Executive branch agencies have increased small business  participation over time.", "Small business advocates have expressed concerns that category  management will reduce the number of small businesses eligible for a  given opportunity; the executive branch has taken some steps to  address such concerns.", "Most agencies did not demonstrate that they are in full compliance  with requirements involving their small business offices.", "SBA has improved how it assesses firms\u2019 eligibility for small business  programs, but we found it should do more to oversee its women- owned small business program and its HUBZone program.", "We elaborate on these points below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Have Met More Small Business Goals Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Section 809 Panel  Federal agencies continue to address  challenges related to small business  participation.

In its January 2018  report, the Section 809 Panel recommended  that DOD refocus its small business policies  and programs to prioritize the department\u2019s  mission, among other things.", "Since the Panel issued its report in 2007, Congress and executive branch  agencies have continued efforts to encourage small business  participation, with improved results over time. In the 2010 Small  Business Jobs Act, Congress addressed the three primary small business  issues raised by the Panel. These issues included taking action on issues  of parity, requiring justifications and reporting for contract bundling, and  addressing small business concerns about multiple award contracts,  among other things.", "Meanwhile, executive branch agencies have also taken steps to  encourage small business participation. For example:", "GSA strongly supports small business participation in its Federal  Supply Schedules program. The schedule program provides federal  agencies a simplified method of purchasing commercial products and  services at prices associated with volume buying. GSA set aside  some specific schedule categories\u2014such as photographic services  and library furniture\u2014for small businesses. GSA also developed a  forecasting tool in 2016, intended to give small businesses a preview  of upcoming federal contracting opportunities.", "In a 2013 rule, SBA clarified how contracting officers should assign  small business codes under multiple award contracts. North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are the basis  for SBA\u2019s size standards; therefore, the NAICS code that a  contracting officer assigns determines whether a firm is eligible for  small business set-asides. In its rule, SBA observed that when NAICS  codes are assigned to a multiple award contract solicitation, a  business concern may be small for one or some of the NAICS codes,  but not all. In that situation, an agency could receive small business  credit on an order for an award to a \u201csmall business\u201d where a firm  qualifies as small for any NAICS code assigned to the contract, even  though the business is not small for the NAICS code that was  assigned or that should have been assigned to that particular order.  SBA\u2019s rule stated that, to ensure small businesses receive the awards  that are intended for them, contracting officers should assign NAICS  codes to discrete components of a contract in certain circumstances.  The contracting officers we interviewed stated that assigning a NAICS  code can be challenging when one or more codes could apply to a  contract and we noted that SBA\u2019s rule may further clarify code  assignment for these officials. However, updates to the FAR are  required to fully implement SBA\u2019s final rule. This FAR rule-making  process is ongoing.", "In fiscal year 2017, the federal government met three of its five  government-wide small business participation goals.

Because category management includes streamlining the number of  available contracts, small business advocates\u2014including officials at DOD  and SBA\u2014have told us that they worry the initiative will reduce the  number of small businesses eligible for a given opportunity, and that the  number of small businesses awarded federal contracts may fall.", "The executive branch has taken some steps to provide small businesses  with contracting opportunities through category management. For  example, the category management effort includes a set of cross-agency  priority goals that include small business utilization. Another element of  category management identifies best-in-class contracting vehicles that  are recommended for agency use. Some best-in-class vehicles under  category management focus on small business providers, including  GSA\u2019s Alliant Small Business vehicle that provides IT solutions.  Additionally, in 2015, we found that DHS\u2019s \u201con-ramp/off-ramp\u201d  mechanisms offered an option to help maintain a pool of eligible small  businesses by reopening an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity  vehicle\u2019s solicitation to new small business vendors after participating  businesses outgrew their small size status and left the program.

As  we reported in August 2017, noncompliance with these legislative  requirements may limit the extent to which an office can advocate for  small businesses, and we made recommendations to 19 agencies to  come into full compliance with these OSDBU requirements or report to  Congress on why they have not.
