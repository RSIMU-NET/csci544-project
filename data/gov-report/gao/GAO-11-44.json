Executive Order 12862 (September 11, 1993) and a related 1995 memorandum require agencies to post customer service standards and report results to customers. As requested, this report (1) assesses the extent to which federal agencies are setting customer service standards and measuring related results, (2) assesses the extent to which agencies are reporting standards and results to customers and using the results to improve service, and (3) identifies some customer service management tools and practices used by various governments. The report also examines the steps the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is taking to facilitate agency use of tools and practices. GAO surveyed 13 federal services among those with the most contact with the public, reviewed literature and interviewed agency officials as well as knowledgeable individuals in the area of customer service."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All 13 government services GAO surveyed had established customer service standards, which varied in their form from quantitative standards based on hourly, daily, monthly or annual averages to general commitments to qualitative standards. All 13 services reported having measures of customer service, such as measures of wait times or accuracy of service and 11 services had measures of customer satisfaction. For example, the National Park Service surveys visitors at over 320 points of service through a survey card program. All services had methods to receive customer complaints, and all had methods of gathering ideas from front line employees to improve customer service. Although standards exist, GAO found that the surveyed services' standards were often made available in a way that would not be easy for customers to find and access or, in the case of two services, were not made available to the public at all. For example, five services made standards available in long, detailed documents mostly focused on other topics, such as annual performance plans, performance and accountability reports, and budget justifications. About half of the services reported customer service results in similar types of documents. All services reported comparing customer service results to the standards and using the results to improve internal processes. For example, Customs and Border Protection officials told GAO that after they studied wait times at land borders and airports, they made facility enhancements and staff assignment changes. At one port of entry, these changes reduced wait times by more than half. However, some services have not compared performance to the private sector, as required by the Executive Order. Most services reported considering customer service measures in employee performance appraisals. For example, according to IRS officials, the performance appraisals for all employees who provide taxpayer assistance are based in part on critical job elements related to customer satisfaction. GAO identified several customer service tools and practices government agencies have used to improve customer service, such as engaging customers through social media, providing self service options and offering redress for unmet standards. Additionally, OMB has begun an initiative to identify and share private sector best practices among federal agencies and to develop a dashboard where agencies can make customer service standards available. Building on the progress made under this initiative, OMB could evaluate the benefits and costs of applying these tools and practices on a more widespread basis and share those that are found to be beneficial."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB (1) direct agencies to consider options to make customer service standards and results more readily available and (2) collaborate with the President's Management Advisory Board and agencies to evaluate the benefits and costs of applying the tools and practices identified in this report, and include those found beneficial in its related initiative. OMB had no comments on the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has set a goal of providing service to the public  that matches or exceeds the best service available in the private sector. It  is therefore critical for agencies to gauge how their customer services are  meeting the needs of their customers to sustain and focus agency efforts in  continuing improvements. Federal agencies interact with the public in a  vast number of individual transactions between federal employees and an  individual. The circumstances and expectations for service vary based on  the particular transaction as government services include diverse  functions such as providing information, benefits, regulation, and  enforcement.", "Both Congress and the executive branch have taken actions to increase  the value of these transactions to those the government serves. In 1993  Congress enacted the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA),  which was intended, in part, to improve federal program effectiveness by  promoting a new focus on results, service quality, and customer  satisfaction. The same year, in order to carry out the principles of the  National Performance Review, President Clinton issued Executive Order  12862, which required agencies to post customer service standards and  measure results against them. In 1995, President Clinton issued a  presidential memorandum to the heads of executive departments and  agencies on improving customer service which instructed agencies to treat  the requirements of the Executive Order as continuing requirements. This  memorandum is still in effect. More recently, legislation titled the \u201cFederal  Customer Service Enhancement Act\u201d has been introduced in Congress that  would, among other things, require the establishment of customer service  standards and performance measures for federal agencies.", "In light of your interest in determining how federal agencies are currently  using customer service standards and measures, you asked us to (1) assess  the extent to which federal agencies are setting customer service  standards and measuring results against these standards, (2) assess the  extent to which federal agencies are reporting standards and results to  customers and using the results to improve service, and (3) identify some  customer service management tools and practices used by local, state,  federal, and other national governments. In addition, we examined the  steps the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is taking to facilitate  federal agency use of tools and practices to improve customer service.", "To assess whether and how federal agencies are setting customer service  standards, measuring results, reporting those results and using them to  improve service, we conducted a survey, based on the requirements of the  Executive Order and the related memorandum, of 13 services provided by  federal agencies that are among those with the most widespread contact  with the public. Services were chosen for the survey based on a list of  agencies with the most contact with the public developed by the National  Performance Review in the late 1990s, input from subject matter experts,  and available public data. Services included in the survey were:    Recreational facilities and services provided by the Forest Service    Student loans under the Direct Loan Program provided by Federal    Visitor and interpretive services provided by the National Park Service    Health insurance under Medicare provided by the Centers for Medicare    Medical care provided by the Indian Health Service    Border security inspection of individuals provided by Customs and    Passenger and baggage screening provided by the Transportation    Passport services provided by the Bureau of Consular Affairs    Provision of tax information and advice to individuals provided by the    Disability compensation provided by the Veterans Benefits    Life insurance provided by the Veterans Benefits Administration    Medical care provided by the Veterans Health Administration    Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security  Income provided by the Social Security Administration  To gain a fuller understanding of the survey responses, we selected five of  the services with varying answers to key questions on the survey for  follow-up interviews to discuss their responses.", "We did not evaluate the overall effectiveness of or level of customer  service provided by any of the services reviewed.", "To obtain input from services with a lower volume of contact with the  public, services with different missions or goals than those that were  surveyed, and services that serve government customers and are not  subject to the requirements of the Executive Order, we selected an  additional five services for interview. These five services were:    Regulation of power plants and other uses of nuclear materials by the    Health and safety information provided by the Centers for Disease    Research and education grants provided by the National Science    Procurement of goods and services for the government provided by the    Federal agency property management services provided by Public  Building Services  To assess significant customer service management practices used by  local, state, federal and other national governments that may be  considered for application by federal agencies, we conducted a review of  relevant literature, such as industry, academic, and management journals  dealing with customer service practices and an annual evaluation of  customer service provided by national governments published each year  since 2000. In addition, we interviewed knowledgeable current and former  researchers and practitioners with experience managing or designing  government performance improvement initiatives, such as the National  Performance Review and the Government Performance and Results Act  (GPRA) at the federal level or similar initiatives at the state and local level,  experience implementing, in a government setting, one or more of the  customer service management tools and practices we identified in our  literature review, or had been identified in our literature review as  contributing to the field of public sector customer service. We also  gathered information from seven local, state, or non-U.S. national  governments and incorporated information received from federal agencies  through survey and interviews.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 to October 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

GPRA requires executive agencies to develop strategic plans,  prepare annual performance plans, measure performance toward the  achievement of goals in the annual plans and report annually on their  progress.", "Building on GPRA and in carrying out the principles of the National  Performance Review (NPR), on September 11, 1993, President Clinton  issued Executive Order 12862, which remains in effect. The order created  several requirements for agencies related to customer service. Specifically,  the order stated that all executive departments and agencies that provide  significant services directly to the public shall provide customer service  equal to the best in business and shall take the following actions:  identify the customers who are, or should be, served by the agency    survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they  want and their level of satisfaction with existing services    post service standards and measure results against them    benchmark customer service performance against the best in business    survey frontline employees on barriers to, and ideas for, matching the    provide customers with choices in both the sources of service and the    make information, services, and complaint systems easily accessible    provide means to address customer complaints  On March 23, 1995, President Clinton issued a presidential memorandum  on improving customer service, which stated that the standards agencies  had begun issuing in response to Executive Order 12862 had told the  federal government\u2019s customers for the first time what they had a right to  expect when they asked for services. The memorandum instructed  agencies to treat the requirements of Executive Order 12862 as continuing  requirements and stated that the actions the order prescribes, including  surveying customers and employees and benchmarking, shall be  continuing agency activities. The memorandum further provided that  standards should be published in a form readily available to customers,  and that services that are delivered in partnership with state and local  governments, services delivered by small agencies and regulatory  agencies, and customer services of enforcement agencies are covered by  the requirement to set and publish customer service standards. It further  stated that agencies shall, on an ongoing basis, measure results achieved  against the customer service standards and report those results to  customers at least annually in terms readily understood by individual  customers, and that measurement systems should include objective  measures wherever possible, but should also include customer satisfaction  as a measure. Finally, the memorandum stated that agencies should  publish replacement customer service standards if needed to reflect  customer views on what matters most to them.", "According to the last NPR report on customer service in 1997, 570 federal  departments, agencies, organizations, and programs issued a total of 4,000  customer services standards. The NPR report was accompanied by a  database through which customers could search for standards of interest  or browse standards by customer group, such as beneficiaries, veterans,  and businesses. For example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service  issued a standard that it would complete action on naturalization  applications within 6 months, and the Department of Health and Human  Services issued a standard for Medicare and Medicaid that 80 percent of  callers would be on hold for less than 2 minutes. In addition, the report  stated that for 2,800 of the 4,000 standards, results of performance against  the standards had been identified and were the basis for changes and  improvements in the delivery of service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Selected Services Have Customer Service Standards and Measure Results of Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "All Surveyed Services Established and Reviewed Standards", "paragraphs": ["All 13 services we surveyed had established customer service standards.  Officials from the Indian Health Service (IHS), which provides medical  care for American Indians and Alaska Natives, told us their customer  service standards are established by their area offices and facilities. The  other services had standards that applied service-wide.", "The services\u2019 standards varied in their form. Some standards were general  commitments to qualitative standards, often stating commitments to meet  certain identified customer rights. Other standards were structured  quantitatively and based on daily, monthly, or annual averages. The  Bureau of Consular Affairs, for example, had standards that include  general commitments to qualitative standards for Passport Services, such  as \u201cWe will provide service in a courteous, professional manner,\u201d as well  as commitments to meet customer rights, such as \u201cYou have the right to  speak with management if you are not satisfied with the service you have  received.\u201d Some of the standards from IHS area offices and facilities also  stated general commitments to qualified standards such as, \u201chave pride in  our appearance, and provide a pleasant greeting,\u201d while other IHS area  offices and facilities had individual level quantitative standards, which  included, \u201canswering phone calls within three rings.\u201d The Veterans  Benefits Administration (VBA) has established several quantitative  standards for customer service related to their Veterans\u2019 Group Life  Insurance (VGLI) program, including averages such as the speed of answer  for their call center, which is set at 20 seconds, as well as call  abandonment rates, which they set at 2 percent. Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) has similar quantitative standards for their Medical  Care program, such as a standard for the number of new patient  appointments completed within 30 days of the appointment create date.", "All services reported that they had reviewed their standards within the last  year. For example, VGLI told us that they review standards annually, and  2 years ago changed the standard for e-mail response time from 48 to 24  hours based on this review. Similarly, Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  officials told us that standards for taxpayer assistance are reviewed to see  if they need updating three times per year by executives, directors, and  managers, and the Forest Service told us that they review standards for  recreational facilities and services as part of their annual performance  reporting required by GPRA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nearly All Surveyed Services Have Measures of Customer Service and Customer Satisfaction", "paragraphs": ["All 13 of the surveyed services reported having measures of customer  service, and 11 of the services reported having measures of satisfaction.

CBP submitted the planned survey for review  and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on  September 1, 2010. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  has methods of gathering input from customers by phone or e-mail  through their Customer Contact Center, through the \u201cTSA Blog\u201d and \u201cTalk  to TSA\u201d feedback Web site, or through speaking with a TSA manager at the  airport; however, they do not have measures of satisfaction.", "All the services reported they measure customer service at least annually,  and all 11 services that measured customer satisfaction reported doing so  at least annually as well. In addition, many services measured more  frequently. Eleven of the surveyed services measure customer satisfaction  daily, for example, and 8 reported that they measure customer service  daily.", "The surveyed services reported measuring various aspects of their  customer service. Customer service measures can include measures  related to customer access to services, wait times, accuracy and other  factors. Eleven surveyed services had measures related to quality or  accuracy of service. For example, IRS measures the accuracy of responses  provided by service representatives to questions on both tax law and  taxpayers\u2019 accounts by listening to and reviewing phone calls. Ten services  had measures related to customer wait times, eight had measures of  processing time, and eight had measures related to access times. For  example, Passport Services measures wait times for customers applying in  a passport agency office, application processing times, and the number of  passport book re-writes due to errors made by Passport Services.  Similarly, for VGLI, VBA measures the percentage of calls that receive  busy signals and the average speed of answer, as well as processing time  for disbursements, applications, and correspondence.", "All surveyed services but TSA and CBP reported gathering input from  customers regarding their level of satisfaction through surveys. The  National Park Service (NPS), for instance, reported using a visitor survey  card program to survey visitors at over 320 of its points of service. These  surveys are conducted annually at NPS units to measure performance  related to visitor satisfaction and visitor understanding of park  significance.", "Four surveyed services stated that they use the American Customer  Satisfaction Index (ACSI) to gather and report results. ACSI is a  standardized customer satisfaction survey that measures customer  satisfaction for a particular service based on drivers of satisfaction,  including customer expectations and perceived quality. Overall results of  the ACSI survey are made available on the ACSI public Web site,  http://www.theacsi.org, where results can be compared among federal  agencies that use the survey. Participating agencies receive more detailed  results that contain information, trends, and recommendations for areas to  work on to improve results. Federal Student Aid (FSA), which provides  student loans under the direct loan program, for instance, uses an  independent third-party contractor to conduct the ACSI survey on FSA\u2019s  behalf. Officials stated that from the results of ACSI, they determined that  some of the responses that they were providing customers on telephone  calls were not achieving satisfactory marks, which led FSA to start a task  force to address the issue.", "In addition to customer surveys, most services also employed other  methods through which they gathered customer input. The most common  of these were comments cards or suggestion boxes (seven services),  telephone numbers (seven services), and e-mail or written correspondence  (five services). For instance, Social Security Administration (SSA) officials  stated that customers have the opportunity to either complete comment  cards at field offices, or send letters to field offices regarding their  satisfaction with the service received. Passport Services officials stated  that they gather input from customers by having them complete comment  cards while being served at a passport agency. Additional methods  services reported using for gathering input include focus groups, e-mail  lists, conferences, and outreach campaigns. IHS, for instance, uses patient  satisfaction surveys, telephone surveys, a director\u2019s blog, personal  interviews, an incident reporting process, tribal negotiation meetings,  suggestion boxes, and a patient needs task force to gather input from  customers.", "All surveyed services reporting having methods to receive customer  complaints. In addition to general methods of gathering input described  above, many agencies reported using additional methods to receive  complaints. These included complaint forms on the agency Web site,  identifying service mailing addresses to receive complaints, providing  customers with additional telephone numbers to provide feedback, and  general feedback forms and survey cards about the service they received.  For example, VBA reported that they use a public message management  system called the Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS) for  receiving inquiries, including complaints, for beneficiary medical care and  disability service.

The PRA requires federal agencies to  minimize the burden on the public resulting from their information  collections, and to maximize the practical utility of the information  collected. To comply with the PRA process, agencies must develop and  review proposed collections to ensure that they meet the goals of the act.  Once approved internally, agencies generally must publish a 60-day notice  in the Federal Register soliciting public comment on the agency\u2019s  proposed collection, consider the public comments, submit the proposed  collection to OMB and publish a second Federal Register notice inviting  public comment to the agency and OMB. OMB may act on the agency\u2019s  request only after the 30-day comment period has closed. Under the PRA,  OMB determines whether a proposed collection is necessary for the  proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the  information will have practical utility. The PRA gives OMB 60 days to  approve or disapprove a proposed collection, however, OMB can also  instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change to the  proposed collection.", "There are two primary ways that the normal clearance process can be  altered. First, agencies may request and OMB may authorize emergency  processing under certain circumstances. Second, agencies may submit  generic information collection requests, which are requests for OMB  approval of a plan for conducting more than one information collection  using very similar methods, such as a plan to gather views from the public  through a series of customer satisfaction surveys. The plan itself is subject  to the standard 60- and 30-day public comment periods, but, if approved,  each specific collection under the plan requires only OMB review and  approval without additional public comment, subject to the terms of the  original generic clearance.", "According to some agency officials, the Paperwork Reduction Act  clearance process may, in certain instances, make obtaining customer  input difficult. A March 2009 report from the Government Contact Center  Council, an interagency group of contact center directors and managers  sponsored by the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Office of  Citizen Services, notes that although the PRA is important and affords  many safeguards and benefits, the council commonly hears from agencies  that the approval process takes 9 months or longer, in fact, so long that  sometimes a survey is no longer relevant. The report recommended that  OMB lead a task force to help to fully understand the implications of the  Paperwork Reduction Act for agencies and to identify ways to minimize  the length of time it takes for an agency to get approval for surveys  intended for citizens.", "Two services we surveyed told us that the PRA clearance process made  obtaining customer input difficult. NPS officials referred us to the letter of  input they provided in response to OMB\u2019s Federal Register notice seeking  comment on, among other things, reducing paperwork burdens and  avoiding adverse consequences of the PRA clearance process. In the  letter, NPS stated that lengthy delays in obtaining approval of information  collections such as visitor surveys under the PRA sometimes causes  research to be postponed or even abandoned. In addition, Forest Service  officials told us that the time needed to obtain clearance for surveys is a  major barrier in gathering input from customers on their level of  satisfaction. Forest Service officials told us that because approval for new  collections of information often takes in excess of a year, which is in  addition to the time for collection, data entry, and reporting, it is not  possible to include customer input in many time-sensitive decisions.", "OMB representatives noted that the reported lengths of time to clear  submissions include the time for internal agency development and  processing and that some delays can be the result of inappropriate  submissions. OMB representatives told us that once an Information  Collection Request (ICR) is submitted to OMB, the average time for review  at OMB is typically less than the required sixty days.", "According to OMB representatives, the time to obtain clearance could be  reduced by using generic clearances, if the collections meet the criteria for  generic clearances. Some other agencies we contacted also told us that the  generic clearance process made PRA requirements manageable for  surveying. For example, SSA officials told us that obtaining OMB  clearance for its surveys had not presented a challenge, and that this was  facilitated by a generic clearance for satisfaction surveys that SSA has had  since the mid-1990s. Likewise, FSA officials told us that the expedited  review process associated with a generic clearance allows it to get surveys  approved within 10 to 15 days and that most problems with surveys that  arise during the process are quickly resolved.", "As required by a presidential memorandum issued on January 21, 2009,  OMB issued an Open Government Directive, which among other things,  instructs the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs (OIRA) to review existing OMB policies, such as PRA guidance, to  identify impediments to open government and the use of new  technologies, and where necessary, issue clarifying guidance and/or  propose policy revisions. OMB recently released three memorandums  containing clarifying guidance to improve the implementation of the PRA.  The memorandums provide information for federal agencies to facilitate  their understanding of PRA clearances and when and how they can be  used.

In 2005, the  government of Canada reorganized its diverse set of service providers  under one umbrella service organization, called Service Canada, that  offers citizens a single point of access to a wide range of government  services and seeks to make access to services easier, quicker, and more  convenient. As one part of its efforts to improve service delivery, Service  Canada crafted a segmentation strategy centered around seven  subpopulations: workers, seniors, people with disabilities, Aboriginal  people, newcomers to Canada, youth, and families. Service Canada then  tailored its service delivery processes to the needs of each subpopulation.  Specifically, Service Canada outlined priority service issues for each  population segment, as well as marketing approaches tailored to better  inform customers about available services. For instance, to improve its  outreach to Aboriginal populations, Service Canada created fact sheets in  11 Aboriginal languages, hired staff that spoke Aboriginal languages and  modified the distribution of office locations to better serve remote and  northern communities. Service Canada attributes improved results in the  areas of citizen satisfaction, access to services and efficiency of service  delivery to the implementation of its segmentation strategy.", "Organizations can also use social media to better understand and engage  their customers. Social media can facilitate low effort communication  between customers and service providers. It allows service providers to  disseminate up to date and relevant information that may lead to improved  customer decision making, while also allowing customers to provide  feedback on their experiences. In order to encourage the use of social  media by federal agencies, the General Services Administration (GSA)  sponsors a Web site, http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/, that is managed by  the Federal Web Managers Council, an interagency group of Web  managers from every cabinet-level agency and numerous independent  agencies. The Web site contains information on the benefits of using social  media for customers of government agencies, as well as detailed advice on  social media best practices. For example, it states that agencies can use  microblogs to both provide timely information to citizens and improve  understanding of customer needs by searching microblogs for references  to their agency name or acronym.

As previously discussed, most of the services we surveyed already  consider customer service measures in employee performance appraisals,  though the extent and weight varied widely by job and service. However,  as noted earlier, there can be challenges to creating effective performance  standards for frontline employees. A primary concern is that some  performance standards, such as call duration, are easy to measure but  ignore the tradeoff between efficiency and quality customer service. Call  center employees being judged solely on call duration might sacrifice the  quality of the customer service they provide in order to end calls more  quickly. One solution is to create performance metrics that attempt to  balance operational efficiency and quality service. For example, telephone  agents at the nonemergency services call center in the city of Denver,  Colorado, are graded using a balanced scorecard which takes into account  both call duration and whether or not the agent resolved a customer\u2019s  issue without having to transfer the caller to another employee. Because  this measure emphasizes service quality, it serves to counterbalance the  incentive to rush through service calls. A representative from the Georgia  Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA) raised the additional concern that  including customer service measures in performance appraisals may be  perceived as a mechanism for placing blame on frontline employees. In  order to gain employee support, the OCA representative recommended  that agencies engage employees in the conversation about customer  service management and seek employee input about how management can  help them provide better customer service.

We  then interviewed the respondents to check whether (1) the questions were  clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms used were precise, (3) the  questionnaire was unbiased, and (4) the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on the officials completing it. We also submitted the  questionnaire for review by a GAO survey methodology expert and four  external reviewers who were experts on the topic of the survey (selected  based on their experience managing or designing government  performance improvement initiatives). We modified the questions based  on feedback from the pretests and reviews, as appropriate.", "We sent the questionnaire by e-mail to the individual identified by the  service as the lead respondent. We asked services to complete the  questionnaire within the electronic form and return it as an e-mail  attachment. All 13 services completed the questionnaire. We reviewed all  questionnaire responses and followed up by phone and e-mail to clarify  the responses as appropriate.", "We analyzed responses to closed-ended questions by counting and  summarizing the type and frequency of response for each of the 13  services. For responses to open-ended narrative questions, we coded the  responses from each service and created categories for the purpose of  organizing and summarizing the response of each service (e.g., methods  used to gather input from customers regarding their level of satisfaction  with the service).", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the  types of respondents who do not respond to a question can introduce  errors into the survey results. We included steps in both the data  collection and data analysis stages to minimize such nonsampling errors.  As indicated above, we collaborated with GAO survey specialists to design  and review draft questionnaires, versions of the questionnaire were  pretested with four officials from services not included in our survey but  who were in positions similar to the respondents who would complete our  survey, we asked several external experts to review and comment on a  draft of the questionnaire, and we revised the questionnaire as necessary  to reduce the likelihood of nonresponse and reporting errors on our  questions. We examined the survey results and performed computer  analyses to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error, and  addressed such issues as necessary. A second, independent analyst  checked the accuracy of all computer analyses to minimize the likelihood  of errors in data processing. In addition, GAO analysts answered  respondent questions and resolved difficulties respondents had answering  our questions. For questions that asked respondents to provide a narrative  answer, we created content categories and had one analyst code each  response into one of the categories, and another analyst verify the coding.
