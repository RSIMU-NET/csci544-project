Therefore, more CBP officers will be required to review and analyze data for participating seaports. (2) Host nation examination practices: The SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts require DHS to develop standards for the scanning systems, but CBP lacks information on host nation equipment and practices. (3) Measuring performance: CBP has had difficulties defining performance measures for its container security programs; therefore, it will be difficult to assess if 100 percent scanning achieves increased security. (4) Resource responsibilities: Neither the SAFE Port Act nor the 9/11 Act specifies whether the United States would bear the costs of implementing 100 percent scanning. (5) Logistics: Space constraints can require seaports to place scanning equipment miles from where cargo containers are stored, and some containers are only available for scanning for a short period of time and may be difficult to access. (6) Technology and infrastructure: Environmental conditions can damage equipment and cause delays, and infrastructure capacity and equipment compatibility have presented difficulties in the SFI pilot program. (7) Use and ownership of data: Legislation specifies that scan data should be available to CBP officials, but the data are often generated and collected by foreign seaports and, in some cases, will require international agreements for transfer to CBP officials. (8) Consistency with risk management: International partners state that 100 percent scanning is inconsistent with accepted risk management principles and diverts resources away from other security threats. (9) Reciprocity and trade concerns: Foreign governments could call for reciprocity of 100 percent scanning, requiring the United States to scan cargo containers, and some view this requirement as a barrier to trade."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss challenges to 100 percent  scanning of U.S.-bound cargo containers. More than 700 foreign seaports  ship cargo containers to the United States and over 11 million oceangoing  cargo containers arrived at U.S. seaports last year. The terrorist attacks of  2001 heightened concerns about the potential vulnerability of U.S.-bound  cargo containers to terrorist exploitation, and the prevention of such  activity became a goal for the federal government.", "Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for preventing terrorists and  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) from entering the United States,  including the potential WMD threat posed by the movement of oceangoing  cargo containers. As it performs this mission, CBP maintains two  overarching and sometimes conflicting goals\u2014increasing security while  facilitating legitimate trade. To address these goals, CBP has developed a  layered security strategy that includes the Container Security Initiative  (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT).  The CSI program, begun in 2002, aims to deter and detect the smuggling of  WMD via cargo containers before they reach U.S. seaports. At the 58  seaports participating in the CSI program as of January 2008, foreign  governments allow CBP personnel to be stationed at the seaports and use  intelligence and automated risk assessment information to determine  whether U.S.-bound shipments are at risk of containing WMD or other  terrorist contraband\u2014a process referred to as targeting. CBP personnel  can then request that host government customs officials scan the  identified high-risk cargo. CBP also operates C-TPAT, a voluntary  partnership with the trade community, in which member companies  commit to improving the security of their supply chains and develop  security profiles that outline the companies\u2019 security measures. Because of  their cooperation, and after verification by CBP that such stronger  measures are in place, C-TPAT members are generally subjected to  reduced levels of CBP scrutiny of their shipments.", "To further address container security concerns, Congress passed, and the  President signed, the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port  Act in October 2006, which includes provisions that codified CSI and         C-TPAT, both of which had been CBP initiatives but not previously  required by law. In addition, the act calls for the establishment of a pilot  program to test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo  containers and directs CBP to require transmission of additional data from  importers and cargo carriers for improved targeting of U.S.-bound cargo  containers. CBP is implementing these requirements as part of its Secure  Freight Initiative (SFI) program. The SAFE Port Act also requires that 100  percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers be scanned using nonintrusive  imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment at foreign seaports  as soon as feasible. The SFI pilot program tests the feasibility of using this  equipment and implementing 100 percent scanning at seven foreign  seaports. In August 2007, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act (9/11 Act) was enacted, which revised the SAFE Port Act  provision on 100 percent scanning to require implementation by 2012, with  possible exceptions for seaports for which DHS certifies that specified  conditions exist.  These conditions include that adequate scanning  equipment is not available or cannot be integrated with existing systems, a  port does not have the physical characteristics to install the equipment, or  use of the equipment will significantly impact trade capacity and the flow  of cargo.", "We have issued several reports over the past few years relating to cargo  container security that include challenges that are also applicable to 100  percent scanning because of the similarities in the operations of the  programs reviewed and their overall purpose to strengthen cargo security.

To fulfill this  and other requirements of the SAFE Port Act, CBP and DOE jointly  announced the formation of SFI in December 2006. The first phase of SFI  is the International Container Security project\u2014commonly known as the  SFI pilot program. The SFI pilot program tests the feasibility of 100  percent scanning of U.S.-bound container cargo at seven overseas seaports  and involves the deployment of advanced cargo scanning equipment and  an integrated examination system. The advanced cargo scanning  equipment\u2014NII and radiation detection equipment\u2014produce data to  indicate the presence of illicit nuclear and radiological material in  containers. The integrated examination system then uses software to make  this information available to CBP for analysis.

For example, we reported in 2005 and again in 2008 that CBP\u2019s  human capital plan did not systematically determine the optimal number  of officers needed at each CSI seaport to carry out duties that require an  overseas presence (such as coordinating with host government officials or  witnessing the examinations they conduct) as opposed to duties that could  be performed remotely in the United States (such as reviewing  databases). Determining optimal staffing levels is particularly important  since CBP reports facing ongoing challenges identifying sufficient  numbers of qualified employees to staff the program. For example, CBP  officials reported that 9 qualified applicants applied for 40 permanent  positions at CSI seaports. We also reported that according to CBP officials,  to fill open CSI positions, officers have in some cases been deployed who  have not received all required training. We recommended in April 2005  that CBP revise the CSI staffing model to consider (1) what functions need  to be performed at CSI seaports and what can be performed in the United  States, (2) the optimum levels of staff needed at CSI seaports to maximize  the benefits of targeting and inspection activities in conjunction with host  nation customs officials, and (3) the cost of locating targeters overseas at  CSI seaports instead of in the United States. CBP agreed with our  recommendation on CSI\u2019s staffing model and said that modifications to the  model would allow program objectives to be achieved in a more cost- effective manner. CBP said that it would evaluate the minimum level of  staff needed at CSI seaports to maintain ongoing dialogue with host nation  officials, as well as assess the staffing levels needed domestically to  support CSI activities. However, as of January 2008, CBP\u2019s human capital  plan did not systematically make these determinations.", "The ability of the SFI pilot program\u2014and by extension the 100 percent  scanning requirement of the SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts\u2014to operate  effectively and enhance maritime container security depends, in part, on  the success of CBP\u2019s ability to manage and deploy staff in a way that  ensures that critical security functions are performed. Under the CSI  program, CBP operated and conducted cargo container scanning at 58  foreign seaports as of January 2008; however, given that additional  scanning equipment will be used in the SFI pilot program, and fulfilling the  100 percent scanning requirement will naturally increase the number of  containers to be scanned at the more than 700 seaports that ship cargo to  the United States, the SFI pilot program and 100 percent scanning  requirement will generate an increased quantity of scan data. According to  European customs officials, for there to be value added in these additional  scans, the scan data must be reviewed. Therefore, in implementing the 100  percent scanning requirement, CBP will face staffing challenges because  more CBP officers will be required to review and analyze these data from  participating seaports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Generally Lacks Key Information on Host Government Examination Systems Because of Sovereignty Constraints", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in January 2008, CBP does not systematically collect  information on CSI host governments\u2019 examination equipment or  processes. We noted that CBP must respect the sovereignty of countries  participating in CSI and, therefore, cannot require that a country use  specific scanning equipment or follow a set of prescribed examination  practices. Thus, while CBP has set minimum technical criteria to evaluate  the quality and performance of equipment being considered for use at  domestic seaports, it has no comparable standards for scanning equipment  used at foreign seaports. In addition, CBP officials stated that there are no  plans to evaluate examination equipment at foreign seaports against the  domestic criteria. CBP officials added, however, that the capabilities of  scanning equipment are only one element for determining the  effectiveness of examinations that take place at CSI seaports. It is better,  in their view, to make assessments of the processes, personnel, and  equipment that collectively constitute the host governments\u2019 entire  examination systems. However, in January 2008, we reported that CBP  does not gather this type of information and recommended that CBP, in  collaboration with host government officials, improve the information  gathered at each CSI port by (1) establishing general guidelines and  technical criteria regarding the minimal capability and operating  procedures for an examination system that can provide a basis for  determining the reliability of examinations and related CSI activities;       (2) systematically collecting data for that purpose; and (3) analyzing the  data against the guidelines and technical criteria to determine what, if any,  mitigating actions or incentives CBP should take to help ensure the  desired level of security. CBP partially concurred with this  recommendation in terms of improving the information gathered about  host governments\u2019 examination systems. In particular, CBP agreed on the  importance of an accepted examination process and noted that it  continues to improve the information it gathers. CBP did not indicate that  it would systematically pursue information on these host government  examination systems. It did state that it was working through the WCO to  address uniform technical standards for equipment. We reported that  while CBP engaged with international trade groups to develop supply  chain security requirements, these requirements do not specify particular  equipment capabilities or examination practices.", "Both the SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts require DHS to develop technical and  operational standards for scanning systems; therefore, the challenges that  CSI has faced in obtaining information about host governments\u2019  examination systems are relevant to the SFI pilot program and the 100  percent scanning requirement. However, as noted earlier in this  statement, the United States cannot compel foreign governments to use  specific equipment for the SFI pilot program or the 100 percent scanning  requirement, thus challenging CBP\u2019s ability to set and enforce standards.  In addition, because CBP does not systematically collect information on  the efficacy of host governments\u2019 examinations systems, it lacks  reasonable assurance that these examinations could reliably detect and  identify WMD unless it implements our January 2008 recommendation to  determine actions to take to ensure the desired level of security.

In the past, we and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have  acknowledged the difficulty in developing outcome-based performance  measures for programs that aim to deter or prevent specific behaviors. In  the case of C-TPAT, we noted in our March 2005 and April 2008 reports  that CBP had not developed a comprehensive set of performance  measures and indicators for the programs, such as outcome-based  measures, to monitor the status of program goals. A senior CBP official  stated that developing these measures for C-TPAT, as well as other CBP  programs, has been difficult because CBP lacks the data necessary to  determine whether a program has prevented or deterred terrorist activity.  We recommended that CBP complete the development of performance  measures, to include outcome-based measures and performance targets, to  track the program\u2019s status in meeting its strategic goals. CBP agreed with  our recommendation on developing performance measures, and had  developed initial measures relating to membership, inspection  percentages, and validation effectiveness.

According to CBP, the  average cost of initiating operations at CSI seaports was about $395,000 in  2004 and $227,000 in 2005. By comparison, CBP reported that it and DOE  have spent approximately $60 million, collectively, to implement 100  percent scanning at the three foreign seaports fully participating in the SFI  pilot program. The SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts did not require nor prohibit  the federal government from bearing the cost of scanning 100 percent of  U.S.-bound cargo containers. According to customs officials in the UK  who participated in the SFI pilot program at the Port of Southampton,  resource issues will inhibit their ability to implement permanently the 100  percent scanning requirement. For example, these customs officials  commented that to accommodate the SFI pilot program at the Port of  Southampton, existing customs staff had to be reallocated from other  functions. The UK customs officials further stated that this reallocation  was feasible for the 6-month pilot program, but it would not be feasible on  a permanent basis.

Seaports may  lack the space necessary to install additional scanning equipment needed  to comply with the 100 percent scanning requirement. For example, we  observed that scanning equipment at some seaports is located several  miles away from where cargo containers are stored, which could add to  the time and cost requirements for scanning these containers. Similarly,  while some seaports have natural bottlenecks that allow for container  scanning equipment to be placed such that all outgoing containers would  have to pass through the equipment, not all seaports are so configured,  and the potential exists for containers to be shipped to the United States  without being scanned. Another potential logistical vulnerability is related  to the transportation modes by which cargo containers arrive and pass  through seaports. For example, cargo containers that arrive at a seaport by  truck or rail are generally easier to isolate, whereas transshipment cargo  containers\u2014those moved from one vessel to another\u2014are only available  for scanning for a comparatively short time and may be more difficult to  access. For example, UK customs officials stated that it was not possible  to route transshipment containers that arrived by sea through the SFI  equipment. As a consequence, the scanning of transshipment containers  has not begun at the Port of Southampton. CBP and European customs  officials evaluating the SFI pilot program stated that while the pilot has  been comparatively successful at relatively lower-volume seaports, such  as Southampton, implementing 100 percent scanning would be  significantly more challenging at seaports with a higher volume of cargo  container traffic or greater percentages of transshipment cargo containers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology and Compatibility Issues Could Present Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The SFI pilot program currently faces technology challenges, such as  mechanical breakdowns of scanning equipment because of environmental  factors, inadequate infrastructure for the transmission of electronic  information, and difficulties in integrating different generations of  scanning equipment. Environmental conditions at some sites can  compromise the effectiveness of radiation detection equipment used in the  SFI pilot program. For example, two of the three seaports fully  participating in the SFI pilot program experienced weather-related  mechanical breakdowns of scanning equipment. Specifically, at the Port of  Southampton, a piece of radiation scanning equipment failed because of  rainy conditions and had to be replaced, resulting in 2 weeks of diminished  scanning capabilities. Additionally, Port Qasim in Pakistan has  experienced difficulties with scanning equipment because of the extreme  heat. Because of the range of climates at the more than 700 other  international seaports that ship cargo to the United States, these types of  technological challenges could be experienced elsewhere.", "The limited infrastructure at some foreign seaports poses a challenge to  the installation and operation of radiation detection equipment, as well as  to the electronic transmission of scan data to CBP officers in the United  States. Many seaports are located in remote areas that often do not have  access to reliable supplies of electricity or infrastructure needed to  operate radiation portal monitors and associated communication systems.  For example, at Port Salalah in Oman, a key challenge has been the cost of  data transmission, because of low bandwidth communications  infrastructure, to send data to the CBP officers who review the scans.  Prior to SFI, the CSI office in Port Salalah already used transmission  technology that cost annually about 10 times that of other SFI seaports. To  participate in SFI, CBP originally planned to procure additional technology  costing approximately $1.5 million each year to transmit the SFI data from  Port Salalah. However, CBP was able to devise a lower-cost option that  involved sharing communications infrastructure with existing CSI  operations at the port because U.S.-bound container volume is relatively  low in Oman. While CBP reported that this solution could keep data  transmission costs down at other low-volume seaports, it is unclear  whether this could be accomplished at higher-volume seaports. In addition  to compatibility with existing infrastructure, SFI seaports have  experienced compatibility issues with equipment from different  generations. According to CBP, there are various manufacturers of  equipment used at CSI seaports, and although the integration of equipment  and technology at SFI pilot program seaports has generally been  successful, it has not been without challenges. For example, at Port  Salalah integration of a large number of new pieces of equipment by new  vendors caused operational delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use and Ownership of Data Have Not Been Determined", "paragraphs": ["The legislation that mandated the SFI pilot program and 100 percent  scanning does not specify who will have the authority or responsibility to  collect, maintain, disseminate, view, or analyze scan data collected on  cargo containers bound for the United States.

Other unresolved questions include ownership of data, how proprietary  information is to be treated, and how privacy concerns are to be  addressed. For example, officials from UK Customs stated that UK privacy  legislation barred sharing information on cargo containers with CBP  unless a specific risk was associated with the containers. To comply with  UK laws, while still allowing CBP to obtain scan data on container cargo,  UK Customs and CBP negotiated working practices to allow CBP to use its  own handheld radiation scanning devices to determine whether cargo  containers emitted radiation, but this was only for purposes of the SFI  pilot program. According to the European Commission, for 100 percent  scanning to go forward, the transfer of sensitive information would have  to take place systematically, which would only be possible if a new  international agreement between the United States and the European  Union (EU) was enacted. In the absence of agreements with the host  governments at the more than 700 seaports that ship cargo to the United  States, access to data on the results of container scans could be difficult to  ensure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP International Partners Have Stated That 100 Percent Scanning Is Inconsistent with Widely Accepted Risk Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["Some of CBP\u2019s international partners, including foreign customs services,  port operators, trade groups, and international organizations, have stated  that the 100 percent scanning requirement is inconsistent with widely  accepted risk management principles, and some governments have  expressed to DHS and Congress that 100 percent scanning is not  consistent with these principles as contained in the SAFE Framework.  Similarly, some European customs officials have told us that the 100  percent scanning requirement is in contrast to the risk-based strategy  behind CSI and C-TPAT, and the WCO has stated that implementation of  100 percent scanning would be \u201ctantamount to abandonment of risk  management.\u201d In addition, some of CBP\u2019s international partners have  stated that the requirement could potentially reduce security. For  example, the European Commission noted that there has been no  demonstration that 100 percent scanning is a better means for enhancing  security than current risk-based methods. Further, CBP officials have told  us that the 100 percent scanning requirement may be a disincentive for  foreign countries or companies to adopt risk-based security initiatives,  such as CSI, C-TPAT, or the SAFE Framework. Similarly, in April 2008, the  Association of German Seaport Operators released a position paper that  stated that implementing the 100 percent scanning requirement would  undermine mutual, already achieved, security successes and hinder  maritime security by depriving resources from areas that present a more  significant threat and warrant closer scrutiny."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "100 Percent Scanning Could Lead to Calls for Reciprocity and Be Viewed as a Barrier to Trade", "paragraphs": ["Implementation of the 100 percent scanning requirement could result in  calls for reciprocity of scanning activities from foreign officials and be  viewed as a barrier to trade. European customs officials, as well as  officials from the WCO, have objected to the unilateral nature of the 100  percent scanning requirement, noting that this requirement contrasts with  prior multilateral efforts CBP has implemented. Similarly, the Association  of German Port Operators published a position paper stating that the  legislative requirement inherently ignores the international character of  global maritime trade and is a classic example of an issue that should have  been discussed with and passed by the legislative body of an international  organization, such as the WCO. In its report on the SFI pilot program, the  European Commission expressed concern that it would be difficult for EU  customs administrations to implement a measure designed to protect the  United States that would divert resources away from strengthening EU  security. Customs officials from Europe, as well as members of the World  Shipping Council and the Federation of European Private Port Operators,  indicated that should implementation of the 100 percent scanning  requirement be pursued, foreign governments could establish similar  requirements for the United States, forcing U.S. export cargo containers to  undergo scanning before being loaded at U.S. seaports. According to CBP  officials, the SFI pilot program, as an extension of CSI, allows foreign  officials to ask the United States to reciprocate and scan 100 percent of  cargo containers bound for their respective countries. CBP officials told us  that CBP does not have the personnel, equipment, or space to scan 100  percent of cargo containers being exported to other countries, should it be  requested to do so.", "In addition to the issue of reciprocity, European and Asian government  officials, as well as officials from the WCO, have stated that 100 percent  scanning could constitute a barrier to trade. For example, the Association  of German Seaport Operators stated that the 100 percent mandate would  amount to an unfair nontariff trade barrier between the United States and  foreign seaports. Similarly, senior officials from the European Commission  expressed concern that a 100 percent scanning requirement placed on  foreign seaports could disrupt the international trading system. Further,  the WCO passed a unanimous resolution in December 2007, expressing  concern that implementation of 100 percent scanning would be  detrimental to world trade and could result in unreasonable delays, port  congestion, and international trading difficulties.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared statement. We look forward to working with CBP and the  Congress to track progress of the SFI pilot and to identify the way forward  for supply chain security. I would be happy to respond to any questions  you may have."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For information about this testimony, please contact Stephen L.
