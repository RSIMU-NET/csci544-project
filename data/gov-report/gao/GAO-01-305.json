The Under Secretary (Enforcement) position was created as a result of Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 1994 appropriation in which Congress directed that the Secretary of the Treasury establish the Office of the Under Secretary (Enforcement) to give increased prominence to the law enforcement activities and responsibilities of Treasury\u2019s law enforcement bureaus. In July 1994, the first Under Secretary (Enforcement) was sworn in. The Under Secretary\u2019s staff includes an Assistant Secretary and three Deputy Assistant Secretaries. The Under Secretary reports to the Secretary of the Treasury through the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and is responsible for the following functions:  coordinating all Treasury law enforcement matters, including the formulation of policies for all Treasury enforcement activities;   ensuring cooperation and proper levels of Treasury participation in law enforcement matters with other federal departments and agencies;   directly overseeing the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement) and DAS (Enforcement Policy); and, through the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement), overseeing the DAS (Law Enforcement) and the DAS (Regulatory, Trade and Tariff Enforcement);   providing departmental oversight of Customs; the Secret Service; ATF; and FLETC and, through the Assistant Secretary (Enforcement), monitoring the activities of FinCEN, OFAC, and EOAF; and conducting policy guidance for the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division (IRS/CID);   negotiating international agreements on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury to engage in joint law enforcement operations and for the exchange of financial information and records useful to law enforcement; and   supervising the Director of the Office of Finance and Administration (OF&A).", "Enforcement\u2019s performance goals, as described in its fiscal year 2000 performance plan, were to (1) develop and implement policies to facilitate achievement of strategic goals in Treasury\u2019s enforcement mission and (2) provide effective oversight of law enforcement bureaus. The fiscal year 2000 budget for the Treasury law enforcement bureaus, as enacted, totaled about $3.3 billion, with about 27,300 FTEs.", "As of September 30, 2000, Enforcement had 42 staff on board, consisting of 24 mission-related and 18 mission-support staff. In addition to these staff, Enforcement also had on board six detailees and one employee for whom Enforcement was reimbursed. Four of the five top Enforcement management positions and one bureau head position are political positions that are subject to turnover with a change in administration.

The documentation we obtained and reviewed included Enforcement\u2019s financial plans and payroll runs and relevant portions of appropriations acts for fiscal years 1994 through 2000. We selected fiscal year 1994 as the starting point for these data because that was the year that the first Under Secretary (Enforcement) was sworn in.", "To determine the circumstances under which the law enforcement bureaus are required to interact with Enforcement, versus acting on their own, we interviewed Enforcement officials. Because there was no comprehensive source that indicated when the bureaus are required to interact with Enforcement, we asked Enforcement officials to compile a list of these circumstances and to provide copies of the documentation that spelled out these requirements. We reviewed these documents to determine the extent to which they described the required interaction between Enforcement and the bureaus, such as when and how the bureaus were to interact with Enforcement. To determine whether the bureaus generally have complied with these requirements, the role Enforcement is to play, and how Enforcement communicated its authority to the bureaus, we interviewed Enforcement and bureau officials and obtained and reviewed related documentation.", "We also interviewed Enforcement and bureau officials to (1) determine what Enforcement had done to provide oversight, policy guidance, and support to the law enforcement bureaus and (2) identify what factors, if any, have been viewed as barriers to Enforcement in performing its oversight, policy guidance, and support roles, and what actions Enforcement had taken in response to these factors. We summarized these factors and identified broad categories into which they fell. We did not determine to what extent, if at all, the barriers these officials cited have affected Enforcement\u2019s ability to fulfill its roles.", "Lastly, we developed and administered a DCI to Enforcement officials to gather information on examples of projects in which Enforcement engaged from October 1, 1998, through June 30, 2000. Enforcement did not have an inventory of the projects or ongoing efforts related to its oversight, policy guidance, and support roles. Therefore, we requested that Enforcement officials identify and provide data on up to 5 projects or ongoing efforts that were related to each of the 10 strategic goals that either Enforcement or the bureaus it oversees supports. Because the projects and ongoing efforts on which we obtained information are not a statistical sample of all projects and ongoing efforts, the DCI responses may not be representative of all projects or ongoing efforts that Enforcement engaged in during this period. We received 49 completed DCIs. We did not verify the information provided in the DCIs. Appendix I provides (1) Treasury\u2019s four missions and the strategic goals for which the Enforcement officials were to complete the DCIs and (2) data on each of the projects or ongoing efforts they described in their DCI responses.", "The Enforcement officials we interviewed included the Under Secretary; Assistant Secretary; the DAS (Enforcement Policy); the DAS (Law Enforcement); the DAS (Regulatory, Tariff and Trade Enforcement); and the Director, OF&A.

Treasury distributes (or allots) this annual appropriation among various programs and offices, including Enforcement. For example, in fiscal year 2000, Congress appropriated about $134 million for the departmental offices\u2019 salaries and expenses appropriation. Of this total, Treasury\u2019s FMD allotted about $5.2 million to Enforcement for its annual operations, including its oversight, policy guidance, and support roles.", "FMD allots these annual operating funds to Enforcement through a financial plan. The initial financial plan indicates the amount of funds Enforcement has available for the fiscal year. The resources made available to Enforcement through its initial financial plans for fiscal years 1994 through 2000 ranged from about $2.3 million in fiscal year 1996 to $5.2 million in fiscal year 2000. Throughout the fiscal year, FMD can increase or decrease the financial plan for a variety of reasons, including the rate at which Enforcement has obligated its funds during the fiscal year and funding needs elsewhere in Treasury. For example, according to FMD officials, at the Secretary\u2019s discretion, funds may be reallotted to support the Secretary\u2019s priorities. For fiscal years 1994 through 2000, the percentage of funding from the initial financial plan that Enforcement obligated ranged from about 74 percent (in fiscal year 1997) to about 124 percent (in fiscal year 1996). Cumulatively, from fiscal years 1994 to 2000, about $28.3 million had initially been made available to Enforcement through FMD, and Enforcement obligated about $25.2 million of these funds.", "Figure 2 shows Enforcement\u2019s initial financial plan, year-end financial plan, and actual obligations of its annual operating funds for fiscal years 1994 through 2000.", "In 5 of the 7 fiscal years from 1994 to 2000, Enforcement obligated fewer funds than it had available through its initial financial plan. In 3 of the 5 fiscal years\u20141995, 1997, and 1998\u2014Enforcement obligated about three- quarters of its available funds. In the remaining 2 fiscal years\u20141999 and 2000\u2014Enforcement obligated about 92 percent of its available funds. Enforcement and FMD officials said that a principal reason that Enforcement did not obligate all of its available funds was due to Enforcement\u2019s not obligating all of the funds it had available for personnel expenses. According to an Enforcement official, Enforcement had not always hired staff quickly enough, which created a surplus of personnel funds and ultimately led to FMD\u2019s reducing Enforcement\u2019s financial plan. Enforcement officials cited a variety of issues they have faced relating to hiring staff. These issues included a lengthy hiring process, including the background and security investigations; difficulty in filling positions because qualified people were in high demand; length of time it took to get approval from the Office of Management to fill a position; Office of Management\u2019s not approving the filling of a position; and Enforcement\u2019s being slow in selecting candidates. Enforcement officials said that the major reason for underobligating available funds in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 was that Enforcement experienced major impediments in staffing its newly established Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), which was funded by Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 1997 appropriation.", "In the remaining 2 of the 7 fiscal years (1994 and 1996), Enforcement\u2019s obligations were greater than its initial financial plan. Both personnel and nonpersonnel-related factors, such as equipment purchases, were the reasons for Enforcement\u2019s obligating more that it had available through its initial financial plan.", "Figure 3 shows the number of FTEs authorized for Enforcement by the Assistant Secretary for Management and the number of FTEs that Enforcement had used as of the end of each fiscal year. For fiscal years 1994 through 2000, the number of FTEs that Enforcement was authorized ranged from 31 in 1996 to 51 in 2000.
