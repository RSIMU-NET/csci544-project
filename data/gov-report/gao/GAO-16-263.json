This report examines 1) the designation of mandatory accounts government-wide under the President's sequestration order for fiscal year 2014, 2) how selected agencies implemented sequestration and any effects they reported on programs or services, and 3) how continued sequestration of mandatory spending relates to the achievement of deficit reduction goals.", "GAO analyzed fiscal year 2014 budget data on sequestration; selected a nongeneralizable sample of 6 accounts from USDA, HHS, Treasury, and DOT based on the amount of sequestrable budget authority, budget function, and account type; reviewed documentation on sequestration; interviewed budget officials; and reviewed legislation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that in fiscal year 2014, total mandatory budget authority government-wide was approximately $2.9 trillion spread across roughly 443 accounts. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), as amended, required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to apply a range of sequestration rates to non-exempt mandatory spending. This resulted in estimated reductions of $19.4 billion in fiscal year 2014, which was less than one percent of mandatory budget authority. Exemptions and special rules in BBEDCA led some areas of government to be reduced more than others. For example, 90 percent or more of mandatory budget authority for the administration of justice and transportation was subject to reduction. Veterans benefits and services were exempt. About two-thirds of the 67 federal agencies with mandatory budget authority implemented sequestration procedures in 2014. The largest drivers of mandatory spending growth\u2014Social Security and health care\u2014are statutorily exempt from sequestration under BBEDCA, with the exception of Medicare and certain health programs which are subject to a special rate.", "Agency officials responsible for managing the selected accounts in GAO's review at the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), the Treasury (Treasury), and Transportation (DOT) reported varied administrative and programmatic effects. While they said 2014 sequestration procedures were similar to the prior year, implementation involved additional administrative activities to ensure that reductions were applied correctly and to accommodate the changes in cash flows for programs and services. In certain cases, selected officials said sequestration added uncertainty when planning and executing their budgets. They also said that the required reductions affected program beneficiaries in different ways including smaller direct payments, reduced services, delayed payments, and reduced tax credits.", "The processes established by BBEDCA were designed to reduce the deficit over 10 years by at least an additional $1.2 trillion. However, the subsequent availability of temporarily sequestered budget authority in certain accounts\u2014referred to as \u201cpop ups\u201d\u2014provide savings in the year they are sequestered but do not represent lasting savings. OMB staff said they do not tally the total amount of funds that \u201cpop up,\u201d nor are they required to do so. However, doing so would provide additional transparency to Congress about the total amount of funds agencies have available in a given year.", "In addition, actual sequestered amounts for certain types of mandatory spending cannot be determined until the end of the fiscal year due to the variable nature of indefinite budget authority\u2014budget authority for an unspecified or indeterminable amount at the time of enactment. OMB staff said they do not aggregate government-wide data on the actual amounts sequestered nor are they required to do so under BBEDCA. However, tabulating actual amounts after the close of the fiscal year would provide a clearer picture of the amount of funds that were permanently canceled, thereby representing the true savings generated from mandatory spending reductions each year. Moreover, compiling such data could improve transparency and serve as a benchmark to evaluate the progress made each year toward the required overall savings of $1.2 trillion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB identify and publicly report the total amount of (1) temporarily sequestered budget authority that becomes available in subsequent fiscal years and (2) actual budget authority sequestered government-wide each year.

The act set deficit  reduction targets for the federal government and established  sequestration procedures to enforce those targets. The Budget Control  Act of 2011 (BCA) amended BBEDCA and revived this budgetary  enforcement mechanism to encourage agreement on deficit reduction  legislation or, in the event that such agreement was not reached, to  automatically reduce spending so that an equivalent budgetary goal  would be achieved. Sequestration was triggered after the Joint Select  Committee on Deficit Reduction (Joint Committee) did not propose, and  Congress and the President did not enact, legislation to reduce the deficit  by at least an additional $1.2 trillion. In fiscal year 2014, federal agencies  implemented the second consecutive year of across-the-board spending  reductions to mandatory spending (also known as direct spending).", "Discretionary spending is controlled through  appropriations acts, which provide agencies  with budget authority on a one-year, multi- year, or no-year basis. Examples include most  defense spending, education, housing, and  energy programs.", "Mandatory spending (also known as direct  spending) generally refers to budget authority  provided through laws other than  appropriations acts. By statute, funding tends  to be driven by eligibility rules and benefit  formulas, which means that funds are made  available as needed to provide benefits to  those who are eligible and wish to participate.  Examples include Medicare, Social Security,  unemployment insurance, and various  veterans\u2019 programs.", "While an across-the-board reduction of discretionary appropriations was  not triggered in fiscal year 2014 (and thus did not occur), nor were  discretionary spending limits required to be reduced under BBEDCA,  current law requires mandatory spending to be sequestered every year  through 2025. Mandatory outlays are largely driven by eligibility rules and  benefit formulas, which means that funds are made available as needed  to provide benefits to those who are eligible and choose to participate.  Pursuant to BBEDCA, a great deal of mandatory spending is exempt from  sequestration such as Social Security benefit payments, Medicaid grants,  and funding for veterans\u2019 benefits programs.", "Under sequestration, agencies are required to reduce nonexempt  mandatory spending, which includes amounts for Medicare, various farm  programs, unemployment insurance, and citizenship and immigration  services. The list of exemptions was established in the 1980s, when  BBEDCA was first enacted, and has been amended since then. Through  its amendments to BBEDCA in 2011, Congress encouraged the  enactment of deficit reducing legislation and established consequential  procedures in the absence of such legislation. Given that sequestration of  mandatory spending will be in effect over the coming decade, it is  important to evaluate the effects and implications of sequestration as a  tool for reducing the federal deficit.", "While under current law, Joint Committee reductions to discretionary  spending limits are not required until fiscal year 2018, and an after  session sequestration of discretionary appropriations will only occur if  spending limits are breached, mandatory spending is to be sequestered  under the Joint Committee sequestration process every year through  fiscal year 2025. You requested that we examine the implementation of  sequestration on mandatory accounts and any related effects.  Specifically, this report discusses (1) the designation of mandatory  accounts across the federal budget under the President\u2019s sequestration  order for fiscal year 2014, (2) how selected agencies implemented the  fiscal year 2014 sequestration order and the effects, if any, they reported  the required spending reductions had on programs or services, and (3)  how continued sequestration of mandatory spending relates to the  achievement of deficit reduction goals.", "To accomplish our first objective, we identified how mandatory accounts  were designated under sequestration primarily using a data set provided  by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff that was used to  prepare OMB\u2019s Report to the Congress on the Joint Committee  Reductions for Fiscal Year 2014. We also analyzed actual budget  authority data for all mandatory accounts government-wide from OMB\u2019s  MAX database to show trends over time from fiscal year 2005 through  fiscal year 2014. To accomplish our second objective, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of six accounts for a more in-depth review of the  implementation of sequestration and its effects. We relied on the same  data used for our first objective to select six accounts representing a  variety of characteristics including the amount of sequestrable budget  authority, type of account, agency, budget function, and whether the  account included some portion of budget authority that was exempt from  sequestration. We assessed the reliability of the data sources noted  above through electronic data testing, interviews with agency officials,  and reviewing related documentation. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of our report.", "We reviewed budget data, guidance, and documentation of any reported  programmatic effects of sequestration for each of the selected accounts.", "We spoke with agency budget and program officials, as well as OMB  staff, about their challenges and lessons learned from implementing  sequestration. We also spoke with a nongeneralizable selection of  interest groups to gain their perspective on the effects of sequestration on  programs and services. To accomplish our third objective, we reviewed  relevant literature and the government-wide federal budget data  described above that was used for our first objective. We reviewed OMB\u2019s  processes compared to federal standards for internal control specifically  related to information and communication. In addition, for each of the  objectives, we reviewed relevant legislation, executive memoranda, and  OMB guidance.

This growth is projected to continue at least through fiscal year 2046.", "Current law requires OMB to calculate the reductions to budgetary  resources required each year to ultimately reduce the deficit by at least  an additional $1.2 trillion. For fiscal year 2014, BBEDCA directed OMB to  calculate a sequestration of mandatory spending, which was effective on  October 1, 2013.", "A percentage reduction, or sequestration rate, is applied to programs,  projects, and activities (PPA), which are generally sub-elements within  accounts, to achieve the total reduction amount required for the fiscal  year. The sequestration rate varies from year to year based on a formula  outlined in BBEDCA. The annual reduction amount calculated by OMB  ($109.3 billion) is split evenly between the defense and nondefense  functions, and then allocated between discretionary appropriations and  mandatory spending in each function in proportion to their share of the  function.", "To determine the requisite percentage reduction to nonexempt budget  accounts in each function pursuant to BBEDCA, OMB must define the  sequestrable base. For fiscal year 2014, the base for mandatory  spending was equal to the current law baseline amounts provided in the  President\u2019s Budget submission for fiscal year 2014, including unobligated  balances in the defense function, and administrative expenses in  otherwise exempt accounts. OMB was directed to calculate a  sequestration consistent with provisions of sections 251A, 255, and 256  of BBEDCA, which limit or exempt the sequestration of certain budget  authority. Under BBEDCA, many mandatory programs are exempt from  sequestration, and Medicare non-administrative spending (spending to  pay for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries) could not be reduced  by more than two percent.", "These calculations are issued annually in OMB\u2019s Report to the Congress  on the Joint Committee Reductions. OMB provided guidance to agencies  primarily through memoranda for heads of executive departments and  agencies and other technical assistance. In addition, in July 2014, OMB  updated Circular A-11 to include a new Section 100, providing agencies  with guidance on sequestration.

Among the accounts  subject to sequestration, OMB calculated reductions based on differing  rates ranging from 2 percent to 9.8 percent, as determined under the  provisions of BBEDCA.", "As shown in figure 2, about $2.2 trillion, or approximately 77 percent, of  the total estimated government-wide mandatory budget authority in fiscal  year 2014 was exempt from sequestration. Applying the corresponding  rates to each sequestrable account yielded an estimated target of $19.4  billion in sequestration reductions government-wide in fiscal year 2014.  This represented less than 1 percent of the total estimated mandatory  budget authority for that year. The estimated $19.4 billion includes  $11.2 billion from budget authority sequestered at the 2 percent rate, $7.4  billion from budget authority sequestered at the 7.2 percent rate, and  $778 million from budget authority sequestered at the 9.8 percent rate.", "Every federal account is assigned a \u201cbudget function,\u201d which identifies the  national priority supported by that account.

The exemptions and special rules lead sequestration to  affect some areas of the federal government more than others. In fiscal  year 2014, certain national priorities had a greater proportion of  sequestrable budget authority. For example, nearly all mandatory budget  authority for Medicare and more than 90 percent of the mandatory budget  authority that supports the administration of justice was sequestrable,  whereas national priorities such as social security and veterans benefits,  which comprise a larger portion of the federal budget, were exempt from  sequestration.", "As shown in figure 4, four national priorities had more than 80 percent of  their mandatory budget authority subject to sequestration in fiscal year  2014. In contrast, eight national priorities had less than 25 percent of their  mandatory budget authority subject to sequestration.

Agency officials from four of the six  agencies we interviewed described aspects of implementing  sequestration in fiscal year 2014 as generally less challenging because  they had already experienced the 2013 sequestration. For example, these  agencies had already categorized accounts based on their sequestration  designation, determined how to allocate the required reductions, and  modified reporting systems to implement the 2013 sequestration. Thus,  these activities did not need to be repeated to implement the 2014  sequestration order.", "Even though they had created the administrative framework to implement  sequestration during its first year in fiscal year 2013, the agency officials  we spoke with indicated that implementation of the fiscal year 2014  sequestration required them to engage in additional administrative  activities to ensure that reductions were applied correctly and to  accommodate the changes in cash flows for programs and services. This  included such things as notifying program participants, performing manual  computations, and updating software systems.", "For two of our six selected accounts, agency officials said it took time to  clarify which fiscal year\u2019s sequestration rate to apply when calculating  payment reductions to program participants. For example, under the Build  America Bonds (BABs) program, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  administered sequestration reductions by reducing direct payments to  bond issuers or reducing tax credits to taxpayers. Officials stated that  payments could overlap fiscal years which brought confusion since fiscal  year 2013 and fiscal year 2014 were subject to different sequestration  rates, thus it was unclear whether the 2013 or 2014 sequestration rate  should be applied to the return. As a result of this confusion, IRS\u2019s Office  of the Chief Financial Officer developed and issued guidance to describe  which sequestration rate should be applied based on which fiscal year  certain administrative actions had been completed and if delays had  occurred. In addition, until required payment programming changes could  be made, IRS staff manually calculated reductions to individual issuers  and individually notified payment recipients of the sequestration rate and  the total reduction applied to their payment. After issuing the guidance,  IRS determined that 262 payments had been made using the wrong  sequestration rate, and those payments had to be corrected and re- issued. In the end, IRS sequestered $263 million, which was 7.2 percent  of the approximately $3.6 billion in BABs payments made in fiscal year  2014.", "Similarly, officials from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) within the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) described their challenge of identifying  which sequestration rate applied to the Commodity Credit Corporation  (CCC) Fund when reducing direct payments to farmers whose crop year  did not coincide with the federal fiscal year. Consequently, similar  program recipients were subject to different reduction rates depending on  the crop year and when their payment was obligated. FSA officials said  this meant there could be two neighboring farmers participating in the  same CCC program but subject to different sequestration rates. To help  ensure appropriate application of the reductions, the agency modified its  software programs to incorporate the sequestration calculations for more  than a dozen programs. FSA described an additional challenge of  determining whether and how to apply fiscal year 2014 sequestration  reductions after the Agricultural Act of 2014, known as the Farm Bill  reauthorization, was enacted in February 2014. The 2014 Farm Bill  created some new programs, while terminating others, which OMB and  FSA staff said required time and resources to identify which programs  were subject to sequestration and how to implement the required  reductions.", "In certain cases, officials said that sequestration added further uncertainty  to pre-existing budgetary restrictions on agencies\u2019 programs. For  example, at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), officials said  sequestration reductions to the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) created  additional uncertainty about the availability of funds, which led to cash  management concerns. Due to the combination of sequestration  reductions, as well as a cancelation and rescission of budgetary  resources in fiscal year 2014, Treasury\u2019s Executive Office for Asset  Forfeiture (TEOAF) had fewer funds to allocate to participating law  enforcement agencies. Treasury applied sequestration reductions to  federal forfeiture program related expenses of the member agencies,  allowing them to prevent state and local partners, as well as victims, from  seeing reduced payments. Treasury staff said sequestration reduced the  agency\u2019s flexibility to cover unexpected expenses, such as unanticipated  victim payments from prior year forfeitures. While the $125 million in  sequestration reductions later became available to TEOAF in fiscal year  2015, the sequestration reduced the amount of funds available in fiscal  year 2014, which Treasury staff said made it difficult to manage cash  flows. In some circumstances current law allows for budget authority  sequestered in one fiscal year to become available to the agencies again  in a subsequent fiscal year. OMB refers to these amounts as \u201cpop ups.\u201d", "Another account where officials reported that sequestration added  uncertainty to existing budget restrictions was the Highway Trust Fund.  Department of Transportation (DOT) officials said the sequestration of  $907 million\u2014that would have otherwise been transferred into the  Highway Trust Fund\u2014became a complicating factor to deal with on top of  the broader existing cash shortfall the Highway Trust Fund was facing  because revenues from fuel taxes were insufficient to maintain authorized  spending levels for highway and transit programs.", "In addition to the agencies managing the six selected accounts included  in our review, we also spoke with staff from OMB, given its oversight role  and responsibilities related to implementing sequestration across all  federal agencies. OMB staff said they also had to redirect staff time and  resources to meet the needs of the agencies including a substantial  amount of staff hours that could otherwise have been devoted to other  agency priorities. For example, staff from OMB\u2019s Budget Review Division  said that they spent a substantial amount of time working closely with  their Office of General Counsel staff to make determinations regarding  the availability of sequestered amounts in subsequent years pursuant to  section 256(k)(6) of BBEDCA and to document these decisions. OMB  staff said this was a new issue that surfaced in fiscal year 2014 since it  was the first year that such amounts would become available for  obligation. Staff also indicated that OMB had developed principles to aid  in sequestration implementation; however, the process must be repeated  every year as new accounts are created. OMB staff also indicated that  while they and the agencies have gained more expertise in implementing  sequestration, it requires resources and adds considerations that must be  factored into the budget process.", "In March 2014, we recommended that OMB issue guidance directing  agencies to formally document the decisions and principles used to  implement sequestration for potential future application. In response to  our recommendation, OMB revised its Circular A-11 guidance to include a  new section about sequestration and directed agencies to record how  they implemented sequestration to maintain consistency from year to  year, inform agencies\u2019 efforts to plan for sequestration in future years, and  build institutional knowledge. OMB staff and some agency officials we  spoke with said they rely primarily on apportionment records to document  how sequestration was implemented and how much was actually  sequestered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Effects on Program Participants Varied Across Entities and Individuals in Our Review", "paragraphs": ["Selected agencies reported that program beneficiaries were affected in  different ways by the sequestration reductions ranging from smaller direct  payments, reduced services, delayed payments, and reduced tax credits.  For example, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)  provides services to underserved and vulnerable communities in need of  health care. According to HRSA, sequestration reductions in fiscal year  2014 to the health centers and workforce programs prevented the  expansion of services to an estimated 365,000 new patients. In  addition, HRSA officials reported that, in the absence of sequestration,  the National Health Service Corps program would have been able to  increase the number of practitioners providing primary care, dental,  mental and behavioral health services in the field by 358\u2014from 9,242 to  9,600. According to the officials, this additional staff would have been  able to provide services to approximately 300,000 additional individuals in  fiscal year 2014.", "As illustrated in figure 6, in the case of direct payment BABs,  sequestration reductions were transferred directly to issuers through  reducing the outlay by 7.2 percent after IRS determines that a refund can  be disbursed. In the case of tax credit BABs, sequestration reductions of  7.2 percent were taken from any payment owed to the taxpayer by IRS  above the bond holder\u2019s tax liabilities, but no reductions were taken from  the tax credit if tax liabilities were higher than the amount of the BABs tax  credit.", "FSA\u2019s CCC Fund provides direct payments to farmers under a variety of  farm programs to support their operational activities. FSA administered an  estimated $574 million in reductions by reducing individual direct  payments to farmers at the 7.2 percent sequestration rate, which FSA  reported affected thousands of producers across different programs. A  senior director from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) said  the reductions further exacerbated the uncertainty growers were already  experiencing from delays in final appropriations decisions for federal  programs upon which they rely. FSA officials echoed this concern. In  addition, the NCGA representative emphasized the need for growers to  know the sequestration reduction amounts with enough time that they  may include it in their final projections needed to secure loans for  production costs.", "For fiscal year 2014, $12.6 billion was transferred from DOT\u2019s Payments  to the Transportation Trust Fund account directly into the Highway Trust  Fund, which in December 2012, we found had been facing increasing  shortfalls because revenues from fuel taxes were insufficient to maintain  authorized spending levels. This amount was subject to the 7.2 percent  reduction rate, translating into a $907 million reduction in monies  available to reimburse states for highway projects. However, as a result of  a subsequent appropriation of general revenues into the Highway Trust  Fund of approximately $9.8 billion in August 2014, officials said DOT was  able to pay states any outstanding reimbursement amounts. In other  words, states received the full reimbursement, without additional  reductions. The subsequent amount was appropriated under the Moving  Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) extension, the  Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, which was not subject  to the 2014 sequestration because the extension was enacted after the  sequestration order was issued for fiscal year 2014. We spoke with a  senior official from the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials, who said the sequestration reductions  accelerated the timing of the potential cash shortfall in the Highway Trust  Fund. DOT officials echoed this same sentiment. However, this shortfall  was ultimately postponed once the MAP-21 extension was enacted.", "Of the agencies we spoke with, only HRSA could quantify the effects of  sequestration on programs or their recipients. The others described the  effects in general terms.

In addition, the reductions  affected certain national priorities more than others as provisions of  BBEDCA provided exemptions and special rules for certain programs and  accounts. Aside from Medicare and certain other health programs, the  largest drivers of mandatory spending growth are statutorily exempt from  sequestration.", "The selected agencies we spoke with reported that they were more  familiar with sequestration procedures in 2014 since it was the second  consecutive year of implementing the required reductions. However,  these agencies said implementation involved additional administrative  activities, and in certain cases, an additional element of uncertainty when  planning and executing their budgets. The form of the reported reductions  varied by program and affected beneficiaries differently ranging from  smaller direct payments, reduced services, delayed payments, and  reduced tax credits.", "The processes established under BBEDCA were designed to reduce the  federal deficit by at least an additional $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

For example, beginning with the fiscal year 2016 budget, the  President\u2019s budget contains a data field to record \u201cpop up\u201d amounts. OMB  staff said \u201cpop up\u201d amounts are delineated with a particular value in the  OMB MAX database and are identified so as not to re-sequester those  same funds in the subsequent fiscal year.", "OMB staff disagreed with the second recommendation in this report and  said this would be a burdensome new requirement that is not applied for  other types of budget enforcement. For example, they said estimated  savings are used for PAYGO enforcement, and there is no requirement  for agencies to track actual PAYGO savings over time. In addition, OMB  staff said this would be problematic for programs with indefinite funding  for direct payments (e.g., benefit payments) because agencies typically  record indefinite budget authority equal to obligations incurred as they  operate the program. Further, they said requiring agencies to capture the  sequestration savings separately in their accounting records would  require changes to agencies\u2019 financial systems so that both a pre- sequestration amount and a reduction amount could be recorded for each  payment. OMB staff said that their current oversight of sequestration via  an annual exercise requiring agencies to certify that they are executing  the reductions to payments required by the sequestration order and  OMB\u2019s review of estimated reductions is a balanced approach that  focuses attention on the critical control elements needed to achieve  savings. OMB staff said the attempt to provide additional precision is  outweighed by the cost and confusion\u2014and potentially erroneous  conclusions\u2014that would be engendered by this recommendation. They  said collecting such data would require significant accounting changes  both by OMB and agencies and would require coordination and approval  by the Department of the Treasury\u2014all of which could take years to  implement.", "As stated earlier in this report, we acknowledge the uncertainty in  estimating sequestration reductions for accounts with indefinite budget  authority, thereby requiring actual amounts to be tabulated at the close of  the fiscal year. In our view, identifying the actual amounts reduced at the  close of each fiscal year would be consistent with the type of budgetary  reporting practices OMB and agencies already follow when preparing the  President\u2019s budget each year. Regarding OMB\u2019s concern that this would  require modifications to agencies\u2019 financial systems, we found that the  selected agencies who manage the six accounts included in our more in- depth analysis were able to readily provide us with actual amounts  reduced under sequestration, including cases where indefinite budget  authority was involved. Moreover, there is evidence that at least these  agencies have developed their own tracking mechanisms to identify the  actual amounts that were reduced each fiscal year. We recognize such  tracking mechanisms may vary across agencies, but OMB could request  agencies to report the actual amounts as part of the annual preparation of  the President\u2019s budget, which could also be compared to apportionment  records for the relevant fiscal year. Regarding OMB\u2019s concern that  collecting such data would require accounting changes across agencies  and coordination with the Department of the Treasury, we recognize that  it will take time to establish and refine a government-wide data set of  sequestered amounts that is reliable and comparable across agencies. In  the interim however, there are data available to both OMB and the  agencies that can serve as a meaningful starting point to tally  sequestered amounts and calculate a government-wide total, which could  be refined over time. The fact that sequestration of mandatory spending  will be in effect over the coming decade and an issue that agencies will  have to continue to manage heightens the significance of identifying and  tracking the actual amounts reduced to promote transparency to key  decision makers. Moreover, we believe that taking the next step to  calculate a government-wide aggregate dollar amount that could be  publicly reported would provide confirmation of the amount of funds that  were permanently canceled thereby adding transparency on the true  savings generated from mandatory spending reductions each year. We  continue to believe that this could help serve as a benchmark to evaluate  the progress made each year toward the overall savings of $1.2 trillion  required by law.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; Director of OMB; the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and  Human Services, Transportation, and the Treasury; and other interested  parties.
