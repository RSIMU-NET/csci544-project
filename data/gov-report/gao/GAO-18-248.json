While there are a number of ways to address the fiscal condition of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, some researchers have proposed expanding employer-provided PDI. GAO was asked to review whether expanding PDI could result in potential savings to the Disability Insurance Trust Fund.", "This report examines (1) what is known about how coverage and key features of SSDI and PDI compare, and (2) the potential implications of three distinct proposals to expand employer-sponsored PDI on the Disability Insurance Trust Fund and various stakeholders.", "GAO analyzed data on SSDI and PDI coverage from SSA and BLS for 2016 and 2017; reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; reviewed three PDI policies that three large insurers we selected described as typical for their companies; reviewed three distinct proposals to expand PDI identified through a literature review; and interviewed SSA and Department of Labor officials, authors, researchers, and representatives of insurance, employer, employee, and disability groups for a range of perspectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis found that coverage and key features of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and long-term employer-sponsored private disability insurance (PDI) differ in a number of ways. Key differences include the number of workers covered; characteristics of covered workers; and eligibility, benefits, and return to work assistance. For example:", "According to GAO's analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Social Security Administration (SSA) data, SSDI covers an estimated 96 percent of workers, while 33 percent of workers have PDI coverage through their employers. Also, PDI coverage is more prevalent among workers with higher wages (e.g., management positions) and in certain business sectors (e.g., finance).", "GAO's review of SSDI and PDI policies found that some PDI policies may pay benefits for medical conditions that SSDI would not. However, these PDI policies may time limit payments for mental health and musculoskeletal disorders, while SSDI does not. In addition, while both SSDI and PDI policies include features designed to help beneficiaries return to work, PDI policies may provide such supports more quickly than SSDI.", "GAO's review of the literature identified three distinct proposals for expanding PDI that the proposals' authors believe would address SSDI's fiscal challenges. Specifically, all three proposals suggest that cost savings for the Disability Insurance Trust Fund could be expected by expanding PDI. According to the proposals, this would happen because expanding PDI would provide workers earlier access to cash and employment supports, which would reduce the number of SSDI claims or the length of time SSDI benefits are paid to claimants. However, GAO's review of the three proposals noted that none of them provide enough information to assess how SSDI enrollment and costs might be affected with an expansion of PDI. Therefore, it is unclear whether cost savings to the Disability Insurance Trust Fund would actually be realized. For example, the proposals do not provide information on the type and timing of return-to-work services that would be provided under expanded PDI, nor do they take into account the differences in the populations served by SSDI and PDI policies. Moreover, stakeholders that GAO interviewed about these proposals raised a number of issues about other implications of PDI expansion that the proposals do not explicitly or fully address. For example:", "Insurers told GAO that is was unclear how expanding PDI would affect PDI premiums and the impact this would have on enrollment.", "Employers told GAO they were concerned about potential additional requirements or administrative burdens that would be placed on them if PDI were expanded.", "Employee and disability advocacy groups told GAO they were concerned about whether PDI expansion would provide standard services or employee protections currently available under SSDI, especially with respect to PDI expansion proposals that would replace SSDI for 2 years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Disability Insurance Trust Fund, primarily funded by employers and  workers through payroll taxes and administered by the Social Security  Administration (SSA), is used to provide cash benefits to people no longer  able to work as a result of their disabilities and to their dependents.

In addition, state workers\u2019 compensation programs generally  provide payments and assistance to individuals who are injured on the  job, while both SSDI and PDI are designed to replace lost income from  the onset of any disability regardless of whether it was work-related.  Also, some workers may be eligible for disability payments through  defined benefit pension plans. These benefits, commonly known as  disability retirement benefits, provide eligible workers with early retirement  payments if they can no longer work because of the onset of a disability.

Employees may also pay the entire premium of employer- sponsored PDI\u2014and researchers we interviewed from three private  sector organizations that survey the PDI market told us that these plans  are a minority of the PDI market. However, neither BLS nor industry  surveys comprehensively track the extent of PDI coverage where  employees pay 100 percent of the premium cost.", "In addition, while SSDI coverage is higher across all industries and  income levels, PDI coverage is much more prevalent at higher wage  levels and in certain occupations and industries than others. In particular,  as of March 2017, 60 percent of those in the highest 10 percent of wage  earners had PDI, whereas 4 percent of those in the lowest 10 percent did  (see fig. 1).", "Our analysis of BLS data found that differences in PDI coverage also  exist by occupation and industry. Specifically, 60 percent of workers in  business and financial operations occupations have PDI coverage,  compared to 16 percent of workers in construction, extraction, farming,  fishing, and forestry occupations that have PDI (see fig. 2). Broad  differences in PDI coverage also exist by industry; for example, 83  percent of workers in utilities have PDI, but only 5 percent of workers in  leisure and hospitality have PDI (see fig. 3). According to researchers  from one organization with whom we spoke, the higher rates of PDI  coverage reflect areas where labor markets are more competitive, leading  employers to offer PDI to attract employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSDI and PDI Differ in Many Respects, Including Eligibility, Benefit Level, and Approach to Return to Work", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["Our review of SSDI program rules and PDI policies indicates that  eligibility for PDI is similar in some ways to eligibility for SSDI. For  example, both allow individuals with many types of disabilities to receive  benefits until retirement, recovery, or death. However, there are also  some significant differences, as SSDI and PDI have different definitions  and employment requirements. According to SSDI program rules, to meet  SSDI\u2019s definition of disability, an individual must have a medically  determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) has lasted or is  expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death and (2) prevents the  individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity. SSA uses a list of  medical conditions\u2014established in regulations\u2014that it considers severe  enough to entirely prevent an individual from working. Benefits can also  be provided for medical conditions that are not on the list if the medical  condition or combination of medical conditions meets or equals the  severity of those on the list. SSA also considers additional factors\u2014 such as an individual\u2019s residual functional capacity, relevant past work,  age, education, and work experience. SSA can determine that the  medical conditions combined with the applicable factors preclude the  individual from performing his or her prior work or any other work in the  national economy. Eligibility for granted SSDI benefits continues until  retirement or death, or until SSA deems that the underlying medical  conditions have sufficiently improved or that the individual has become  gainfully employed.", "In contrast, typical PDI policies have provisions related to inability to work  that may compensate workers in a wider range of circumstances than  SSDI does, although these provisions become more strict after 2 years.  For the first 2 years of PDI benefits, policies generally define disability as  the inability of an individual to work his or her own occupation. For  disabilities that last for more than 2 years, a typical PDI policy changes  how it defines disability from the inability to work in one\u2019s previous  occupation, to the inability to work in any occupation offering a  reasonable income, which was 60 percent of pre-disability earnings in the  three sample policies we examined. Similar to SSDI, PDI benefit  payments generally continue for the length of the disability or until  retirement; however, unlike SSDI, benefits paid for certain conditions,  such as mental health conditions, are generally limited to 2 years. Also  unlike SSDI, PDI policies typically include a pre-existing condition  provision, whereby benefits are not paid if the applicant received  treatment, services, or consultation or took medication for the condition in  the 3 months prior to being insured.", "The requisite time period between the onset of a disability and when  benefits can begin is comparable between SSDI and PDI, according to  our review of SSDI program rules and PDI policies; however, the time it  takes to process and make decisions on claims may run longer for SSDI.  For both SSDI and PDI, benefits do not usually start immediately upon  disability onset. SSDI and PDI applicants must apply for benefits and  usually wait for a period of time\u2014known as a waiting period for SSDI and  as an elimination period for PDI\u2014for payments to begin. The waiting  period for SSDI benefits is 5 months after disability onset. For the PDI  policies we examined, the elimination period ranged from 3 to 6 months  after onset. Another factor affecting the time to receipt of benefits is the  time it takes to award the benefit. For PDI, federal regulations under the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that govern  claims in ERISA-covered plans, including disability claims, generally  require initial claims to be decided within 45 days after receipt of the claim  by the plan, with some ability to extend for two 30 day periods based on  reasons beyond the plan\u2019s control. PDI claimants may also appeal the  initial decision. On the other hand, based on our review of SSDI  program rules, claims for SSDI are not subject to timing requirements  established by law. Further, denied claimants may appeal the initial  decisions. The average decision time for appeals before Administrative  Law Judges in fiscal year 2017 was 605 days, according to SSA\u2019s fiscal  year 2017 performance report.", "Our review of SSDI program rules and PDI policies also indicates that  individuals are required to have longer employment periods for SSDI  eligibility than for PDI, but PDI is generally not portable if the individual  leaves the employer offering PDI. According to SSA guidance, individuals  become eligible to receive SSDI payments after they have paid the Social  Security payroll tax long enough\u2014about 10 years for many\u2014and recently  enough to accumulate the required number of credits. In contrast, the  three sample PDI policies we reviewed contained 30-day waiting periods  for coverage to begin. Further, part-time status and job changes affect  PDI more than SSDI eligibility. SSDI\u2019s program rules generally allow for  the work credits that an individual has accumulated to continue to count  toward SSDI eligibility even if the individual is working part-time, changes  jobs, or becomes unemployed or otherwise leaves the workforce. In  comparison, PDI coverage, which is offered at the discretion of  employers, is not generally portable, and may exclude part-time workers  altogether\u2014as was the case for the three \u201ctypical\u201d PDI policies we  reviewed. Nationally, PDI coverage is much more prevalent among full- time workers than part-time workers. According to BLS data, 42 percent  of full-time workers and 5 percent of part-time workers have PDI where  the employer pays for all or part of the premiums. See Table 1 for a  comparison of SSDI and PDI eligibility features.", "Our review of SSDI program rules and PDI policies indicates that SSDI  benefit levels for individuals are generally lower than PDI but are  designed to provide more income replacement for low-income workers  than higher-income workers. Under federal law, SSA determines benefit  amounts using a progressive formula, whereby low-income beneficiaries  receive relatively higher benefit payments based on their average monthly  earnings over the course of their career. For calendar year 2018, the  formula pays 90 percent of the first $896 of the individual\u2019s average  monthly earnings, plus 32 percent of the earnings between $896 and  $5,399, plus 15 percent of earnings over $5,399. (See fig. 4 for the  amount of benefits SSA paid in 2018 according to prior income levels.)  Using the formula, we calculated that at an average indexed annual  earnings of $44,000, the monthly benefit would be $1,693, which is 46  percent of prior average monthly earnings. Under the formula, workers  earning less would receive a higher proportion of their prior average,  while workers earning the taxable maximum (set at $128,400 for 2018) or  more would be eligible to receive $3,042 per month, which is at most 28  percent of their earnings. Under federal law, disabled workers with  qualifying dependents may receive additional SSDI payments, up to 50  percent of their individual benefit amount. Therefore, according to our  calculations, the maximum family benefit for average annual indexed  earnings of $44,000 would be $2,540, which is 69 percent of prior  average monthly earnings.", "By contrast, up to certain income levels, PDI policies typically replace 60  percent of an employee\u2019s current salary if the employee is unable to  continue working his or her prior job. Therefore, a worker earning  $44,000 annually in their prior job would receive $2,200 per month. For  high-income workers, PDI policies typically have a monthly maximum  payment. In one PDI policy we reviewed, this monthly maximum was  $5,000. Employers and employees pay for SSDI through payroll taxes on  employees\u2019 wages and salaries, so the cost to employers and employees  only varies based on employees\u2019 wages and salaries. Federal law also  determines the part of the payroll tax that is allocated for SSDI, half of  which is contributed by the employee and half by the employer. For PDI,  either employers, employees, or a combination of the two make premium  payments, depending on the policy negotiated between the insurer and  the employer. According to industry representatives with whom we spoke,  premiums may vary based on many factors, such as wages and salaries,  the length of the elimination period, rate of income replacement, type of  industry, and a company\u2019s prior claim experience.", "Another difference between SSDI and PDI benefit levels is their treatment  of partial benefits or partial disability determinations. SSDI program rules  do not provide partial payments to individuals who have lost some but not  all of their ability to earn income in the national economy. In contrast,  some PDI policies may pay benefits for a partial disability. For example, in  one of three policies we examined, workers could qualify for partial  benefits, at lower levels, if they were partially unable to achieve their  previous earnings because of a disability.", "PDI policies generally require beneficiaries to apply for SSDI and, if found  eligible, PDI payments are typically adjusted downward (offset) by the  amount of SSDI payments. There is no similar requirement or payment  adjustment for SSDI beneficiaries. In cases where PDI beneficiaries are  not required to or do not apply for SSDI, PDI policies we reviewed would  still reduce their PDI payment by the SSDI amount that the beneficiaries  may have been entitled to receive. The PDI payments would be reduced  for the full amount of the SSDI payments, including any SSDI payments  for the worker\u2019s spouse and dependents, but will typically maintain a  minimum PDI benefit. The three PDI policies we reviewed provide a  minimum $100 monthly benefit when the SSDI offset would otherwise  totally eliminate the PDI benefit or reduce it below $100 a month.  According to insurers we interviewed and PDI policies we reviewed,  insurers will assist PDI beneficiaries with their SSDI applications, and if  necessary, provide legal assistance for SSDI appeals processes.  According to one industry survey, 72 percent of PDI beneficiaries also  qualified for SSDI. PDI benefits may also be reduced by the amount of  income from other sources such as workers\u2019 compensation payments,  sick leave, or severance pay from an employer.", "Additionally, under federal law, SSDI confers Medicare eligibility after 2  years. In contrast, insurance associations and our review of PDI policies  indicate that PDI policies do not typically provide health care benefits.  Table 2 provides a summary of SSDI and PDI benefit features.", "Both SSDI and PDI policies include incentives to return to work, such as  allowing beneficiaries to retain some earnings when they return to work,  but PDI policies may provide return-to-work services sooner than SSDI.  As long as they continue to meet SSDI\u2019s eligibility criteria, beneficiaries  can earn up to the substantial gainful activity amount each month, without  any impact on their SSDI benefit, according to SSDI program rules.  SSDI program rules also provide work incentives in the form of a trial  work period, which allows the beneficiary to receive full disability benefits  while potentially earning more than the substantial gainful activity amount,  for up to 9 months. SSDI beneficiaries who earn above the substantial  gainful activity threshold after 9 months of a trial work period will no  longer receive SSDI cash benefits, but will continue to receive Medicare  coverage, if enrolled, for up to 7 years and 9 months. After the trial work  period ends, the 36-month extended period of eligibility begins, during  which SSDI beneficiaries are entitled to receive benefits so long as they  continue to meet the definition of disability and their earnings are below  the substantial gainful activity monthly earnings limit. Moreover,  individuals whose benefits stopped due to work may have their benefits  reinstated under an expedited reinstatement if for medical reasons they  are unable to work again at some point within 5 years. Under this  expedited reinstatement, beneficiaries receive up to 6 months of temporary cash benefits while SSA conducts a medical review. Despite  these SSDI provisions, participants of a 2013 Social Security Advisory  Board Forum have criticized the SSDI program for having poorly  structured work incentives, and we have previously reported that  complex SSDI rules related to these work incentives may result in  overpayments to beneficiaries.", "PDI policies we reviewed also provide for continued payments while  beneficiaries participate in the insurer\u2019s return-to-work program or find  other employment. However, in contrast to what is referred to as SSDI\u2019s  \u201ccash cliff,\u201d PDI payments are gradually reduced in some ways to account  for the beneficiaries\u2019 earnings. For example, in one policy we reviewed, if  the beneficiary participates in the insurer\u2019s return-to-work program, the  beneficiary may continue receiving benefit payments in addition to any  employment earnings. However, unlike SSDI, the combination of the  employment earnings plus the PDI payment would be capped at 110  percent of the beneficiary\u2019s pre-disability earnings. Under this same  policy, after the first 12 months that the beneficiary is disabled and  working at a reduced capacity, the partial PDI payment decreases  proportionally as the employment earnings increase until the beneficiary  earns 80 percent of their pre-disability earnings, at which point they are  no longer considered to be disabled. The other two policies we reviewed  provided pro-rated PDI payments as soon as a beneficiary had some  work earnings, until those earnings reach a threshold, such as 80 or 100  percent of their pre-disability earnings.", "Both SSDI and PDI policies offer services and supports to beneficiaries to  help them return to work, but PDI policies may focus more on early  provision of services and, depending on the policy, earlier intervention  and case management. SSDI program rules allow beneficiaries access to  return-to-work services and supports through the Ticket to Work (TTW)  program, which helps interested beneficiaries transition to self-sufficiency  through work. When individuals become eligible for SSDI, SSA  guidance calls for sending them information about public or private  employment networks or state vocational rehabilitation agencies.  According to SSA\u2019s guidance, beneficiaries can choose to work with one  of these service providers and develop a plan for work goals that may  involve services such as training, career counseling, vocational  rehabilitation, and job placement. The TTW program then pays for those  services and ensures that participating beneficiaries will not be subject to  a review of their disability while they continue to work with the service  provider. However, the SSA Office of the Inspector General reported that  fewer than 3 percent of beneficiaries were participating in TTW in 2015.  In addition, SSA-funded evaluations have found that TTW has had limited  success in returning SSA beneficiaries to work and reducing their  dependence on SSDI.", "In addition to return-to-work services through TTW, SSA officials told us  that beneficiaries may use services provided through or by other federal, state, and local programs or provider networks, such as the Department  of Labor\u2019s Stay-at-Work/Return-to-Work initiative. However, we have  previously reported that the large number of federal agencies and  programs providing employment supports to individuals with disabilities  represents a fragmented system of services, and little is known about  their effectiveness.", "In contrast, according to insurance representatives and the three PDI  policies we reviewed, PDI policies may provide early interventions,  funding for workplace accommodations, and case management to help  beneficiaries return to work. For example, one policy we reviewed  explicitly offered an early intervention program to covered employees  even when the PDI insurer was not also the short-term disability insurer,  to identify workers who might benefit from vocational analyses and  rehabilitation services before they are eligible for long-term disability  benefits. Separately, this policy also had a return-to-work program with  case managers who coordinate services and refer beneficiaries to clinical  specialists, such as nurse consultants, psychiatric clinical specialists or  vocational rehabilitation consultants. According to this policy, if the insurer  determined that beneficiaries were capable of participating in the return- to-work program, but did not, their benefits could cease.", "Information on how many PDI beneficiaries receive work assistance, such  as worksite modifications, and insurers\u2019 aggregate expenditures for such  assistance is also generally unknown. While participation in and the  impact of SSA\u2019s TTW program has been extensively evaluated, the  insurance representatives and researchers with whom we spoke could  not provide us with data or studies showing the extent or cost of work  assistance provided by PDI insurers, so the impact of these investments  is not publicly known.

According to the  author, if an individual is denied PDI benefits, the individual could  apply for SSDI.", "David Autor and Mark Duggan (Autor and Duggan) proposed  extending coverage of PDI to all workers through a statutory  mandate. Employers would be required to provide PDI benefits for 2 years to individuals with disabilities who are unable to work. At the  end of this period, PDI benefits would cease and SSDI would provide  benefits for individuals qualifying for SSDI. Under the proposal,  individuals with extremely disabling conditions with very limited  prospects of returning to work (e.g. stroke, late stages of certain  cancers, etc.) would be eligible to apply for SSDI at the onset of their  disability, in lieu of PDI.", "Table 4 summarizes key features of the three proposals to expand PDI  that we identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Unknowns Make An Assessment of the Potential for SSDI Savings Uncertain Differences in Covered Populations", "paragraphs": ["Existing differences in the SSDI and PDI covered populations may play a  role in determining the potential impacts of expanding PDI. As previously  noted, SSDI covers almost all workers, whereas PDI coverage tended to  be for those with higher wages and was more prevalent in certain  industries. Based on our review of BLS data, in order to expand  significantly, PDI would need to cover more lower-wage workers and  other occupations and industries where it is currently less common, such  as in retail and construction. However, as indicated in the Autor and  Duggan proposal, expanding PDI to workers currently not covered could  affect PDI premiums, based on the type of industry and wage levels.  According to various stakeholder groups we interviewed, changes in PDI  premiums would, in turn, have implications for the attractiveness of PDI to  employers and employees under voluntary proposals.", "The overlap in PDI with the SSDI beneficiary population also plays a role  in determining any potential impact of expanding PDI. As previously  noted, one industry survey reported that 72 percent of PDI beneficiaries  of its member companies also received SSDI. One insurer told us that the  longer PDI beneficiaries remain on PDI, the more likely they will also  receive SSDI. In fact, for beneficiaries on PDI for 2 years, 58 percent also  get SSDI benefits; and for beneficiaries on PDI for more than 5 years,  more than 90 percent also receive SSDI. Our review of these data  suggests that for those receiving both SSDI and PDI benefits, it may be  difficult to attribute return to work and other changes in circumstances,  such as changes in health, to either PDI or SSDI. For example, it is  possible that any differences in return-to-work outcomes for SSDI  beneficiaries who receive PDI versus those who do not may have more to  do with the specific characteristics and circumstances of the beneficiaries  than as a result of having PDI coverage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Types and Timing of Return-to- Work Assistance Offered", "paragraphs": ["To achieve SSDI cost savings, the three proposals assume that insurers  will provide or reimburse employers for providing vocational rehabilitation,  workplace accommodation, and return-to-work services, but the  proposals provide few, if any details about how this would occur. For  example, the two proposals that describe voluntary PDI enrollment do not  explicitly require that such services be provided through PDI. The Autor  and Duggan proposal, which includes a mandate for enrollment, requires  that PDI provide workplace accommodations consistent with the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and vocational rehabilitation  services. The proposal includes a list of vocational rehabilitation services  that insurers could provide, but the authors acknowledge that in practice it  is not always \u201cclear-cut\u201d when a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d under the  ADA is required and what the accommodation should be. As noted  previously, we were unable to find public data on the extent to which PDI  policies currently provide such services and insurance representatives  and researchers we contacted that collect and report PDI data said that  they do not collect such data from insurance companies. According to our  review of PDI policy provisions that allow for rehabilitation and workplace  accommodation services, the decision of what assistance will be provided  through the PDI policy, if any, and the extent of such assistance the  insurer provides or helps the employer provide, is at the discretion of the  insurer. It is also possible that insurers would make less of an  investment in return-to-work services for PDI beneficiaries under the two  time-limited proposals because the insurers are only responsible for 2 to  3 years of disability payments, compared to traditional PDI policies where  the employer may have financial responsibility to make payments to  beneficiaries until they reach retirement age, unless insurers can help  them return to work.", "Several stakeholders said that additional uncertainty exists with respect to  effectiveness or attractiveness of PDI expansion proposals for  populations currently not covered by PDI, such as low-wage workers and  those with physically demanding jobs. BLS data show that PDI is  currently less prevalent among these workers, and therefore less is  known about the type and effectiveness of return-to-work services that  would be offered to them under PDI expansion. For example,  researchers report that lower-wage workers may have jobs that offer  limited opportunities to adjust work schedules\u2014a flexibility that one  research group said could assist workers in the case of disability. In  addition, researchers stated that lower paying jobs tend to not offer sick  leave and other key benefits, and the absence of such benefits may  present another potential obstacle for successful rehabilitation and  workplace accommodation efforts. According to various stakeholder  groups we interviewed, employers in low-paying industries or who  otherwise do not offer these benefits would have less of an incentive to  offer PDI or other supports to help retain their workers compared to  employers who compete for skilled employees that are also typically more difficult to replace. These factors\u2014in combination with previously  discussed unknowns related to the cost of PDI in non-traditional sectors\u2014 reflect complexity and uncertainty about the extent to which PDI may be  expanded through a voluntary system.", "The proposals assert that expanded PDI would provide financial support,  accommodations, and rehabilitation services much sooner than SSDI.  However, based on our review, it is not clear if this would happen for two  of the proposals. As previously noted, the SSDI elimination period is 5  months, after which SSDI beneficiaries become eligible for return-to-work  assistance through the TTW program and financial incentives, but lengthy  SSA decision times may significantly delay when individuals receive  return-to-work supports. The Autor and Duggan mandatory proposal  has PDI benefits commencing within 3 months of disability onset, which is  sooner than SSDI, and therefore, depending on the circumstances, may  allow for the provision of return-to-work services sooner than under SSDI.  The Babbel and Meyer and Greszler voluntary proposals do not specify  the length of elimination periods. While the Babbel and Meyer and  Greszler proposals indicate PDI will provide return-to-work services  sooner than SSDI, it is unclear whether or how the timing of return-to- work services might evolve under the two voluntary proposals.

Such factors include the  likelihood that efforts to encourage PDI enrollment might be successful,  the effect of policy premiums and tax credits on employers\u2019 willingness to  offer PDI policies, and whether expanded PDI might lead to more people  also going on to SSDI.", "Babbel and Meyer asserted that congressional action and federal  outreach would clarify for employers that automatic enrollment with opt- out arrangements is legally permissible and thereby result in voluntary  PDI expansion. According to the authors, their approach was motivated  by the success of similar automatic enrollment provisions in the Pension  Protection Act of 2006 in raising the participation and savings rates in  401(k) defined contribution savings programs. However, since PDI  automatic enrollment is already available, it is not clear how their proposal  for congressional action and federal outreach would result in more  employers adopting it and employees participating. The Babbel and  Meyer proposal is also based on requiring employees to pay part or all of  the insurance premiums. According to employee advocacy groups,  workers at the lowest end of the wage spectrum in particular may have  little, if any, disposable income to pay for PDI, and also little incentive to participate when SSDI already replaces a relatively high proportion of  their wages. Further, in an employer discussion session we heard that  employees willing to contribute in part or the entire premium may also  have a greater risk of needing PDI benefits, and adverse selection could  result in higher premiums, which in turn, fewer workers may be willing to  pay.", "The Greszler proposal anticipates potential significant savings for SSDI  assuming that employers who had not previously offered PDI to their  employees would opt to offer PDI in exchange for a payroll tax credit.  According to an employer association, in making this choice, employers  would need to compare the financial benefit of a payroll tax credit with the  cost of PDI premiums, among other things\u2014which may evolve under the  proposal, according to insurers in a discussion group we held. According  to insurance industry representatives, the direction of possible premium  changes under the Greszler proposal is unclear because the proposal  reduces employers\u2019 financial responsibility to 2 to 3 years of potential  disability benefit costs. This shorter benefit period could reduce premiums  typical for longer term policies. However, since persons would not  generally be able to receive SSDI benefits during this period under the  proposal, there would be no offset of SSDI benefits against PDI benefits  (as discussed earlier). According to an industry association and an  insurer discussion group we held, the absence of the SSDI offset could  increase premiums, possibly substantially.", "Another consideration raised by SSA officials is whether PDI expansion  would increase SSDI applications and benefits paid, which would reduce  potential SSDI savings from the proposals and could increase the cost of  the SSDI program. Typical PDI policies may effectively require PDI  beneficiaries to apply for SSDI, and PDI insurers may assist beneficiaries  with SSDI applications. Insurance association representatives told us  that in addition to helping keep PDI premiums attractively low, such  practices benefit those who become eligible for SSDI benefits by  providing health care benefits that they might not otherwise be able to  access. One insurance association further noted that by helping PDI  beneficiaries complete SSDI applications, SSA may receive well- supported applications that are more efficient to process.

Only the Babbel and Meyer proposal developed an  estimate of potential savings. In forecasting SSDI savings,", "The Babbel and Meyer proposal estimated cost savings by assuming  that automatic enrollment would result in PDI coverage increasing  from 33 percent to just over 50 percent of private sector employees.  Comparing PDI disability termination rates from the Society of  Actuaries with SSDI termination rates, Babbel and Meyer estimated  that PDI expansion would save the federal government an additional  $500 million to $700 million per year, with a 10-year cumulative  savings of $5 billion to $7 billion. They said that because they were  unable to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive study of disability,  recovery, and reemployment, their proposal \u201cquantifies the benefits of  group disability insurance indirectly, using publicly available data that  are sparse, aggregated, and often difficult to interpret.\u201d", "The Greszler proposal relied on the Babbel and Meyer analysis in  concluding that there would be significant SSDI savings. According to  Greszler, early intervention would keep individuals on the job and  reduce the number of potential SSDI beneficiaries. Further, Greszler  assumes that the loss of tax revenue from the proposed payroll tax  credit would be made up by lower SSDI expenditures incurred during  the 2 \u2013 3 years that employees are covered by PDI instead of SSDI.", "However, the Greszler proposal did not quantify the magnitude of the  tax credit or the overall savings to SSDI.", "The Autor and Dugan proposal noted that SSDI expenditures would  be lower because mandated PDI policies would pay the first 2 years  of benefits, instead of SSDI. The authors also noted that, over the  longer-term, 2-year mandated PDI for employees has the potential to  pay for itself and generate SSDI savings if the proposed mandate  succeeds in allowing 1 in 11 would-be SSDI beneficiaries to remain  gainfully employed. However, Autor and Duggan\u2019s proposal did not  include an explanation of how, or data or evidence supporting that,  the proposed PDI mandate would achieve employment for 1 in 11  would-be SSDI beneficiaries.", "Our analysis of the Babbel and Meyer proposal found that the available  data used to develop the SSDI cost savings estimates due to PDI  expansion were not comparable and therefore did not result in a reliable  estimate of the financial impact of current or expanded PDI on SSDI. In  their proposal, Babbel and Meyer estimated cost savings by comparing  SSDI\u2019s and PDI\u2019s recovery rates. For SSDI, Babbel and Meyer used an  SSDI work termination rate that includes the number of SSDI  beneficiaries terminated during the year due to having earnings that  exceeded the substantial gainful activity amount, divided by the total  number of SSDI beneficiaries during the year. For PDI, Babbel and Meyer  used a PDI recovery rate that includes the number of PDI benefit awards  terminated during the year for multiple reasons, divided by the cumulative  number of months all PDI benefits were received by PDI beneficiaries  who received PDI benefits during the year.", "However, we found that the numerators and denominators used to  compare SSDI and PDI recovery rates are not comparable. For example,  the PDI numerator reflects a much broader definition of recovery than the  SSDI numerator, which may contribute to overestimating PDI\u2019s relative  recovery rate. Specifically, the SSDI numerator is limited to those  terminated from SSDI for earnings exceeding SGA, whereas the PDI  numerator includes terminations for reasons besides return to work, such  as medical improvement (even if an individual did not return to work),  failure to submit required documents to continue receiving benefits,  changes in coverage from inability to perform own occupation to any  occupation coverage, and other non-specified terminations. The  denominator used in the comparison also differs. For SSDI, it is the  number of people receiving SSDI benefits during the year. For PDI, it is  the cumulative number of months of all PDI benefits that were received by  PDI beneficiaries who received PDI benefits during the year. Because the  denominators are different, we were unable to determine whether they  contributed to an under- or overestimate of PDI\u2019s relative recovery rate.  Regardless, we determined that the non-comparable rates in Babbel and  Meyer\u2019s proposal affect the reliability of its cost savings estimate. SSA\u2019s  Office of the Chief Actuary also reviewed the proposal at our request and  concluded that the SSDI and PDI termination rates shown in the proposal  were comparable neither in concept nor in unit of analysis.

They also suggested that pilot programs could be targeted, such as to  larger firms. In discussing the Greszler proposal with the author, she told  us that a pilot test of her proposal might help show if the program works better in some industries or occupations than others, as well as determine  how employers respond to the tax incentive and if employees feel they  are treated fairly by private insurers.", "Similarly, we have previously reported that changes affecting the SSDI  program may raise particular implementation challenges, given the  program\u2019s inherent complexity; any changes may require pilot testing to  evaluate the potential effects or unintended consequences that the  Congress, the administration, SSA, and the broader public will need to  know to make an informed decision about whether to implement program  changes nationwide.

For example, an employee benefits survey and  several stakeholder groups we spoke with suggested that employees  tend to value other benefits, such as health insurance, more than  disability insurance. According to employee groups, lower-wage workers,  in particular, may opt-out of PDI under the Babbel and Meyer proposal in  favor of paying for other benefits, or forgo benefits entirely, especially if  premiums are high. In addition, based on our review, PDI may not provide  much additional benefit for lower-wage workers, and employee groups  told us that, given a choice, lower-wage workers might choose not to  participate in PDI since SSDI benefits replace a relatively high share of  their wages. Based on our review of SSDI and PDI policies, current PDI  policies typically do not include dependent and spousal benefits offered  by SSDI, and unlike SSDI have exclusions and pre-existing condition  provisions, as well as have time limits on benefit payments for some  conditions, which may result in workers finding SSDI more attractive than  PDI.
