The communities surrounding the former bases continue to recover economically from the closures. Congress recently authorized another round of base realignments and closures beginning in 2005. DOD has saved $16.7 billion through fiscal year 2001, and expects to save $6.6 billion in annually in future years. Although DOD plans to transfer nearly all of the 518,500 acres of unneeded base property to federal and nonfederal users, it has completed only some of the transfers. Environmental cleanup is the primary impediment to conveying the remaining property titles. The military services are using early transfer authority and leasing to make property available for reuse sooner. Although successful redevelopment of base property plays a key role in the economic recovery of neighboring communities, broader regional economic growth also is important to the process. Two economic indicators--the unemployment rate and average annual real capita income growth rate--show that most communities are doing well compared with average U.S. rates, despite delays in the transfer or reuse of former base property.

At the same time, the communities surrounding the former defense bases continue the lengthy process of recovery from the economic impact of the closure process. Our last comprehensive report on the implementation of base closure decisions was issued in December 1998.In that report, we concluded that the closure process was generating substantial savings (although the savings estimates were imprecise), most former base property had not yet been transferred to other users, and most communities surrounding closed bases were faring well economically in relation to key national economic indicators. In a July 2001 report and August 2001 testimony, we updated our closure implementation data and reaffirmed the primary results of our prior work.", "While the Congress recently authorized another round of defense base realignments and closures beginning in 2005, many in the Congress continue to have questions about the implementation of the prior rounds. Some in Congress have raised concerns about the adequacy of the department\u2019s accounting for the costs and savings associated with closure decisions and the economic impact on communities affected by the closures and their ability to recover. Others have expressed the view that all prior round actions should be completed before the introduction of any new rounds.", "As requested, this report further updates the status of the four prior rounds of defense base realignments and closures at the conclusion of the 6-year implementation period associated with the 1995 round. It addresses (1) the magnitude of the net savings accruing from the prior four closure rounds and the impact of remaining closure-related costs on future savings, (2) the department\u2019s progress in transferring unneeded base property to other users, and (3) the economic recovery of communities affected by base closures.", "In performing our work, we used our December 1998 status report on prior realignments and closures as a baseline for assessing the department\u2019s progress in completing prior round actions. First, we examined the department\u2019s recently reported net savings estimates and the rationale for estimate revisions over time. Second, we compared data on actual unneeded property transfers with earlier data and sought out the reasons for transfer delays. Finally, we reviewed key economic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and real per capita income growth) for communities affected by the closure process and visited select communities to assess the overall recovery process. Further details on the scope and methodology for our work are described in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["To enable the Department of Defense (DOD) to close unneeded bases and realign others, the Congress enacted base realignment and closure (BRAC) legislation that instituted base closure rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. A special commission established for the 1988 round made recommendations to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives. For the 1991, 1993, and 1995 rounds, special BRAC Commissions were set up to recommend specific base realignments and closures to the president, who in turn sent the commissions\u2019 recommendations and his approval to the Congress. The four commissions generated 499 recommendations\u201497 major closures and hundreds of smaller base realignments, closures, and other actions. Of the 499 recommendations, 451 required action; the other 48 were modified in some way by a later commission. DOD was required to complete its realignment and closure actions for the 1988 round by September 30, 1995, and for the 1991, 1993, and 1995 rounds within 6 years from the date the president forwarded the recommended actions to the Congress. Property disposal and environmental cleanup actions, however, were allowed to continue beyond the 6-year period.", "DOD reported that, as of September 30, 2001, it had taken all necessary actions to implement the recommendations of the BRAC Commissions for the four rounds. As a result of these actions, DOD estimates that it has reduced its domestic infrastructure by about 20 percent and saved billions of dollars in the process. DOD calculates its net savings by deducting the costs necessary to implement BRAC actions from the savings accrued by realigning or closing bases. These accrued savings include savings that occur during the budget year that a BRAC decision is implemented as well as the estimated cost avoidances during future years\u2014costs that DOD would have incurred if BRAC actions had not taken place. Some of the savings are one-time (e.g., canceled military construction projects), but most represent an avoidance of recurring spending (e.g., personnel reductions). Eliminating or reducing recurring base support costs at closing and realigned bases is a major component of BRAC savings. Savings are realized through a number of actions, such as terminating physical security, fire protection, utilities, property maintenance, accounting, payroll, and a variety of other services that have associated costs linked specifically to base operations. Over time, the value of the recurring savings has become the largest and most important portion of BRAC\u2019s overall savings. DOD reports these savings estimates to the Congress as part of its annual budget requests. The avoidance of other one-time, but not-yet-programmed, costs also may be significant over time, but they are not easily captured or reported.", "Once DOD no longer needs BRAC property, it is considered excess and is offered to other federal agencies. As shown in figure 1, any property that remains is then considered surplus and is disposed of through a variety of means\u2014initially by transfers to states and local governments for public benefit purposes and, thereafter, for economic development purposes (commonly referred to as \u201ceconomic development conveyances\u201d) and negotiated or public sales. Under public benefit transfers, local redevelopment agencies can acquire property for such purposes as schools, parks, and airports for little or no cost. In 1993, BRAC legislation was amended to provide local redevelopment authorities with BRAC property at or below fair market value or without cost to promote economic recovery in areas affected by closures. DOD was required to transfer property for economic development to communities in rural areas at no cost. Later, these provisions were replaced with others that allowed no-cost property transfers to local redevelopment authorities for job generation or lease back to the federal government. Consequently, local redevelopment authorities have usually sought to obtain property at no cost and, failing that, pursue it through negotiated sales.", "The economic impact on communities near base realignments and closures has been a long-standing source of public anxiety. Because of this concern, DOD included \u201ceconomic impact\u201d as one of eight criteria that it used for making BRAC recommendations in the last three rounds. Although it did not play as large a role in initial BRAC deliberations as did other criteria and was not a key decision factor, \u201ceconomic impact\u201d was of such sufficient importance that DOD components were required to estimate the impact of their recommendations.", "We have reported on base closure implementation issues on several occasions. Although many of our reports have been limited in scope, focusing on concerns raised by individual members of Congress on closure-related actions at a specific location, our first comprehensive report addressing DOD-wide closure issues (e.g., the magnitude and precision of cost and savings estimates, the progress of environmental cleanup and property transfer, and the latter\u2019s impact on communities and their recovery) was issued in December 1998. In that report, we concluded that the closure process was generating substantial savings, although the savings estimates were imprecise; most former base property was still awaiting transfer to other users; and most communities surrounding closed bases were faring well economically in relation to national economic indicators. Subsequent reports issued in July and August 2001 updated closure-related implementation data and reaffirmed the primary results of our prior work. In our July 2001 report, for example, we noted that DOD\u2019s net BRAC savings estimates, while imprecise, had not only remained substantial but also were higher than projected earlier. In August 2001, we reported that most BRAC-affected communities were continuing to recover from the impact of base closures and were doing well economically in terms of key U.S. economic indicators. Furthermore, we noted that while progress was being made, over one-half of unneeded former base property had not yet been transferred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BRAC Net Savings Are Substantial but Imprecise", "paragraphs": ["Through fiscal year 2001, financial data show that DOD generated an estimated $16.7 billion in net BRAC savings from the four rounds, an increase of $2.5 billion from its fiscal year 1999 estimate, and expects additional annual recurring savings of $6.6 billion beginning in fiscal year 2002, an increase of $1 billion. Although they have fluctuated over time, as projected costs and savings arising from the BRAC actions have changed, the net savings estimates have remained substantial. In addition to our analyses, studies by other federal agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the DOD Inspector General, and the Army Audit Agency, have shown that BRAC savings are real and substantial. However, because they are based on cost and savings projections that are not precise, net savings should be viewed as a rough approximation of the likely savings. The estimates are imprecise because the military services have not regularly updated their savings projections. Furthermore, DOD has not incorporated into its estimates all costs, including reported cumulative federal government expenditures of about $1.5 billion incurred by agencies to assist communities affected by the BRAC process. On the other hand, estimated net savings could be viewed as greater than reported by DOD if one considers, for example, that many environmental-related costs attributed to the closures would have likely occurred, but probably at a slower pace, even if the bases had remained open.

At the same time, our analysis shows that overall environmental costs remain within the range of prior program estimates that we reported on in 1996.A significant portion of the increased savings estimate is attributable to (1) an underreporting of $925 million in savings accrued from the 1991 closure round and (2) the inclusion of a $381 million savings estimate for two Air Force bases\u2014McClellan Air Force Base, California, and Kelly Air Force Base, Texas\u2014which was not included in the fiscal year 1999 submission.

This increase is attributed to adjustments in the inflation rate, changes in the implementation of BRAC actions at specific locations, and underreported savings by the Navy, as explained below:   About $470 million of the $1 billion increase in expected annual recurring savings is primarily a result of changes in the reporting base year (from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2002), which resulted in 3 additional years of inflation.", "About $366 million of the increase is due to overall estimated savings updates for specific BRAC actions made by the military services since fiscal year 1999. The Army updated its savings estimates for 24 BRAC actions on the basis of revisions submitted by Army major commands and in response to a 1997 Army Audit Agency report that recommended specific adjustments for audited BRAC actions. The Navy revised its savings estimate for the Navy Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, because of changes to planned implementation actions at the facility.

For example, while the costs incurred for the environmental cleanup of BRAC bases is recorded as a BRAC cost, DOD asserts that many of these costs would have been incurred anyway had the closing bases remained open.

As discussed previously, it updated savings estimates for 24 BRAC actions in its fiscal year 2000 budget request and an additional 6 in its fiscal year 2001 budget request. The Navy, on the other hand, has revised the savings estimate for only one of its BRAC actions since 1998. Consistent with our previous reporting in 1998, Army and Navy officials told us they revise estimates only when there are substantive changes to BRAC decisions that warrant such revisions. While the Air Force does not routinely revise its savings estimates from the initial estimates established by the various BRAC commissions in rendering their decisions, it did, however, update its estimates for McClellan Air Force Base, California, and Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, in its fiscal year 2000 and 2001 budget requests.", "Service officials have cited a number of reasons for not routinely updating savings estimates from BRAC closures and realignment. They acknowledged that updating savings has not been a high priority and that, instead, the emphasis in preparing the annual budget lies in estimating costs\u2014not savings. They told us that updating savings estimates is a labor- intensive process and could be costly because no systematic approach exists for the process. A fundamental limitation in DOD\u2019s ability to identify and track savings from BRAC closures and realignments is DOD\u2019s accounting systems, which like other accounting systems, are not oriented toward identifying and tracking savings. The services develop savings estimates when they create their initial BRAC implementation budgets and report them in DOD\u2019s BRAC budget justifications. Because the accounting systems do not track savings, however, updating these estimates would require a separate tracking method or system.", "In those instances in which the services did update savings estimates, the process for updating estimates varied among them, and they were unable to provide us with adequate documentation to permit us to independently validate the basis for the revised estimates. Army officials told us that their major commands provided estimate revisions during their funding request briefings with the Army Budget Office. Similarly, Navy commands submitted revised estimates to the Naval Engineering Facilities Command when a significant change was warranted.

DOD acknowledges, however, that environmental costs under the BRAC process may have been accelerated in the short term, and may have been more costly because of more stringent regulatory requirements. However, the marginal difference is not easily quantified. A similar case can be made for military construction activities. DOD has expended significant funds (an estimated $6.6 billion through fiscal year 2001) on military construction at receiving bases under the BRAC process.

For example, at former Fort Ord, California, the estimated $306 million needed to complete unexploded ordnance cleanup is likely to change because the location and concentration of all unexploded ordnance is still being investigated. A similar situation exists at Camp Bonneville, Washington, where, according to Army officials, the current $73 million cost estimate is likely too high, depending on the extent of cleanup agreed upon by environmental regulators and the Army. Aside from unexploded ordnance, the discovery of other hazardous materials can dramatically change cleanup cost estimates. For example, at McClellan Air Force Base, California, the more than $600 million estimate is likely to rise because recent cleanup actions have uncovered about 100 buried and forgotten drums of materials, some of which contained plutonium waste. According to Air Force officials, it is too early to tell how many more drums will be unearthed and what cleanup actions will be required in those areas where they are found. However, one estimate states that another 1,000 barrels may be buried. Under the Air Force\u2019s worst-case scenario, the remaining environmental cleanup cost estimate at the base would increase to about $1.5 billion.", "Considering the magnitude of the expected out-year environmental costs, the Congress has recently expressed concern over the cost accuracy and amount of funding devoted to DOD\u2019s BRAC environmental cleanup efforts. The Military Construction Appropriations Act of 2002, contained a general provision that directed DOD to accurately reflect the cost of environmental cleanup activities in its future BRAC budget submissions. According to the conference report, this was based on the fact that Navy and Air Force budget requests for fiscal year 2002 were far below the level needed to meet urgent obligations. As a result of what it termed inadequate programming and budgeting decisions by these two services, the Congress found it necessary to provide both services with additional funding (about $80.5 million for the Navy and $20 million for the Air Force) in fiscal year 2002 to complete mandated cleanups. Furthermore, the conferees directed the Navy and Air Force to allocate all unobligated balances from previous BRAC appropriations to address additional cleanup funding shortfalls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Using Several Methods to Expedite Property Reuse or Transfer", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing delays in the transfer process, DOD has resorted to several methods to make unneeded property more readily available to future users for reuse purposes.

These methods have created benefits for both DOD as well as affected users. By getting property into the hands of users sooner, DOD is able to reduce its expenses (e.g., caretaker costs). At the same time, users have the opportunity to put the property to quicker productive reuse (e.g., creating jobs and stimulating economic growth)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Long-Term and Interim Leasing Can Expedite Property Reuse", "paragraphs": ["The military services are using long-term and interim leasing to get property into the hands of communities while awaiting final transfer. Long-term leases are issued when deeds cannot be obtained immediately\u2014usually because of environmental cleanup issues. These leases, commonly referred to as \u201cleases in furtherance of conveyance,\u201d are usually provided to the expected ultimate transferee after the service has issued a final disposal decision for the BRAC property, and they can extend for many years. The Air Force, for example, has entered into 55- year leases at several of its former bases. Interim leases are short-term leases that make no commitment to the lessee for future use or transfer, and they are usually used in cases where the service has not yet made a final disposal decision.", "Leasing can provide advantages for both the services and lessees. It may allow the military services to reduce their operation and maintenance costs for BRAC property before final transfer by allowing the lessee to assume more of these responsibilities. It also allows the services to keep base utilities and infrastructure operational, thereby saving them and the lessee the expense of having to restart these services. Community officials stated that lease terms of 25 years or greater are advantageous because financial institutions are more willing to lend funds to lessees to finance their reuse and redevelopment efforts. Leasing also allows lessees to redevelop closed bases without assuming the risks of property ownership. As shown in table 3, the Air Force has leased more property (in terms of acreage) than the Army or the Navy.", "Two of the BRAC-affected sites we visited had leases in place while awaiting property transfer. At the former Loring Air Force Base, Maine, the Air Force in April 1997 negotiated a 55-year lease with the local reuse authority for 3,600 acres on the base. Reuse authority officials told us that the lease has allowed them to take on several expected long-term tenants and generate revenue for further redevelopment and reuse. At the same time, the lease also helped the Air Force reduce its base operation and maintenance costs. In April 2001, 2,800 of the 3,600 acres were transferred to the reuse authority, and the Air Force is retaining the remaining acreage as environmental cleanup proceeds. At the former Charleston Naval Shipyard, South Carolina, the Navy leased several properties to the local reuse authority while cleaning up the land to meet environmental standards. The reuse authority initially offered tenants short-term, 5-year interim leases, but these were modified to 30-year terms when it was assured that these tenants would become the eventual property owners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Transfer Authority Can Accelerate Property Transfer and Reuse", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that environmental cleanup has often delayed the transfer of BRAC property, the Congress in 1996 enacted the so-called \u201cearly transfer authority\u201d provision, which allowed property to be transferred before all necessary cleanup actions had been completed. For DOD to exercise this authority, however, certain conditions must exist, including the following:   The property must be suitable for transfer for the intended use.", "The agency must submit the terms of the transfer for a 30-day public written comment period.", "The transfer of the property must not substantially delay any cleanup actions.", "The deed must contain necessary restrictions on the use of the property to protect human health and the environment, ensure no disruption of remedial actions, and provide that all cleanup actions will be taken as approved by the appropriate regulatory agency.", "The agreements must have the concurrence of the governor of the state where the property is located.", "In terms of cost, DOD retains the responsibility for funding the environmental cleanup, regardless of whether it is performed by DOD or the user.", "A primary advantage of using the early transfer authority is that it makes property available to the future user as soon as possible, thus allowing environmental cleanup and redevelopment activities to proceed concurrently. This can save time and cost and provide users with greater control over both activities. Furthermore, it provides communities with the means to quickly put property into productive use, create jobs, and generate tax revenue. The Navy estimates that use of the early transfer authority has shortened the time required to transfer property by at least 4 months and, in one case, up to 54 months. According to an Air Force official, early transfers helped to transfer property sooner than conventional methods, and in one case saved the property recipient over $100,000 in loan interest costs.", "While early transfer authority can benefit all parties, it has not yet been exercised widely within the BRAC process. According to service officials, several factors have worked against its application, such as community adversity to taking risks, the absence of ready-to-implement reuse plans, the lack of support from state and local regulators, changes in intended property reuse, and distrust of DOD. Furthermore, exercising the authority may require DOD to commit more funds, in the short term, than what is available to meet environmental cleanup requirements. It appears that early transfer authority\u2019s use is an evolving process; service officials told us that they expect greater application as users and other parties become more familiar with its potential advantages. Table 4 provides a list of locations where early transfer authority has been exercised through fiscal year 2001, including those locations where a deeded transfer has been completed.", "DOD also uses economic development conveyances, which are designed to create jobs and promote economic activity, to transfer unneeded BRAC property to users. In 1993, BRAC legislation was amended to provide local redevelopment authorities with BRAC property at or below fair market value or without cost to promote the economic recovery of areas affected by closures. DOD was required to transfer property for economic development to communities in rural areas at no cost. Subsequently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 included a provision that required all economic development conveyances to be no- cost. It also permitted existing economic development conveyances to be modified to no-cost agreements if certain conditions were met. According to the conference report accompanying the act, the purpose of the provision was to support permanent job creation. Service and community officials told us that the effect of the provision has been to eliminate delays resulting from prolonged negotiation over the fair market value of BRAC property and to accelerate economic development and job creation. More recently, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 stipulates that DOD \u201cshall seek to obtain\u201d fair market value for property transferred from bases recommended for closure or realignment in the BRAC 2005 round. It also authorizes property transfers without consideration if circumstances warrant. DOD has not yet developed policy guidance for implementing these provisions.", "As of September 30, 2001, DOD had 61 economic development conveyances in place. Of these, 28 were implemented as no-cost agreements following enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, and 9 previously negotiated conveyances were modified to no-cost conveyances as allowed in the act. Appendix III provides a listing by location of the 61 economic development conveyances in effect.", "Although DOD has not quantified the overall impact of no-cost economic development conveyances in terms of facilitating faster transfers and improving economic activity, the reuse authorities and DOD officials we interviewed agreed that their use generally has benefited both parties. Negotiations between DOD and reuse authorities over fair market property values, which were often highly contentious, have essentially been eliminated, thereby accelerating the transfer process in many cases. According to officials from several communities we visited, funds raised to pay DOD for BRAC properties could now be used to invest in reuse and redevelopment efforts.

Overcoming the negative economic impact of base closures or realignments on local communities, including the loss of perhaps thousands of jobs, has long been a concern for their citizens, as well as members of Congress. Despite the difficulties of transition, local community officials attributed their recovery to a number of factors, including a strong national economy, diversified local economies, and the redevelopment of former base property, all of which play key roles in unemployment rates and income levels. According to recent economic data, a majority had unemployment rates for the 9-month period ending September 30, 2001, that were lower than the national average and had annual per capita income growth rates that exceeded the national average during 1996 through 1999. Furthermore, a majority of the communities had lower unemployment and higher per capita growth rates than when we last reported these figures in December 1998.

Officials also pointed to government assistance and base development, among other factors. (See fig. 7.) Although optimistic about the continued economic recovery of their communities, some local officials were concerned that the recent downturn in the national economy could hinder continued economic recovery.", "Officials from BRAC communities have stressed the importance of having a strong national economy and local industries that could soften the impact of job losses from base closures. Since the 1991 recession, and until the recent slowdown, the economic performance of the United States has been robust. Officials from rural communities surrounding Fort McClellan, Alabama, for example, told us that the strong national economy during the 1990s helped to mask the worst effects of the base closing, but as the economy has slowed in recent months, the area is beginning to feel the full effects of the Fort McClellan closure.", "Officials also point to diversification of the local and regional economy as key factors in easing economic recovery. For example, officials from urban communities surrounding the former Charleston Naval Shipyard Complex, South Carolina, believe they are better able to absorb the job losses from the base closure because their diversified economies provide a wider range of job and business opportunities. In a January 1998 report, we examined defense-related spending trends in New Mexico and the relationship between those trends and New Mexico\u2019s economy.  We reported that, although defense-related spending had declined in the state, the state\u2019s gross product and total per capita income had increased and that this economic growth might be due to efforts to diversify the economy to counter the loss of defense jobs.", "Officials also pointed to other economic forces at work in their region during the closure period that affected recovery efforts. For example, according to officials from communities surrounding Loring Air Force Base, Maine, a potato blight in the early 1990s adversely affected the potato-related industry\u2014a significant revenue producer for the county and the state\u2014and, in turn, slowed down the regional economy. Another event that adversely affected the regional economy was the enactment in the early 1990s of a Canadian law that allowed the Province of New Brunswick to apply a provincial sales tax on goods entering Canada from Maine. These fees forced many Canadian shoppers to remain at home rather than cross the border into Maine to shop, thereby ending most Canadian commerce in Aroostook County, where the former Loring Air Force Base was located.", "An area\u2019s natural and labor resources also can help economic recovery. The rural areas we visited, where agriculture has historically dominated the economy, have benefited from their efforts to diversify. For example, Beeville, Texas (Chase Naval Air Station), and Merced County, California (Castle Air Force Base), where farming or ranching have long prevailed, have been recently aided by an expanding prison industry. In Blytheville, Arkansas, where Eaker Air Force Base closed, the growing steel industry, which was attracted to the area in late 1980s, in part because of its access to the Mississippi River, has benefited the community. While the extent of economic recovery varies in each of these communities, economic diversity has provided a broader basis for long-term growth.", "Leadership and teamwork among participants at the federal, state, and local levels are essential to reaching agreement on key issues, such as property transfer, base reuse, and environmental cleanup, all of which can promote economic recovery. The lack of agreement can prolong the cleanup and transfer of property. In Charleston, South Carolina, reuse authority officials told us that state officials have been very supportive of their redevelopment efforts, both in terms of financial assistance and other efforts.", "Publicizing base redevelopment efforts and goals within the community and outside the community is a key strategy for attracting industry and helping communities gain confidence in recovering from the closure. For example, Charleston Naval Complex Redevelopment Authority\u2019s recent marketing efforts helped it to enter into an agreement with a British firm specializing in the packaging and shipping of machine and engineering products to move its world headquarters to the former base. Charleston officials also said that the positive efforts of the surrounding community governments to work together to recover from the shipyard closure helped the community to regain confidence quickly.", "To help communities successfully transform closed bases into opportunities, federal agencies have provided areas affected by closed or realigned bases with about $1.5 billion since 1988 in direct financial assistance.  This assistance has come in several forms, including planning grants to help develop the property, training grants to provide new skills for the workforce, and grants for base infrastructure improvements. A 1997 study requested by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration and prepared by a Rutgers University research team concluded that federal financial assistance succeeded in aiding job creation and economic recovery from base closures and defense downsizing.", "The redevelopment of base property is widely viewed as an important component of economic recovery for BRAC-affected communities. While not the only determinant of economic recovery for surrounding communities, it can, nevertheless, be an important catalyst for recovery efforts. Base closures make buildings and land available for new uses, which can generate new economic activity and new jobs. DOD data show that, as of October 2001, over 79,000 jobs, or about 62 percent of the nearly 130,000 jobs lost at major base closures from the prior rounds, had been replaced\u2014an increase from the 36 percent recovery rate reported in 1998. (See app. IV for further details on jobs lost and created at major BRAC bases.) Closed bases can have various impacts on the recovery process. For example, DOD data show that when the Charleston Naval Shipyard Complex closed in 1996, more than 6,000 civilian positions were lost. Charleston redevelopment officials told us that since 1996 they have attracted some 80 tenants and more than 4,200 new jobs to the former base. Further, for the 1996-2000 period, overall employment in the Charleston metro area has risen by about 20 percent, or over 45,000 jobs. However, a closed base can also hinder economic recovery. At Fort Ord, California, for example, officials stated that the poor condition of the base\u2019s infrastructure has slowed the economic redevelopment of the base.

The periodic updating of cost and savings estimates is not only a good financial management practice but also one that strengthens DOD\u2019s budgeting process by helping to ensure that correct assumptions are made about expected reductions in base operating costs. We recognize that accounting systems are more oriented to tracking expenditures than savings and that practical limitations may exist in fully accounting for all changes in savings estimates over time. At the same time, it is important for the services to have some means for periodically, systematically, and consistently updating their savings estimates where closure and realignment actions vary over time from original plans. Without a sound process in place to improve the accuracy of the estimates, the process becomes subject to criticism and the subsequent erosion of credibility.", "While DOD continues the lengthy process of transferring unneeded property from former military bases to other users and as communities continue recovering, DOD still has more than half of its unneeded property left to transfer.

To ascertain the extent to which cost and savings estimates have changed over time, we compared the data contained in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2002 BRAC budget submission and related documentation with similar data in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 submission, which was the latest budget document available when we produced our last comprehensive report on BRAC issues in December 1998.

We also categorized the property disposition data into the various transfer methods (e.g., economic development conveyances) used for property transfers to gain a sense of the predominant method being used. With regard to the untransferred acreage, we sought to determine the primary impediments to property transfer by examining 51 former bases with a combined untransferred acreage of about 291,447 acres as of September 30, 2001, or about 98 percent of the total untransferred BRAC property.

In performing our assessment, we used unemployment and real per capita income growth rates as measures to analyze changes in the economic condition of communities over time and in relation to national averages. We chose to use unemployment and real per capita income as key performance indicators because (1) DOD used these measures in its community economic impact analysis during the BRAC location selection process and (2) these measures are commonly used by economists in assessing the economic health of an area over time.

First, the Navy inadvertently omitted some estimated savings (about $183 million) for fiscal year 1998 from one of its 1991 BRAC round subaccounts. Because these savings were recurring, in nature, and were also omitted in subsequent years through fiscal year 2001, the error was compounded, resulting in an underreporting of $760 million. Second, estimated recurring savings for all military services were improperly adjusted for inflation for fiscal years 1998 through 2001, resulting in an additional $165 million reporting error. When combined, these errors constitute the $925 million underreported savings error through fiscal year 2001.", "In addition, another $381 million (about 24 percent) of the increase was attributable to increased savings estimates in the Air Force BRAC operation and maintenance subaccount at two of its bases\u2014McClellan Air Force Base and Kelly Air Force Base. Prior to fiscal year 2000, Air Force officials told us they had not submitted savings estimates for these two bases in its budget documentation because of uncertainties in the workload status of the depots at these locations. Air Force officials told us that they had subsequently prepared this estimate after the fiscal year 1999 budget submission. We were unable to independently validate the basis for these estimates because the Air Force could not provide us with adequate supporting documentation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: DOD\u2019s Use of Economic Development Conveyances", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 2001, DOD had 61 economic development conveyances in place.

As a result, only 9 of the 33 such transfers issued prior to April 21, 1999, were initially no-cost and they were obtained by communities in rural areas. The remainder was provided under negotiated terms. Subsequently, the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2000 contained a provision that allowed for no-cost conveyances for all BRAC communities after April 21,1999, and for the modification of previous conveyances to no-cost under certain circumstances.

Our visits to communities surrounding the Chase Naval Air Station and Castle Air Force Base were designed to see what progress they had made since our last visits to them in 1998; the remaining visits during this review were with our initial contacts. In general, local officials told us that their communities were recovering from the impacts of base closure and they were optimistic about the future. At the same time, they pointed to the considerable difficulties, frustrations, and losses that their communities experienced as they adjusted to the loss of military jobs, the redevelopment of base property, and the recent declining national economy. The economic impact on and recovery of specific communities within a region encompassing a closed base can vary\u2014widely in some cases\u2014because of such factors as proximity to the base and the business diversity within the community. For example, officials in Seaside, California (which abuts the former Ft. Ord) told us that the base closure caused significant economic problems for the community (e.g., closing of local businesses) and that these problems continue to hinder recovery. In the neighboring city of Monterey, however, officials told us that the impact was less severe because the city had a more diverse local economy and was less dependent on the base."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Community Impacts Resulting from the Closure of Chase Naval Air Station, Texas", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, we visited the communities surrounding the former Chase Field Naval Air Station, Bee County, Texas, and found that they were recovering economically from the base closure.

The medium-security prison, completed in 1994, occupies less than one-third of the former base and employs about 1,200 people. Without this prison and another prison complex built earlier and adjacent to the former base, local officials believe Beeville would not have survived as a community. According to a DOD Office of Economic Adjustment October 2001 report, 1,153 new jobs, or 120 fewer than reported in 1998, were created at the former naval air station.

However, within several years these negative aspects were overcome. Although the strong national economy helped in this recovery, Merced County\u2019s continuing growth is primarily a result of three factors. First, a new federal prison now occupies a portion of the former air base and employs 200 individuals. Second, real estate sales have begun to increase because a new University of California campus is expected to open in the fall of 2004 and eventually serve 25,000 students.

The impacts of the closures that officials conveyed to us are shown in table 10 and included initial economic disruption caused by the news of impending closure; loss of population; decreasing business revenue leading some businesses to shutdown; a drop in real estate markets and a rise in rental property vacancies; declining school enrollments; and social losses felt in the communities from the departure of active, educated military personnel and families. For example, two school districts (Limestone and Presque Isle) surrounding the former Loring Air Force Base, Maine, lost 300 to 400 students and 150 to 200 students, respectively, after the base closed. In the city of Weaver, a bedroom community hit hard by the closing of Fort McClellan, Alabama, the population dropped by 200 people to about 2,700 after the base closed in 1999. But there were some positive effects as well at the communities we visited. (See table 10.) For example, local grocers in communities surrounding the former Loring Air Force base benefited from new business from military retirees, who now shop in their stores because the base commissary closed.
