As early as 1990, VA began encouraging regional offices (VARO) to develop and implement improvements in their claims processing systems; but instead of decreasing, processing times and backlogs have increased. At the end of fiscal year 1994, almost 500,000 claims were waiting for a VA decision. About 65,000 of these claims were initial disability compensation claims. On average during fiscal year 1994, veterans waited over 7 months for their initial disability claims to be decided and, if approved, payments to begin; many waited much longer.", "At your request, we examined VA\u2019s efforts to address these problems.

Veterans and their families can apply for benefits at any of VA\u2019s 58 VAROs. Significant differences exist among VAROs; for example, as of September 30, 1994, their claims processing staffs ranged in size from 11 to 219. Likewise, performance varies considerably; for example, the time needed to process initial disability claims ranged from 86 to 367 days in 1994. VA\u2019s ability to process claims for benefits in a timely way has been a major topic of concern for many years.", "In 1990, VA took steps to fundamentally change the way services are provided to veterans. A key element of those changes is modernization of VBA\u2019s automated information systems, projected to be completed in 1998. Progress on this effort has been slow, and we have raised significant concerns about the adequacy of planning and implementation. In response to our initial work, VA agreed with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to, among other things, increase project oversight, establish outcome-oriented performance measures and document the system\u2019s effect on service, and update the project\u2019s economic analysis. The OMB agreement included timeliness goals to be met by the end of fiscal year 1998\u2014as well as interim goals\u2014for selected types of claims, including initial disability compensation and initial pension claims.", "In 1990 the Secretary of VA also asked all VAROs to identify and implement innovative changes aimed at speeding up claims processing and reducing the growing backlog. In response, some VAROs undertook major restructuring initiatives, but most continued using the traditional \u201cassembly-line\u201d approach to processing. Under this approach, each claim passes through several individuals, each of whom performs a specific task. One person enters the claim into the computerized system and opens the claims file. Another then determines what information is needed and develops requests for that information. Another communicates with VA hospital staff if a physical examination is needed. These steps continue until an \u201cauthorizer\u201d approves the decision. Often, files are centrally located and are sent back and forth from the central files to various claims processors many times before a claim is decided.", "The claims backlog and processing times did not decrease but grew from 1990 to 1993. The backlog of compensation and pension claims grew from about 378,000 to about 528,000 during that period. Table 1 shows that, during the same period, average processing time increased for the four types of claims specifically included in VA\u2019s agreement with OMB.", "VA attributed its claims processing difficulties to several factors, including significantly increased workloads resulting from downsizing of the military, increased complexity of claims, and expanded responsibility resulting from decisions by the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals created in 1988. \u201cThere is no ownership or accountability associated with the process. The claim physically moves from one location to the next, with each person responsible for a small part of the process and each movement contributing to further delay in the claim.\u201d", "The panel\u2019s recommendations addressed what it saw as three key problem areas in claims processing: (1) inadequate claims development, (2) excessive response time for obtaining evidence, and (3) an unacceptably long time to rate cases. (See app. I for a list of the panel\u2019s recommendations.)", "The recommendations were based, in part, on initiatives already implemented in one or more VAROs and on panel members\u2019 judgment. The panel was composed of people from both inside and outside VA with extensive experience and knowledge of VA operations and relied on expertise and judgment to identify root causes and develop recommended changes. Our work and the work of others have also identified these three areas as significant problems for VA.", "During 1994 some VAROs continued or began making changes intended to improve claims processing, and VA worked to develop guidance and policies for implementing the Blue Ribbon Panel recommendations. During that year the number of claims awaiting a decision decreased somewhat, from 528,000 in 1993 to about 485,000 in 1994. However, average processing times increased and VA moved further away from, rather than closer to, the 1998 timeliness goals. Officials told us that processing times increased because, during the later part of the year, VA focused on reducing the backlog of old claims, thus increasing the average age of claims closed.

The case management approach organizes staff into small work teams responsible for all claims processing steps for all or most types of claims. This approach reduces the number of staff involved in processing each claim. The functional alignment approach organizes staff into two types of work teams. One team handles the processing of all claims that require a rating decision, thereby allowing some specialization of staff responsible for the most complex claims VA processes. The other team performs all claims-related activities for claims that do not require a rating decision.", "Implementation of each approach could follow one of two paths. Option one would integrate some of the VAROs\u2019 staff responsible for all direct contact with customers\u2014Veterans Services Division staff\u2014with staff responsible for processing claims\u2014Adjudication Division staff. This would allow a veteran to talk directly, in person or by telephone, to the individuals most knowledgeable about his or her specific claim.

These initiatives include, for example, allowing claims examiners to contact claimants by telephone, developing a system to better track and locate claim files, and having claims examiners specialize by type of claim such as initial disability compensation or pension. Although empirical data were often not available to show a positive impact from these initiatives, VARO officials we spoke to who were implementing them believed the initiatives were improving timeliness or other aspects of service.", "Four VAROs that we visited allowed claims processors to contact sources of evidence by telephone rather than by the standard practice of sending a letter. Officials at all four VAROs found that using telephones was helpful. Officials at one VARO said that contacting sources by telephone shortens the time required to obtain the evidence and helps ensure that claimants and other sources of evidence understand exactly what VA needs. Officials at another VARO noted that applications frequently come in lacking critical information such as social security numbers. In such instances, processors simply telephone applicants to obtain the missing information.", "Locating files is a continuing problem in VA, one that regional officials acknowledged takes considerable staff time. One VARO modified VA\u2019s existing computer system to better track claim files. The files at this VARO were well organized, and officials said they have almost eliminated the problem of lost and misplaced files. Two other VAROs planned to modify their systems in a similar manner. In addition, VA is revising existing computer software that uses bar codes to track files. The revisions will allow more VAROs to use the bar code system.", "Another initiative\u2014specialization\u2014allows processors to become more knowledgeable about complex issues related to a specific type of claim. According to officials, this practice increases processors\u2019 proficiency. Data from one VARO that implemented specialized work teams late in 1993 show that processing times decreased for the four types of claims included in VA\u2019s agreement with OMB.

VA officials said that regional directors are in the best position to determine whether specific actions will work in their given situation.

On average, the 35 VAROs made fewer than three changes, and some of those changes were minor. For example, one VARO simply displayed graphs showing claims processing goals and target dates in the claims processing work area.", "Some VAROs we visited were reluctant to implement changes that appear to have considerable advantages. Officials at several VAROs, for example, expressed concern about allowing claims processors to use telephones to contact veterans, although VA officials believe that such contact is helpful.

An official at another VARO was concerned that staff would spend too much time \u201con hold\u201d waiting for responses from institutions such as VA hospitals.", "Furthermore, VAROs that want to change may have difficulty doing so. For example, two VAROs we visited were limited physically in how much they could change. One had recently renovated its space and installed modular furniture, which limited its ability to lay out its space to accommodate work teams. The other had implemented teams but could not store their files in close proximity to the teams because the floor was not strong enough to support the weight of the files. (Colocating files is generally thought to increase the efficiency of teams and improve customer service.) Likewise, regional and headquarters officials noted that some VAROs may encounter physical limitations that would make it difficult to provide all claims processors access to telephones.", "When we discussed these VARO concerns with officials in VBA\u2019s Compensation and Pension Service, they reiterated that these are the kinds of problems that necessitate flexibility: not all VAROs can implement all changes.

Officials at the one VARO took it upon themselves to travel to another to learn about the second VARO\u2019s efforts and results. These informal methods do not guarantee complete information sharing.

The compensation and pension staff responsible for monitoring VAROs did not have a list showing all initiatives. That staff\u2019s March 1994 data showed that 23 VAROs had implemented 50 initiatives, yet data obtained by the VBA reengineering task force showed that, as of January 1994, 35 VAROs had implemented 86 initiatives. Four VAROs, for example, had implemented some form of claims processing work teams on which the compensation and pension staff had no information. Also, at one VARO we visited, mail clerks processed all death notices received by mail instead of forwarding them to claims processing.

An official of VBA\u2019s Program Analysis and Evaluation staff told us that, according to his recent discussions with VARO officials, those officials want headquarters to provide this type of guidance.", "Some of the VAROs we visited performed weak evaluations. For example, analyses usually considered only the initiatives\u2019 impact on overall processing time or backlog; they did not consider other possible impacts, such as improved communications with veterans. Similarly, some evaluations had technical flaws. One VARO compared the quality of processing for a prototype, team-based unit with that of its unit using the assembly-line approach. Although the comparison showed that the prototype unit was more accurate, the study\u2019s statistical sampling methodology did not allow a valid comparison, raising questions about its conclusion.", "In other cases, VAROs experienced outcomes that were contradictory or could not clearly be explained by changed procedures. For example, two VAROs of similar size established similar types of specialized claims processing teams but had different results. For unexplained reasons, one\u2019s processing times continued to increase while the other\u2019s decreased. Likewise, where VAROs seemed to be improving, the reasons were unclear. VA identified four VAROs that had recently begun to meet some of the department\u2019s claims processing goals: One used specialization and met processing goals; the other three are among VA\u2019s smallest VAROs, and officials acknowledged that the three were among those that traditionally had the best processing times anyway. In fact, two of those VAROs had reported no changes in their processing structures and procedures.", "Data are also inconclusive because some initiatives may not have been in place long enough to determine their full impact. It is not clear how long evaluations should continue to accurately assess results. The importance of this issue is demonstrated by dramatically different actions involving three VAROs that have implemented claims processing work teams. Two VAROs disbanded their claims work teams after 7 months or less because processing times or backlog had not been reduced. In contrast, another VARO is continuing to use work teams even though, after nearly 2 years, its processing times and backlog have continued to increase. Additionally, some initiatives can only be implemented fully over the long term so their full impact cannot be evaluated in the short term. For example, the panel\u2019s recommendations included assigning and training additional staff to the rating activity and certifying rating specialists. Revised training materials, performance standards, and a method for certifying rating specialists are not scheduled to be ready until June 1995; then, officials said, it could take 2 years to fully train staff. Therefore, although interim assessments can be made, a full assessment of these initiatives will take several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Headquarters Will Have Limited Information About VARO Initiatives and Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["VA headquarters plans to continue to routinely assess each VARO\u2019s overall performance in the areas of timeliness, quality, and productivity using national data.

Ideally, VA would use control groups, possibly setting up separate sections within VAROs, one or more using the revised structure and procedures and others not. Control groups would allow VA to more confidently determine whether changes resulted from the initiatives or from unrelated factors, such as workload or staff turnover. But this method is problematic. Some portion of VARO workload would have to continue to use the existing approach at a time when management sees change as critically needed. Also, VAROs would have to operate for some time using two processing structures, which could significantly strain operations.

The Secretary said that the process involves all levels of VBA\u2014from headquarters, including the Compensation and Pension Service; the area offices; and the VAROs themselves. The Secretary also noted that VBA\u2019s project to reorganize claims processing\u2014the major focus of this study\u2014had been in development, testing, and evaluation for at least 2 years. On November 29, 1994, VBA issued organization models to guide VAROs in the future. VA believes its current process\u2014including analysis of outcome data and ongoing monitoring\u2014along with the knowledge and judgment of VA staff, is sufficient to determine the most effective initiatives and provide guidance to VAROs that are not making sufficient progress.", "In response to the Secretary\u2019s comments, we clarified our recommendation about an evaluation plan to recognize that VA has an evaluation process in place. We continue to believe, however, that the existing process is inadequate. We believe a more thorough evaluation is needed to enable VA to understand not only the outcomes but their causes and to effectively persuade\u2014and, as appropriate, direct\u2014VAROs to adopt the most promising changes.", "In support of the effectiveness of its improvement efforts to date, VA emphasized that data on average processing times began to show improvement in fiscal year 1995. VA said that processing times for several types of claims for the month of October 1994 were shorter than the times we report for fiscal year 1994 (ended September 1994). It is not clear, however, that these recent data are indicative of an improvement trend. More important, even if they do indicate a trend, VA\u2019s current evaluation process does not allow VA to determine whether changes to the claims processing structure caused the improvement.", "Interpreting the October 1994 data as the beginning of an improvement trend is questionable because monthly average processing times fluctuate significantly. The national average monthly processing time for original disability compensation claims in fiscal year 1994 ranged from 198 to 227 days while, as we reported, the annual average for that year rose to 212 days from the 1993 average of 198 days. The problem is clearer when viewed at the VARO level. At one VARO, cited by officials as a leader in improving claims processing, the average monthly processing time for original compensation claims fluctuated during fiscal year 1994 from a low of 74 days to a high of 143 days; for 10 months of fiscal year 1994, this VARO\u2019s average was lower than its October 1994 average.", "More important, whether these data indicate the beginning of a positive trend or not, the VA\u2019s current evaluation process cannot explain with any certainty why these changes are occurring and cannot confidently point to characteristics of VAROs or specific models that have the highest probability of success. For example, VA officials told us that during the later part of fiscal year 1994 VAROs had focused on closing the oldest claims (those over 180 days old). Because, by definition, closing older claims increases average processing times, the reduction in October 1994 may not have resulted from any claims processing initiatives, but, instead, from the 1994 focus on older claims.", "VARO experiences also demonstrate the difficulty in interpreting outcome data. Although VA points out that its claims processing project has been in development and testing for 2 years, the outcome data\u2014VBA\u2019s key evaluation tool\u2014are inconclusive about the effects of the models. For example, VAROs implementing similar initiatives achieved different results. In fact, the VAROs we visited that had the most experience with changed claims processing structures have not shown a trend toward improved processing times. In the New York VARO\u2014which played a key role in VA\u2019s testing and evaluation of one of the new organization models\u2014data comparing the processing times of staff using the new model with the rest of the staff did not show the new model to be faster.", "The Secretary also raised a concern about the possible negative impact of our recommendation. He stated that VARO staff were continually seeking ways to improve processing and that it would be \u201cunnecessary and would stifle creativity for all levels of management to know of and to control\u201d each of the many changes until an evaluation showed them to have positive or negative impact. We agree that local creativity should be encouraged. We have not suggested waiting to implement changes in processing structures and procedures until evaluations prove them effective, nor have we suggested that every initiative be evaluated in every VARO. Our report specifically recognizes the urgent need for change in claims processing structures and that some initiatives may be more important than others. However, absent evaluation before widespread implementation, we believe VA should position itself to evaluate at least those initiatives it believes to be the most important, and to do so in a way that allows it to understand the impact different VARO circumstances have on initiatives\u2019 effects.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other interested parties.

Compile and distribute models for the structure of consolidated rating activities containing both rating specialists and rating technicians. Require all VA regional offices (VARO) to submit for headquarters approval a locally designed plan to restructure their claims processing systems. 3. Elevate to the level of a war effort, the creation, testing, and implementation of the Claims Processing System. This system will be used (1) to help claims processors determine the exact evidence needed to support each claim and (2) to monitor the receipt of that evidence. (VA is developing this computer software package as part of its computer modernization program.) 4. Provide automated on-line access to reference materials (that is, regulations, policy and claims processing manuals, and so forth) through implementation of the Automated Reference Material System. (VA is developing this computer software package as part of its computer modernization program.) 5. Deploy manual development checklists for all aspects of claims processing. 6. Prepare a centralized training program for developing claims. 7. Finish the redesign of the application for disability compensation and pension benefits, and field test the redesigned application. 8. Design a new form to help veterans identify issues and evidence needed to support reopened claims and claims for reevaluation of service-connected disabilities.

Use these other modes to supplement written communications between claims processors and claimants and other evidence sources. 11. Revise forms/systems to include claimant telephone numbers\u2014both daytime and nighttime. 12. Expand the memoranda of understanding between the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to include examination quality measures. (VHA completes medical examinations for VBA.) 13. Establish a reporting scheme to monitor the quality, local and national, of VHA examinations. 14. Establish physicians\u2019 coordinators at VA headquarters, medical centers, and VAROs to improve the timeliness and quality of examinations. 15. Establish a joint VBA/VHA education and training effort concerning disability compensation and pension examinations. 16. Improve the automated medical information exchange (AMIE) examination process. (AMIE is a computer system through which VBA requests examinations and VHA reports the results.) 17. Transfer responsibility and associated resources for disability compensation and pension examinations from VHA to VBA. 18. Establish a high-level dialogue with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to communicate VA\u2019s evidence and other needs. 19. Update/verify VBA procedural guidance on obtaining SSA records. 20. If possible, establish a VA/SSA computer link to obtain SSA medical records. 21. Expand the current agreement with the Department of the Army branches for obtaining service medical records to all military service. 22. Assign VA personnel to Department of Defense records centers to assist in obtaining service medical records and to perform liaison activities. 23. Change VBA procedures and forward the claims of separating military personnel to the VARO serving their home state immediately, rather than waiting to send claims from the VARO serving the state where the separating personnel were located. 24. Seek guidance from the environmental support group regarding their sources and capabilities. (The environmental support group is a Department of Defense organization that assists VA in adjudicating claims involving service-connected stress.) 25. Provide guidance on use of evidence sources other than the environmental support group for development of claims involving post traumatic stress syndrome. 26. Continue to educate VBA and VHA staff and veterans service organizations regarding developing claims involving post traumatic stress syndrome. 27. Revise VA regulations to allow acceptance of photocopied documents, rather than requiring certified documents. 28. Ensure that the veterans network design incorporates tracking of case status through the appeal process. (VA is developing the veterans network as part of its computer modernization program.) 29.
