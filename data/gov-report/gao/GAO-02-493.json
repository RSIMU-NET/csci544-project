In response to our previous recommendation on data quality--including consistency and accuracy of reporting--Justice issued supplemental guidance, augmented its training programs, and continued reviewing agency annual reports. Data quality improved, but numerous anomalies remained in agencies' fiscal year 2001 reports. Justice's efforts to implement this recommendation are continuing. Justice also issued guidance encouraging better on-line availability of information, as GAO recommended. Although agencies have progressed in making information available electronically, not all materials required by e-FOIA were available on line as of May/June 2002. Further, certain information was difficult to find and was not always continuously available on Web sites. Justice officials stated that they are continuing to reinforce the need for full e-FOIA compliance and periodic agency review of Web site content, and to facilitate the sharing of best practices. Justice generally agreed with the report's findings and conclusions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In our open society, public access to information about the government and  its operations is a strongly held value.  The Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) has been a valuable tool through which the public has been able to  learn about the operation and decisions of the federal government.   Specific requests by the public for information through FOIA have led to  the disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing in the government  and the identification of unsafe consumer products, harmful drugs, and  serious health hazards.", "The 1996 Electronic Freedom of Information Act (e-FOIA) Amendments  were intended to extend the principles of FOIA to information stored  electronically and improve public access to agency information, in part by  requiring more materials to be available electronically.

As you requested, this report addresses  the progress that federal agencies have made in implementing the e-FOIA  amendments since our previous March 2001 report.", "Last year\u2019s report disclosed that data quality issues limited the usefulness  of agencies\u2019 annual FOIA reports and that agencies had not provided on- line access to all of the information required by e-FOIA.  We therefore  recommended that the Attorney General direct the Department of Justice  to improve the reliability of data in the agencies\u2019 annual reports by  providing guidance addressing the data quality issues we identified and by  reviewing agencies\u2019 report data for completeness and consistency.  We  further recommended that the Attorney General direct the department to  enhance the public\u2019s access to government records and information by  encouraging agencies to make all of the required materials available  electronically.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives for this update were to  determine the progress that the 25 federal agencies studied have made  in processing FOIA requests;  determine the progress that the 25 agencies have made in developing on- line access to materials as required by e-FOIA (often referred to as  \u201celectronic reading room\u201d access);  provide information on the views of FOIA officials and requesters  regarding the impact of the post-September 11, 2001, environment on  implementation; and  determine what actions Justice has taken on our previous  recommendations.", "We assessed the 25 agencies\u2019 implementation progress by analyzing data  from the fiscal years 2000 and 2001 annual reports they submitted to the  Attorney General, and by analyzing their department-level and FOIA- related Web sites to determine whether materials were available.  We also  interviewed FOIA officials at the eight major agencies covered in our  previous report.  To obtain information on the impact of the post- September 11 environment and of actions taken by Justice on our previous  recommendations, we drew upon interviews with officials in the eight  agencies, Justice\u2019s Office of Information and Privacy (OIP), and the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) as well as information from members of  the FOIA requester community.  The requester community members we  contacted, most of whom had been identified during our previous study,  are widely recognized for their expertise and involvement in issues  pertaining to use of the act, and advocate public access to government  information.  Details of our scope and methodology are included as  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FOIA established a legal right of access to government records and  information,  on the basis of the principles of openness and accountability  in government.  Before the act, an individual seeking access faced the  burden of establishing a right to examine government records.  FOIA also  established a \u201cright to know\u201d standard for access, instead of a \u201cneed to  know,\u201d and shifted the burden of proof from the individual to the  government agency seeking to deny access.  FOIA was enacted in 1966 and  was amended in 1974, 1976, 1986, and 1996.  The amendments in 1974  through 1986 made changes in procedures, modified exemptions from  FOIA, protected sensitive law enforcement information, and created new  fee and fee-waiver provisions.  The 1996 amendments are known as the e- FOIA amendments, discussed in detail later in this section.", "FOIA provides public access to government information through two  means:  affirmative agency disclosure and public request for disclosure.   Affirmative agency disclosure takes place in one of two ways.  FOIA  requires disclosure through Federal Register publication of information,  such as descriptions of agency organizations, functions, procedures, rules,  and statements of general policy.  This has come to be known as the FOIA  publication requirement.  The act also requires disclosure of final opinions  and orders, specific policy statements, certain administrative manuals, and  certain records previously released under FOIA to be made available for  public inspection and copying.  This has come to be known as the FOIA  reading room requirement.", "Public request for disclosure of records is the most well-known part of  FOIA.  Any member of the public may use it to request access to  information held by federal agencies, without showing a need or reasons  for seeking the information.  Agencies may deny access to material (e.g., by  withholding records or redacting information) that falls within any of nine  statutory categories of exemptions (see table 3 in app. II).   There are also  FOIA exclusions for specific, sensitive records held by law enforcement  agencies.  Agencies have statutory timelines for determining whether to  comply with FOIA requests, making determinations with respect to appeals  of adverse determinations, and determining whether to provide expedited  processing of FOIA requests.  Requesters are entitled to be told the reason  for denials, to appeal denials, and to challenge them in court.  Under the  act, agencies are required to submit annual reports on these FOIA activities  to the Attorney General.", "Figure 1 provides an overview of a generic agency FOIA process, from  receipt of a request to the release of records.  A brief overview of agency  FOIA processing is included as appendix II.", "The 1986 FOIA amendments established the current fee structure.   Agencies may assess three levels of fees, each with statutory limitations,  according to the type of requester and the intended use of the information  sought.  The first level of fees includes charges for document search,  review, and duplication.  These charges apply when records are requested  for commercial use, defined in the OMB fee schedule guidelines as \u201ca use  or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the  requester or the person on whose behalf the request is being made.\u201d  The  second level of fees exempts educational or noncommercial scientific  institutions and representatives of the news media from being charged  search and review fees when records are not requested for commercial use.  In such instances, these requesters are charged only for document  duplication.  The third level of fees, which applies to all requesters who do  not fall within either of the preceding two fee levels, consists of reasonable  charges for document search and duplication.", "Except for commercial-use requesters, agencies must provide the first 100  pages of duplication, as well as the first 2 hours of search time, without  cost to the requester.  Agencies may not charge fees if the government's  cost of collecting and processing the fee is likely to equal or exceed the  amount of the fee itself.  Agencies also may not require a requester to make  an advance payment (i.e., payment before work is begun or continued on a  request) unless the agency first estimates that the assessable fee is likely to  exceed $250, or unless the requester has previously failed to pay a properly  assessed fee in a timely manner (i.e., within 30 days of the billing date).   Agencies may, however, require payment before records that have been  processed are released."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Roles of Justice and OMB in FOIA Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Justice oversees agencies\u2019 compliance with FOIA and is the primary source  of policy guidance for agencies.

E-FOIA  requires each agency head to prepare and make publicly available  reference material or a guide for requesting information from the agency,  including a handbook for obtaining public information.  OMB issued an  agency guidance memorandum for developing such handbooks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 1996 e-FOIA Amendments", "paragraphs": ["These amendments sought to strengthen the requirement that agencies  respond to FOIA requests in a timely manner and reduce their backlogs of  pending requests.  To that end, the amendments made a number of  procedural changes, including   providing requesters with an opportunity to limit the scope of their  requests so that the requests could be processed more quickly;  authorizing agencies to implement multitrack processing, so they could  process requests by single and complex tracks, instead of processing all  requests on a single-track, first-in/first-out basis (thus giving agencies  the flexibility to respond to relatively simple requests more quickly); and   requiring agencies to expedite processing for requests meeting the  criteria for \u201ccompelling need\u201d that warrants prioritization over other  requests that were made earlier, with the requirement that an agency  determine within 10 days whether to provide such expedited processing.", "The amendments also required agencies to determine within 20 working  days (an increase from the previous 10 days) whether a request would be  fulfilled and to notify the requester immediately.  Congress did not establish  a statutory deadline for making releasable records available, but instead  required agencies to make them available promptly.", "E-FOIA encouraged on-line, public access to government information by  requiring agencies to make six specific types of records, created on or after  November 1, 1996, available in electronic form.  The six elements that the  amendments require agencies to make available on line are  agency final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as  well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;   statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted by the  agency and are not published in the Federal Register;  administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a  member of the public;  copies of records that have been released to any person through FOIA  and which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency  determines have become or are likely to become the subject of  subsequent requests for substantially the same records;   a general index of the \u201cfrequently requested records\u201d referred to in the   the annual FOIA report.", "Agencies are also required to make eight types of related information and  reference materials publicly available.  The law did not explicitly require  these elements to be made publicly available in electronic form.  These are   FOIA fee schedule,  an index of major information systems,  a description of major information systems,  a description of agency record locator systems, and   reference materials or handbooks on how to request records or  information.", "Finally, agencies have incorporated features that facilitate public access to  government information into their Web sites.  These features, which are not  required by law, are  information on obtaining public services,  a FOIA link on the agency home page,  a FOIA Web page,  Web site search features,  ability for requesters to submit requests electronically,  electronic links to FOIA office(s), and  electronic links to program divisions.", "According to legislative history, using electronic access to make more  affirmative disclosure of the frequently requested material was expected to  reduce additional FOIA requests for the same material.  This was expected  to enable agencies to make better use of their limited resources to  complete other, more complex, requests on time.  Because the affirmative  disclosure provisions had historically been considered to provide access  through a physical reading room, the expanded on-line access provisions,  including frequently requested records and other required elements, have  commonly come to be called \u201celectronic reading room\u201d access.", "The e-FOIA amendments also made changes to agency reporting  requirements.  The amendments changed the reporting period from  calendar year to fiscal year and allowed agencies more time to prepare  their annual reports.  Agencies were to provide these reports to the  Attorney General by February 1 of each year and to make them available to  the public in electronic form.  The Attorney General is required to make all  agency reports available on line at a single electronic access point and  report to Congress no later than April 1 of each year that these reports are  available in electronic form.", "E-FOIA also expanded on the previous reporting requirements.  For  example, it added requirements for information regarding denials, appeals,  the number of requests pending at the end of the fiscal year, the median  number of days that requests have been pending, the median number of  days required to process requests, the amount of fees collected, and the  number of staff devoted to FOIA processing.  According to legislative  history, these changes were intended to make the reports more useful to  the public and Congress by providing more visibility into response times,  reasons for not providing a response, resources and workloads, and  backlogs of pending requests.  The intent was to allow meaningful  comparisons among agencies about performance and allow Congress to  monitor individual agencies\u2019 progress over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice Has Issued Guidance on FOIA Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Within Justice, OIP has lead responsibility for providing guidance and  support to federal agencies on FOIA issues.

Further, it also makes a variety of FOIA and Privacy Act  resources available to agencies and the public via the Justice Web site and  on-line bulletins.", "In addition to OIP guidance, the Attorney General has often issued a policy  memorandum at the beginning of a new administration.  Such policy  memorandums have been issued in 1977, 1981, 1993, and 2001.", "The 1993 Attorney General memorandum established an overall  \u201cpresumption of disclosure\u201d and promoted discretionary disclosures (when  an exemption might otherwise be used to withhold information) to achieve  \u201cmaximum responsible disclosure\u201d under FOIA.  This guidance stated that  Justice policy would be to defend an agency\u2019s use of a FOIA exemption to  withhold information only when the agency reasonably anticipated that  disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption (a  \u201cforeseeable harm\u201d standard).  Otherwise, where information might  technically or arguably fall within an exemption, the 1993 memorandum  indicated that it ought not to be withheld from a requester unless it was  necessary to do so.

After a  series of conflicting court decisions, Congress in 1984 clarified the  interrelationship between the Privacy Act and FOIA for all federal  agencies.  As a result, individuals may make first-party requests using the  procedures in the Privacy Act, FOIA, or both.  Subsequently, OIP issued  guidance that it is \u201cgood policy for agencies to treat all first-party access  requests as FOIA requests (as well as possibly Privacy Act requests),  regardless of whether the FOIA is cited in a requester\u2019s letter.\u201d  This  treatment may provide a possibly broader response to a first-party request.

Agencies with multitrack processing designate requests as simple requests,  which require relatively minimal review, or complex requests, which are  more voluminous and/or require more search and review.  Agencies  generally reported median processing times of about 20 days for requests  processed in what they designated as their simple tracks; however, two  agencies reported much longer times (see fig. 3).  Median processing times  for complex requests were reported to be much higher than for simple  requests (see figs. 3 and 4).", "Agencies process FOIA requests on an expedited basis when a requester  has shown a compelling need or urgency.

Specifically, as shown  in table 1, agencies changed in terms of whether they reported at the  individual component level or agencywide, and also changed the tracks in  which they process requests.", "Annual reports for agencies with decentralized FOIA operations are  changing, in terms of how workload data (request processing and  backlogs) are reported: component-based reporting, agencywide reporting,  or both.  These changes are a result of August 2001 guidance from OIP,  which stated that agencies that handle FOIA requests in a decentralized  manner should report their data at the component level, rather than only in  aggregated form.

Finally, not all FOIA offices respond to requesters in the  same way.  A few of the agency FOIA officers we interviewed told us that  their agencies do not routinely provide the statutory 20-day determination  notification to requesters, because that extra step takes time away from the  actual processing of the request and/or because they expect to fulfill the  request in close to 20 days.
