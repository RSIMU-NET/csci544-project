As one of the  largest components of the Department of Homeland Security, TSA  obligated more than $1.4 billion through instruments called other  transaction agreements (OTA) from fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Congress  granted TSA other transaction authority in 2001, allowing it to enter into  agreements other than standard government contracts or other traditional  mechanisms. OTAs entered into under this authority are generally not  subject to certain federal laws and regulations related to federal contracts  such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), allowing TSA to  customize them to help meet project requirements and mission needs.

We assessed the reliability of the OTA data in FPDS-NG by performing  electronic testing and comparing it to data from TSA\u2019s financial  management and accounting systems. We found that over this timeframe  the data in all three systems were incomplete and we therefore excluded  OTAs that did not match in two or more systems. As a result of this step,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to report on TSA\u2019s  minimum use of OTAs; however, we were not able to independently verify  TSA\u2019s total OTA obligations during this timeframe.", "To address the purposes of TSA\u2019s use of OTAs and how TSA prices and  oversees them, we reviewed relevant TSA policy and guidance and  selected a nongeneralizable sample of 29 OTAs from the eight TSA  programs that awarded them from fiscal year 2012 to 2016. Table 1  shows a breakdown by TSA program of the OTAs we reviewed.", "The number of OTAs we reviewed varied by program based on total  obligations through the programs, OTA values, and the extent to which  OTAs awarded under a program were similar. For example, we reviewed  a larger percentage of OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage  Screening Program and Advanced Surveillance Program because these  programs accounted for about 79 percent of TSA\u2019s overall obligations  through OTAs from fiscal year 2012 to 2016. By contrast, we reviewed a  smaller percentage of OTAs from the Law Enforcement Officer  Reimbursement Program, National Explosives Detection Canine Team  Program, and Checkpoint Janitorial and Utilities Program because OTAs  under these programs were generally for a similar purpose. We reviewed  all of the OTAs awarded by the Office of Security Policy and Industry  Engagement and the Office of Global Strategies because each of the  OTAs awarded by these offices was unique. For each OTA, we requested  information from TSA on the total period of performance, including  unexercised options and obligations as of the end of fiscal year 2017. We  also reviewed file documents including the determination and findings,  business clearance memoranda, and acquisition plans as applicable and  interviewed contracting and program officials. Our review focused on five  key areas: rationale for using an OTA instead of a traditional contract,  method of selecting OTA recipients, OTA type, determination of price  reasonableness, and contracting officer\u2019s representative (COR)  monitoring. We also reviewed COR files for a sample of OTAs awarded  by the top three programs that awarded cost reimbursable OTAs and one  that awarded fixed-price OTAs to provide greater insight into monitoring  methods.

Under these authorities, agencies may  develop agreements that do not follow a standard format or include terms  and conditions that are typically required when using traditional  mechanisms such as FAR-based contracts. Agreements entered into  using other transaction authority are not generally subject to certain  statutory and regulatory requirements related to government contracting  such as the FAR and the terms and conditions of each individual OTA  may be tailored to meet the specific situation. For example, OTAs may be  fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, or provide that each party bear the costs of  their participation. In addition, the length of an OTA is negotiable, with  some agreements lasting a few days and others for years.", "As we reported in 2016, Congress has granted other transaction authority  to 11 federal agencies. The statutory authorities for most agencies,  however, include some limitations on the use of the agreements, although  the extent and type of limitations vary.

Three agencies\u2014the  Federal Aviation Administration, TSA, and the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration\u2014used OTAs for different activities, such as airport  security and education and outreach. Only a few agencies, including TSA  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have  unrestricted authority to award OTAs.

These  programs each used a class determination and findings that describes the  general requirement and other parameters such as a range of possible  award amounts or periods of performance. TSA has an OTA template  with standard provisions. Terms tailored to the specific airport or law  enforcement agency are then provided in the individual OTAs. The  following examples illustrate some of the ways TSA has used OTAs to  reimburse airports and law enforcement agencies for the costs associated  with TSA security programs.", "The Electronic Baggage Screening Program is an acquisition  program that tests, procures, deploys, and maintains checked  baggage screening equipment at federalized airports. TSA uses  FAR-based contracts to buy things like explosives detection machines  and engineering support services. TSA uses OTAs to reimburse  airports for the allowable design and construction costs associated  with facility modifications needed for installing, updating, or replacing  in-line checked baggage screening systems. These systems use  conveyor belts to route checked luggage through an explosives  detection machine which captures an image of the checked bag to  determine if the bag contains any type of threat item including  explosives. Agreements generally range in value from $50,000 to  $150 million, and the anticipated period of performance can range  from 6 months to 3 years, depending on the size and complexity of  the project. In one example, TSA entered into an OTA to reimburse  the City of Cleveland about $24 million for work at Cleveland Hopkins  International Airport for installation of explosive detection systems  within the checked baggage screening area.", "The Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program provides  partial salary reimbursement to approximately 325 airports to offset  the costs of carrying out aviation law enforcement responsibilities in  support of passenger screening activities. Reimbursement is based  on an established \u201cnot-to-exceed\u201d hourly rate or the actual cost per  hour, whichever is lower. Agreements range in value depending on  the airport category, the number of checkpoints and law enforcement  officers, hours of operation, and availability of funds. The period of  performance for these agreements is generally 3 to 5 years. For  example, TSA entered into an agreement with the Dallas/Fort Worth  International Airport Board that lasted from October 2012 to March  2016 to reimburse the airport about $5.5 million.", "While the five reimbursement programs awarded numerous OTAs for the  same purpose to different airports and law enforcement agencies, the  remaining three non-reimbursement programs awarded few OTAs and  their use was more varied. Specifically, the Office of Security Policy and  Industry Engagement, the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal  Service, and the Office of Global Strategies used OTAs for a range of  services including intelligence analysis and the development of aviation  standards. For example:", "The Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement is  responsible for developing security policies to reduce the risk of  catastrophic terrorist attacks. From fiscal year 2012 to 2016, the office  awarded four OTAs. These included two awards to the American  Public Transportation Association to meet ongoing requirements for  intelligence gathering, public transit information sharing and analysis,  and the development of mass transit and passenger rail security  practices.", "The Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service  awarded 13 OTAs to pay for parking for federal air marshals and  authorized Law Enforcement Office employees at airports including  John F. Kennedy International and Washington Dulles International.  However, in September 2016, TSA competitively awarded a contract  to manage parking expenses at numerous airports. According to  officials, parking requirements for the Office of Law  Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service will be met through the  contract and as a result, existing OTAs for this requirement are being  phased out.", "Other than the parking OTAs, TSA officials noted that the requirements  for the seven remaining programs that used OTAs from fiscal year 2012  to 2016 are ongoing and that TSA will continue to use OTAs for the same  purposes in fiscal year 2017 and beyond, contingent on available funding.

For the 29 OTAs we reviewed,  we found that the methods used to determine price reasonableness and  provide monitoring varied based on the complexity of the requirement.", "Approaches to determining price reasonableness ranged from instances  where TSA extensively evaluated proposed costs to more straightforward  analysis. For OTAs awarded by the Electronic Baggage Screening  Program where the requirements for infrastructure design and  construction can be complex, the program produces an independent  government cost estimate based on design drawings and specifications  from the airports which are required to follow TSA\u2019s detailed guidance.  The program compares the estimate with the airport authority\u2019s  independent bid for the design and construction. Any discrepancies are  noted in the technical evaluation, which the contracting officer reviews  and documents in the business clearance memorandum. For example, in  fiscal year 2016, TSA awarded an OTA for $23 million to the City of  Chicago for the recapitalization of the checked baggage resolution area at  O\u2019Hare International Airport. Certain proposed costs in the contractor\u2019s  bid were higher than TSA\u2019s independent government cost estimate. The  contracting officer performed an evaluation of the costs and determined  that they were reasonable and that the difference was, in part, the result  of the airport having greater familiarity with the existing conditions at the  site than TSA\u2019s cost estimators.", "By contrast, some programs took a more straightforward approach to  determining price reasonableness, including cases where the costs were  predetermined or not negotiable. For example, the Checkpoint Janitorial  and Utilities Program used OTAs as a vehicle for reimbursing airport  authorities for the costs of electricity to operate TSA screening equipment  and for janitorial services in checkpoint areas. TSA had independently  verified electricity prices set by the local power authority. Prices for  janitorial services were verified based on the airport\u2019s competitively- awarded janitorial contracts. In one case, TSA entered into an OTA to  reimburse the Massachusetts Port Authority for $678,000 for one year.  TSA performed price analysis on historical data from agreements dating  back to 2008 and reviewed changes to the checkpoint square footage  and changes in electrical consumption based on use of new TSA  equipment. The airport authority provided documentation verifying  electrical rates set by the local power authority that TSA\u2019s contracting  officer used to determine fair and reasonable pricing. Janitorial costs were  based on TSA\u2019s pro-rated share of the airport\u2019s competitively-awarded  janitorial contract and considered to be fair and reasonable based on  adequate competition in the commercial market-place. TSA verified the  rates each year prior to executing options.", "COR monitoring similarly varied depending on the complexity of the  requirement. For the more complex design and construction projects  under the Electronic Baggage Screening Program, COR monitoring was  more rigorous than for programs with less complex requirements.  According to 2016 guidance, the COR is the primary interface between  TSA and the airport and is responsible for performing stakeholder  coordination functions. During the design phase, the COR is to review the  airport\u2019s design documentation to ensure compliance with TSA\u2019s  guidelines and standards in collaboration with TSA subject matter  experts. During the construction phase, the COR is responsible for  performing ongoing oversight including reviewing invoices prior to  payment. For an OTA awarded to the Miami Dade Aviation Department  the COR reviews monthly milestone progress status reports as well as  weekly status reports prepared by TSA\u2019s site integration contractor  highlighting work completed, ongoing activities, and program risks. A  contracting official noted that schedule slippage is a big risk for cost  reimbursement projects which is mitigated by COR oversight, as well as  the ongoing oversight of the site leads. A contracting official also noted  that most CORs for these OTAs have DHS certification for program and  project management providing them with greater technical and  administrative expertise to monitor more complex projects.", "In one instance on another project with complex requirements under the  Advanced Surveillance Program, project monitoring resulted in TSA and  the airport working together to contain costs when a project did not go as  expected. In fiscal year 2012, TSA awarded an OTA for $7.2 million to the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the design, installation  and maintenance of a security system, including closed-circuit television  cameras and associated software, at John F. Kennedy International  Airport. In fiscal year 2013, TSA modified the OTA to add more cameras,  thereby increasing the cost of the project to $21 million. However, during  installation, the Port Authority experienced several unforeseen issues with  the project, including reduced work hours available for unionized labor  and asbestos abatement costs. As a result, the Port Authority reassessed  its original cost estimate and determined that it was not sustainable. In  fiscal year 2017, TSA and the Port Authority agreed to decrease the  scope of the project from 751 cameras to 389 cameras to stay within the  original $21 million estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Found Improved Compliance in Its Reviews of OTAs after Taking Action to Address Lapses in Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Starting in fiscal year 2015, four years after it issued its 2011 OTA policy,  TSA began to include OTAs in its contract compliance review program.  Compliance reviews are conducted quarterly based on a selection of  contracts and OTAs awarded in the previous quarter and intended to  improve contracting operations, ensure compliance with applicable  standards and policies, and identify best practices. Based on the number  of findings identified in its review of six OTA actions included in a 2015  quarterly review, TSA commissioned an OTA-specific compliance review  in June 2015. The OTA-specific review covered 30 actions with a total  value of about $82 million and identified significant gaps in documentation  and reporting. For example, 18 of 27 OTAs awarded after TSA\u2019s 2011  policy was issued did not include a determination and findings approving  the action. As noted above, this is a key document that describes the  rationale for using an OTA instead of a traditional contract and the  determination of price reasonableness. The review also found that 18 of  30 files did not document the assignment of a COR to perform oversight  and that 20 of 30 FPDS-NG records were incorrect.", "In response to the findings of the OTA-specific compliance review, TSA  implemented a number of actions and has subsequently found  improvement in OTAs meeting documentation and reporting  requirements. We found that TSA revised the OTA policy to clarify  requirements and increased training for contracting officers with OTA  warrants. Specifically, to obtain the OTA warrant, contracting officers  must complete webinar training and 3 days of classroom training. To  maintain the warrant, contracting officers must retake the webinar training  every two years. According to TSA contracting officials, all of the 56  contracting officers had completed the new training requirements as of  May 2017. In addition, TSA has continued to include OTAs in its quarterly  compliance review process. Based on our analysis of TSA\u2019s fiscal year  2016 compliance reviews, we found that TSA reviewed 16 OTAs with a  total value of $62 million. In those reviews, 12 of the 16 findings were  determined to be low risk. For example, several of the files did not include  documentation of COR certification. The remaining four OTAs had  findings that were determined to be medium risk. This includes, for  example, one case where the OTA period of performance started 5  months before the OTA was signed. None of the OTAs, however, was  missing a determination and findings and three had missing or incorrect  FPDS-NG entries. Officials noted that their efforts to increase training,  oversight, and enforcement of OTA policies and procedures have resulted  in increased awareness of reporting requirements and greater  compliance.", "In addition, TSA also recently increased oversight of the COR program to  support efficient OTA and contract oversight and administration. A TSA  official responsible for the COR program reported that in fiscal year 2017,  TSA began to conduct quarterly compliance reviews of the COR program  to ensure greater consistency in oversight practices across the agency.  According to COR compliance review guidance issued in 2016, the  reviews are intended to highlight positive practices, effective management  techniques, and identify areas of improvements.", "Our analysis of data in FPDS-NG showed that issues with incomplete  data have been corrected over time, in part due to increased oversight.  We compared data reported in TSA\u2019s financial management and  accounting systems with data reported in FPDS-NG and found that the  percentage of new OTAs reported in FPDS-NG increased from 37  percent in 2012 to 95 percent in 2016. TSA\u2019s policy requires that OTAs be  reported in the OTA module within FPDS-NG. The awarding contracting  officer has responsibility for accurately entering OTA information,  including the value of the award and the period of performance. TSA  contracting officials attributed gaps in data in part to the fact that the  process for entering OTA data into FPDS-NG is manual, whereas FPDS- NG automatically pulls data for contracts from TSA\u2019s contract writing  system. According to officials, OTAs are excluded from the contract  writing system due to system limitations and this additional step increases  the chance that a contracting officer may forget to enter the data into  FPDS-NG or enter it into the system incorrectly. TSA officials noted that  they have taken steps to improve the accuracy of the data reported in  FPDS-NG by reviewing and verifying entries on a monthly basis in  accordance with TSA\u2019s policy.", "Our review of 29 OTAs also demonstrated that the OTAs generally met  the requirements for the key areas of TSA policy that we reviewed. For  example, TSA\u2019s policy states that if the OTA will be awarded without  competition, the determination and findings must include a discussion of  the method for selecting the OTA recipient. None of the OTAs we  reviewed was competed because TSA determined that competition was  not applicable due to the nature of the requirements. Nonetheless, all the  determination and findings included a discussion of the method for  selecting OTA recipients, a process that varied by program. For example,  the Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program posts a solicitation  and selects eligible applicants based on review criteria. By contrast, the  Advanced Surveillance Program prioritizes projects using a risk-based  matrix that assesses threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences populated  with data from 449 airports.", "Despite improvements, TSA officials acknowledged the need for  continued vigilance based on several issues we identified. For example,  TSA entered into a \u201cno funding\u201d OTA in 2013 with Signature Flight  Support, a commercial fixed-base operator at Ronald Reagan  Washington National Airport. A fixed-base operator is an organization  granted the right by an airport to provide aeronautical services such as  fueling, hangaring, tie-down and parking, aircraft rental, aircraft  maintenance, flight instruction, and similar services. Under the  agreement, Signature Flight Support collects and remits special security  screening and threat assessment fees from airline operators on behalf of  TSA, fees that are required due to the airport\u2019s location within a flight  restricted zone and special flight rules area. TSA does not obligate funds  through the OTA, which primarily establishes the responsibilities and  procedures for the fee collection and remittal. Our review found that TSA  did not take any action to extend or renew the agreement after it expired  in December 2014. However, TSA program officials told us that Signature  Flight Support continued to provide the service although an agreement  was not in place. When we brought this issue to TSA\u2019s attention, officials  agreed the OTA period of performance should have been extended each  year. Officials told us that as of October 2017 they anticipate awarding a  new OTA for this requirement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018,  more than three years after the OTA expired. In addition to the steps TSA  has taken to improve OTA oversight, such as revising its OTA policy and  increasing training requirements, TSA officials told us that they will  continue to conduct quarterly compliance reviews and monthly data  verification in accordance with their policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Homeland Security  for comment.

Depending on the airport\u2019s  size, TSA will reimburse 90 or 95 percent of the allowable, allocable and  reasonable cost of certain projects. In other types of projects, TSA  provides 100 percent reimbursement\u2014for example, for existing systems  requiring the correction of security or safety deficiencies.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: TSA produces an  independent government cost estimate based on design drawings and  specifications received from the airport and approved by TSA. The  estimate is developed using industry standards and is used for evaluating  total project cost. When bids are received from the airport, TSA compares  the bid amount with the estimate. TSA may conduct further analysis and  discussion to ensure that the estimate correctly reflects the scope  included in the bid documents.", "Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative (COR) monitoring: The COR is  the primary interface between TSA and the airport and is responsible for  performing stakeholder coordination functions. During the design phase,  the COR is to review the airport\u2019s design documentation to ensure  compliance with TSAs guidelines and standards in collaboration with TSA  subject matter experts. During the construction phase, the COR is to  monitor project schedule and scope through processes such as weekly  and monthly reporting.", "Purpose: Provides partial reimbursement to approximately 325 airports  to offset the allowable costs of carrying out aviation law enforcement  responsibilities in support of passenger screening activities.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: Participants are not traditional contracting  partners; most participants must contribute to the cost of providing law  enforcement officer support at the checkpoints; and the agreements do  not acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the  government.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: The program posts a solicitation to  FedBizOpps.gov with eligibility requirements, application process, review  criteria, and selection process. Airports as well as state, local, or other  public institutions/organizations responsible for commercial airport  operations that have incurred law enforcement service costs due to TSA  security mandates are eligible. The Federal Security Director\u2014a TSA  employee responsible for security operations at federalized airports\u2014 along with the Law Enforcement Officer Program Office, Office of Chief  Counsel, and the contracting officer, participate in selecting eligible  applicants.", "OTA type: Partial cost reimbursement.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: OTAs are negotiated to  provide reimbursement for law enforcement officer support at an  established \u201cnot-to-exceed\u201d hourly rate or the actual cost per hour,  whichever is lower. The amount of partial reimbursement is based on  airport category, the number of checkpoints, hours of operation, and  availability of funds.", "COR monitoring: CORs provide technical direction and day-to-day  oversight of the program, work with the airport Federal Security Director  to make sure that requirements are being satisfied, and approve invoices  prior to payment.", "Purpose: Provides reimbursement for the allowable costs incurred to  design, install, or expand surveillance systems to meet the required views  of the local TSA. Project costs generally range from $200,000 to $21  million with an anticipated period of performance ranging from 6 months  to 3 years depending on the complexity of the system and facility size.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: The primary beneficiary of the  surveillance equipment is the facility that will take ownership of the  system and be solely responsible for its operation. The use of an OTA  provides for the facility to manage and perform the work but allows TSA  oversight and control over the expenditure of TSA funds. TSA will not  benefit directly from the purchase, installation, and operation of the  system, so a traditional contract would not be appropriate.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: The program prioritizes projects  based on a risk-based matrix that assesses threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences based on data from 449 airports. Airports must be willing  to complete the project within the required timeframe.", "OTA type: Cost reimbursement.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: The program uses a  pre-award systems engineering process which culminates in a project  evaluation and plan, a comprehensive surveillance assessment of TSA  managed areas, and an independent government cost estimate. TSA  reviews the cost elements to, for example, validate labor categories, labor  hours, materials, and other direct costs based on industry standards and  comparison with other projects. The program also uses market research  and historical data to inform price analysis.", "COR monitoring: The COR works with project coordinators to monitor  OTA performance and maintains direct contact with the transportation  facility and the local TSA representatives. The COR reviews invoices to  ensure that the transportation facility (via its contractor) has met all  acceptance criteria prior to approval and payment of each invoice. Upon  completion of installation and testing, TSA obtains an acceptance report  to be signed by the transportation facility authority and major stakeholders  including facility representatives, and the responsible TSA Federal  Security Director, contracting officer, and COR.", "Purpose: Provides partial reimbursement to airports, mass transit  systems, and state and local law enforcement participants for the  allowable costs incurred associated with the operation of the authorized  canine teams and explosives storage magazines. Allowable costs that will  be reimbursed include handlers' salaries and care for the canines. In turn,  the local jurisdiction agrees to a set of responsibilities including using TSA  trained canine teams at least 80 percent of their on-duty time in the  transportation environment and to maintain a minimum of three certified  teams available for around-the-clock incident response. The program  reimburses participants up to $50,500 per canine team for allowable costs  incurred. The period of performance for these OTAs is up to 5 years.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: A standard procurement contract is not  suitable because the airports, mass transit, and maritime facilities are not  owned by TSA, but by airport authorities, and state and local agencies.  These entities have the responsibility for the control and oversight of  security operations at a specific location, either by having their own law  enforcement officers, or using the state or local law enforcement officers.  Since TSA does not own the airport or have primary law enforcement  responsibility and only provides participants partial reimbursement for the  operating costs of the teams, an OTA is warranted.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: Transportation authorities and/or  local law enforcement entities submit a written request outlining their  desire to join the program in which they outline the need for the canine  teams within their respective transportation system/s. TSA selects  recipients based on a review of the transportation system\u2019s risk profile  and the program\u2019s available team openings.", "OTA type: Partial cost reimbursement.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: The $50,500 per team  stipend only covers a portion of the cost to the participant. There are  instances after award that require an additional price reasonableness  determination, such as when a participant requests reimbursement for a  supply or service that is either unknown to the program or inconsistent  with program historical prices for the given supply/service. If the program  determines that the item is allocable the program will determine whether it  was procured competitively and any facts that may support it being higher  than historical prices paid. If the item was not procured competitively, the  program will look at current price lists and catalogs for a same or similar  item and consult program subject matter experts on their personal  knowledge of the item(s) being purchased.", "COR monitoring: The program assigns a Field Canine Coordinator who  is responsible for overseeing the participant\u2019s compliance with the  agreement through periodic reporting and assessments. Reimbursement  is to be made upon receipt and review of summited expenses by the COR  and contracting officer.", "Purpose: The Checkpoint Janitorial and Utilities program uses OTAs to  define the terms and conditions for TSA\u2019s use of checkpoint space in  mandated non-leased space at airports and to provide a vehicle for  reimbursing the cost of electrical consumption and janitorial services.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable  since the airport is a governmental entity, not a commercial vendor.  Additionally, airports often contract directly with a utility provider or  janitorial company.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: Airports request reimbursement for  utility costs and janitorial services in mandated non-leased space at TSA  security checkpoints. TSA Federal Security Directors who are responsible  for security operations at federalized airports confirm the need for  reimbursing the cost of utilities and janitorial services at the checkpoint  space. These OTAs are not available for competition as the only available  source is the airport authority.", "OTA type: Cost reimbursement.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: TSA reimburses airports  at cost for the costs of electrical consumption by TSA screening  equipment located in the checkpoint space based on a cost allocation  methodology. TSA reimburses airports for its pro-rata share of the  airports janitorial costs per square foot also based on a cost allocation  methodology. In the files we reviewed, prices were considered to be fair  and reasonable based on documentation verifying the rates set by the  local power authority. Costs were considered to be fair and reasonable  based on the airports\u2019 competitively-awarded janitorial contracts and rates  established by the local utility authority.", "COR monitoring: Provides technical direction, contractor oversight, and  certification of payments.", "Purpose: The office has an ongoing requirement for intelligence  gathering, public transit information sharing and analysis, and  development of mass transit and passenger rail recommended security  practices.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: The American Public Transportation  Association is a not-for-profit trade association which therefore may not  currently have the experience, knowledge, or past performance to support  a FAR type contract.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: Through market research, TSA  determined that the American Public Transportation Association was  uniquely capable of meeting requirements.", "OTA type: Fixed price.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: In 2014, price was  determined to be fair and reasonable based primarily on historical data  and prices consistent with the preceding interagency agreement and the  office\u2019s independent government cost estimate. In 2016, the program  updated the independent government cost estimate based on a quote  from the American Public Transportation Association which provided for  greater clarity, insight, and definition to the actual costs. Additional market  research is planned to determine the best way to fulfill this requirement in  the future.", "COR monitoring: The COR developed a contract management plan  which identifies a detailed list of work products and delivery schedule.  The expected deliverables are also detailed in the OTA statement of  work.

Rather, the requirement entails the direct employment of intelligence  gathering focused on preventing terrorist acts affecting the nation\u2019s  passenger and freight-rail infrastructure.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: Since 2003, the Association of  American Railroads has provided the TSA with a railroad police officer  charged with collecting and analyzing intelligence information. Market  research reveals the Association of American Railroads to be one of two  major railway representation groups in the U.S. counting among its  membership the seven largest freight and passenger rail carriers in North  America. A follow-on agreement with the Association of American  Railroads maintains an uninterrupted flow of the critical intelligence  necessary in monitoring the safety and security of the nation\u2019s railway  infrastructure.", "OTA type: Fixed price.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: The program developed  an independent government cost estimate based on prices paid under a  previous agreement which allows for an inflationary cost adjustment of 3  percent per year and determined the annual funding cost to be fair and  reasonable in meeting this requirement.", "COR monitoring: The COR is responsible for the technical  administration and liaison of the agreement and is to review and certify  invoices for completeness and accuracy before approving them for  payment. As authorized by the FBI, the assigned railroad police officer is  to provide a monthly written report that summarizes the activities and  accomplishments related to the tasks outlined in the agreement.", "Purpose: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is located within  the Flight Restricted Zone and Special Flight Rules Area. As such, the  Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement developed a security  program for approved general aviation aircraft operators which requires  stringent security measures including requirements for background  checks, physical screening of passengers and baggage. Aircraft  operators are responsible for reimbursing TSA for the cost of the security  screening. TSA requires the use of the airport facility to perform the  screening function and a mechanism for the collection of security  screening and threat assessment fees from aircraft operators and  remittance of those fees to TSA.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable for  this requirement because TSA is not acquiring, purchasing, or leasing any  product or service. The OTA primarily establishes the responsibilities of  the parties and the fee collection and remittal procedures.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: TSA determined that Signature  Flight Support, as the sole commercial fixed base operator granted the  right to operate at Reagan National Airport to provide aeronautical  services such as fueling, hangaring, parking, aircraft rental, aircraft  maintenance, flight instruction, and similar services\u2014is therefore the only  entity capable of providing the facilities and services required to  implement this program.", "OTA type: No funding.", "Method of determining price reasonableness: Not applicable.", "COR monitoring: The COR is responsible for providing technical  direction and administration.", "Purpose: The Office of Global Strategies is directed to encourage the  development of civil aviation security, and is authorized to furnish to  international organizations certain technical expertise and assistance.  The office awarded an OTA to the International Civil Aviation  Organization\u2014a specialized agency of the United Nations committed to  preventing and deterring unlawful interference with international civil  aviation\u2014to cover the salaries and benefits for three TSA employees  assigned to the organization as senior security advisors. TSA actively  participates in the organization\u2019s Aviation Security Panel of Experts,  which is responsible for promulgating international security standards.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: An OTA is best suited for this requirement  since the International Civil Aviation Organization is a United Nations  specialized agency and TSA is not acquiring any property or services for  the direct benefit or use of the United States government.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: There are no known alternative  sources.", "OTA type: Fixed price.", "Method of determining a fair and reasonable price: Both the Program  Office and the Contracting Officer solely relied upon historical salaries as  previously used with the International Civil Aviation Organization.", "COR monitoring: The COR reviews and the contracting officer approves  all invoices prior to payment.", "Purpose: TSA has a requirement to obtain parking spaces/permits for  Federal Air Marshals during their mission flights for various airports.", "TSA rationale for using OTA: A procurement contract is not suitable for  this requirement as airport parking is not considered a commercial  item/service to the public; it is only available to business partners. An  OTA allows TSA to participate in an airport\u2019s business partner category.  Further OTAs provide a practical vehicle because the airport authority is  considered a U.S. state government entity.", "Method of selecting OTA recipient: TSA conducted market research  which found that an OTA with the airport provides a significant cost  savings to the government compared with other alternatives. TSA  compared the costs of parking as a business partner with the cost of  parking at the typical rates at the airport.", "OTA type: Fixed price.", "Method of determining a fair and reasonable price: TSA prepared an  independent government cost estimate based upon commercial market  pricing for airport parking.", "COR monitoring: TSA will pay the airport the variable fixed rate on a  monthly basis. All costs will be invoiced based on actual costs incurred,  but not to exceed the OTA amount. To receive payment from TSA, the  airport submits one-page invoice to include the quantity used, unit price,  and extended prices of the monthly deliverable.
