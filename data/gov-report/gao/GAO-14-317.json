Specifically, NIST spent about $495 million on awards to centers and spent the rest on contracts, staff, agency-wide overhead charges, and other items, some of which NIST considered direct support and some of which NIST considered administrative spending. Although NIST is not required to track, and has not historically tracked, administrative spending, NIST officials told GAO the agency developed definitions of direct support and administrative spending in fiscal year 2013 in response to congressional interest, then conducted an analysis of fiscal year 2013 federal MEP program spending using those definitions. NIST defines direct support spending as spending that directly supports the MEP center system's work with manufacturing firms, such as awards to centers or contracts to train MEP center staff on how to quickly assess innovative ideas for new products. NIST considers all other spending to be administrative, including spending on performance evaluations for MEP centers or on agency-wide overhead fees that pay for facilities operations and maintenance at the NIST campus. Using these definitions, NIST estimated that about 88.5 percent of federal MEP program spending in fiscal year 2013 was for direct support, and the remaining 11.5 percent was for administration.", "NIST's spending on cooperative agreement awards is based on the historical amount awarded to each center when it was established. This took into account each center's identification of target manufacturing firms in its service area\u2014including characteristics such as business size, industry types, product mix, and technology requirements\u2014and its costs of providing services to those firms. However, because NIST made the awards on an incremental basis to individual centers serving different areas over a period of more than 15 years, NIST's awards did not take into account variations across service areas in the demand for program services\u2014a function of the number and characteristics of target firms\u2014or variations across service areas in costs of providing services. NIST's cooperative agreement award spending is, therefore, inconsistent with the beneficiary equity standard. This standard\u2014commonly used to design and evaluate funding formulas\u2014calls for funds to be distributed in a way that takes these variations into account so that centers can provide the same level of services to each target manufacturing firm, according to its needs. Because NIST did not account for these variations across service areas, NIST's cooperative agreement award spending may not allow centers to provide the same level of services to target manufacturing firms, according to their needs. NIST officials told GAO that an analysis they recently conducted showed wide variation across centers in the relationship between their cooperative agreement award amounts and the number of target manufacturing firms in their service areas. NIST officials told GAO they are exploring ways to revise NIST's cooperative agreement award spending to take into account variations across service areas in the number of target manufacturing firms, among other factors.

By 1990, NBS had become NIST, and the  agency published the second federal funding opportunity announcement  for the establishment of two additional centers, bringing the total number  of centers to 5. In 1992, NIST announced a federal funding opportunity for  2 more centers, bringing the total to 7. The number of centers grew  rapidly thereafter, with a nationwide network of 44 centers in place by  1995. NIST has since added to its network and, as of 2013, has 60  centers that cover all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

In recognition of this situation,  NIST reoriented the program to focus on basic technologies that  permitted firms to improve their competitive position.

As a result, NIST\u2019s cooperative agreement  award spending falls short of another component of beneficiary equity.  Under the beneficiary equity standard, funds should be distributed in a  way that accounts for variations in the cost of providing services in each  area, so that target manufacturing firms across MEP center service areas  may receive the same level of assistance, according to their needs. The  costs of operating the centers to provide assistance to manufacturing  firms affect the amount of funding that centers have available for direct  assistance to firms. According to NIST\u2019s funding opportunity  announcements, costs\u2014as presented by the centers\u2019 budgets\u2014were  considered in making the original awards, but these costs were presented  on an incremental basis over a period of more than 15 years and,  therefore, NIST\u2019s consideration of these costs did not account for  variations across service areas. By not accounting for these variations,  NIST\u2019s cooperative agreement award spending may further call into  question centers\u2019 ability to provide the same level of services to each  target manufacturing firm, according to its needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIST Is Undertaking Efforts to Revise Its Cooperative Agreement Award Spending", "paragraphs": ["NIST officials told us they are exploring ways to revise cooperative  agreement award spending to take into account variations across service  areas in the number of target manufacturing firms, among other factors.  The officials discussed various options they are considering, but they did  not identify an option they had agreed to implement or a timeline for  decision making and implementation. They stated that one option they  are considering is to provide increased awards to those centers that are  currently underfunded relative to the mean relationship between centers\u2019  cooperative agreement award amounts and the number of manufacturing  firms in their service areas. They told us that doing so would result in a  greater benefit in terms of manufacturing firms served than providing  additional funds to centers that are overfunded relative to the mean. NIST  estimates that if it were to increase cooperative agreement award  amounts for the underfunded centers, the program would see up to a 20  percent increase in the number of manufacturing firms served in these  service areas over a 3-year period.", "NIST officials told us that they face at least two impediments in revising  cooperative agreement award spending. First, they stated that revising  cooperative agreement award spending within the current level of funding  would likely mean taking funds from some centers to give to others, and  NIST is concerned about the effect this disruption might have on the  impact of the program. The officials told us that they would like to  increase NIST\u2019s total cooperative agreement award spending and that  they are exploring options to do so. They said they are examining their  spending on direct support contracts to determine whether cost savings  can be realized and redirected to cooperative agreement awards. They  also said that they are considering making any changes over a multiyear  period. Our prior work has shown that phasing in changes to funding  levels gradually over a number of years minimizes disruptions to funding  recipients by providing them time to adjust.", "The second impediment that the officials identified is the requirement in  the MEP program\u2019s authorizing legislation that federal cooperative  agreement funds provided to MEP centers after their sixth year of  operation not exceed one-third of their capital and annual operating and  maintenance costs. This requirement leaves the centers responsible for  raising the remaining two-thirds of matching funds from other sources.  NIST officials told us that many centers already face difficulties raising the  required two-thirds of matching funds and may not be able to raise the  additional funds needed to access an increased cooperative agreement  award."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Manufacturing plays a key role in the U.S. economy, and NIST has  established a nationwide system of MEP centers dedicated to supporting  and strengthening the U.S. manufacturing base.

NIST officials told  us they are exploring ways to revise cooperative agreement award  spending to take into account variations across service areas in the  number of target manufacturing firms, among other factors. Revising  NIST\u2019s cooperative agreement award spending poses challenges  because it could result in award decreases for some centers, along with  increases for others.
