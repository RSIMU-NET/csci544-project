In  July 2004, HHS released The Decade of Health Information  Technology: Delivering Consumer-centric and Information-rich  Health Care\u2014Framework for Strategic Action. This framework  described goals for achieving nationwide interoperability of health  IT and actions to be taken by both the public and private sectors in  implementing a strategy. HHS\u2019s Office of the National Coordinator  for Health IT updated the framework\u2019s goals in June 2006 and  included an objective for protecting consumer privacy. It identified  two specific strategies for meeting this objective\u2014(1) support the  development and implementation of appropriate privacy and  security policies, practices, and standards for electronic health  information exchange and (2) develop and support policies to  protect against discrimination based on personal health information  such as denial of medical insurance or employment.", "In July 2004, we testified on the benefits that effective  implementation of IT can bring to the health care industry and the  need for HHS to provide continued leadership, clear direction, and  mechanisms to monitor progress in order to bring about measurable  improvements. Since then, we have reported or testified on several  occasions on HHS\u2019s efforts to define its national strategy for health  IT. We have recommended that HHS develop the detailed plans and  milestones needed to ensure that its goals are met and HHS agreed  with our recommendation and has taken some steps to define more  detailed plans. In our report and testimonies, we have described a  number of actions that HHS, through the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health IT, has taken toward accelerating the use of  IT to transform the health care industry, including the development  of its framework for strategic action.

Organizations also described issues with  obtaining individuals\u2019 authorization and consent for uses and  disclosures of personal health information and difficulties with  determining the best way to allow individuals to participate in and  consent to electronic health information exchange.

Additionally, as health information is amended, HIPAA rules require  that covered entities make reasonable efforts to notify certain  providers and other persons that previously received the individuals\u2019  information.
