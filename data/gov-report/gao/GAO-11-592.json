The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) is designed to identify and address fraud, waste, and abuse, which are all causes of improper payments. MIP's authorizing legislation provided funding for its activities and subsequent legislation provided additional funding. GAO was asked to report on how effectively CMS is using MIP funding to address Medicare program integrity. GAO examined (1) how CMS used MIP funding to support the program's activities from fiscal years 2006 through 2010, (2) how CMS assesses the effectiveness of MIP, and (3) factors CMS considers when allocating MIP funding. GAO analyzed CMS budget and other documents, interviewed CMS officials, and examined the agency's method of calculating return on investment (ROI), a performance measure used by CMS to measure the effectiveness of MIP activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS used the increase in total MIP funding received, from $832 million in fiscal year 2006 to $1 billion in fiscal year 2010, to expand MIP's activities. The additional funding supported oversight of Medicare Part C (Medicare benefits managed through private plans) and Part D (the outpatient prescription drug benefit) and agency efforts to examine the claims of Medicare beneficiaries who also participate in Medicaid--a joint federal-state health care program for certain low-income individuals. CMS officials also reported that CMS was able to move some funding from activities, such as provider audit, to other activities because of savings achieved from consolidating contractors. The largest percentage increase from this redistribution went to benefit integrity activities, which aim to deter and detect Medicare fraud through proactive data analysis and coordination with law enforcement. Although CMS has reported that the agency measures MIP's performance with goals related to reductions in the improper payment rates for Medicare fee-forservice, Part C, and Part D, CMS officials with direct responsibility for MIP generally do not connect measurements of effectiveness of MIP activities with the CMS goals of reducing improper payments. These goals to reduce improper payments, which were reported as goals previously and for fiscal year 2012, are particularly important in light of the President's Accountable Government Initiative, which aims to reduce overall improper payments by $50 billion by the end of 2012. In interviews with GAO, CMS officials with direct responsibility for implementing MIP activities generally did not connect the measurement of effectiveness of MIP activities with these CMS goals to reduce improper payments and instead cited other measures of effectiveness. This suggests that CMS has not clearly communicated to its staff the relationship between the daily work of conducting MIP activities and the agency's improper payment reduction performance goals. Because MIP will be central to CMS's efforts to reduce Medicare improper payments, MIP staff need to understand how their work supports these goals. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires CMS to report annually on the use of funds for MIP and the effectiveness of the use of those funds. One way that CMS already measures MIP effectiveness is ROI, which CMS calculates as savings from an activity in relation to expenditures. CMS calculates ROI for most of its MIP activities, but the data it uses have two flaws. First, ROI calculations are not updated when program expenditure data, a key component in the ROI calculation, are updated, which may lead to an incorrect ROI. Second, CMS does not have reliable information to determine the amount of MIP spending by activity for one type of contractor that received about 22 percent of total MIP funding in fiscal year 2010. It will be important for CMS to correct these flaws to ensure reliability in ROI reporting. CMS considers a variety of factors when allocating MIP funding. Based on a review of the documents submitted to justify funding of specific MIP activities, CMS may consider the prior year's funding level, the consequence of not funding, and the performance goal that the activity is intended to meet."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS communicate the linkage between MIP activities and the goals for reducing improper payments and that CMS expeditiously improve the reliability of data used to calculate ROI.

An  improper payment is any that should not have been made or that was  made in an incorrect amount under statutory, contractual, administrative,  or other legally applicable requirements. Medicare makes about   $500 billion in payments per year and continues to have a significant  amount of improper payments. For example, in fiscal year 2010, the  estimated improper payments for Medicare fee-for-service (Parts A   and B) were about $34.3 billion and for Medicare Advantage (Part C)  were about $13.6 billion. We have designated Medicare as a high-risk  program since 1990, in part because the program\u2019s complexity and size  made it vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Since that time, Medicare  has grown, and in 2006 a new benefit\u2014the Medicare prescription drug  benefit (Part D)\u2014was added, making the task of addressing improper  payments in a program of Medicare\u2019s size even greater.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is leading a  governmentwide effort to reduce improper payments. MIP is important to  this effort because of the size of the Medicare program. In fiscal year  2010, Medicare improper payments represented about 38 percent of all  federal government improper payments. MIP was established, and  provided with a dedicated source of mandatory funding from the Federal  Hospital Insurance trust fund, in the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to enhance efforts to address  Medicare\u2019s vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, and abuse.", "MIP is designed to better ensure the integrity of the Medicare program by  identifying and addressing improper payments and helping to prevent and  stop fraud and abuse through several types of activities, such as  educating providers on proper billing practices, auditing reported costs  used to set payments for hospitals and other institutional providers, and  coordinating with law enforcement to target potential fraud. These  activities are generally conducted by contractors working for CMS.", "In 2006, we reported that while funding for MIP had increased over time,  the approach CMS used to allocate funding among MIP activities had  weaknesses. Specifically, we found that allocations for MIP activities  were generally based on historical allocation levels, not on risk for  improper payments. We also noted that programmatic changes in  Medicare, particularly the prescription drug benefit and Medicare  contracting reform, would affect MIP funding allocations, and that the  allocation approach was not adequate to address the associated  emerging risks for improper payments. Finally, we found that CMS  tracked dollars saved in relation to dollars spent\u2014a useful quantitative  measure that the agency calls return on investment (ROI)\u2014to assess the  effectiveness of some MIP activities, but did not attempt to objectively  measure the effectiveness of all of its MIP activities. In our 2006 report,  we recommended that CMS develop a method of allocating MIP funding  based not only on the effectiveness of the program\u2019s activities but also on  contractor workloads and risk for improper payments.", "Since our 2006 report, there have been changes in the funding and scope  of MIP. Congress has appropriated discretionary MIP funding to  supplement existing mandatory funding, in part to address increased  responsibilities because of the addition of the Medicare prescription drug  benefit.

DRA  provided CMS with a onetime amount of $100 million in fiscal year 2006,  part of which CMS used to perform new Part C and D Oversight. In fiscal  years 2007 and 2008, CMS requested but did not receive discretionary  funding to perform Part C and D Oversight. As a result, CMS officials told  us that mandatory HIPAA funding for MIP was moved from other MIP  activities in fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to the Part C and D Oversight  activity. In fiscal years 2009 and 2010, CMS received $147 million and  $220 million, respectively, in discretionary funding and used more than  half of that funding for Part C and D Oversight.

Further, in response to one of our previous recommendations, CMS  also consolidated its postpayment recovery efforts into one MSP recovery  contractor in October 2006, thereby increasing the efficiency of the MSP  activity.", "CMS officials stated that the operational efficiencies and cost savings  resulting from the contractor consolidations enabled the agency to  decrease mandatory MIP funding to four of the five existing MIP activities  and redistribute those funds to the Part C and D Oversight and Benefit  Integrity activities. Specifically, from fiscal years 2006 through 2009, CMS  redistributed MIP funding from the Provider Outreach and Education,  Medical Review, MSP, and Provider Audit activities because these  activities were less costly with fewer contractors performing the work. For  example, CMS officials told us that the Provider Outreach and Education  activity had less overhead and other administrative costs with fewer  contractors, which resulted in reduced program expenditures. Provider  Outreach and Education spending decreased from almost $65 million in  fiscal year 2006 to about $42 million in fiscal year 2010\u2014about   35 percent. Provider Outreach and Education had the largest percentage  decrease in MIP funding. CMS officials stated that another factor in the  decrease in Provider Outreach and Education spending was a  realignment of some of its activities in fiscal year 2007. CMS officials also  told us that under the consolidation into MAC jurisdictions, CMS required  only one medical director for each MAC jurisdiction, instead of having one  medical director for each state, which lowered the cost to perform the  Medical Review activity. CMS officials stated that reduced costs allowed  CMS to use some of the newly available MIP mandatory funding to  address other priorities, such as funding Part C and D Oversight in fiscal  years 2007 and 2008, when the agency received no discretionary  funding. In addition, the MSP consolidation allowed CMS to reduce MIP  funding for the MSP activity beginning in fiscal year 2007, and the agency  used the savings to fund other MIP activities.

For instance, Provider Outreach and Education on proper  billing practices is a MIP activity, but it would be difficult to quantify how  much more improper billing would occur without this education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Calculates ROI for Most MIP Activities, but the Data CMS Uses in Its Calculation Have Flaws", "paragraphs": ["PPACA requires CMS to report annually on the use of funds for MIP and  the effectiveness of the use of those funds. One way that CMS measures  program effectiveness is through calculation of ROI. CMS already  calculates ROI for each MIP activity, with the exception of Provider  Outreach and Education. An overall ROI for MIP is reported to Congress  annually in the agency\u2019s budget justification. ROI is calculated as program  savings from the activity divided by program expenditures from the  activity. The Director of the Medicare Program Integrity Group told us that  the current methodology used by MIP for calculating ROI is likely the  method the agency will use to meet the PPACA reporting requirements.", "The data CMS currently uses to calculate the ROI have two flaws. First,  CMS calculates the ROI for each activity in January of each year for the  prior fiscal year, but contractors can change expenditure data via the  submission of additional invoices or corrections through the time they are  audited, which can occur up to 2 years after the end of the fiscal year.  The ROI figures calculated based on this information are not  subsequently updated. When we compared the expenditure data used to  calculate activity-level ROIs and final expenditure data provided by OFM,  we found differences up to $9.7 million. Given that these dollar amounts  are used as the denominator for the ROI, the ROI amounts would likely  change if they were updated with final expenditure data. In the case of the  $9.7 million difference, for example, the difference represented a   6.4 percent increase in the program expenditures. Second, ROIs for  activities conducted by MACs are potentially inaccurate because MACs  have discretion to direct MIP funding among the activities they perform,  and CMS does not have reliable information to determine the exact  amount spent by each MAC on individual MIP activities. CMS officials  told us that they were aware of the issue and were making changes to the  data collection system so that CMS could calculate actual spending data.", "As of May 2011, these officials were unable to estimate when the change  to the data collection system would be implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Considers a Variety of Factors, Including Potential Effect on Improper Payments, When Allocating Funding", "paragraphs": ["Decisions about recommendations for how MIP funding should be  allocated among the various activities and subactivities are based on a  variety of factors. Based on the budget request documents we reviewed,  the CMS MIP Budget Small Group may consider any or all of the  following factors:  \uf0b7  prior year\u2019s approved funding levels and requested levels for the  current and following fiscal year;  \uf0b7 rationale for the increase or decrease in requested funding;  \uf0b7  description and justification of the subactivity; \uf0b7  agency performance goals, including the strategic objective and  GPRA goal, that the subactivity is intended to meet; and  consequence of not funding the subactivity.", "We reviewed 36 budget request documents for subactivities funded in  fiscal year 2010 and found that 11 cited the reduction of the fee-for- service improper payment rate as the GPRA goal the subactivity was  intended to meet.", "It is difficult to determine the factors CMS considers when allocating MIP  funds beyond those listed in the budget request documents. There is no  record of why submitted subactivities were funded or not funded. Also,  CMS has no policies or procedures in place that outline how decisions  about funding allocations should be made for MIP. CMS officials told us  that a subactivity\u2019s effectiveness may be discussed orally at the meetings,  though there is no documentation substantiating this. A budget official in  CMS told us that when allocating MIP funds, the MIP Budget Small Group  tries to focus on where the problems are in each area and then  determines how to efficiently spend the money. For instance, he said that  in the past the process for allocating MIP funding within the Part C and D  Oversight activity had been difficult because the subactivities were new,  and consequently, there were no baseline ROI data available. This same  official said that he thought the allocation process for Part C and D  Oversight would become more data driven as program savings data  become available, which will allow the agency to calculate ROIs for the  Part C and D Oversight subactivities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The administration has made reducing the governmentwide improper  payment rate a priority. CMS must play a strong role in this effort  because, even without Part D, Medicare\u2019s improper payments constitute  more than a third of total federal government improper payments. As the  CMS program with the goal to reduce Medicare\u2019s improper payments,  MIP will be central to the agency\u2019s effort to reduce the Medicare improper  payment rates. CMS will need a strong, concerted effort on the part of  staff and contractors working on MIP activities to achieve the improper  payment reduction goals the agency has set for itself, and MIP staff will  need to understand how their work supports these goals and any  additional goals developed in response to PPACA requirements. Further,  a clear focus on reducing improper payments should be central to MIP  budget allocations. Because at least some information is presented orally  at the MIP Budget Small Group meetings, we cannot determine the extent  to which the risk of improper payments and effectiveness of MIP activities  in addressing that risk are discussed during the process. We continue to  believe that consideration of how MIP activities will reduce the risk of  improper payments and their effectiveness in doing so should be an  important part of the funding process and encourage CMS to make that a  priority.", "As we noted in our 2006 report, ROI is a useful method for assessing the  effectiveness of MIP activities. However, such reporting is valuable only if  the ROI figures reported are reliable. Currently, the data used to calculate  the ROI are flawed because the ROI calculations are not updated beyond  the end of a fiscal year to account for changes in MIP expenditure data,  and CMS does not currently have a way to account for the exact amount  of MIP funds MACs spend on individual MIP activities. CMS officials  acknowledged the shortcomings of the MAC expenditure data and noted  that they were implementing changes to the applicable data collection  system to more accurately capture MAC expenditures.
