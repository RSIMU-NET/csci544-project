The increased complexity is due, in part, to combining the NMTC with other federal, state, and local government funds. Based on GAO's survey of Community Development Entities (CDEs) an estimated 62 percent of NMTC projects received other federal, state, or local government assistance from 2010 to 2012. While combining public financing from multiple sources can fund projects that otherwise would not be viable, it also raises questions about whether the subsidies are unnecessarily duplicative because they are receiving funds from multiple federal sources. In addition, in some cases the complexity of the structures may be masking rates of return for NMTC investors that are above market rates. For example, a study done for the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) found an investor apparently earning a 24 percent rate of return, which is significantly above market rates of return. In that case, the investor leveraged the NMTCs by using other public funds to increase the base for claiming the NMTC. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued guidance about allowable financial structures in the early years of the NMTC program, but the guidance has not been updated to reflect the subsequent growth in complexity, such as the use of other public money to leverage the NMTC. Treasury also does not have controls to limit the risk of unnecessary duplication in government subsidies or above market rates of returns. Without such guidance and controls the impact of the NMTC program on low-income communities could be diluted.", "The costs of complex NMTC financial structures may not be fully reflected in fees charged by CDEs, and they could be reflected in other costs such as higher interest rates. Treasury has taken steps to ensure businesses are better informed about fees and other costs, but is not collecting these additional data itself. Without these data, Treasury is limited in its ability to analyze NMTC program benefits.", "GAO also found that the data on equity remaining in businesses after the 7-year credit period were unreliable because, in part, instructions on what to report are unclear. As a result, at this time it is not possible to determine how much equity remains in low-income community businesses after 7 years.", "Similarly, data on NMTC project failure rates were unavailable. GAO reviewed data of performance on loans from CDEs to low-income community businesses as an indicator of whether the businesses will be viable over the long term. However, data on loan performance were also incomplete because some reporting of this information by CDEs is optional. As a result, it is not possible to determine, at this time, the NMTC project failure rate with certainty."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Treasury should issue further guidance on how other government programs can be combined with NMTCs; ensure adequate controls to limit the risks of unnecessary duplication and above-market rates of return; and ensure that more complete and accurate data are collected on fees and costs, the equity remaining in the business after 7 years, and loan performance.", "Treasury agreed with GAO's recommendations to improve data collection on equity remaining and loan performance.

In addition, 21 percent of  projects had four or more transactions involving financial flows (such as  loans from the CDEs to the LIC business). The NMTC financial structures  have become more complex over time. We estimated that 41 percent of  NMTC investments were made using one of the leveraged models in  2006, while more recent industry estimates state that more than 90  percent used such leverage in 2013.", "The simplified structures in our examples also do not show some of the  complexities that are required for the purpose of acquiring the tax benefit.  For example, when the public funds are leveraged, as in figure 4, a pass- through entity that is disregarded for tax purposes is established to route  the flow of funds back from the low-income community business to the  investment fund to claim the NMTC. The complexity of the structures may  reduce transparency by making it more difficult to trace the flow of private  and public funds and the benefits from the tax subsidies. For example,  investors can leverage other tax credits with the NMTCs to gain access to  other tax benefits such as when the tax credit for solar equipment is  leveraged to claim additional NMTCs and also claim accelerated  depreciation deductions based on the solar equipment.", "However, as mentioned above, this complexity can have benefits  because it may result in projects getting financing they could not get  otherwise.

The NMTC  investor\u2019s level of risk depends on the financial structure that the investor  uses. For example, when the NMTC investor uses a leveraged  investment model, the investor does not generally share in the riskiness  of the project.

They noted that the NMTC financing was combined with a  conventional loan outside the NMTC structure, owner equity, and a loan  from the local municipality.

With this information, an additional control could  be implemented that would require CDEs to justify rates of return above a  certain threshold by explaining why this project was so risky that it  required a greater-than-market rate of return. Other controls that could be  considered include caps on rate of returns and mechanisms to ensure  competition among NMTC investors sufficient to prevent above-market  rates of return.

To assess the complexity and  transparency of NMTC investment structures, we applied criteria from our  prior work on evaluating tax expenditures. We also applied criteria from  federal government internal control standards to assess whether controls  are present to ensure that subsidies are not larger than necessary for a  NMTC project.", "To report on the number, types, and funding amounts of other federal  programs used on NMTC projects, we designed and implemented a web- based survey to gather information on how projects were financed from  the CDEs responsible for the project. Our survey population consisted of  randomly selected NMTC projects with all loans and investments closing  on or after January 1, 2010. Restricting the survey population to NMTC  projects within our study\u2019s time period left us with a total of 1,265 projects  in the population. We selected a stratified sample of 305 projects. From  the first strata, defined as those projects for which there is an indication  on the underlying population file that at least one of the funding sources  was public dollars, we selected 126 projects. From the second strata,  defined as all other projects, we selected 179 projects. Although some  projects in the second strata could actually have public dollars, this  stratification helps ensure that our sample has enough of these cases to  produce estimates of that domain.", "The survey asked the CDEs a combination of questions that allowed for  open-ended and close-ended responses with regard to federal, state,  local, and private funding sources. We pre-tested the content and format  of the questionnaire with four knowledgeable CDEs and made changes  based on pre-test results. The survey was a web-based survey. We sent  an activation e-mail for the survey on March 7, 2014, and closed the  survey on April 4, 2014.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For example, differences in  how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of information  available to respondents, how the responses were processed and  analyzed, or the types of people who do not respond can influence the  accuracy of the survey results. We took steps in the development of the  survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these non- sampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that were  obtained. A second independent analyst checked all the computer  programs that processed the data. In instances where multiple CDEs  responded about the same project, we manually merged the data  together into a representative single project following the Community  Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund\u2019s practices, such as  reporting the highest value as the default estimate.", "We obtained responses for 214 of the 305 projects in our sample for an  overall response rate of about 70 percent. Population estimates were  produced by weighting the sample data from the responding projects to  account for differing sampling rates for projects funded with public dollars  and those funded without public dollars. We have treated the respondents  as a stratified random sample and calculated sampling errors as an  estimate of the uncertainty around the survey estimates. All percentage  estimates based on this sample have 95 percent confidence intervals of  within +/- 7 percentage points of the estimate itself. For other numeric  estimates, the 95 percent confidence intervals are presented along with  the estimates themselves. We are 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals in this report will include the true values in the study  population.", "To address the last three objectives, we analyzed data from the CDFI  Fund on NMTC investments in low-income community businesses from  2003 through 2012. The CDFI Fund requires all CDEs that have been  awarded NMTC allocations to submit an annual report detailing how they  invested the qualified equity investment (QEI) proceeds in low-income  communities. These reports must be submitted to the CDFI Fund by the  CDEs, along with their audited financial statements, within 6 months after  the end of their fiscal years. CDEs are required to report their NMTC  investments in the CDFI Fund\u2019s Community Investment Impact System  (CIIS) for a period of 7 years. Due to a time lag in reporting, NMTC  investments reported in CIIS are less than the total amount allocated for  the NMTC program. Given that the CDFI Fund requires CDEs to report  information on project characteristics and financing once a year, CIIS  data may not capture the most current information for all existing projects.  However, the CIIS data that we used represent the most current available  information as of December 2, 2013 on the status of the program. We  interviewed CDFI Fund officials with knowledge of CIIS about the steps  they take to ensure its accuracy. Based on GAO\u2019s criteria for valid data\u2014 that they be sufficiently accurate and complete to capture program  performance\u2014we also determined the data on fees and retentions we  used in this report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes (see below  for discussion of the data we found unreliable for our purposes).", "Seventy-three projects were excluded because they had loans and investments  originating both before and after December 31, 2010, and 49 projects were excluded  because one or more CDEs appeared to have reported fees data incorrectly by reporting  fees as a percentage of the QEI rather than as basis points as instructed by the CDFI  Fund. to calculate the total dollar amounts of fees. We compared our final  results to other data on fees submitted by CDEs when applying for NMTC  allocations in 2010 and 2011.", "We attempted to compare these costs to costs on non-NMTC  investments by reviewing industry data and academic studies on fees,  and interviewing industry and tax credit experts. We also reviewed written  and oral comments made by CDEs and industry experts to the CDFI  Fund in response to a November 7, 2011, Federal Register notice  soliciting comments on several possible NMTC program changes. The  CDFI Fund specifically requested comments on whether additional rules,  restrictions, and requirements should be imposed related to fees and  expenses charged by CDEs. The CDFI Fund also held three listening  sessions in December 2012 and January and February 2013 with a total  of 45 CDE and industry experts. We reviewed the transcripts of these  listening sessions and concluded from these reviews that the types of  projects funded by the NMTC are so varied that we could not conduct a  valid comparison of fee costs with those on non-NMTC projects.", "We attempted to determine the amount of equity that remains in low- income community businesses by analyzing data reported by CDEs to the  CDFI Fund on equity projected to remain in NMTC projects at the end of  the 7-year credit period. We analyzed these data at the project level for  842 projects with loans and investments originating in 2011 and 2012.  Starting with the 2011 reporting period, the CDFI Fund began requiring  that, if applicable, CDEs report the projected amount of any equity or debt  investment which may be acquired by the low-income community  business as the result of a put/call option or other arrangement for loans  and investments originating after December 31, 2010. After reviewing all  2,249 transactions for all 842 projects, we determined that data were  usable for only 363 projects (about 40 percent), and therefore the data  could not be used to give sufficiently reliable descriptions of the equity  remaining in the project for our purposes. We found the following  problems with the data that made the values unreliable for our report.", "For 201 projects, no data were reported by one or more of the CDEs  involved in those projects. We concluded that in these cases we could  not determine: (1) how many of these projects were non-leveraged  where the failure to project a residual value might be expected; (2)  how many indicated a true intention not to leave any equity in the  project; and (3) how many were simply errors or omissions.", "For another 143 projects, one or more CDEs involved reported a total  projected residual value of $0. We concluded in these cases that the  implications of zero for equity remaining were ambiguous. According  CFDI Fund officials, some CDEs may in fact do not intend to leave  any residual equity for the business to obtain at the end of the 7-year  period. However, other CDEs may project $0 remaining now when in  fact they intend to designate the amount of equity at a later date.  These CDEs may be reporting a zero value at this time due to an  individual CDE\u2019s internal practices or accounting rules particular to the  CDE\u2019s form of incorporation. That is, the CDEs would not report a  projected or final residual value until the put/call option was exercised  by the business.", "Of the remaining 498 projects, 135 projects had data showing that the  total projected residual value for these projects appeared to be  overstated. Some data showed that one or more CDEs reported  projected residual values greater than or equal to the original equity  investment values. In most of these cases, the CDEs appeared to  have incorrectly reported a projected residual value for both leveraged  loans and equity investments. Based on the typical leveraged model  structure, the CDEs should have only reported the residual value of  the equity investments. In other cases, one or more CDEs involved in  a project reported the projected residual value of the equity  investment twice\u2014once as value for the equity investment, and then  repeated it as a value for the leveraged loan. As a result of these  reporting errors or inconsistencies, the total projected residual value  for these projects appeared to be overstated.", "To determine the NMTC projects at risk of failing by becoming  economically nonviable, we analyzed data reported by CDEs to the CDFI  Fund that could indicate that a project is experiencing financial distress.  We used indicators of financial distress that are available from CDFI Fund  data, such as whether a loan on a project is delinquent, charged off, or  restructured that could show increased risk of business failure. These  indicators, in most cases, could not be used to conclude that a business  has failed in the sense of being economically nonviable as the CDFI Fund  does not currently have data on the ultimate disposition of NMTC  projects. We analyzed the number of projects that showed indications of  financial distress between 2003 and 2012, and the dollar amounts  invested in these financially distressed projects. We tested the reliability  of these optional fields by reviewing CDEs applications for 2012 NMTC  allocations. In the application instructions, CDEs were asked to discuss  any delinquent, defaulted, or impaired loans or equity investments from  prior NMTC investments. In the 2012 applications, we counted 281  projects with delinquent, defaulted, or impaired loans or investments. Of  these, 193 projects were described in sufficient detail that we could then  match those projects to transaction-level data in CIIS. However, 49 of  those projects did not show any indications of financial distress in CIIS.  For some projects involving multiple CDEs, one or more CDEs may have  described the project in their 2012 applications as having delinquent,  defaulted, or impaired investments, but only one CDE then reported any  of the optional distress indicator data in CIIS. In other cases, CDEs  described several projects in the 2012 applications as having delinquent,  defaulted, or impaired investments, but then those CDEs did not report  any distress indicators for these projects in CIIS. In the end, we  concluded that the CDFI Fund CIIS data on indicators of financial distress  were insufficient for our purposes, largely due to the fact that nearly all of  the distress indicators were optional data fields.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to July 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
