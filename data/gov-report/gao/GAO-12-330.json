GAO analyzed standards issued by OSHA between 1981 and 2010, interviewed subject matter experts and agency officials at OSHA and two similar federal regulatory agencies and offices, and reviewed the standard-setting process at OSHA and the comparison agencies and offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between 1981 and 2010, the time it took the Department of Labor\u0092s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to develop and issue safety and health standards ranged widely, from 15 months to 19 years, and averaged more than 7 years. Experts and agency officials cited increased procedural requirements, shifting priorities, and a rigorous standard of judicial review as contributing to lengthy time frames for developing and issuing standards. For example, they said that a shift in OSHA\u0092s priorities toward one standard took attention away from several other standards that previously had been a priority.", "In addition to using the typical standard-setting process, OSHA can address urgent hazards by issuing emergency temporary standards, directing additional attention to enforcing relevant existing standards, and educating employers and workers about hazards. However, OSHA has not issued an emergency temporary standard since 1983 because it has found it difficult to compile the evidence necessary to meet the statutory requirements. Instead, OSHA focuses on enforcement and education when workers face urgent hazards. For example, OSHA can enforce the general requirement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) that employers provide a workplace free from recognized hazards, as it did in 2009 when it cited a major retail employer after one of its workers was crushed to death by uncontrolled holiday crowds. To educate employers and workers, OSHA coordinates and funds on-site consultations and publishes information on matters as diverse as safe lifting techniques for nursing home workers and exposure to diacetyl, a flavoring ingredient used in microwave popcorn linked to lung disease among factory workers.", "Experiences of other federal agencies that regulate public or worker health hazards offer limited insight into the challenges OSHA faces in setting standards. For example, officials with the Environmental Protection Agency noted that certain Clean Air Act requirements to set and regularly review standards for specified air pollutants have facilitated that agency\u0092s standard-setting efforts. In contrast, the OSH Act does not require OSHA to periodically review and update its standards. Officials with the Mine Safety and Health Administration noted that their standard-setting process benefits from both the in-house knowledge of its inspectors, who inspect every mine at least twice yearly, and a dedicated mine safety research group within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a federal research agency that makes recommendations on occupational safety and health. OSHA must rely on time-consuming site visits for hazards information and has not consistently coordinated with NIOSH to engage that agency\u0092s expertise on occupational hazards.", "Experts and agency officials identified several ideas that could improve OSHA\u0092s standard-setting process. While some of the changes, such as improving coordination with other agencies to leverage expertise, are within OSHA\u0092s authority, others call for significant procedural changes that would require amending existing laws. For example, some experts recommended a statutory change that would allow OSHA to revise a group of outdated health standards at the same time, using industry consensus standards as support rather than having to analyze each hazard individually."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To streamline OSHA standards development, GAO recommends that OSHA and NIOSH more consistently collaborate on researching occupational hazards, so that OSHA can more effectively leverage NIOSH expertise in determining the needs for new standards and developing them.

Under the Occupational Safety and  Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), as amended, the Department of Labor\u2019s  (Labor) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issues  and enforces occupational safety and health standards, which have been  credited with helping prevent thousands of work-related deaths, injuries,  and illnesses. For example, OSHA\u2019s \u201clockout/tagout\u201d safety standard  requires employers to install devices ensuring that heavy machinery  cannot be turned on while being cleaned or repaired. In a 2000 review,  OSHA attributed a 55 percent reduction in machinery-related fatalities at  10 steel-producing companies between 1990 and 1997 to the provisions  in this standard. However, some occupational safety and health experts  have raised questions concerning whether the agency\u2019s approach to  developing standards is overly cautious, slowing the process and  resulting in too few standards being issued. Others counter that the  process is intentionally deliberative to balance protections provided for  workers with the burden imposed on employers in complying with the  standards. Further, over the past 30 years, various presidential executive  orders and federal statutes, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, have  added new procedural requirements for regulatory agencies, resulting in  multiple and sometimes lengthy steps OSHA and other agencies must  follow. In addition, OSHA\u2019s authority covers nearly all U.S. industries,  which requires OSHA staff to be familiar with a broad range of processes,  equipment, and chemicals used at worksites.", "We were asked to review: (1) the time taken by OSHA to develop and  issue occupational safety and health standards and the key factors that  affect these time frames, (2) alternatives to the typical standard-setting  process that are available for OSHA to address urgent hazards, (3)  whether rulemaking at other regulatory agencies offers insight into  OSHA\u2019s challenges with setting standards, and (4) ideas that have been  suggested by occupational safety and health experts for improving the  process.", "To determine how long it takes OSHA to develop and issue occupational  safety and health standards, we analyzed new standards and substantive  updates to standards finalized between calendar years 1981 and 2010  and identified as significant by the agency. We chose this time frame  because it spans multiple executive administrations and changes in  congressional leadership. Also, several statutes, executive orders, and  key court decisions affecting OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process became  effective after 1980. To identify the key factors affecting OSHA\u2019s time  frames for issuing standards and ideas for improving OSHA\u2019s standard- setting process, we conducted semistructured interviews with current and  former Labor officials and occupational safety and health experts and  analyzed their responses. We selected these experts based on our  research and the recommendations of other experts. We also reviewed  relevant federal laws, regulations, and executive orders, and interviewed  officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to determine  the required steps in the standard-setting process and how those  requirements affect the time it takes OSHA to develop and issue  standards. To identify alternatives to the typical standard-setting process  available for OSHA to address urgent hazards, we reviewed relevant  federal laws and interviewed current OSHA staff and attorneys from  Labor\u2019s Office of the Solicitor. We also analyzed relevant agency  documentation that Labor officials provided. To determine whether  rulemaking at other regulatory agencies offers insight into OSHA\u2019s  challenges with setting standards, we explored the regulatory process at  selected federal regulatory agencies and offices. Through semistructured  interviews with policy and program officials at the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and at the Mine Safety and Health  Administration (MSHA), we learned about challenges each agency faces  when developing and issuing similar regulations and factors that affect  their time frames.

Rulemaking at most  regulatory agencies follows the APA\u2019s informal rulemaking process, also  known as \u201cnotice and comment\u201d rulemaking, which generally requires  agencies to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal  Register, provide interested persons an opportunity to comment on the  proposed regulation, and publish the final regulation, among other  things. Agencies may also take other actions to gather information during  the rulemaking process; for example, agencies may hold a public meeting  to allow stakeholders to discuss specific aspects of the proposed  regulation. Under the APA, a person adversely affected by an agency\u2019s  rulemaking is generally entitled to judicial review of that new rule. For  regulations developed and issued using the APA\u2019s notice and comment  rulemaking process, the court may invalidate a regulation if it finds it to be  \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in  accordance with law,\u201d sometimes referred to as the arbitrary and  capricious test.", "In addition to the APA requirements, federal agencies typically must  comply with requirements imposed by certain other statutes and  executive orders. Some of the relevant laws include the Paperwork  Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which were both enacted  in 1980; the Congressional Review Act, enacted in 1996;and the  Information Quality Act, enacted in 2000. (See app. II for an overview of  requirements that commonly apply to OSHA standard setting.)

If the committee comes to an  agreement on the content of a potential regulation, the agency may use it  as the proposed rule. However, any agreement by the negotiated  rulemaking committee is not binding on the agency or interest groups  represented on the committee. Negotiated rulemaking does not replace  any procedures required by the APA; rather, it can be used to help reach  agreement among the members of the committee on the content of a  proposed regulation, and according to proponents, it may help decrease  the likelihood of subsequent litigation over the regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Framework and Staffing for OSHA\u2019s Standard-Setting Process", "paragraphs": ["OSHA administers the OSH Act, which was enacted to help assure, so far  as possible, safe and healthful working conditions for the nation\u2019s  workers.

These procedures  include publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing  interested persons an opportunity to comment, and holding a public  hearing upon request.", "Section 6(a) of the OSH Act directed the Secretary of Labor (through  OSHA) to adopt any national consensus standards or established federal  standards as safety and health standards within 2 years of the date the  OSH Act went into effect. In general, national consensus standards are  safety and health standards that a nationally recognized standards- producing organization, such as the National Fire Protection Association,  adopts after reaching substantial agreement among those who will be  affected, including businesses, industries, and workers. Unlike OSHA\u2019s  standards, which are mandatory, employers may choose whether to  voluntarily follow national consensus standards. The OSH Act specified  that OSHA set standards under section 6(a) without following OSHA\u2019s  typical standard-setting procedures or the APA, including provisions for  public comment.

At any given point during this period, OSHA staff worked  to develop standards that eventually became final, represented in the  table below. On average, OSHA took a total of about 93 months (7 years,  9 months) to develop and issue these standards.

The majority of these  standards\u201447 of the 58\u2014were finalized between 1981 and 1999. In  addition to these final standards, OSHA staff have also worked to develop  standards that have not yet been finalized.

First, as  shown in table 1, it took OSHA about 70 percent longer, on average, to  finalize standards in the 1990s than it took during the 1980s, and about  30 percent longer than during the 2000s. While we were not able to  determine the reason for this through our analysis, it demonstrates that  there is no clear trend of OSHA developing and issuing standards more  or less quickly over time. Second, we found that it took OSHA longer to  develop and issue safety standards than health standards\u2014an average of  about 8 years, 6 months for safety standards compared with about 6  years, 4 months for health standards\u2014even though several experts to  whom we spoke stated that health standards are more difficult for OSHA  to issue than safety standards (see figs. 1 and 2 for a depiction of the  timelines for safety and health standards issued between 1981 and  2010). Part of this difference may be explained by the fact that a larger  portion of the health standards (6 of 23, compared with only 3 of 35 safety  standards) were standards for which Congress or the courts articulated  time frames for their issuance or development.", "Experts and agency officials frequently cited the increased number of  procedural requirements established since 1980, shifting priorities, and  the relatively high standard of judicial review required for OSHA  standards as factors that lengthen OSHA\u2019s time frames for developing  and issuing standards. In addition to these primary factors, several of the  experts and agency officials also noted two secondary factors affecting  the standard-setting process: significant data challenges and an  institutional apprehension about setting standards in the wake of adverse  court decisions. We have characterized these as secondary factors  because they are both related to the three primary factors.", "Experts and agency officials indicated that the increased number of  procedural requirements affects standard-setting time frames because of  the complex requirements for OSHA to demonstrate the need for  standards. Experts and agency officials named a variety of statutes and  executive orders that have imposed an increasing number of procedural  requirements on OSHA since 1980.", "The process for developing and issuing standards is complex and  directed by multiple procedural requirements.

When OSHA performs the economic feasibility analysis, it  concludes that a standard is economically feasible if the affected industry  or industries will maintain long-term profitability and competitiveness. To  do this, staff and contractors, by analyzing information they collect when  visiting worksites, must assess the extent to which employers in the  affected industries can afford to implement the required controls. In  addition to the site visits, OSHA staff sometimes conducts industry-wide  surveys to determine baseline practices and collect other relevant  information needed for the technological and economic feasibility  analyses. According to OSHA officials, the process of developing a  survey and having it approved by OMB takes a minimum of 1 year.", "In addition to the feasibility analyses, OSHA staff generally must also  conduct economic analyses. First, OSHA must assess the costs and  benefits of significant standards as required by Executive Order 12866.   Second, under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act  of 1996, if OSHA determines that a potential standard would have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,  such as businesses, it is one of three federal agencies that must initiate a  panel process that seeks and considers input from representatives of the  affected small businesses.several months of work that many other federal regulatory agencies do  not have to complete in order to issue regulations.

During the 30-year period covered by our review,  administrations have alternately favored and resisted the development of  new federal regulations or revisions of existing regulations. For example,  officials told us that Assistant Secretaries typically serve for about 3  years, and that new appointees tend to change the agency\u2019s priorities.  Some agency officials and experts told us that, regardless of the agency  leadership\u2019s motivation for changes in priority, these changes often cause  delays in the process of setting standards. Further, officials told us that,  ultimately, political appointees make decisions about what standards, if  any, to pursue based on their goals and the agency\u2019s resources.", "Other experts described instances in which changes in the agency\u2019s  standard-setting priorities affected the process. One example some cited  was OSHA\u2019s efforts to develop the ergonomics standard. OSHA worked  for several years in the 1990s to develop a proposed rule on ergonomics  to address workers\u2019 exposure to risk factors leading to musculoskeletal  disorders. After being in the preproposal stage through much of the  1990s, there was interest in the late 1990s for OSHA to publish a  proposed rule, and OSHA issued a final standard just 1 year after  publishing the proposed rule. Several experts and agency officials noted  that, in order to develop the rule so quickly, the vast majority of OSHA\u2019s  standard-setting resources were focused on this rulemaking effort, taking  attention away from several standards that previously had been a priority.  Agency officials told us, for example, that work on this standard used  nearly 50 full-time staff in OSHA\u2019s standards office, half the staff  economists, and 7 or 8 attorneys, compared with the more typical 5 total  staff assigned to develop a new standard.", "The standard of judicial review that applies to OSHA standards if they are  challenged in court also affects OSHA\u2019s time frames because it requires  more robust research and analysis, according to some experts and  agency officials. OSHA standards are subject to a different standard of  judicial review than most other federal regulatory agencies\u2019 regulations.  Instead of the arbitrary and capricious test provided for under the APA,  the OSH Act directs courts to review OSHA\u2019s standards using a more  stringent legal standard: it provides that a standard shall be upheld if  supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record considered as a  whole.\u201d stringent standard requires a higher level of scrutiny by the courts and,  therefore, requires OSHA staff to perform more extensive research and  analysis to support a new standard. For example, OSHA officials  explained that the substantial evidence standard requires that OSHA staff  conduct a large volume of detailed research in order to understand all  industrial processes that involve the hazard being regulated and to  ensure that a given hazard control would be feasible for each process.", "OSHA officials and experts discussed two additional factors that cause  OSHA officials to perform an extensive amount of work in developing  standards, which are related to the factors described above.", "29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(f). need for or feasibility of a standard contribute to substantial challenges to  attaining information required for setting standards. They cited court  decisions interpreting the OSH Act\u2019s requirements as one of the reasons  they must rigorously support the need for and feasibility of standards. For  example, in 1980, the Supreme Court held that before it can issue a  standard, OSHA must determine that the standard is necessary to  remedy a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of material health impairment among workers.  As a result of this decision, OSHA generally conducts quantitative risk  assessments for each health standard, which it must ensure are  supported by substantial evidence.decision essentially established a standard of medical and scientific  certainty and has resulted in OSHA staff having to spend an inordinate  amount of effort gathering data to support the need for a standard.", "OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process has been significantly influenced by  court decisions interpreting statutory requirements. A key example is the  1980 \u201cbenzene decision,\u201d in which the Supreme Court invalidated an  OSHA standard that set a new exposure limit for benzene because OSHA  failed to make a determination that benzene posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of  material health impairment under workplace conditions permitted by the  current standard. Another example is a 1992 decision in which the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit struck down an OSHA health  standard that would have set or updated the permissible exposure limit   In that case, the court found that  (PEL) for over 400 air contaminants.OSHA had not adequately demonstrated that current exposure to each  hazard posed significant risk, or that each standard reduced that risk to  the extent feasible. Labor officials told us that the court\u2019s decision  discouraged them from trying to expedite the standard-setting process by  combining many standards into one rulemaking effort. Several experts  with whom we spoke observed that such adverse court decisions have  contributed to an institutional culture of trying to make OSHA standards  impervious to future adverse decisions. These experts cited the threat of  litigation as a disincentive to issuing standards. In contrast, agency  officials commented that while OSHA tries to avoid lawsuits that might  ultimately invalidate a standard, in general OSHA does not try to make a  standard \u201cbulletproof.\u201d Agency officials noted the agency is frequently  sued."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSHA has Authority to Address Urgent Hazards through Emergency Temporary Standards, Enforcement, and Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Although It Has the Authority, OSHA Has Found it Difficult to Issue Emergency Temporary Standards", "paragraphs": ["OSHA has not issued any emergency temporary standards in nearly 30  years, citing, among other reasons, legal and logistical challenges.  Section 6(c) of the OSH Act authorizes OSHA to issue these standards  without following the typical standard-setting process if two legal  requirements are met. The Secretary of Labor must determine that: (1)  workers are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or  agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful, or from new hazards,  and (2) an emergency temporary standard is necessary to protect  workers from that danger.effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register and must   An emergency temporary standard becomes  be replaced within 6 months by a permanent standard issued using the  process specified in section 6(b). OSHA officials told us that meeting the  statutory requirements and issuing a permanent standard within the 6- month time frame has proven difficult. Furthermore, OSHA\u2019s emergency  temporary standards have received close scrutiny by federal courts,  whose decisions have characterized OSHA\u2019s emergency temporary  standard authority as an extraordinary power to be used only in limited  situations.", "OSHA officials noted that the emergency temporary standard authority  remains available, but the legal requirements to issue such a standard  are difficult to meet. OSHA issued nine emergency temporary standards  between 1971, when the agency was established, and 1983, and none  since that year. Five of those nine emergency temporary standards were  either stayed or invalidated, at least in part, by federal courts.", "For OSHA to satisfy the first of the OSH Act\u2019s two requirements for  issuing an emergency temporary standard, the agency must determine  that workers will be exposed to grave danger during the time an  emergency temporary standard is in effect. Establishing sufficient  evidence of grave danger to withstand a court challenge can be difficult,  even for substances whose hazards are well-known, such as asbestos. In  1983, OSHA issued an emergency temporary standard lowering the PEL  for asbestos, which was subsequently challenged in federal court by  representatives of the asbestos industry. The court held that OSHA failed  to show sufficient evidence that workers faced grave danger from  exposure under current limits for the 6 months the emergency temporary  standard would be in effect. OSHA had estimated, based on mathematical projections from long-term epidemiological studies, that  during the 6 months the emergency temporary standard would be in  effect, it could prevent at least 80 eventual asbestos-related deaths.  However, the court found these projections too uncertain to establish a  grave risk over a 6-month period and noted that the type of analysis  OSHA used merited the public scrutiny of the notice and comment  standard-setting process.", "OSHA has also found it challenging to meet the second OSH Act  requirement: establishing that an emergency temporary standard is  necessary to protect workers from the grave danger. In the asbestos  case, the court found that OSHA was on its way to issuing a permanent  standard within a year, already had the authority to conduct the education  activities the emergency temporary standard contained, and could  achieve many of the same benefits by increasing enforcement of the  existing standard. The court, therefore, invalidated the emergency  temporary asbestos standard because OSHA failed to meet both of the  OSH Act\u2019s requirements. OSHA officials cited diacetyl, a food flavoring  ingredient, as a recent example of a hazardous substance for which the  OSH Act\u2019s second requirement might have been difficult to meet if the  agency had chosen to pursue an emergency temporary standard. In  2006, the agency was urged to issue an emergency temporary standard  for diacetyl after investigations showed its association with severe,  irreversible lung disease among workers in microwave popcorn factories.  OSHA officials told us they could likely have established that diacetyl  exposure under then-current workplace conditions presented grave  danger to workers in the near term. These officials noted, however, that  because manufacturers responded quickly after diacetyl\u2019s danger became  clear, OSHA had less evidence that an emergency temporary standard  was necessary. For example, they noted that manufacturers responded  with a combination of measures including improved ventilation and  housekeeping, reducing the concentration of diacetyl used, and  substituting other ingredients.", "In addition to the legal requirements, OSHA has found that issuing an  emergency temporary standard presents a logistical challenge. OSHA\u2019s  emergency temporary standards are effective on the date of publication in  the Federal Register, but they must be replaced within 6 months by a  permanent standard.evidence required for the typical standard-setting process\u2014which, as  noted above, involves engaging with stakeholders and can take many  years\u2014in this abbreviated time frame. OSHA officials noted that the  Congress intended this emergency temporary standard-setting authority  to be used under very limited circumstances.", "This means OSHA must compile the same  OSHA has not issued an emergency temporary standard since 1983,  despite many requests that it do so. Labor unions and public health and  other advocacy organizations continue to petition OSHA to issue  emergency temporary standards to address a variety of workplace  hazards. According to OSHA records, it has received 23 petitions to issue  emergency temporary standards on hazardous chemicals, such as  formaldehyde, and also for safety hazards such as shock or injury from  unsecured equipment. One petition, submitted in September 2011, urges  OSHA to issue an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from  potentially fatal exposure to heat. Although OSHA has generally denied  these petitions, officials told us the agency considers whether to issue an  emergency temporary standard and takes the information into account  when setting its priorities for permanent standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSHA Addresses Urgent Hazards through Enforcement and Education", "paragraphs": ["OSHA uses enforcement and education as alternatives to issuing  emergency temporary standards to respond relatively quickly to urgent  workplace hazards. OSHA officials consider their enforcement and  education activities complementary: a high-profile citation or enforcement  initiative on an urgent hazard generates attention that can improve worker  safety industry-wide.", "OSHA may cite employers for failing to adequately protect workers from a  specific workplace hazard even if it has not set a standard on that hazard.  Under section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act, known as the general duty clause,  OSHA has the authority to issue citations to employers even in the  absence of a specific standard under certain circumstances. The general  duty clause requires employers to provide a workplace free from  recognized hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause, death or  serious physical harm to their employees. OSHA relied on the general  duty clause when it cited Walmart for inadequate crowd management in  the 2008 trampling death of a worker. OSHA\u2019s investigation found that the  company failed to protect its employees from the known risks of being  crushed or suffocated by a large unmanaged crowd\u2014in this case, about  2,000 shoppers surging into the store for a holiday sale. To cite an  employer under the general duty clause, OSHA officials told us they must,  among other things, have evidence that the hazard is \u201crecognized\u201d in the  industry and that the employer failed to take reasonable protective  measures. According to OSHA officials, using the general duty clause  requires significant agency resources so is not always a viable option, for  example when OSHA cannot prove an employer knows the hazard exists  or when a hazard is just emerging.", "Some of OSHA\u2019s standards require general protective measures that are  sufficiently broad to cover a variety of hazardous substances or practices.  Such standards may be the basis for enforcement actions regarding  urgent hazards that are not the subject of a specific standard. OSHA  officials explained that not every conceivable workplace hazard can be  the subject of its own standard. The agency has issued specific exposure  limits for some hazardous substances, such as formaldehyde, but  indicated it would be impossible to test and establish specific exposure  limits for all chemicals present in the modern workplace. OSHA\u2019s general  standards include, among others, requirements for employers to follow  protective housekeeping practices, provide respiratory protection under  certain conditions, and inform workers about hazardous chemicals they  are exposed to on the job.", "OSHA uses education to promote voluntary protective measures against  urgent hazards along with its enforcement and standard-setting activities.  Standards and enforcement are critical parts of OSHA\u2019s education  activities: standards inform employers about their responsibilities, and  enforcement initiatives raise awareness of urgent hazards. OSHA officials  believe high-profile citations serve to focus attention throughout the  relevant industry and can create a ripple effect of improved worker  protection. In addition to setting standards, OSHA offers on-site  consultations and publishes health and safety information to inform  employers and workers about urgent hazards. If its inspectors discover a  particular hazard, OSHA may send letters to all employers where the  hazard is likely to be present to inform them about the hazard and their  responsibility to protect their employees.", "OSHA officials also use education to improve safety in the near term  while the agency compiles the information necessary to develop a  standard. For example, OSHA decided not to issue an emergency  temporary standard on diacetyl in part because, as it gathered evidence  to support the standard, employers implemented changes to improve  worker safety. As evidence mounts that other ingredients in food  flavorings may be hazardous, OSHA is gathering information but has not  yet published a proposed standard on diacetyl. OSHA has, in the  meantime, published educational documents such as alerts and  information bulletins for employers on diacetyl and flavorings in general,  describing protective measures, compliance assistance programs, and  employer responsibilities under the OSH Act and existing OSHA   The agency has also developed material for workers, giving  standards.them the information they need to determine when they may be exposed  to diacetyl or similar substances and the types of protection they need.", "OSHA\u2019s education efforts also address other hazards for which it has  received petitions to issue emergency temporary standards. For example,  OSHA officials told us they are addressing the risks of exposure to heat  primarily through education, along with targeted enforcement in cases  where workers are known to be most at risk. OSHA\u2019s education efforts on  this hazard include an initiative intended to reach and educate agricultural  workers through training materials designed to be culturally appropriate  and accessible, including a train-the-trainer approach for wide distribution.  These training materials were supplemented by public service radio  announcements intended to reach workers at risk of heat-related illness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Regulatory Agencies\u2019 Experiences Offer Limited Insight into OSHA\u2019s Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although the rulemaking experiences of two other federal agencies shed  some light on OSHA\u2019s challenges, their statutory framework and  resources differ too markedly for them to be models for OSHA\u2019s  standard\u2013setting process. Other regulatory agencies may also face  challenges similar to OSHA\u2019s. For example, as GAO has previously  reported, EPA has faced difficulties regulating under the Toxic  Substances Control Act of 1976. Some of these differences in statutory  frameworks and resources may facilitate rulemaking efforts at other  agencies. For example, EPA is directed to regulate specified air pollutants  and review its existing regulations within specific time frames under  section 112 of the Clean Air Act, and MSHA benefits from a narrower  scope of authority than OSHA and has more specialized expertise as a  result of its more limited jurisdiction.", "Similar to OSHA, EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation regulates a wide  range of hazards across diverse industries to protect the public health.  This office implements the Clean Air Act, including section 112, which  requires EPA to regulate certain sources of air pollution and specifies the  substances to be controlled. For example, under section 112, EPA must  establish standards for sources of 187 specific hazardous air pollutants.", "EPA officials told us that this provision gave the agency clear  requirements and statutory deadlines for regulating hazardous air  pollutants, which it previously lacked. In contrast, some experts and  agency officials we spoke with identified OSHA\u2019s relatively broad  discretion to set and change its regulatory agenda as a contributing factor  to the length of time it takes OSHA to issue standards. Even with this  relatively specific statutory mandate, EPA has faced challenges  implementing its section 112 mandate, such as insufficient funding and  court-imposed deadlines that make it difficult for the agency itself to  implement its own agenda.", "EPA also has a statutory mandate to periodically review the standards  issued under section 112. For example, section 112 requires that EPA set  technology-based standards for stationary sources of hazardous air  pollutants, and further requires that EPA review these standards at least  every 8 years and revise them, as necessary, taking into account  developments in practices, processes, and control technologies. contrast, the OSH Act does not specify when OSHA is to revise its  standards.

In contrast, OSHA must  determine that significant risks to workers are present under current  conditions before it can establish or change existing standards. OSHA  has had to perform a specific risk assessment for every new toxic agent  for which it intends to set a PEL.", "MSHA\u2019s mission is more focused than OSHA\u2019s because its authority is  limited to one industry and it can target its regulatory resources more  easily. In addition, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977  requires that MSHA inspect each mine in the United States at least two  times a year, which facilitates its regulatory work. Officials at MSHA  noted that both this frequent on-site presence and relatively homogenous  industry helps agency staff maintain a current knowledge base.officials contrasted this with the vast array of workplaces and types of  industries OSHA oversees. Officials with OSHA and Labor noted that  OSHA\u2019s scope of authority is so large that it cannot inspect more than a  fraction of workplaces in any given year. As a result, OSHA and Labor  officials told us they can call upon inspectors when researching a  standard but must often supplement the agency\u2019s inside knowledge by  conducting site visits using OSHA staff or contractors.", "MSHA\u2019s legal framework may also present fewer challenges to standard  setting than OSHA\u2019s. First, MSHA standards are subject to the arbitrary  and capricious standard of review, unlike OSHA standards, which are  reviewed under the generally more stringent substantial evidence  standard. Second, according to MSHA officials, the agency has met the  statutory requirements for the five emergency temporary standards it has  issued since 1987, and no legal challenges to these standards were filed.  Similar to OSHA\u2019s authority to issue emergency temporary standards,  MSHA has statutory authority to issue \u201can emergency temporary  mandatory health or safety standard\u201d without following the APA\u2019s notice  and comment rulemaking procedures if the Secretary of Labor determines  that (1) miners are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances  or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful, or to other  hazards, and (2) such a standard is necessary to protect miners from  such danger. MSHA\u2019s most recent emergency temporary standard  required underground bituminous coal mine operators to increase the  incombustible content of rock, coal, and other dust, in order to address  the risk of explosion posed by such dust.", "Both OSHA and MSHA supplement their employees\u2019 knowledge by  calling upon the expertise at NIOSH, with MSHA benefiting from a  specialized research group within NIOSH focused on the mining industry.  According to officials with both NIOSH and OSHA, coordination between  the two has varied over time and has improved significantly in recent  years. For example, in 2011, NIOSH and OSHA adopted a Memorandum  of Understanding that provides OSHA with access to specified NIOSH  data on the health hazards of diacetyl and allows OSHA to coordinate  with NIOSH in preparing a risk assessment to support the development of  a new diacetyl standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Suggested Many Ideas to Improve OSHA\u2019s Standard-Setting Process, Including More Interagency Coordination and Statutory Deadlines", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improve Coordination with Other Federal Agencies to Leverage Expertise", "paragraphs": ["To fully leverage expertise at other federal agencies, experts and agency  officials suggest improving interagency coordination. Specifically, they  indicated that OSHA has not fully leveraged available expertise at other  federal agencies, especially NIOSH, when developing and issuing its  standards. As mentioned previously, NIOSH conducts research and  makes recommendations on occupational safety and health, and it was  created at the same time as OSHA by the OSH Act. OSHA has a number  of staff with subject matter expertise relevant to standard setting,  including industrial hygienists and scientists, but the agency does not  always take advantage of the expertise and data at NIOSH on  occupational hazards. One expert noted that NIOSH is uniquely  positioned as a primary research institution to help OSHA develop  standards using EPA-produced data and analysis on chemical hazards.  OSHA officials said their agency\u2019s staff consider NIOSH\u2019s input on an ad  hoc basis, but do not routinely work closely with NIOSH staff to analyze  risks of occupational hazards. An OSHA official cited one case in which  OSHA staff worked closely with NIOSH staff to prepare the technological  feasibility analysis for a proposed silica standard, drawing on an  extensive body of work on dust control technology by NIOSH engineers.  In addition, officials described other cases of collaboration between the  two agencies during OSHA\u2019s process of visiting worksites. However,  NIOSH officials told us that this type of coordination has been more  common recently than it was in the past, when the two agencies  performed separate risk assessments for hazards, such as hexavalent  chromium.", "OSHA officials stated that collaborating with NIOSH on risk assessments  could reduce the time it takes to develop a standard by several months.  OSHA and NIOSH have coordinated on a number of OSHA standards  projects; currently, the two agencies have a Memorandum of  Understanding stipulating that NIOSH will perform the risk assessment for  the OSHA standard on diacetyl. However, some experts and officials at  both agencies noted that collaborating in a more systematic way could  facilitate OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expand OSHA\u2019s Ability to Use Industry Voluntary Consensus Standards", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that OSHA\u2019s standards keep pace with changes in technology  and best practices, experts suggested the agency be allowed to more  easily adopt industry voluntary consensus standards. According to OSHA  officials, many OSHA standards incorporate or reference outdated  consensus standards, which results in challenges for employers in  complying with the standards and OSHA in enforcing them. Officials also  said that the majority of OSHA\u2019s health standards were adopted from  existing federal standards\u2014originally adopted under the Walsh-Healy  Act\u2014during the agency\u2019s first 2 years using section 6(a) of the OSH Act,  which directed OSHA to set standards without following the typical  section 6(b) standard-setting procedures or the APA. Although current at  the time, many industry consensus standards have since been updated to  reflect advancements in technology and science. However, according to  OSHA, most of OSHA\u2019s standards have not been similarly updated, so  employers following current industry consensus standards may be out of  compliance with OSHA\u2019s standards. As a result, some employers may be  discouraged from updating processes or technology at their worksites in  order to avoid OSHA citations. One expert said, and OSHA reported, that  this could leave workers at these worksites exposed to hazards that are  insufficiently addressed by OSHA standards that are based on out-of-date  technology or processes. OSHA has reported that these types of  standards are challenging because their inspectors must spend time  addressing them during worksite inspections. Additionally, officials told us  that issuing citations to employers that are following the most up-to-date  industry consensus standards reflects poorly on the agency. OSHA has  attempted to update some of its standards to incorporate advances in  technology and science, but the lengthy standard-setting process  presents significant challenges for updating them. In accordance with the  requirements in the OSH Act and the National Technology Transfer and  Advancement Act, when updating its standards, OSHA considers using  voluntary consensus standards. However, OSHA officials told us that,  since standards developing organizations typically do not have to meet  scientific requirements in developing voluntary standards, OSHA\u2019s ability  to base its standards on voluntary consensus standards is limited  because staff must still perform a full quantitative risk assessment for new  standards. Since 2004, OSHA has been engaged in an effort to update  several of its standards using industry consensus standards, which  officials told us started by first identifying standards that would be well- suited to more streamlined rulemaking approaches, such as issuing a  direct final rule. For example, they said they chose to update the  standard on personal protective equipment first because they expected  employers would be amenable to the update, as changes would be  consistent with the current industry consensus standard.", "To address the problem of standards based on outdated consensus  standards, experts suggested that Congress pass new legislation that  would allow OSHA, through a single rulemaking effort, to revise standards  for a group of health hazards based on current industry voluntary  consensus standards or the Threshold Limit Values developed by the  American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. In 1989,  OSHA attempted to revise the PELs for over 200 air contaminants by  combining them into a single rulemaking effort, but the rule was  invalidated by the court for failing to follow the OSH Act requirements for  each hazard. To save OSHA time, experts specified that any new law to  this effect should contain a provision similar to the one in the OSH Act  that excused the agency during its first 2 years from following the  standard-setting provisions of section 6(b) of the OSH Act or the APA.  One potential disadvantage of this proposal is that OSHA may need to do  a substantial amount of independent scientific research to ensure that  consensus standards are based on sufficient scientific evidence. While  such a law, if enacted, could exempt OSHA from conducting this  research, an abbreviated regulatory process could also result in  standards that fail to reflect relevant stakeholder concerns, such as an  imposition of unnecessarily burdensome requirements on employers. For  example, one expert stated that, while following the APA process takes  time for regulatory agencies, it leads to higher quality standards and  ensures that the basis for agency action is clear and defensible. Also,  while this change could help ensure that existing OSHA standards are  kept up to date, it could divert resources away from efforts to set new  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impose Statutory Deadlines and Provide Relief from Procedural Requirements for Setting Standards", "paragraphs": ["To minimize the time it takes OSHA to develop and issue safety or health  standards, experts and agency officials suggested that statutory  deadlines for issuing occupational safety and health standards be  imposed by Congress and enforced by the courts. OSHA officials  indicated that it can be difficult to prioritize standards due to the agency\u2019s  numerous and sometimes competing goals. In the past, having a  statutory deadline, combined with relief from procedural requirements,  resulted in OSHA issuing standards more quickly. For example, the  Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act directed OSHA to make specified  revisions to its bloodborne pathogens standard within 6 months and  exempted the agency from the typical procedural requirements under  section 6(b) of the OSH Act or the APA. OSHA had already spent some  time developing the standard before the law was passed, so it was able to  complete the revised standard within the required time frame. Including  the time spent on developing the standard before passage of the Act,  OSHA completed the revised standard in less than 3 years. Another  alternative to the full rulemaking process is for an agency to issue an  interim final rule, which is immediately effective as a final rule but still  allows for subsequent public comment. However, similar to one of the  disadvantages described above, some legal scholars have noted that  curtailing the current rulemaking process required by the APA may result  in fewer opportunities for public input and possibly decrease the quality of  the standard. Also, officials from MSHA told us that statutory deadlines  make its priorities clear, but this is sometimes to the detriment of other  issues that must be set aside in the meantime.

Congress has similar concerns about OSHA, it may be preferable to keep  the current standard of review. However, the Administrative Conference  of the United States has recommended that Congress amend laws that  mandate use of the substantial evidence standard because it can be  unnecessarily burdensome for the agency or confusing because it has  been inconsistently applied by the courts.

However, one limitation to this method is that, according to  OSHA officials, in-person site visits are imperative for gathering sufficient  data in support of most health standards. Specifically, officials told us that  to fully understand the industrial processes and application of a chemical  to be regulated, OSHA staff or contractors must be able to observe the  work being performed and ask questions of workers at the site. In  addition, the only way for OSHA to know about ambient chemical levels is  to collect on-site air samples all day long. In light of this limitation, this  method may be more appropriate for safety hazards. The other method  experts suggested is allowing OSHA to base economic and technological  feasibility assessments on industry best practices, which one expert  noted would require a statutory change. For example, OSHA could base  these analyses on the fact that a minimum percentage of workplaces in a  particular industry use technology or methods that decrease exposure to  hazards.

The process for  developing new standards for previously unregulated occupational  hazards and new hazards that emerge is a lengthy one and can result in  periods when there are insufficient protections for workers. Nevertheless,  any streamlining of the current process must guarantee sufficient  stakeholder input to ensure that the quality of standards does not suffer.

We selected standards that met two criteria:  (1) they were published as a final rule between calendar years 1981 and  2010 and (2) OSHA identified each standard as significant. To identify our  universe of standards for this analysis, we first conducted an electronic  legal database search for final rules published by OSHA in the Federal  Register between 1981 and 2010. We chose this time frame because it  spans multiple executive administrations and changes in congressional  leadership. Also, several statutes, executive orders, and key court  decisions affecting OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process became effective in  or after 1980. We excluded from our review any rules that were not  occupational safety or health standards, such as recordkeeping  requirements or general administrative regulations, and any rules that  were minor or technical amendments to existing standards.

Using these criteria, we initially selected Labor\u2019s  Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and two offices of the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): the Office of Pollution  Prevention and Toxics and the Office of Air and Radiation. For the EPA  offices, we specifically focused on their rulemaking experiences under  section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act and section 112 of the  Clean Air Act. However, after further review, we concluded that the Office  of Pollution Prevention and Toxics did not offer insights for OSHA  because of the office\u2019s limited recent standard-setting experience and, as  a result, we excluded the Toxic Substances Control Act from our review.  Through a review of relevant federal laws and semistructured interviews  with staff in EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation and at MSHA, we learned  about challenges each agency faces when developing and issuing  regulations and the factors that affect their time frames. Although states  may also issue standards in the absence of an applicable federal  standard or under an OSHA-approved plan, we did not look to these  states to gain insight into OSHA\u2019s challenges with setting standards.  Based on our interviews with experts, and because rulemaking at the  state level is governed by state law and is not subject to federal  rulemaking procedural requirements, we determined that any  comparisons between OSHA and states with respect to time frames for  issuing standards would be inapt.", "We compiled the ideas for improving OSHA\u2019s standard-setting process by  analyzing statements from interviews with current and former agency  officials and experts representing both workers and employers. The six  ideas discussed in the report represent those most frequently mentioned  that are not otherwise addressed by other parts of our report.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 to April 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
