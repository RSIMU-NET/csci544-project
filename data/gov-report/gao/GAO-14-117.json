Treasury has made several efforts to increase participation, such as extending the program deadline through December 2015, expanding program eligibility requirements, and initiating the MHA Outreach and Borrower Intake Project. This project provides funding to counseling agencies to help borrowers complete and submit MHA application packages. The project was scheduled to end in December 2013 but was recently extended through September 2014.", "Treasury requires MHA servicers to develop internal control programs that monitor compliance with fair lending laws (the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act) but has not assessed the extent to which servicers are meeting this requirement. Treasury noted that it shares HAMP loan-level data with the federal agencies responsible for fair lending enforcement. GAO's analysis of HAMP loan-level data for four large MHA servicers identified some statistically significant differences in the rate of denials and cancellations of trial modifications and in the potential for redefault between populations protected by fair lending laws and other populations. Such analysis by itself cannot account for all factors that could explain these differences. Reviewing the fair lending internal controls of MHA servicers could give Treasury additional assurance that servicers are complying with fair lending laws.", "Despite an Executive Order issued in 2000 and a 2011 Attorney General's memorandum regarding improving access to federal programs for limited English proficiency (LEP) persons, Treasury only recently developed LEP-related written guidelines and procedures for the MHA programs. Treasury has taken measures to reach out to these borrowers and requires servicers to have a policy for \u201ceffective relationship management\u201d with LEP borrowers. However, Treasury has not provided any clarifying guidance to servicers on what such a policy should contain or assessed servicer compliance with this requirement. Housing counselors have noted that LEP borrowers continue to encounter language-related barriers in obtaining access to MHA program benefits. Without a comprehensive strategy that includes guidance for servicers on engaging with LEP borrowers and monitoring of servicers, Treasury cannot ensure that all potential MHA participants have equal access to program benefits. Because the MHA program provides direct outlays of taxpayer dollars, it is important that Treasury take appropriate steps to ensure that all eligible borrowers, including those whose primary language is not English, have access to MHA program benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Treasury should (1) assess the extent to which servicers have established internal control programs to monitor compliance with fair lending laws, (2) issue guidance to servicers on working effectively with LEP borrowers and (3) monitor servicers' compliance with the guidance.

Among other things, EESA was intended to preserve  homeownership and protect home values. The U.S. Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) introduced MHA in February 2009, providing up to  $50 billion to help as many as 4 million struggling homeowners avoid  potential foreclosure. Treasury has subsequently reduced the amount  obligated for housing programs under TARP to $38.5 billion, of which  $29.9 billion is allocated to MHA programs. MHA\u2019s key component is the  Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which provides servicers  and mortgage holders/investors with incentive payments for modifying  first-lien mortgages. These modifications are intended to prevent  foreclosures by reducing homeowners\u2019 monthly mortgage payments to  affordable levels. Treasury has implemented additional programs that use  TARP funds, including a program aimed at helping homeowners in areas  hit hardest by the housing crisis and another to help underwater  borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.

In October 2010, PRA  took effect as a component of HAMP to give servicers more flexibility  in offering relief to borrowers whose homes were worth significantly  less than their mortgage balance.

Treasury has tripled  the PRA incentive amounts offered to mortgage holders/investors for  permanent modifications with trial periods effective on or after March  1, 2012.

When  servicers include principal reductions in modifications under PRA, the  principal reduction amount is initially treated as non-interest-bearing  principal forbearance.

Under  this program, servicers offer foreclosure alternatives (short sales and  deeds-in-lieu) to borrowers who meet the eligibility requirement for  HAMP and cannot be approved for a HAMP trial modification, do not  successfully complete a HAMP trial modification, default on a  modification (miss two or more consecutive payments), or request a  short sale or deed-in-lieu. to investors, servicers, and borrowers for completing these  foreclosure alternatives.", "Under a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the homeowner voluntarily conveys all ownership  interest in the home to the lender as an alternative to foreclosure proceedings. In a short  sale, a homeowner sells a house rather than going into foreclosure. Proceeds from short  sales are generally less than the mortgage amount, so the homeowner must have the  lender\u2019s permission for the sale. Under a HAFA short sale, a lender must forgive the  shortfall between the loan balance and net sales proceeds and release the lien on the  subject property.

However, we subsequently reported that  because of the unsettled dynamics of the mortgage market and overall  economic conditions, actual outcomes may well be different from the  projection. Further, Treasury stated to us that the number of potentially  eligible borrowers has shrunk steadily since the beginning of the program,  as has the number of delinquent borrowers across the mortgage industry,  generally. Extending the deadline for HAMP applications and expanding  program eligibility may provide more borrowers the opportunity to  participate in the programs. However, because the number of borrowers  that have received permanent modifications as of November 30, 2013  (1.3 million) is well below Treasury\u2019s initial estimate of 3 million to 4  million and the pool of estimated HAMP eligible borrowers is declining, it  is unclear whether Treasury will disburse all the funds it has obligated to  MHA.

Treasury stated that they  periodically review the Production Dashboard for individual agencies, as  needed.", "An agency that does not meet its production goals would receive less  compensation because document preparation fees are only paid for  complete initial packages accepted by servicers. In addition,  NeighborWorks may re-allocate funds from an underperforming agency to  another agency if it reaches its allocation goal. However, Treasury  officials noted that the funding for 20,000 applications had not been fully  allocated and, thus, NeighborWorks would first allocate unallocated funds  to any agency needing a higher allocation before reducing the allocation  of an underperforming agency.", "In addition to the Production Dashboard report, NeighborWorks provides  Treasury with quarterly reports describing what housing counseling  agencies have characterized as successes and challenges to project  implementation. For example, in September 2013, NeighborWorks  reported that 55 counseling agencies identified internal programmatic  changes such as streamlining processes, specialized staff, and direct  engagement with borrowers as factors associated with success.  Counseling agencies also reported challenges with servicers that did not  subscribe to the Hope LoanPort, unresponsive servicers, and borrowers  that did not engage with counselors. Fully understanding and analyzing  the nature of these successes and challenges could be useful to Treasury  in working with NeighborWorks to improve the performance of the project.  For example, Treasury stated to us that the majority of large MHA  servicers subscribe to the Hope LoanPort, representing over 80 percent  of HAMP activity. Treasury stated to us that servicers may have chosen  not to subscribe to the Hope LoanPort due to the related subscription  costs, and that the servicers that did not subscribe were generally either  smaller servicers or those with their own document collection system.  Additionally, Treasury noted that its compliance agent has begun  assessing servicers\u2019 processes associated with the MHA Outreach and  Intake Project and has noted instances where certain servicers could  enhance their design and execution of controls, but, the compliance  agent\u2019s loan level testing indicated that in most instances the loans were  processed accurately and timely. By extending the project from  December 2013 through September 2014, it is more likely that Treasury  will reach its goal of 20,000 HAMP application packages completed  through the project.

Our analysis of HAMP loan-level data, which focused on four large MHA  servicers, identified some statistically significant differences within these  servicers\u2019 portfolios for certain protected groups in denials and  cancellations of trial modifications and in the potential for redefault of  permanent modifications, which might indicate a need for further review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Treasury Requires Servicers to Develop and Maintain Systems to Monitor Compliance with Fair Lending Laws", "paragraphs": ["The MHA Servicer Participation Agreement and MHA Handbook require  that servicers have an internal control program to monitor compliance  with relevant consumer protection laws, including ECOA and the Fair  Housing Act, and that the servicers review the effectiveness of their  internal control program quarterly. The internal control program must  document the control objectives for MHA activities, the associated control  techniques, and mechanisms for testing and validating the controls.  Servicers are also required to provide Treasury\u2019s compliance agent with  access to all internal control reviews related to MHA programs performed  by the servicer and its independent auditing firm and to provide a copy of  the reviews to the MHA program administrator.", "Although Treasury requires MHA servicers to certify that they have  developed and implemented an internal control program to monitor  compliance with applicable consumer protection and fair lending laws,  Treasury has not monitored servicers to determine whether they have  developed such internal control programs. Specifically, Treasury officials  told us that it has not required its compliance agent to obtain information  from servicers on such programs. The five MHA servicers we spoke with  told us that they had not shared with Treasury details on their internal  control programs for monitoring compliance with fair lending laws.  However, four of the servicers said that they regularly shared the details  of these programs, as well as the results of fair lending analyses, with  their federal financial regulators.", "Treasury officials explained that Treasury does not examine servicer  compliance with fair lending laws because other federal agencies\u2014 CFPB, DOJ, FTC, HUD, and the banking regulators\u2014have the sole  responsibility for enforcement and supervision of federal fair lending laws.  Therefore, only those agencies, and not Treasury, are charged with the  responsibility for determining whether a servicer (subject to the  jurisdiction of the appropriate agency) complies with the federal fair  lending laws. According to representatives of the prudential regulators,  their fair lending reviews have a broader overall focus, which include  examining the servicers\u2019 overall servicing and loss mitigation activities.  They added that, while the reviews may not specifically focus on MHA  activities, HAMP modifications may be included in the loan portfolios of  the MHA servicers examined. Officials from two prudential regulators said  that their examinations of servicing portfolios had resulted in supervisory  guidance to a few of the larger MHA servicers related to (1) potential  disparities between certain fair lending protected classes and their  comparison populations, (2) communication issues with non-English  speaking borrowers, and (3) handling of loss mitigation and loan  modification complaints. Additionally, one regulator, on behalf of the  Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force\u2019s (FFETF) Non-Discrimination  Working Group, conducted exploratory analysis to characterize outcomes   According to  of the HAMP program and identify fair lending risks.officials from this regulator, the aggregate results of the exploratory  analysis were shared with Treasury and other members of the Non- Discrimination Working Group in January 2012, and no fair lending issues  of note were identified. Additionally, officials said that this regulator also  shared the supervisory guidance discussed above and summaries of its  fair lending reviews, which included statistical analysis of MHA servicers  under its jurisdiction, with the working group.", "Officials from the prudential regulators noted that they consider  complaints from consumers alleging discriminatory practices in their  examinations of regulated banking institutions. According to the prudential  regulators, results of their fair lending examinations are considered  confidential supervisory information and are sensitive and privileged. The  regulators explained that because of the nature of the information, they  would not have shared the details of examination results with Treasury.  Further, these regulators told us that they had not identified fair lending  violations related to the MHA program specifically.", "Treasury officials told us that while they have not specifically examined  servicers\u2019 controls for ensuring compliance with fair lending laws, the  compliance agent did examine servicers\u2019 internal controls related to other  HAMP requirements, such as soliciting borrowers who are 60 days  delinquent and performing \u201csecond look\u201d loan reviews which focused on  determining whether HAMP denials were appropriate. Additionally,  Treasury officials noted that the processes servicers use to solicit  borrowers and determine the eligibility and terms of a modification were  highly structured due to MHA requirements. These processes limit  servicer discretion with respect to implementing the MHA requirements,  and as a result, outcomes in HAMP modifications are less likely to result  in fair lending compliance issues, according to Treasury officials. Despite  the structured nature of HAMP, we have previously found instances  where servicers varied their application within HAMP guidelines. For  example, in 2010 we reported that servicers have inconsistent practices  for evaluating borrowers for imminent default because Treasury has not  provided specific guidance on how to evaluate nonenterprise borrowers  for imminent default.  Additionally, Treasury does not require servicers  to apply principal reduction in connection with modifications; instead  servicers are required to establish written policies detailing when principal   While these policies must treat similarly  reduction will be offered.situated borrowers in a consistent manner, there may be variations  across servicers in the use of principal reduction and in some cases  servicers may reasonably refuse to reduce principal.", "Also, servicers, and their employees, may make errors in applying HAMP  policies to modifications. For example, in 2010 we reported that 5 of the  10 servicers we contacted reported at least a 20 percent error rate for  income calculations. We noted that without accurate income calculations,  which are key in determining borrowers\u2019 DTI, similarly situated borrowers  applying for HAMP may be inequitably evaluated for the program and  may be inappropriately deemed eligible or ineligible for HAMP. Treasury  also assesses servicers on their income calculations and tracks the  percentage of loans for which MHA-C\u2019s income calculation differs from  the servicer\u2019s on a quarterly basis. In their July 2013 assessment results,  Treasury noted an average income error rate of less than 2 percent, down  from an average of about 7.5 percent in July 2011.", "Although the prudential regulators have not identified any fair lending  violations of MHA servicers, they did share some fair lending-related  concerns of some large MHA servicers with Treasury. Furthermore,  opportunity for variations and errors within and across servicers can  impact borrowers. By evaluating the extent to which servicers have  developed and maintained internal controls to monitor compliance with  fair lending laws, Treasury could gain additional assurance that servicers  are implementing the MHA program in compliance with fair lending laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Collects but Has Not Analyzed MHA Data Related to Fair Lending", "paragraphs": ["data, including information on the servicer and the borrowers\u2019 race,  ethnicity, and gender, with the federal agencies with fair lending oversight  and enforcement authority. Treasury also makes a more limited public  file available to the general public that excludes, among other things,  information identifying the servicer and personal identifying information  about the borrower (name, address, etc.). On first releasing the public file  containing loan-level data in January 2011, Treasury stated that it  intended to engage one or more independent, third-party research firms  to conduct a more detailed analysis of fair lending in MHA and that it  would make the results of this analysis available to the public. In March  2013, Treasury entered into an interagency agreement with HUD to  engage a third-party contractor to conduct a fair lending analysis of  HAMP loan modifications. As of September 30, 2013, HUD secured a  contractor to conduct the analysis.", "Our analysis of Treasury\u2019s HAMP data through April 17, 2013, suggested  that there may be some issues that warrant a closer look at servicers\u2019 fair  lending internal control systems by Treasury and the pertinent fair lending  regulatory agency. We examined the rate of denial or cancellation of  HAMP modifications, and the rate of redefault of permanent HAMP  modifications experienced by selected population groups and compared  them to the same rates for their comparison populations at various stages  of the HAMP process. We primarily focused on the outcomes for certain  protected groups under federal fair lending laws plus low-income groups  and groups in neighborhoods that consisted primarily of minority  populations (substantially minority); we refer to these groups collectively  as \u201cselected populations.\u201d We used a multivariate econometric analysis  to control for several observable characteristics of the borrower, servicer,  loan, and property, allowing us to appropriately estimate the outcomes  these populations experienced. In focusing our analysis on four large  MHA servicers, we found some statistically significant differences in the  outcomes experienced by our selected populations compared to their  comparison population. For example, we found that for all four servicers  non-Hispanic African-Americans had a statistically significant higher trial  modification denial rate compared to non-Hispanic whites due to DTIs  being less than 31 percent. When examining denials of trial modifications  because borrowers had not provided complete information to the servicer,  denial rates were significantly higher for Hispanics than for the  comparison population of non-Hispanic whites for three of the four large  servicers we analyzed. We also found that for all of the servicers we  analyzed, non-Hispanic African-Americans had a statistically higher rate  of redefault than non-Hispanic whites, regardless of whether or not the  servicer applied capitalization, principal forbearance, or principal  forgiveness to the loan modification, holding other key factors constant.  For additional findings from our analysis, see appendix II.", "We are unable to determine from the available HAMP data whether the  statistically significant differences between the selected populations and  their comparison populations identified in our analysis were the result of  servicer discretion, servicer errors in the application or interpretation of  HAMP guidelines or servicing protocols, differences among servicers\u2019  policies, or the unintended consequences of HAMP guidelines or program  design. Additional analysis is needed to determine the reasons for the  differences and the extent to which servicer implementation of HAMP  guidelines could be a potential cause as well as other potential causes for  the differences in outcomes. As noted in appendix II, there are some  limitations of our analysis. For instance, we could not control for all  potential factors that affect these outcomes due to the lack of certain  data, such as the wealth of the borrowers and their knowledge of the loan  modification process. Also, our analysis cannot account for some  important factors, such as whether equivalent borrowers in these  populations apply to HAMP at different rates or are more or less likely to  receive assistance outside of HAMP. Further, race and ethnicity data  were not available for 54 percent of borrowers in the early stage of the  HAMP process and 43 percent of borrowers in the later stage of HAMP.  Although we took appropriate steps to minimize the impact of missing  data our results should be interpreted with caution.", "Despite the limitations noted above, statistical differences in outcomes  among population groups might suggest potential fair lending concerns  that merit further examination. Officials from fair lending regulatory  agencies told us that results of econometric analyses of fair lending  populations were one of multiple sources of information they review when  examining fair lending compliance of banking institutions and servicers.  They noted that the existence of a statistical disparity alone would not  necessarily result in the finding of a fair lending violation but could be a  reason to further investigate an institution. Such analyses could be useful  to Treasury as the agency considers whether servicers participating in the  HAMP program have sufficient internal controls to assess compliance  with fair lending laws."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Treasury Has Provided Servicers with Limited Guidance and Oversight on Interacting with Borrowers with Limited English Proficiency", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has taken various actions to increase access to the program for  borrowers whose primary language is not English, but only recently has  begun to systematically assess access to the MHA program, for these  borrowers.

Although Treasury has not specified for servicers how they  should meet the needs of LEP persons or assessed their efforts to do so,  it has taken steps to provide information and support to LEP borrowers in  connection with MHA through various sources and methods. For  example, Treasury publishes a website with information about the MHA  program (www.makinghomeaffordable.gov), which has a mirror Spanish  website and critical content pages in Chinese, Vietnamese, Russian,  Tagalog, and Korean. Treasury also has published advertisements and  public service announcements in Spanish, and conducted outreach to  Spanish-speaking media as well. Additionally, the MHA website, along  with Treasury\u2019s outreach materials, directs interested homeowners to the  Homeowners HOPE\u2122 Hotline, which provides over-the-telephone  support to LEP borrowers related to MHA programs. As part of the MHA  escalations process, Treasury also provides a toll-free call center\u2014MHA  Help\u2014where, according to Treasury, LEP borrowers can receive more  specialized assistance over the phone. Treasury has also translated the  MHA application form and certain outreach materials in other languages  such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.  However, it does not require that servicers use the translated materials.", "The executive order also directs federal agencies to \u201cprepare a plan to  improve access to its federally conducted programs and activities by  eligible LEP persons.\u201d The plans are to include the steps the agency will  take to ensure that eligible LEP persons can meaningfully access the  agency\u2019s programs and activities. In February 2011, the Attorney General  issued a memorandum to the heads of federal agencies that renewed the  federal government\u2019s commitment to language access obligations under  the executive order and called on agencies to, among other things, review  their programs and activities for language accessibility and submit an  updated LEP plan within 6 months after the date of the memorandum.Treasury issued its last LEP plan in 2000 and, as such, it did not cover  newer programs such as MHA that began in early 2009. As of November  2013, Treasury was working on finalizing an updated agency-wide LEP  plan, which would address newer programs and activities, such as the  MHA programs. The draft plan indicated that Treasury intended to publish  the plan in the Federal Register and on the Treasury website for public  comment. The draft plan included information related to Treasury\u2019s  assessment of the language needs for the MHA programs. In addition, it  described Treasury\u2019s current and planned steps to assist LEP borrowers  in accessing the information and support provided by Treasury in  connection with the MHA programs.

Treasury officials also told us that they had not  required their compliance agent to review servicers\u2019 implementation of the  requirement for effective relationship management for LEP borrowers.  According to Treasury officials, concerns about LEP borrowers\u2019 lack of  access to MHA were only recently raised as an issue by consumer  advocates in May 2013. In response to this feedback, Treasury  conducted a survey of the LEP-related policies of the 17 largest MHA  servicers to better understand how these servicers worked with LEP  borrowers. All of the 17 servicers Treasury surveyed reported that they  had staff that spoke Spanish, and 15 servicers indicated that they had  contracted with a vendor for real-time translation. Representatives of four  MHA servicers we contacted confirmed this practice. The remaining  servicer told us that they contract with a vendor for all non-English  customer communication related to modifications. Additionally,  representatives of three servicers told us that their firms had electronic  systems that could note in the borrower\u2019s file if the borrower\u2019s primary  language was Spanish. However, the systems contain no similar notation  for other languages. Three servicers we spoke with told us that they also  referred borrowers to the Homeowners HOPE\u2122 Hotline to find a housing  counseling agency that could assist with languages.", "Nonetheless, representatives of some advocacy groups we spoke to  raised concerns about the sufficiency of the practices followed by  servicers in meeting the needs of non-English-speaking borrowers. The  advocacy groups represented housing counseling agencies whose  counselors worked one-on-one with potential HAMP borrowers and legal  services attorneys. These groups were concerned that servicers\u2019 current  practices of using Spanish-speaking staff or contracting with a language  interpretation service were insufficient. For example, one advocacy group  said that some servicers used Spanish-speaking customer service agents  who might be knowledgeable about banking and mortgages generally, but  not about servicing, loss mitigation, or HAMP specifically. Similarly,  representatives of three advocacy groups noted that staff from a  language interpretation service might not be familiar enough with banking  terminology or the details of HAMP to provide quality interpretation  services. Another group pointed out the importance of translated  documents and noted that it would be more beneficial for borrowers to  have important documents, such as the trial modification offer letter,  translated into their preferred language so that they could refer to it when  needed. In fact, in a 2013 national survey conducted by the National  Housing Resource Center and a similar survey conducted by a California- based research group, nearly half of the 296 housing counselors who  responded said their LEP clients who were seeking mortgage servicing  assistance \u201cnever\u201d received translated foreclosure-related documents.   Additionally, in both surveys, over 60 percent of the housing counselors  said that their LEP clients were \u201cnever\u201d or only \u201csometimes\u201d able to speak  to their servicer in their native language or through a translator provided  by the servicer, while the rest said their clients were \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d  able to do so. Furthermore, in the national survey, nearly half of the  survey respondents said their LEP clients \u201calways,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or  \u201csometimes\u201d received worse loss mitigation outcomes than their English- proficient clients, while the other half said their clients \u201cnever\u201d received  worse outcomes.", "Ultimately, the lack of clear guidance and expectations of servicers on  what constitutes effective relationship management in serving LEP  borrowers can potentially affect the effectiveness of servicers\u2019 ability to  work with such borrowers and result in unequal access to the program by  these borrowers. Treasury officials noted that MHA-eligible loans  represent a small portion of participating servicers\u2019 overall servicing  activity, and thus Treasury is cautious in imposing additional requirements  on participating servicers that could lead to excessive costs and burdens.  They added that participating servicers interact with borrowers from a  number of communities that speak a variety of languages and are in a  better position to ascertain how to best provide effective relationship  management to the LEP borrowers they serve. According to Treasury,  servicers have told Treasury that mandating the translation or use of  certain documents, among other things, would be of little benefit given the  overall low demand for such documents in languages other than English,  the added legal risks, the potential for inaccurate translation, and  increased costs associated with the translation of documents. Treasury  also noted that it may not be appropriate to require servicers to conduct  business in languages other than English, especially when other  regulators have not done so. For example, they noted that CFPB\u2019s recent  mortgage servicing rules do not require servicers to accept applications in  other languages or provide specific translation services. Treasury officials  stated that the issues faced by LEP borrowers extend beyond HAMP to  the broader areas of loss mitigation and mortgage origination.", "Accordingly, Treasury believes that it is appropriate for such industry-wide  issues to be addressed by those government entities that have broad  jurisdiction over the financial institutions operating in these fields.  However, the MHA program provides direct outlays of taxpayer dollars to  servicers and is intended to provide benefits to eligible borrowers. As  such, it is important that Treasury take appropriate steps to help ensure  that all eligible borrowers, including those whose primary language is not  English, have access to the MHA program benefits.", "Without guidance on effective relationship management for LEP  borrowers, the policies that MHA servicers develop may vary, and LEP  borrowers may be treated differently across servicers, depending on  which company services their loan. Additionally, because Treasury has  not provided guidance to servicers describing the essentials of a  relationship management policy for LEP borrowers, Treasury is limited in  what it can measure when assessing servicers\u2019 compliance with  Treasury\u2019s requirement or the effectiveness of their current practices for  interacting with LEP borrowers. Ultimately, the lack of LEP policies and  procedures for the MHA programs and clear expectations for effective  relationship management make it less likely that servicers may effectively  meet borrowers\u2019 needs for language services and therefore limit their  opportunity to benefit from MHA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While below initial expectations, over a million borrowers have had their  mortgages modified under the program. However, with respect to MHA  servicer compliance, Treasury could be taking additional steps to ensure  that borrowers are being treated in accordance with fair lending laws.  MHA servicers are required to develop an internal control program to  monitor compliance with fair lending laws that prohibit discrimination.  However, Treasury has not examined servicers\u2019 internal control programs  or conducted any analysis of borrowers\u2019 outcomes in HAMP modifications  to identify potential fair lending risks. Our analysis found some statistically  significant differences in the outcomes of fair lending populations, when  compared to others, and while these variations alone do not indicate that  borrowers were treated differently, they suggest that further examination  may be warranted. Conducting further analyses would permit Treasury to  better identify where it might apply examination resources, such as those  of its compliance agent, and ascertain whether these differences are due  to servicers\u2019 discretion in the application of HAMP guidelines or other  factors. By requiring its compliance agent to review the fair lending  internal controls of loan servicers, or reviewing the data MHA servicers  collect on the race, ethnicity, and gender of borrowers, Treasury could  gain additional assurance that servicers are implementing the MHA  program in compliance with fair lending laws as the servicers contracted  to do.", "Finally, despite an executive order issued in 2000 to improve access to  federal programs for people with limited English proficiency and a 2011  memorandum by the Attorney General renewing the federal government\u2019s  commitment to that executive order, Treasury officials have only recently  developed a written plan that covers the Making Home Affordable  programs as of November 2013.

According to a  Treasury survey of MHA servicers and our discussions with five large  MHA servicers, these servicers had some processes in place to assist  LEP borrowers, such as using an oral translation service. Housing  counselors and housing advocacy groups that work with LEP borrowers  have questioned the ability of servicers to assist LEP borrowers. Without  additional guidance on providing meaningful language assistance, LEP  borrowers may be treated differently across servicers and have unequal  access to the MHA program. Moreover, Treasury has not assessed the  effectiveness of its own or its servicers\u2019 LEP practices.

FDIC and OCC did not provide any comments on the draft report.", "In its comment letter, Treasury noted that it was still considering our  findings and recommendations, and agreed that it should continue to  strengthen its program in order to help as many homeowners as possible  avoid foreclosure. Treasury also noted that since MHA\u2019s launch in 2009,  more than 1.9 million homeowner assistance actions had taken place  under the program and that they continue to take action to maximize  participation rates. In response to our recommendation that it take action  to require that its compliance agent begin assessing the extent to which  servicers had established internal control programs that effectively  monitor compliance with fair lending laws, Treasury said that it remained  committed to working to ensure that homeowners are treated fairly by  servicers participating in MHA. Treasury stated that it had a robust  compliance program to assess servicers\u2019 performance and that it  published the results of its assessments to provide greater transparency  and hold servicers accountable. However, as noted earlier, Treasury does  not require its compliance agent to assess servicers\u2019 internal control  programs for monitoring fair lending compliance.  Treasury stated that it  planned to continue to explore ways to promote fair lending policies,  including through coordination with fair lending supervisions and  enforcement agencies and improving access to data. We agree that  continuing to improve the transparency and accountability of MHA is  important.

Treasury noted that it recognized the challenges homeowners  with limited English proficiency faced, and had made some program  materials available in other languages and sponsored call centers that  offer translation services. Treasury added that the challenges faced by  these homeowners extend beyond MHA to industry-wide areas of loan  servicing and mortgage lending. Treasury stated that it would continue to  explore additional ways to assist LEP homeowners and work with federal  regulators that have broad jurisdiction over these issues. While these  challenges likely extend beyond the MHA program, the MHA program  provides direct outlays of billions of taxpayer dollars in incentive  payments to participating servicers and is intended to provide benefits to  all eligible borrowers needing assistance to avoid foreclosure. Taking  appropriate steps to help ensure that LEP borrowers have access to the  MHA program benefits would place this federal program in the forefront of  efforts to reach these borrowers and ensure that taxpayer dollars are put  to the most effective use.", "In its technical comments, Treasury indicated that it disagreed with three  statements in the draft report. Specifically, Treasury disagreed with our  characterization of participation levels in the HAMP first-lien modification  program as declining despite Treasury\u2019s efforts to increase participation.  We modified the text to clarify that since the implementation of HAMP Tier  2 in June 2012, the number of modifications started each month has been  relatively steady through November 2013. Treasury also questioned the  accuracy of our statement that it lacked assurance that the MHA program,  and servicers\u2019 implementation of it, were treating all borrowers fairly and  consistently citing, among other things, the role of the prudential  regulators in enforcing fair lending laws and its compliance program for  assessing the performance of participating servicers. However, these  mechanisms only provide limited assurance since, as noted previously in  the report, the prudential regulators do not focus their fair lending reviews  on MHA program activity and Treasury\u2019s compliance program does not  look at the fair lending controls of participating servicers. As a result, we  continue to believe that it is important that Treasury require its compliance  agent to assess the internal control programs that servicers are required  to put into place to monitor compliance with fair lending laws that apply to  MHA programs. Lastly, Treasury noted in its technical comments that it  disagreed with the statement that it has only recently begun to  systematically assess and take measures to ensure access to the  program for borrowers whose primary language is not English. We  clarified the text to acknowledge the actions taken to raise awareness and  outreach to LEP borrowers, but that Treasury has not provided guidance  to servicers on its requirement to have a relationship management policy  for their LEP borrowers or assessed the effectiveness of its own or its  servicers\u2019 LEP practices.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees.

We also used income cohorts for borrowers relative to  incomes in their geographic areas (metropolitan statistical areas\u2014MSAs)  instead of nationally.
