DOE uses a system of regulations and internal directives that lay out requirements and guidance for ensuring the safety of staff and contractors, the public, and the environment. Over the past 10 years, GAO and others have repeatedly made recommendations for DOE to improve safety performance. In March 2010, DOE announced a reform effort to revise safety-related directives to increase productivity and reduce costs while maintaining safety.", "This report examines (1) how DOE revised safety directives under its reform effort, (2) the costs of the reform effort and the benefits DOE hoped to achieve, and (3) the extent to which its reform effort addresses safety concerns GAO and others have identified. GAO reviewed relevant DOE reform effort documents, visited selected DOE sites to interview site office and contractor officials, and analyzed past GAO and other reports on DOE\u0092s safety problems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under its safety reform effort, the Department of Energy (DOE) reduced the number of safety directives by eliminating or combining requirements it determined were unclear, duplicative, or too prescriptive and by encouraging the use of industry standards. DOE reduced the number of its safety directives from 80 to 42, and for some of the directives DOE retained, it made extensive revisions. For example, DOE deleted requirements from its quality assurance directive addressing a corrective action program because another safety directive adequately covered these requirements. DOE obtained comments on its proposed revisions from DOE and contractor staff and from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Safety Board).", "The benefits of DOE\u0092s reform effort are not clear. DOE intended to enhance productivity and reduce costs while maintaining safety, but DOE did not determine how the original requirements contained in safety directives impaired productivity or added costs before undertaking the reform effort. Moreover, DOE did not assess whether the cost to implement the revised directives would exceed the benefits, but officials said they had launched an initial study to determine, among other things, the costs associated with implementing selected safety requirements. DOE also did not develop performance measures in order to assess how the reform effort will lead to improved productivity or lower costs while maintaining safety. Instead, DOE is measuring success by using output-oriented measures, such as the number of directives eliminated, and not outcome measures, such as specific productivity improvements or cost savings. In the absence of clear measures linking the reform effort to productivity and safety improvements, DOE is not well positioned to know that its reform effort will achieve the intended benefits.", "DOE\u0092s reform effort did not fully address safety concerns GAO and others have identified in three key areas: (1) quality assurance, (2) safety culture, and (3) federal oversight. Regarding quality assurance, DOE strengthened its quality assurance directive by clarifying that contractors must follow specific industry quality assurance standards, but quality assurance problems persist. For example, DOE proposed a nearly $250,000 fine against a contractor in July 2011 after identifying quality assurance problems in an incident where a worker punctured his hand with a sharp object contaminated with plutonium. With regard to safety culture, DOE revised its Integrated Safety Management directives to attempt to strengthen the safety culture at its sites, but DOE removed requirements for contractors to follow the directives because contractors already had to comply with safety management requirements in federal regulation. Safety Board officials raised concerns that the requirements in federal regulation are less detailed and, as a result, contractors may not implement safety practices as rigorously as if they were subject to the more specific requirements in DOE\u0092s directives. Finally, regarding federal oversight, DOE revised its approach to place greater emphasis on having its independent oversight staff review safety design documents before facilities are constructed, rather than after they are built. Other changes, however, such as requiring oversight staff to coordinate their assessment activities with DOE site office and contractor staff, raise concerns about the oversight staff\u0092s ability to provide a critical review of safety at DOE\u0092s sites that is independent from DOE site office and contractor staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE analyze the costs and benefits of its safety reform effort and identify how the effort will help address safety concerns.

Work carried out at DOE\u2019s  sites across the country involves, among other things, (1) research on  dangerous nuclear materials, such as plutonium, and (2) the handling and  disposal of radioactive and hazardous waste that, if not handled safely,  could cause nuclear accidents or expose the public and the environment  to heavy doses of radiation. DOE\u2019s sites also conduct a wide range of  other activities, including construction and routine maintenance and  operation of equipment and facilities that also run the risk of accidents,  such as those involving heavy machinery or electrical mishaps. The  consequences of such accidents could be less severe than those  involving nuclear materials, but they could also lead to long-term  illnesses, injuries, or even deaths among workers.", "DOE relies on contractors and subcontractors to perform day-to-day  operations at most of its nuclear and nonnuclear facilities located at  approximately 40 sites across the country. To help ensure safety at  these sites, the department requires its contractors to adhere to federal  safety laws; departmental regulations; and DOE requirements that are  provided in the department\u2019s system of directives\u2014including DOE\u2019s  policies, orders, guides, and manuals. Among other things, DOE  directives address the safe operation of nuclear facilities as well as  worker safety.

For example, the  Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Safety Board)\u2014an independent  executive branch agency created by Congress to independently assess  safety conditions and operations at defense nuclear facilities at DOE\u2019s  sites\u2014has held 11 public hearings over the past 10 years to address  concerns about DOE\u2019s safety practices. Additionally, in January 2005, the  director of DOE\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suspended all  programmatic work at the laboratory\u2019s plutonium-handling facility, largely  because of numerous unresolved safety issues and a failure to address  these issues adequately. Moreover, in October 2007, we reported that  nearly 60 serious accidents or near misses had occurred at DOE\u2019s  nuclear weapons laboratories since 2000. For instance, at DOE\u2019s Los  Alamos National Laboratory in July 2004, an undergraduate student who  was not wearing required eye protection was partially blinded in a laser  accident. Accidents such as this one and nuclear safety violations  focused attention on needed improvements in safety performance across  DOE\u2019s sites.", "In March 2010, the Deputy Secretary of Energy announced a new effort\u2014 the 2010 Safety and Security Reform Plan (reform effort)\u2014to revise  DOE\u2019s safety and security directives and reform its oversight approach to  \u201cprovide contractors with the flexibility to tailor and implement safety and  security programs without excessive federal oversight or overly  prescriptive departmental requirements\u201d while \u201cmaintaining the highest  standards of safe and secure operations\u201d at DOE\u2019s sites.

Our objectives were to examine (1) how  DOE revised safety directives under its reform effort, (2) the costs of the  reform effort and the benefits DOE hoped to achieve, and (3) the extent to  which DOE\u2019s reform effort addresses safety concerns we and others have  identified.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed documents on DOE\u2019s reform effort,  including the overall strategy and implementation plan for the reform  effort. DOE\u2019s reform effort addresses directives both in the safety and  security areas. This report focuses on safety, including nuclear safety,  worker safety, quality assurance, oversight, and operating experience.  We interviewed DOE officials at DOE headquarters in the Office of  Health, Safety, and Security and in the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), a semiautonomous agency within the department  that is responsible for, among other things, the management and security  of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs. To gain an understanding of  the potential impact of the reform effort on DOE\u2019s sites, we visited sites  that were in various stages of implementing revised safety requirements.  These sites were the Kansas City Plant in Missouri, the Nevada National  Security Site in Nevada, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in  California, and the Hanford Site in Washington state. We interviewed  both DOE and contractor officials at these sites. We also reviewed  documents relating to safety performance measures, efforts to address  safety problems, and oversight. We interviewed officials at other  governmental agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC), which licenses and regulates commercial nuclear power plants,  and the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Occupational Health and Safety  (OSHA), which generally regulates worker safety and commercial  industrial facilities. We also interviewed officials with the Safety Board to  gain an understanding of the process of changing regulatory safety  requirements. In addition, we interviewed officials from the American  Society of Industrial Standards, an industry standards-making  organization, to determine how industry standards are developed. To gain  an understanding of DOE\u2019s long-standing safety problems, we reviewed  51 reports from the past 10 years by GAO, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, and the Safety Board.

This oversight has three main  components. First, DOE\u2019s program offices\u2014such as DOE\u2019s Office of  Environmental Management and NNSA\u2014have primary responsibility to  safely carry out their program missions. Second, the site offices oversee  the contractors that manage and operate DOE\u2019s sites. DOE\u2019s contractors  are responsible for safely designing, constructing, and operating the  facilities at these sites that they use to carry out their work. Third, DOE\u2019s  Office of Health, Safety, and Security is responsible for, among other  things, the development of safety policy and conducting independent  oversight of compliance with DOE\u2019s safety regulations and directives, and  enforcement activities. Within DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and  Security, the Office of Independent Oversight conducts periodic  appraisals of the environment, safety, and health programs at DOE\u2019s sites  to determine if DOE officials and contractors are complying with DOE\u2019s  safety regulations and directives.", "DOE also receives safety assessments and recommendations from other  organizations, most prominently the Safety Board. The Safety Board  provides independent safety oversight of DOE\u2019s defense nuclear facilities,  which are located at 13 DOE sites across the United States. The Safety  Board has broad oversight responsibilities at defense nuclear facilities  located at DOE\u2019s sites and seeks to use informal interactions with DOE to  resolve safety issues that are of concern to the Safety Board. However,  the Safety Board also uses formal communications, such as  recommendations, to address more substantial safety issues at a facility  or site as well as broader safety issues across DOE\u2019s sites. Other  organizations that provide assessments to DOE on the management of its  sites include DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the National Academy of  Sciences, and GAO.", "In March 2010, the Deputy Secretary of Energy issued a memorandum  that announced a reform effort aimed at revising DOE\u2019s 80 safety-related  directives and the department\u2019s approach to regulating and overseeing  safety at its sites. In announcing the reform effort, the Deputy Secretary  noted that it was aimed at (1) providing increased recognition of program  management\u2019s responsibility for safety, (2) reviewing opportunities to  streamline safety requirements, and (3) eliminating safety directives that  do not add value. The reform effort was intended to provide contractors  with the flexibility to tailor and implement safety programs without  excessive federal oversight or overly prescriptive departmental  requirements, while also maintaining safety at DOE\u2019s sites. Key elements  of the reform effort included reviewing the department\u2019s safety directives  to (1) clarify and streamline wording in them; (2) increase the use of  external (non-DOE) standards, such as industry standards and those  from other regulatory agencies; (3) focus oversight activities on high-risk  activities and contractors with poor safety records; and (4) provide more  reliance on contractor systems that reliably measure the effectiveness of  their safety management systems and ability to implement effective  corrective actions.", "DOE\u2019s reform effort mirrors another reform effort underway at NNSA.  Known as \u201cgovernance transformation,\u201d NNSA\u2019s effort involves revising  the agency\u2019s business model to, among other things: more clearly establish roles of federal oversight staff and contractors; place more reliance on contractor\u2019s self-oversight through its  contractor assurance systems to ensure such things as safety  performance; allow contractors to tailor safety and other requirements to their work  without overly prescriptive DOE requirements; and promote the use of national and international standards as  appropriate, rather than departmentally unique requirements.", "NNSA\u2019s Kansas City Plant has completed implementation of this new  model, and other NNSA sites\u2014such as the Nevada National Security Site  in Nevada and Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge,  Tennessee\u2014are currently implementing the changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Reform Effort Streamlined Directives, but Views on the Revisions Were Not Sought from the Public or Federal Agencies Other than the Safety Board", "paragraphs": ["Under its reform effort, DOE reduced the number of safety directives by  eliminating or combining, among other things, requirements it determined  were unclear, duplicative, or too prescriptive; allowing contractors  additional flexibility; and encouraging the use of industry standards.

When deciding whether to keep, revise, or  eliminate a safety directive, DOE identified a justification for the  directive\u2014that is, why the directive was first established and what it  should accomplish. For example, DOE\u2019s safety directive requiring the  development of a departmentwide system to collect, communicate, and  evaluate lessons learned about operating nuclear and other facilities was  established in 2006 in response to, among other things, the 2003  explosion of the Space Shuttle Columbia where inadequate collecting and  sharing of operating lessons learned was found to have contributed to the  accident. According to DOE documents, the department determined that  it would not eliminate this directive because it helped establish good work  practices and enabled the sharing of information across DOE\u2019s sites. In  contrast, DOE eliminated its policy directive on recruiting and training  federal employees that ensured the employees had sufficient technical  knowledge of safety issues. This directive was established in 1998 to  provide departmental expectations for maintaining sufficient federal  technical safety capability. In undertaking its reform effort, DOE  concluded this policy had served its purpose and was no longer needed  as a stand-alone directive because a companion directive implementing  the requirements for recruiting and training staff to safely carry out work  was sufficient.", "If DOE decided to retain rather than eliminate an entire safety directive,  DOE officials undertook a line-by-line examination of the specific  requirements contained within the directive. This examination was  intended to determine whether revisions to the requirements were  necessary to make them more easily understandable and to eliminate  confusion arising from having similar requirements in multiple directives.  As mentioned, the examination included determining why each  requirement was initially established. For example, some specific  requirements in a DOE directive may have been the result of  recommendations from the Safety Board or the result of a long-standing  DOE or industry practice. Establishing the reason why a requirement was  initially created assisted the DOE officials who were undertaking the line- by-line examination to determine whether revisions were necessary.", "Within the safety directives that DOE retained, DOE eliminated some  requirements that department officials determined were unclear,  duplicative, or too prescriptive. In particular, DOE removed requirements  that it determined already existed in other safety directives or regulations.  In its quality assurance directive, for example, DOE deleted 61 of 245  requirements for a corrective action program because it determined that  the requirements were adequately addressed in revisions to other  directives on oversight practices. DOE also eliminated requirements that  it identified as being too prescriptive. For example, in revising its oversight  directives, DOE modified requirements that defined specific components  that a contractor\u2019s oversight system must have. DOE revised the  requirements to allow contractors the flexibility to develop their own  oversight systems, as long as those oversight systems could generally  provide assurance that work was being performed safely.", "DOE also revised directives to promote greater use of industry standards.  For example, DOE modified its quality assurance directive to require its  contractors to follow industry standards\u2014or its equivalent\u2014for nuclear  facility quality assurance that were developed by the American Society of  Mechanical Engineers.", "In addition, DOE revised directives to refocus federal oversight on the  performance of high-risk activities and placed greater responsibility on  contractors to oversee lower-risk activities. For example, DOE revised a  directive detailing how accident investigations should be carried out by  eliminating one of two categories under which a federally led accident  investigation would take place. Under the revision, a federal investigation  would be initiated using some, but not all, of the criteria previously  established under the two categories. Accidents not meeting these  criteria, including some that would have initiated federal accident  investigations, are the responsibility of the contractors themselves to  investigate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Obtained Views on Proposed Changes from DOE and Contractor Staff and from the Safety Board, but Did Not Seek the Views of the Public or Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As part of its process to revise its directives, DOE obtained comments  from federal and contractor officials on proposed revisions.

In the study,  however, the laboratory managers did not provide specific examples  of burdensome safety requirements or criteria that could be used for  making a determination of what is burdensome.

The official  also could not provide an explanation of how burdensome  requirements affected productivity or costs or how changes to them  would be an improvement.", "In response to the concerns of several senior contractor and federal  staff in NNSA that DOE\u2019s nuclear safety requirements may be  burdensome or overly prescriptive, NNSA launched a study to  determine the strength of these concerns. In April 2011, as a result of  the study, NNSA reported that the original requirements did not place  an undue burden on the contractors. The study found that senior  contractor managers considered that DOE nuclear safety  requirements provided a sound framework to safely operate nuclear  facilities. These managers noted, however, that DOE had not clearly  communicated its safety requirements, which resulted in uneven  implementation of these requirements across NNSA\u2019s sites.", "In terms of productivity, DOE officials indicated that productivity  improvements from reducing burdensome requirements will be achieved.  For example, several senior DOE officials told us that increases in  productivity would result from raising the threshold at which a nuclear  facility, such as a facility treating radioactive waste, would be required to  undergo a rigorous review process before starting up to ensure it will  operate safely. This review process involves federal staff review of a  contractor\u2019s detailed set of facility startup procedures, contractor  preparation of a detailed plan to correct any deficiencies found during that  review, and preparation of a detailed report indicating how any  deficiencies were resolved. This rigorous review was previously required  whenever any facility\u2019s operations were restarted, even after routine  maintenance. Under the reform effort, this level of review is now only  required for facilities and activities posing a higher risk, such as starting  up a newly constructed nuclear facility, and not required for facilities and  activities posing lesser risk, such as restarting facilities after routine  maintenance. According to two officials from DOE\u2019s Office of Health,  Safety, and Security, the revised requirement will help free up federal  resources to focus on higher-risk activities, such as the startup of a newly  constructed nuclear waste processing facility, instead of lower-risk  activities, which are the responsibility of the contractor to manage safely.", "DOE did not analyze the costs of the original requirements or attempt to  quantify how revising or eliminating requirements would reduce costs.  DOE officials told us that cost savings are expected as a result of having  a more streamlined, clear, and nonduplicative set of requirements.  However, according to DOE officials, the department had not developed  estimates of the cost savings it expected. According to DOE\u2019s Associate  Deputy Secretary, the department has launched an initial study of  selected directives to determine how changes to these directives have  impacted mission work, schedule, and costs, among other things.", "Moreover, it is not clear whether the reform\u2019s benefits will exceed the  costs of implementing the revised directives, as DOE\u2019s reform effort is  likely to add costs in the short term. Specifically, several officials at DOE\u2019s  Hanford Site told us that contractors will have to perform cost-impact  analyses prior to implementing the revised directives in their contracts.

For example, the goal of reducing costs does not specify those safety  areas where DOE believes savings can be achieved. Moreover,  because the goals are so general, DOE site office and contractor  officials expressed concern about the lack of effective communication  about what the reform effort is trying to achieve. For example, some  NNSA officials at the Nevada National Security Site told us that the  goals of the reform effort are unclear. Without clear goals that are  objective, measurable, and effectively communicated to its sites, DOE  will find it difficult to fully assess whether the reform effort is making  progress toward achieving its intended results.", "Implementation strategy. DOE developed a near-term implementation  strategy for its reform effort\u2014which included how safety directives  would be revised\u2014but did not develop a long-term strategy on how  those revised directives would be implemented. For near-term  implementation, DOE developed a project management plan, which  focuses on the process to revise the directives but not on how to  implement most of them. In the plan, DOE identifies priority actions  and milestones to be achieved; establishes a process for the  directives reform; and assigns responsibility for leading and managing  the directives reform to DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and Security.  DOE\u2019s implementation strategy, however, did not provide further  information on how these changes would be implemented over the  long term at DOE\u2019s sites. According to DOE officials, it is up to each  program office within DOE to determine how best to implement the  revised directives. DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and Security,  however, has developed an implementation strategy for changing its  approach to independent oversight that details how these changes will  be implemented at DOE\u2019s sites.", "Outcome measures. DOE has not developed results-oriented  outcome measures for productivity, cost, or safety under its reform  effort. Instead, DOE\u2019s reform effort has focused on output-oriented  measures, such as the number of directives cancelled or revised, and  not on outcome measures, such as specific improvements in  productivity or cost savings. DOE indicated that the reform is  expected to result in more than a 50 percent reduction in the number  of directives but has not explained how this reduction will improve  productivity, reduce costs, or maintain or improve safety. DOE\u2019s focus  on output-oriented measures such as the number of directives  reduced does not align with its own guidance on performance  measures. DOE\u2019s guidance states that there is a danger when  performance measures become numerical quotas because the setting  of numerical goals and quotas does nothing to accomplish process  improvements. For safety performance, DOE has measures that it uses to monitor safety problems at its sites. However, according to  DOE officials, the department has not developed a plan showing how  it could use these measures, if at all, to evaluate the benefits of its  reform effort.", "Effectiveness evaluation. DOE did not develop a strategy for  evaluating the effectiveness of its reform effort and therefore is not  collecting the results-oriented performance data necessary to identify  benefits achieved or areas where further changes are needed. To  date, DOE officials have only provided anecdotes on the benefits the  reform is expected to achieve. For example, in response to written  questions we provided to the department, DOE\u2019s Office of Health,  Safety, and Security stated that it expects measurable productivity  improvements because it significantly streamlined the requirements  for contractor oversight systems, which provide information on safety  performance and other management issues. Some officials at DOE  sites we visited, however, stated that DOE\u2019s reform effort may not  produce any productivity or safety improvements and may have little  impact on the way they conduct their work. For instance, DOE and  contractor officials at DOE\u2019s Hanford Site told us that, while they are  still working on implementing the revised directives at their site, they  have neither seen any changes in project safety performance, nor do  they expect to see any changes in the future as a result of the reform  effort. Additionally, as discussed previously, DOE has launched an  initial study of selected directives to determine how changes to these  directives have impacted mission work, schedule, and costs, among  other things.

Specifically:  In its revised directive, DOE clarified responsibilities to help ensure  that contractors at facilities without nuclear materials at DOE\u2019s sites  are better aware that they can tailor implementation of their quality  assurance programs to their nonnuclear needs. According to DOE  officials, because problems at nonnuclear facilities may pose different  levels of risk than those at nuclear facilities, quality assurance  programs can be more flexible at DOE\u2019s nonnuclear facilities and  sites.", "To support the reform effort\u2019s goal of greater use of industry safety  quality assurance standards, the revised directive includes a new  requirement for contractors overseeing high-hazard nuclear facilities  to use a uniform version of a quality assurance standard developed by  the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Previously, some  sites were using different versions of the standard. As a result,  according to DOE documents we reviewed, assessments of the  quality assurance practices at DOE\u2019s sites sometimes resulted in  citations that did not concern safety issues but rather arose from  differences in the way that the different versions of the quality  assurance standard were written. By eliminating the use of multiple  versions of the quality assurance standard, DOE believes it can save  time and costs when doing assessments.", "The revised quality assurance directive now helps to clarify quality  assurance requirements for DOE\u2019s safety software, which is  consistent with commitments DOE made in response to the Safety  Board\u2019s September 2002 recommendation to improve the quality of  DOE\u2019s safety software and our February 2011 recommendation to  clarify specific quality assurance requirements for computer models  used in environmental cleanup decisions. DOE expects this  clarification to improve the performance of software used on safety- related systems, according to DOE documentation we reviewed.", "These revisions appear to have strengthened the directive, but it is not  yet clear if they will fully address quality assurance problems, some of  which continue. For example, DOE\u2019s Office of Enforcement identified  quality assurance problems following a June 2010 incident during which a  worker was exposed to radiation after puncturing his hand with a sharp  object contaminated with plutonium at DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site. As a  result, in July 2011, this office proposed a fine of $243,750 against the  contractor. Furthermore, in June 2011, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General  reported that both the Livermore Site Office and the laboratory\u2019s  contractor lacked adequate quality assurance processes to ensure that  corrective actions were effective. Inspector General recommended that the site office perform more timely  inspections to verify that corrective actions had been instituted prior to  closing the finding that led to the corrective actions. In addition, at a  nuclear facility at NNSA\u2019s Nevada National Security Site, NNSA found in  August 2011 that the contractor had not effectively identified, controlled,  or prevented the recurrence of quality assurance problems related to the  installation and inspection of fire safety and other components in nuclear  testing facilities, as required in nuclear safety regulations, and proposed a  nearly $180,000 fine against the contractor.", "DOE, Office of Inspector General, Implementation of Beryllium Controls at Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory, DOE/IG-0851 (Washington, D.C.: June 17, 2011)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Revisions to Its Directives Were Intended to Strengthen Its Safety Culture, but the Safety Board Raised Concerns That Less Vigorous Safety Practices Could Result", "paragraphs": ["A strong safety culture includes the quality that health and safety are  integrated into all work decisions so that workers and managers are  better aware of and better implement safety practices, which helps to  minimize accidents. DOE defines safety culture as an organization\u2019s  values and behaviors modeled by leadership and practiced by employees  to strive to make the safe performance of work a priority. To promote a  strong safety culture at its sites, DOE has federal regulations and a set  of directives\u2014collectively known as Integrated Safety Management\u2014for  implementing the department\u2019s key safety management practices. These  directives lay out high-level expectations and implementing methods for  safety management and include several guides and manuals with  suggested methods for implementing safety management practices.  Many of these directives resulted from DOE\u2019s response to October 1995  and September 1998 recommendations by the Safety Board to establish  clear and systematic processes for addressing and resolving safety  issues and to establish clear lines of responsibility for safety.", "Nevertheless, DOE has experienced problems maintaining an effective  safety culture at some of its sites, as we, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, and the Safety Board have repeatedly reported. Problems have  included not following required safety practices, inadequate testing of key  nuclear waste processing systems to ensure they operate safely, and not  developing safety strategies for extremely hazardous events. For  example, in October 2007, we identified weaknesses in the safety culture  at DOE\u2019s three nuclear research laboratories, and recommended that  DOE strengthen safety management at its weapons laboratories and  ensure that safety improvements are carried out in a systematic  manner. DOE generally agreed with our recommendations, but it noted that, in the department\u2019s view, the safety management systems DOE had  in place adequately addressed safety culture issues and, as a result, the  department took no further action to address those recommendations. In  addition, in September 2009, DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported  that fire fighters who respond to incidents at Los Alamos were not  provided with enough opportunity to tour and become familiar with the  site, which would impede response time in an emergency. Furthermore,  in October 2009, the Safety Board reported that Los Alamos lacked a  safety strategy to minimize the potential consequences of earthquakes to  stored nuclear material and recommended actions to mitigate these  potential consequences.", "Under its reform effort, DOE revised its Integrated Safety Management  directives to attempt to strengthen the safety culture at its sites. For  example, DOE\u2019s revisions more clearly emphasized DOE and contractor  senior management roles and responsibilities for building a strong safety  culture at DOE\u2019s sites. Specifically, the new directives lay out tasks that  each level of management should complete, such as developing and  maintaining safety documents, approving site office safety initiatives, and  establishing safety expectations across DOE\u2019s sites. These revisions  address past issues, such as lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities for  ensuring safety practices at DOE\u2019s sites. In addition, DOE has  undertaken several efforts aimed at improving safety practices across its  sites. For example, the department has worked closely with a contractor  group\u2014Energy Facilities Contractors Group\u2014to issue guidance on  assessing and strengthening safety culture. In addition, DOE issued a  new Integrated Safety Management guide in September 2011 to provide  additional and extensive information to assist the programs in  implementing integrated safety management requirements. Finally, in  2011, DOE established its Nuclear Safety and Security Council, which  advises the department\u2019s senior management on nuclear safety issues  with the aim to improve safety performance.", "However, some revisions DOE made to its Integrated Safety  Management directives raised concerns with Safety Board officials that  safety culture may be undermined. For example:", "When it revised its Integrated Safety Management directives, DOE  removed language that required contractors to follow the directives  and instead revised the directives to apply only to federal employees.  This is because contractors already had to comply with the  department\u2019s acquisition regulations, which the Safety Board noted  contain similar but less detailed requirements. According to Safety  Board officials, because the acquisition regulation does not contain  the specificity of the Integrated Safety Management directives,  contractors may not implement the requirements as vigorously as they  would if they had to follow the more specific practices in the original  directives.", "Because DOE removed language for contractors to follow the  department\u2019s Integrated Safety Management directives, contractors  will no longer need to consider best practices for implementing a  safety culture based on lessons learned over the years that are  integrated into the directives. Specifically, Safety Board officials stated  that they are concerned that contractors will therefore overlook these  lessons learned since the contractors are no longer required to follow  the Integrated Safety Management directives.", "It is also not clear how revisions to DOE\u2019s Integrated Safety Management  directives will affect safety culture problems that persist at DOE\u2019s sites.  For example, in June 2011, the Safety Board reported that workers at  DOE\u2019s Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at its Hanford Site  hesitated to raise safety concerns for fear of management reprisal and  recommended that the Secretary of Energy act to ensure a strong safety  culture at the site. DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and Security has also  recently reported on continuing safety culture problems at the Waste  Treatment and Immobilization Plant. Furthermore, DOE\u2019s Office of  Enforcement issued a notice of violation in September 2011 to the  contractor at DOE\u2019s Separations Process Research Unit site in  Niskayuna, New York, after a building demolition accident potentially  exposed at least 100 employees to low-level radioactive contamination in  September 2010. DOE\u2019s Office of Enforcement found that the accident  was tied to the contractor\u2019s failure to consistently use safe work practices  at the site and management\u2019s failure to assess work processes to ensure  a safe working environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Clarified Roles and Responsibilities for Its Oversight of Contractor Activities, but Its Reform May Result in Weakened Federal Oversight", "paragraphs": ["We and others have reported on DOE\u2019s problems overseeing contractors\u2019  performance.

For example:", "DOE has placed greater emphasis on having its Office of Independent  Oversight staff review safety design documents, which lay out the  safety systems for facilities at DOE\u2019s sites, before their construction.  Our October 2008 report noted that lack of oversight meant that these  documents did not receive an independent review and therefore the  safe operation of newly constructed facilities at DOE\u2019s sites could not  be reasonably assured. In response to our recommendations and  under its reform effort, DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight staff  now review the safety design documents before the facility is  constructed, rather than after it is built, and when the facility  undergoes major modification.", "DOE implemented a new approach to oversight that designates  headquarters staff responsibility for oversight at key sites, such as  DOE\u2019s Hanford and Savannah River sites and its Idaho National  Laboratory. These \u201csite leads\u201d monitor and assess all aspects of a  site\u2019s operations in order to assist the Office of Independent Oversight  in planning assessment activities. According to Office of Independent  Oversight officials, under the site lead approach, oversight staff now  visit a site several times per year rather than approximately once  every 3 years under the previous approach. These officials said that  they believe this change will result in more frequent reviews at these  key sites, enabling them to catch potential safety problems earlier.", "However, some of the revisions DOE made to its oversight directives  under its reform effort raise concerns about the department\u2019s ability to  effectively execute independent oversight. According to DOE\u2019s  independent oversight directive, independent oversight is an integral part  of DOE\u2019s ability to help ensure the effectiveness of DOE and contractor  safety performance. However, some of DOE\u2019s revisions place  accountability for key oversight functions with the site offices and  contractors, which may reduce confidence in an independent oversight  process. For example:", "DOE revised its oversight approach to give site office, rather than  Office of Independent Oversight staff, increased responsibility for  managing actions to correct problems raised in independent  assessments. Previously, issues identified during Independent  Oversight assessments had to be addressed with a formal corrective  action plan submitted to and tracked by the Office of Independent  Oversight. Under the reform, site offices have responsibility for  determining which issues will be formally addressed and monitored,  and which problems are dealt with without the need for a formal plan.  According to some Office of Independent Oversight officials, under  this revised approach, independent oversight staff try to limit the  concerns raised during assessments to higher priority issues in order  to better ensure these receive site management attention. Site office  determinations of whether issues required more formal contractor  responses may be influenced by the fact that the site offices also have  responsibility for keeping costs under control and work on schedule.", "In giving greater responsibility to the site offices, DOE has allowed  them to use staff from the Office of Independent Oversight to help  assess contractor performance. In addition, Office of Independent  Oversight staff must now coordinate their assessment activities with  site office management in order to maximize the use of resources.", "This potentially raises concerns about whether Office of Independent  Oversight staff will be sufficiently independent from site office  management. Furthermore, Safety Board officials told us that the  coordination requirement could reduce the effectiveness of Office of  Independent Oversight assessments because surprise \u201cdrop-in\u201d  assessments would be lost, allowing site office and contractor staff to  prepare ahead of the assessment. We have raised similar concerns in  the past regarding the independence of DOE\u2019s oversight, including  concerns that the department\u2019s focus on providing program offices a  greater role in overseeing contractor oversight resulted in weakening  independent review.", "Even after DOE\u2019s oversight directives were revised, effective oversight of  contractor activities continues to be a problem for DOE.

In September 2011, DOE\u2019s Office of Enforcement proposed a fine of $412,500 against  the Separations Process Research Unit contractor in Niskayuna, New  York, due, in part, to oversight inadequacies during the September 2010  accident discussed earlier in this report. Moreover, the Office of  Enforcement proposed a $150,000 fine in early October 2011 against the  Idaho National Laboratory contractor, in part, because of inadequate  management oversight that resulted in the tipping over of a hoisting rig  loaded with 7,800 pounds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s reform effort was driven by a belief that some requirements in its  safety directives have placed excessive burdens on its contractors and  that revisions would give contractors more flexibility in operating safely.

If high levels of safety could be assured at DOE\u2019s sites while  unnecessary requirements were eliminated, then DOE\u2019s reform effort  would be considered a success. However, DOE did not first determine  whether the directives it planned to revise were indeed burdensome or  costly. DOE also does not have results-oriented outcome measures to  help the department gauge the effectiveness of its effort. Simply counting  the number of directives revised or eliminated does not indicate the  benefit of the reform on productivity and safety performance at DOE\u2019s  sites. Safety should not be measured by the amount of paper that is  saved but by actual improvements in safety performance across the  department.", "Before embarking on management reforms, high-performing  organizations (1) set clear goals, (2) develop an implementation strategy  that sets milestones and establishes responsibility, (3) establish results- oriented outcome measures, and (4) use results-oriented data to evaluate  the reform\u2019s effectiveness and make additional changes where needed.  However, DOE did not fully follow these practices to assess the costs and  benefits of revising its safety directives. Furthermore, our discussions with  DOE and contractor officials at DOE\u2019s sites indicate that there is some  question about the benefits the reform effort can actually achieve. It is  also unclear how revising safety directives will address past and recurring  safety concerns with quality assurance, safety culture, and federal  oversight of contractor activities that we and others have identified over  the years. Many of the directives DOE revised were originally developed  to correct problems in these areas. In revising these directives, DOE  could be undermining hard-won progress over the years in safety  performance at its sites. DOE has not effectively communicated with its  site officials or its contractors about the overall goals of the reform effort,  how progress will be measured, and whether benefits of the reform will  exceed the costs involved with revising directives. In addition, changes to  DOE\u2019s oversight directives raise concerns about the ability of DOE\u2019s  Office of Independent Oversight staff to provide a critical review of safety  at DOE\u2019s sites that is independent from DOE site office and contractor  staff, a concern we have raised in the past.

We agree with DOE and, as our draft report noted,  the elimination of potentially burdensome, duplicative, and costly  requirements that offer little or no contribution to improved safety is a  worthy goal. Our draft report also clearly described the process DOE  followed and the involvement of its employees; contractors; and  stakeholders, such as the Safety Board. However, in our view, it is not  possible to identify impediments and work to mitigate them without first  determining whether and how existing requirements are burdensome. As  our draft report stated, an April 2011 NNSA study found that DOE\u2019s  nuclear safety requirements did not place an undue burden on the  contractors. Instead, NNSA reported that these requirements provided a  sound framework to safely operate nuclear facilities. Officials we spoke  with at some of DOE\u2019s sites also told us that they lacked sufficient data to  determine whether the safety requirements the department was revising  were burdensome.

Two  analysts independently reviewed the report recommendations and coded  them into the three categories. In cases where differences between the  two reviewers regarding the coding of the recommendations into these  safety-related categories were found, all differences were resolved  through reviewer discussion.

However, we did note that officials at  NRC and OSHA\u2014federal agencies with significant experience in  nuclear and worker safety, respectively\u2014told us that obtaining a wide  range of comments on proposed revisions can be very helpful in  developing quality requirements that balance cost with benefits and  assist them to build support for the changes. We revised our report to  further emphasize that DOE is not required to obtain public comments  when making changes to its internal directives. However, we maintain  that obtaining a wide range of comments from a variety of  stakeholders is beneficial.  4.  DOE agrees that it did not conduct an analysis of the costs and  benefits of its requirements prior to revising them, stating that such an  approach would be inconsistent with the department\u2019s approach to  safety and to its management principles. In our view, DOE\u2019s  comments indicate that the department\u2019s priority when revising its  directives was to act quickly rather than to use the key practices of  high-performing organizations when undertaking management  improvement initiatives. As our draft report noted, high-performing  organizations set clearly defined goals that are targeted levels of  performance, expressed as tangible, measurable objectives against  which achievement can be compared. DOE did not do this\u2014as DOE  itself notes in its comments\u2014opting for speed instead of  effectiveness. We maintain, as our draft report noted, that simply  counting the number of directives revised or eliminated does not  indicate the benefit of the reform on productivity and safety  performance at DOE\u2019s sites and that safety should not be measured  by the amount of paper that is saved but by actual improvements in  safety performance. In our view, when it comes to rigorous safety  requirements, the speed of a reform effort is far less important than  the effectiveness of the reform.  5.  DOE states that its safety reform resulted in more concise safety  directives with requirements that are clearer and add value in  protecting its workers and the public, and that the results are  consistent with the goals established by the Deputy Secretary for the  safety reform effort. As our draft report noted, however, one of the  goals expressed by the Deputy Secretary in his March 2010  memorandum announcing the reform effort was that \u201cmeasurable  productivity improvements\u201d would result from reducing burdensome  safety requirements. Because DOE made no attempt to determine  whether these requirements were burdensome\u2014which DOE itself  acknowledges in its comments (see comment 4)\u2014and has no  outcome-oriented metrics to assess the performance of the safety  reform effort, there is no way for the department to demonstrate that  measurable productivity improvements will result from its revisions to  its safety directives.  6.  DOE\u2019s comment that it does not measure success by the number of  directives eliminated is not supported by the evidence. For example,  the Deputy Secretary\u2019s March 2010 memorandum announcing the  reform effort stated that the reform was expected to result in more  than a 50 percent reduction in the number of directives. Furthermore,  in numerous meetings, DOE officials cited examples of the  accomplishments of the safety reform effort. In particular, during a  November 2011 meeting, the Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy  provided us with a copy of DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2011 \u201cManagement and  Operational Excellence Performance Results\u201d that cited the  elimination of more than 1,650 pages from DOE directives, the  cancellation of 22 directives, and the revision of 26 other directives as  an accomplishment of the reform effort.  7.  Our draft report did not assert that inadequate directive requirements  caused a variety of performance weakness at DOE sites over the last  several years. Our point was not that inadequate safety directives  caused these weaknesses, but that DOE\u2019s revisions to these  directives did not correct these weaknesses. We agree with DOE that  safety performance problems are often not related to deficiencies in  requirements, but rather in the implementation of the requirements. In  our view, this increases the importance of ensuring directives are  adequately implemented rather than spending inordinate time and  staff energy revising those directives to eliminate \u201cburdens\u201d that have  not been clearly defined.  8.  DOE is correct that safety management and safety culture are  different, but related, concepts. Nevertheless, as DOE itself  acknowledges in its comments, the department has used the revisions  to its Integrated Safety Management directives as one means to  further clarify and strengthen expectations and requirements for safety  culture. For example, our draft report stated DOE revised its  Integrated Safety Management directives to, among other things,  attempt to strengthen safety culture at its sites by more clearly  emphasizing DOE and contractor senior management roles and  responsibilities for building a strong safety culture at DOE\u2019s sites.  Nevertheless, as our draft report noted, Safety Board officials raised  concerns that some of these changes\u2014in particular the removal of  language that required contractors to follow the directives and  allowing them to follow similar but less detailed requirements in DOE\u2019s  acquisition regulations\u2014could weaken safety culture at DOE\u2019s sites.  However, to address DOE\u2019s concerns that the report does not  adequately acknowledge the department\u2019s efforts to improve safety  culture, we revised the report to add additional examples of recent  DOE safety culture improvement initiatives.  9.  DOE stated that it has been the department\u2019s long-standing practice  to coordinate oversight activities with line organizations to ensure  adequate planning and that this coordination is not a change from  previous order expectations. However, the revised order states that  \u201cIndependent Oversight appraisal activities must be coordinated with  affected DOE line management and staff offices to promote efficient  and effective use of resources.\u201d The previous order that the revised  order replaced did not contain similar language. The previous order  only required coordination between its oversight activities and DOE\u2019s  sites on the development of corrective actions to any deficiencies  found. Although both orders note that independent oversight  activities must be independent of all DOE elements that have line  management responsibilities for safety and security programs, Safety  Board officials with whom we spoke stated that they were concerned  that this revision would result in surprise \u201cdrop-in\u201d assessments being  lost, allowing site office and contractor staff to prepare ahead of the  assessment.  10. We revised the report to discuss the establishment of the Nuclear  Safety and Security Council.  11. As DOE itself acknowledges in its comments (see comment 4), the  department did not analyze the costs and benefits of its requirements  prior to revising them. Therefore, we maintain that the draft report\u2019s  title is accurate.  12. Our draft report discussed in detail the process DOE followed in  revising its directives, including the line-by-line review of each safety  directive and its consultations with Safety Board staff, and we  therefore made no changes to the report in response to this comment.  13. Our draft report noted that DOE has measures that it uses to monitor  safety problems at its sites. However, the department has not been  able to demonstrate how it could use these measures, if at all, to  evaluate the benefits of its reform effort, nor has it developed other  outcome-based metrics that could also be used. In our view, this is  not consistent with one of the Deputy Secretary\u2019s goals for the reform  effort\u2014namely, that measurable improvements in productivity would  result from the elimination of burdensome requirements while  maintaining safety. Because DOE never defined \u201cburdensome\u201d  through an analysis of costs and benefits and never developed  outcome-based measures of the performance of the safety reform  effort, we are left with merely DOE\u2019s assurances that improved  productivity and safety performance will result rather than objective  and verifiable data that could adequately demonstrate improvement.  14.
