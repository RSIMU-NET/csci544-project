EAC began operations in January 2004. However, reported problems with electronic voting systems have led to questions about the security and reliability of these systems. GAO was requested to (1) determine the significant security and reliability concerns identified about electronic voting systems, (2) identify recommended practices relevant to ensuring the security and reliability of these systems, and (3) describe actions taken or planned to improve their security and reliability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While electronic voting systems hold promise for improving the election process, numerous entities have raised concerns about their security and reliability, citing instances of weak security controls, system design flaws, inadequate system version control, inadequate security testing, incorrect system configuration, poor security management, and vague or incomplete voting system standards. It is important to note that many of these concerns were based on specific system makes and models or a specific jurisdiction's election, and there is no consensus among election officials and other experts on their pervasiveness. Nevertheless, some have caused problems in elections and therefore merit attention. Federal organizations and nongovernmental groups have issued both election-specific recommended practices for improving the voting process and more general guidance intended to help organizations manage information systems' security and reliability. These recommended practices and guidelines (applicable throughout the voting system life cycle) include having vendors build security controls and audit trails into their systems during development, and having election officials specify security requirements when acquiring systems. Other suggested practices include testing and certifying systems against national voting system standards. The federal government has begun efforts intended to improve life cycle management of electronic voting systems and thereby improve their security and reliability. Specifically, EAC has led efforts to (1) draft changes to existing federal voluntary standards for voting systems, including provisions addressing security and reliability; (2) develop a process for certifying voting systems; (3) establish a program to accredit independent laboratories to test electronic voting systems; and (4) develop a library and clearinghouse for information on state and local elections and systems. However, these actions are unlikely to have a significant effect in the 2006 federal election cycle because important changes to the voting standards have not yet been completed, the system certification and laboratory accreditation programs are still in development, and a system software library has not been updated or improved since the 2004 election. Further, EAC has not consistently defined specific tasks, processes, and time frames for completing these activities; as a result, it is unclear when their results will be available to assist state and local election officials."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the 2000 elections, Congress, the media, and others cited numerous  instances of problems with the election process. In light of these concerns,  we produced a series of reports in which we examined virtually every  aspect of the election process, including challenges associated with  electronic voting systems. In these reports, we emphasized the  contributions and necessary interactions of people, process, and  technology to address these challenges. Subsequently, in October 2002,  Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which authorized  funding for local and state governments to make improvements in election  administration, including upgrading antiquated voting systems. In addition,  HAVA created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to provide  support for election improvements and to administer payments to states  under the act. As states have expanded their use of electronic voting  systems, the media and others have reported problems with these systems  that have caused some to question whether they are secure and reliable.", "In view of the importance and growing role of electronic voting systems,  you asked us to (1) determine the significant security and reliability  concerns that have been identified about these voting systems; (2) identify  recommended practices relevant to ensuring the security and reliability of  such systems; and (3) describe the actions that federal agencies and other  organizations have taken, or plan to take, to improve their security and  reliability. To determine concerns and recommended practices, we  analyzed over 80 recent and relevant reports related to the security and  reliability of electronic voting systems. We focused on systems and  components associated with vote casting and counting, including those  that define electronic ballots, transmit voting results among election  locations, and manage groups of voting machines. We assessed the various  types of voting system issues reported to determine categories of concerns.  We discussed the reports, concerns, and recommended practices with  elections officials, citizen advocacy groups, and system security and testing  experts, including members of GAO\u2019s Executive Council on Information  Management and Technology. To describe actions to improve the security  and reliability of electronic voting systems, we reviewed and analyzed  pertinent documentation, such as EAC\u2019s draft voluntary voting system  guidelines (which are expected to replace the 2002 voting system  standards), and we attended public meetings and interviewed officials from  EAC, its Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC), and the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST). We also identified activities being performed by citizen advocacy  groups, academic and standards bodies, and others that are intended to  improve the security and reliability of electronic voting systems, reviewed  materials from these activities, and discussed them with representatives of  these groups.

At the federal level, Congress has authority under the Constitution to  regulate presidential and congressional elections and to enforce  prohibitions against specific discriminatory practices in all federal, state,  and local elections. Congress has passed legislation that addresses voter  registration, absentee voting, accessibility provisions for the elderly and  handicapped, and prohibitions against discriminatory practices.", "At the state level, individual states are responsible for the administration of  both federal elections and their own elections. States regulate the election  process, including, for example, the adoption of voluntary voting system  guidelines, the state certification and acceptance testing of voting systems,  ballot access, registration procedures, absentee voting requirements, the  establishment of voting places, the provision of election day workers, and  the counting and certification of the vote. In total, the U.S. election process  can be seen as an assemblage of 55 distinct election systems\u2014those of the  50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 4 U.S. territories.", "Further, although election policy and procedures are legislated primarily at  the state level, states typically have decentralized voting processes, so that  the details of administering elections are carried out at the city or county  levels, and voting is done at the local level. As we reported in 2001, local  election jurisdictions number more than 10,000, and their sizes vary  enormously\u2014from a rural county with about 200 voters to a large urban  county, such as Los Angeles County, where the total number of registered  voters for the 2000 elections exceeded the registered voter totals in 41  states.", "Administering an election is a year-round process involving the following  stages:   Voter registration. Local election officials register eligible voters and  maintain voter registration lists. This includes updating registrants\u2019  information and deleting the names of registrants who are no longer  eligible to vote.", "Absentee and early voting. Election officials design ballots and other  systems to permit eligible people to vote in person or by mail before  election day. Election officials also educate voters on how to vote by  these methods.", "Election administration and vote casting. Election officials prepare  for an election by arranging for polling places, recruiting and training  poll workers, designing ballots, and preparing and testing voting  equipment for use in casting and tabulating votes. Election day activities  include opening and closing polling places and assisting voters in  casting votes.", "Vote counting and certification. Election officials tabulate the cast  ballots, determine whether and how to count ballots that cannot be read  by the vote counting equipment, certify the final vote counts, and  perform recounts, if required.", "As shown in figure 1, each stage of an election involves people, processes,  and technology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Voting Systems Support Vote Casting and Counting", "paragraphs": ["Electronic voting systems hold promise for improving the efficiency and  accuracy of the election process by automating a manual process,  providing flexibility for accommodating voters with special needs, and  implementing controls to avoid errors by voters and election workers.", "In the United States today, most votes are cast and counted by one of two  types of electronic voting systems: optical scan systems and direct  recording electronic (DRE) systems. Such systems include the hardware,  software, and firmware used to define ballots, cast and count votes, report  or display election results, and maintain and produce audit trail  information\u2014as well as the documentation required to program, control,  and support the equipment. A description of both technologies follows.", "Optical Scan Systems. Optical scan voting systems use electronic  technology to tabulate paper ballots. Although optical scan technology has  been in use for decades for such tasks as scoring standardized tests, it was  not applied to voting until the 1980s. According to Election Data Services,  Inc., a firm specializing in election data statistics, about 31 percent of  registered voters voted on optical scan systems in the 2000 election, and  about 35 percent of registered voters voted on optical scan systems in the  2004 election.", "An optical scan system is made up of computer-readable paper ballots,  appropriate marking devices, privacy booths, and a computerized  tabulation device. The ballot, which can be of various sizes, lists the names  of the candidates and the issues. Voters record their choices using an  appropriate writing instrument to fill in boxes or ovals, or to complete an  arrow next to a candidate\u2019s name or the issue. In some states, the ballot  may include a space for write-ins to be entered directly on the ballot.", "Optical scan ballots are tabulated by optical-mark-recognition equipment  (see fig. 2), which counts the ballots by sensing or reading the marks on the  ballot. Ballots can be counted at the polling place\u2014referred to as a  precinct-count optical scan\u2014or at a central location. If ballots are counted  at the polling place, voters or election officials put the ballots into the  tabulation equipment, which tallies the votes; these tallies can be captured  in removable storage media that are transported to a central tally location,  or they can be electronically transmitted from the polling place to the  central tally location. If ballots are centrally counted, voters drop ballots  into sealed boxes and election officials transfer the sealed boxes to the  central location after the polls close, where election officials run the ballots  through the tabulation equipment in the presence of observers.", "Software instructs the tabulation equipment how to assign each vote (i.e.,  to assign valid marks on the ballot to the proper candidate or issue). In  addition to identifying the particular contests and candidates, the software  can be configured to capture, for example, straight party voting and vote- for-no-more-than-N contests. Precinct-based optical scanners can also be  programmed to detect overvotes (where the voter votes for two candidates  for one office, for example, invalidating the vote) and undervotes (where  the voter does not vote for all contests or issues on the ballot) and to take  some action in response (rejecting the ballot, for instance). In addition,  optical scan systems often use vote-tally software to tally the vote totals  from one or more vote tabulation devices.", "If election officials program precinct-based optical scan systems to detect  and reject overvotes and undervotes, voters can fix their mistakes before  leaving the polling place. However, if voters are unwilling or unable to  correct their ballots, a poll worker can manually override the program and  accept the ballot, even though it has been overvoted or undervoted. If  ballots are tabulated centrally, voters would not be able to correct any  mistakes that may have been made.", "Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Systems. First introduced in the  1970s, DREs capture votes electronically, without the use of paper ballots.  According to Election Data Services, Inc., about 12 percent of voters used  this type of technology in the 2000 elections and about 29 percent of voters  used this technology in the 2004 elections.", "DREs come in two basic models: pushbutton or touchscreen. The  pushbutton model is the older technology and is larger and heavier than the  touchscreen model (see fig. 3).", "Pushbutton and touchscreen models also differ significantly in the way  they present ballots to the voter. With the pushbutton model, all ballot  information is presented on a single \u201cfull-face\u201d ballot. For example, a ballot  may have 50 buttons on a 3- by 3-foot ballot, with a candidate or issue next  to each button. In contrast, touchscreen DREs display the ballot  information on an electronic display screen. For both pushbutton and  touchscreen models, the ballot information is programmed onto an  electronic storage medium, which is then uploaded to the machine. Both  models rely on ballot definition files to tell the voting machine software  how to display ballot information on the screen, interpret a voter's touches  on a button or screen, and record and tally those selections as votes. Local  jurisdictions can program these files before each election or outsource  their programming to a vendor. For touchscreens, ballot information can be  displayed in color and can incorporate pictures of the candidates. Because  the ballot space on a touchscreen is much smaller than on a pushbutton  machine, voters who use touchscreens must page through the ballot  information.", "Despite their differences, the two DRE models have some similarities, such  as how the voter interacts with the voting equipment. For pushbutton  models, voters press a button next to the candidate or issue, which then  lights up to indicate the selection. Similarly, voters using touchscreens  make their selections by touching the screen next to the candidate or issue,  which is then highlighted. When voters have finished making their  selections on a touchscreen or a pushbutton model, they cast their votes by  pressing a final \u201cvote\u201d button or screen. Until they hit this final button or  screen, voters can change their selections. Both models also allow voters to  write in candidates. While most DREs allow voters to type write-ins on a  keyboard, some pushbutton types require voters to write the name on  paper tape that is part of the device. Further, although these systems do not  use paper ballots, they retain permanent electronic images of all the  ballots, which can be stored on various media, including internal hard disk  drives, flash cards, or memory cartridges. According to vendors, these  ballot images can be printed and used for auditing and recounts.", "Some of the newer DREs use smart cards as a security feature. Smart cards  are plastic devices\u2014about the size of a credit card\u2014that use integrated  circuit chips to store and process data, much like a computer. These cards  are generally used as a means to open polls and to authorize voter access to  ballots. For instance, smart cards for some systems store program data on  the election and are used to help set up the equipment; during setup,  election workers verify that the card is for the proper election. Other  systems are programmed to automatically activate when the voter inserts a  smart card; the card brings up the correct ballot onto the screen. In general,  the interface with the voter is very similar to that of an automated teller  machine.", "Like optical scan devices, DREs require the use of software to program the  various ballot styles and tally the votes, which is generally done through  the use of memory cartridges or other media. The software is used to  generate ballots for each precinct in the voting jurisdiction, which includes  defining the ballot layout, identifying the contests in each precinct, and  assigning candidates to contests. The software also is used to configure any  special options, such as straight party voting and vote-for-no-more-than-N  contests. In addition, for pushbutton models, the software assigns the  buttons to particular candidates, and, for touchscreen models, the software  defines the size and location on the screen where the voter makes the  selection. Vote-tally software is often used to tally the vote totals from one  or more units.", "DRE systems offer various configurations for tallying the votes. Some  contain removable storage media that can be taken from the voting device  and transported to a central location to be tallied. Others can be configured  to electronically transmit the vote totals from the polling place to a central  tally location.", "These systems are also designed not to allow overvotes. For example, if a  voter selects a second choice in a two-way race, the first choice is  deselected. In addition to this standard feature, different types of systems  offer a variety of options, including many aimed at voters with disabilities.  In our prior work, we reported that the following features were available  on some models of DRE:  A \u201cno-vote\u201d option. If allowed by the state, this option helps avoid  unintentional undervotes. This provides the voter with the option to  select \u201cno vote\u201d (or abstain) on the display screen if the voter does not  want to vote on a particular contest or issue.", "A \u201creview\u201d feature. This feature requires voters to review each page of  the ballot before pressing the button to cast the vote.", "Visual enhancements. These features include, for example, color  highlighting of ballot choices and candidate pictures.", "Accommodations for voters with disabilities. Examples of options for  voters who are blind include Braille keyboards and audio interfaces. At  least one vendor reported that its DRE accommodates voters with  neurological disabilities by offering head movement switches and \u201csip  and puff\u201d plug-ins. Another option is voice recognition capability,  which allows voters to make selections orally.", "An option to recover spoiled ballots. This feature allows voters to recast  their votes after their original ballots are cast. For this option, every  DRE at the poll site could be connected to a local area network. A poll  official would void the original \u201cspoiled\u201d ballot through the  administrative workstation, which is also connected to the local area  network. The voter could then cast another ballot.", "An option to provide printed receipts. This option, provided by a voter- verified paper audit trail system, provides the voter with a paper  printout or ballot when the vote is cast. This feature is intended to  provide voters and/or election officials with an opportunity to check  what is printed against what is recorded and displayed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HAVA Is Expected to Enhance the Federal Role in Election Processes", "paragraphs": ["In October 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to  provide states with organizations, processes, and resources for improving  the administration of future federal elections.

In light of the recently demonstrated voting system problems; the differing  views on how widespread these problems are; and the complexity of  assuring the accuracy, integrity, confidentiality, and availability of voting  systems throughout their life cycles, the security and reliability concerns  raised in recent reports merit the focused attention of federal, state, and  local authorities responsible for election administration.", "Common concerns as well as examples of the problems identified during  recent elections are discussed in more detail below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Product Development", "paragraphs": ["Multiple recent reports, including several state-commissioned technical  reviews and security assessments, voiced concerns about the development  of secure and reliable electronic voting systems by system vendors. Three  major areas of concern are weak security controls, audit trail design flaws,  and weak security management practices.", "Weak system security controls. Some electronic voting systems provided  weak system security controls over key components (including electronic  storage for votes and ballots, remote system access equipment, and system  event and audit logs), access to the systems, and the physical system  hardware.", "Regarding key software components, several evaluations demonstrated  that election management systems did not encrypt the data files  containing cast votes (to protect them from being viewed or modified).  Evaluations also showed that, in some cases, other computer programs  could access these cast vote files and alter them without the system  recording this action in its audit logs. Two reports documented how it  might be possible to alter the ballot definition files on one model of DRE  so that the votes shown on the touch screen for one candidate would  actually be recorded and counted for a different candidate. In addition,  one of these reports found that it was possible to gain full control of a  regional vote tabulation computer\u2014including the ability to modify the  voting software\u2014via a modem connection. More recently, computer  security experts working with a local elections supervisor in Florida  demonstrated that someone with physical access to an optical scan  voting system could falsify election results without leaving any record of  this action in the system\u2019s audit logs by using altered memory cards. If  exploited, these weaknesses could damage the integrity of ballots,  votes, and voting system software by allowing unauthorized  modifications.", "Regarding access controls, many security examinations reported flaws  in how controls were implemented in some DRE systems. For  example, one model failed to password-protect the supervisor functions  controlling key system capabilities; another relied on an easily guessed  password to access these functions. In another case, the same  personal identification number was programmed into all supervisor  cards nationwide\u2014meaning that the number was likely to be widely  known. Reviewers also found that values used to encrypt election data  (called encryption keys) were defined in the source code. Several  reviews reported that smart cards (used to activate the touch screen on  DRE systems) and memory cards (used to program the terminals of  optical scan systems) were not secured by some voting systems.  Reviewers exploited this weakness by altering such cards and using  them to improperly access administrator functions, vote multiple times,  change vote totals, and produce false election reports in a test  environment. Some election officials and security experts felt that  physical and procedural controls would detect anyone attempting to  vote multiple times during an actual election. Nevertheless, in the  event of lax supervision, the privileges available through these access  control flaws could allow unauthorized personnel to disrupt operations  or modify data and programs that are crucial to the accuracy and  integrity of the voting process.", "Regarding physical hardware controls, several recent reports found that  many of the DRE models under examination contained weaknesses in  controls designed to protect the system. For instance, one report noted  that all the locks on a particular DRE model were easily picked, and  were all controlled by the same keys\u2014keys that the reports\u2019 authors  were able to copy at a local store. However, the affected election  officials felt that this risk would be mitigated by typical polling-place  supervisors, who would be able to detect anyone picking the lock on a  DRE terminal. In another report, reviewers were concerned that a  particular model of DRE was linked together with others to form a  rudimentary network. If one of these machines were accidentally or  intentionally unplugged from the others, voting functions on the other  machines in the network would be disrupted. In addition, reviewers  found that the switches used to turn a DRE system on or off, as well as  those used to close the polls on a particular DRE terminal, were not  protected.", "Design flaws in the voter-verified paper audit trail systems. Voter- verified paper audit trail systems involve adding a paper printout to a DRE  system that a voter can review and verify. Some citizen advocacy groups,  security experts, and elections officials advocate these systems as a  protection against potential DRE flaws. However, other election officials  and researchers have raised concerns about potential reliability and  security flaws in the design of such systems. Critics of the systems argue  that adding printers increases the chance of mechanical failure and  disruption to the polling place. Critics also point out that these systems  introduce security risks involving the paper audit trail itself. Election  officials would need to safeguard the paper ballots. If voting system  mechanisms for protecting the paper audit trail were inadequate, an insider  could associate voters with their individual paper ballots and votes,  particularly if the system stored voter-verified ballots sequentially on a  continuous roll of paper. If not protected, such information could breach  voter confidentiality.", "Weak security management practices. Selected state elections officials,  computer security experts, and election experts view the reported  instances of weak controls as an indication that the voting system vendors  lack strong security management and development practices. Security  experts and local election officials cite the position of trust that vendors  occupy in the overall election process, and say that to ensure the security  and reliability of electronic voting systems\u2014as well as improve voters\u2019  confidence in the electoral process\u2014vendors\u2019 practices need to be above  reproach. Specific concerns have been expressed about (1) the personnel  security policies used by vendors, including whether vendors conduct  background checks on programmers and systems developers; (2) whether  vendors have established strict internal security protocols and have  adhered to them during software development; and (3) whether vendors  have established clear chain of custody procedures for handling and  transporting their software securely. A committee of election system  vendors generally disagrees with these concerns and asserts that their  security management practices are sound."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Election Operations", "paragraphs": ["Several reports raised concerns about the operational practices of local  jurisdictions and the performance of their electronic voting systems during  elections. These include incorrect system configurations, poor  implementation of security procedures, and operational failures during an  election.", "Incorrect system configuration. Some state and local election reviews  have documented cases in which local governments did not configure their  voting systems properly for an election. For instance, a county in California  presented some voters with an incorrect electronic ballot in the March 2004  primary. As a result, these voters were unable to vote on certain races. In  another case, a county in Pennsylvania made a ballot programming error  on its DRE system. This error contributed to many votes not being  captured correctly by the voting system, evidenced by that county\u2019s  undervote percentage, which reached 80 percent in some precincts.", "Poor implementation of security procedures. Several reports indicated  that state and local officials did not always follow security procedures.  Reports from Maryland found that a regional vote tabulation computer was  connected to the Internet, and that local officials had not updated it with  several security patches, thus exposing the system to general security  threats. In another example, election monitors in Florida described how  certain precincts did not ensure that the number of votes matched the  number of signatures on the precinct sign-in sheets, thus raising questions  as to whether the voting systems captured the correct number of votes. A  report from California cited a number of counties that failed to follow  mandatory security measures set forth by the Secretary of State\u2019s office  that were designed to compensate for potential security weaknesses in  their electronic voting systems.", "System failures during elections. Several state and local jurisdictions have  documented instances when their electronic voting systems exhibited  operational problems during elections. For example, California officials  documented how a failure in a key component of their system led to polling  place disruptions and an unknown number of disenfranchised voters. In  another instance, DRE voting machines in one county in North Carolina  continued to accept votes after their memories were full, effectively  causing over 4,000 votes to be lost. The same system was used in  Pennsylvania, where the state\u2019s designated voting system examiner noted  several other problems, including the system\u2019s failure to accurately capture  write-in or straight ticket votes, screen freezes, and difficulties sensing  voters\u2019 touches. A Florida county experienced several problems with its  DRE system, including instances where each touch screen took up to 1  hour to activate and had to be activated separately and sequentially,  causing delays at the polling place. In addition, election monitors  discovered that the system contained a flaw that allowed one DRE system\u2019s  ballots to be added to the canvass totals multiple times without being  detected. In another instance, a malfunction in a DRE system in Ohio  caused the system to record approximately 3,900 votes too many for one  presidential candidate in the 2004 general election.

These standards  identify minimum functional and performance requirements for electronic  voting systems such as optical scan and DRE voting equipment. The  functional and performance requirements address what voting equipment  should do and delineate minimum performance thresholds, documentation  provisions, and security and quality assurance requirements. These  standards also specify testing to ensure that the equipment meets these  requirements. The standards are voluntary\u2014meaning that states are free to  adopt them in whole or in part, or reject them entirely.", "Computer security experts and others have criticized the 2002 voting  system standards for not containing requirements sufficient to ensure  secure and reliable voting systems. Common concerns with the standards  involve vague and incomplete security provisions, inadequate provisions  for some commercial products and networks, and inadequate  documentation requirements.", "Vague and incomplete security provisions. Security experts and others  have criticized the security provisions in the voting system standards for  being vague and lacking specific requirements. Although the standards  require the presence of many kinds of security controls, the concern is that  they are not specific enough to ensure the effective and correct  implementation of the controls. One of the independent testing authorities  agreed and noted that the broad terms of the standards do not provide for  consistent testing because they leave too much room for interpretation.", "Computer security and testing experts have also noted that the current  voting system standards are not comprehensive enough and that they omit  a number of common computer security controls. For example, an  independent testing authority expressed a concern that the standards do  not prohibit many software coding flaws, which could make the voting  system software susceptible to external attack and malicious code. In  addition, NIST performed a review of the voting system standards and  found numerous gaps between its own security guidance for federal  information systems and those prescribed by the standards. Others have  argued that the standards are simply out of date, and contain no guidance on technologies such as wireless networking and voter-verified paper audit  trails.", "Inadequate provisions for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems and  telecommunications and networking services. Computer security experts  have raised concerns about a provision in the voting system standards that  exempts unaltered COTS software from testing, and about voting system  standards that are not sufficient to address the weaknesses inherent in  telecommunications and networking services. Specifically, vendors often  use COTS software in their electronic voting systems, including operating  systems like Microsoft Windows. Security experts note that COTS software  could contain defects, vulnerabilities, and other weaknesses that could be  carried over into electronic voting systems, thereby compromising their  security. Regarding telecommunication and networking services, selected  computer security experts believe that relying on any use of  telecommunications or networking services, including wireless  communications, exposes electronic voting systems to risks that make it  difficult to guarantee their security and reliability\u2014even with safeguards  such as encryption and digital signatures in place.", "Inadequate requirements for documentation. Computer security experts  and some elections officials have expressed concerns that the  documentation requirements in the voting system standards are not  explicit enough. For instance, computer security experts warn that the  documentation requirements for source code are not sufficient for code  that is obscure or confusing, nor do they require developers to sufficiently  map out how software modules interact with one another. This could  make it difficult for testers and auditors to understand what they are  reviewing, lessening their ability to detect unstable or hidden (and  potentially malicious) functionality. In addition, election officials and a  security expert raised concerns that the standards do not require sufficient  documentation for local officials with respect to proper operation and  maintenance procedures. For instance, election officials in one state  noted that when voting machines malfunctioned and started generating  error messages during an election, state technicians were unable to  diagnose and resolve the problems because the vendor\u2019s documentation  provided no information about what the error messages meant, or how to  fix the problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voting System Testing", "paragraphs": ["Security experts and some election officials have expressed concerns that  tests currently performed by independent testing authorities and state and  local election officials do not adequately assess electronic voting systems\u2019  security and reliability.

Many computer security experts expressed  concerns with weak or insufficient system functional testing, source code  reviews, and penetration testing. Illustrating their concerns, most of the  systems with weak security controls identified earlier in this report (see  product development issues) had previously been certified by the National  Association of State Election Directors after testing by an independent  testing authority. Security experts and others point to this as an indication  that both the standards and the testing program are not rigorous enough  with respect to security.", "Regarding the functional testing conducted by independent testing  authorities and state and local officials, election and security experts  expressed concern that this testing may not reveal certain security flaws  in electronic voting systems. They argue that functional tests only  measure a system\u2019s performance when it is used as expected, under  normal operating conditions. As a result, this testing cannot determine  what might happen if a voter acts in unexpected ways, or how the  system would react in the face of an active attack. Specifically, security  experts argue that functional testing is unlikely to ever trigger certain  types of hidden code. As a result, malicious code could be present in a  system and evade testing as long as the triggering commands were not  entered.", "Security and testing experts also expressed concern that the source  code reviews called for in the voting system standards and conducted by  independent testing authorities are too general and do not take into  account the unique nature of voting systems. For instance, several  experts noted that malicious code could be hidden in source code and  be obscure enough to avoid detection by the general reviews, which  currently focus on coding conventions, comments, and line length.  Moreover, there is concern that these code reviews may not adequately  inspect how voting system software interacts with key election data.  Specifically, security experts say that a testing authority\u2019s source code  review should include checks for unique elements of the election  contest, including (1) software modules with inappropriate access to  vote totals, ballot definition files, or individual ballots; (2) functionality  with time or date dependent behavior; and (3) software modules that  retain information from previous screen touches or previous voters\u2014all  potentially indicative of improper and malicious voting system  behavior.", "As for penetration testing, experts expressed concerns that voting  system testing does not include such explicit security tests. An official  from an independent testing authority generally agreed and said that the  security-related parts of their testing use a checklist approach, based on  what is called for in the voluntary voting system standards. This official  recommended more rigorous security testing. Another testing authority  official said that their testing does not guarantee that voting systems are  secure and reliable. This official has called for local jurisdictions to  conduct additional security testing and risk analyses of their own.", "Lack of transparency in the testing process. Security experts and some  elections officials have raised concerns about a lack of transparency in the  testing process. They note that the test plans used by the independent  testing authorities, along with the test results, are treated as protected  trade secrets and thus cannot be released to the public. (Designated  election officials may, in fact, obtain copies of test results for their systems,  but only with the permission of the vendor.) As a result, critics argue, the  rigor of the testing process is largely unknown. Critics say that this lack of  transparency hinders oversight and auditing of the testing process. This in  turn makes it harder to determine the actual capabilities, potential  vulnerabilities, and performance problems of a given system.

Specifically, the voting system  software installed at the local level may not be the same as what was  qualified and certified at the national or state levels. These groups raised  the possibility that either intentionally or by accident, voting system  software could be altered or substituted, or that vendors or local officials  might (knowingly or not) install untested or uncertified versions of voting  systems. As a result, potentially unreliable or malicious software might be  used in elections. For example, in separate instances in California and  Indiana, state officials found that two different vendors had violated  regulations and state law by installing uncertified software on voting  systems.", "Inadequate security management programs. Several of the technical  reviews mentioned previously also found that states did not have effective  information security management plans in place to oversee their electronic  voting systems. The reports noted that key managerial functions were not  in place, including (1) providing appropriate security training, (2) ensuring  that employees and contractors had proper certifications, (3) ensuring that  security roles were well defined and staffed, and (4) ensuring that pertinent  officials correctly configure their voting system audit logs and require them  to be reviewed.", "In addition, several reports indicated that some state and local jurisdictions  did not always have procedures in place to address problems with their  electronic voting systems.

On one hand, both vendors  and election officials express confidence in the security of their current  products. Election officials note that their administrative procedures can  compensate for inherent system weaknesses, and they point out that there  has never been a proven case of fraud involving tampering with electronic  voting systems.

To address its responsibilities related to providing  election management support to state and local jurisdictions, EAC and  NIST have been working to establish a software library and to act as a  clearinghouse for information on both problems and recommended  practices involving elections and systems.", "In anticipation of the 2004 elections, EAC and NIST established a  software library for voting systems within NIST\u2019s National Software  Reference Library that allows state and local governments to verify that  their voting system software is the certified version (based on testing by  independent testing laboratories) and to manage the configuration of  that software for their systems. The library was established before the  2004 general election with software from approximately a half dozen  major voting system vendors. NIST derived digital signatures for the  software and published them on the library\u2019s public Web site for states  and local jurisdictions to compare with the signatures of software used  by their systems.", "In January 2005, TGDC requested that NIST define a process and  specification for sharing information among jurisdictions regarding  nonconformities, problems, and vulnerabilities in voting systems, to  specifically address the security and reliability of those systems. Such  information could be used to alert state and local election officials to  known problems with their systems and to develop additional  recommended practices for their use. TGDC designated this task as a  third-tier priority and has deferred working on it until after the  publication of the 2005 voting system standards. In addition, EAC  surveyed state and local election officials to identify problems they  encountered during the 2004 election. However, election officials often  interpreted the survey questions differently, so not all of the information  resulting from this survey was complete or usable. EAC plans to  enhance its survey activities in the future.", "EAC is charged by HAVA with conducting periodic studies of election  administration issues with the goal of providing the most accurate,  secure, and expeditious system for voting and tabulating election  results. Toward this end, EAC compiled the experiences of a select  group of elections experts into a tool kit to help states and local  jurisdictions prepare for the 2004 general election. It was published on  EAC\u2019s Web site in August 2004 and publicized to state and local  jurisdictions before the election. The tool kit provides recommendations  for methods to manage and operate voting systems to help ensure  accurate and secure election results and includes general practices for  all voting systems and environments, as well as controls for specific  types of voting equipment. Since developing the tool kit, EAC has  included additional best practices proposed by TGDC and NIST in the  appendixes of its draft voting system guidelines. These practices  recommend that election officials establish procedures for their  jurisdictions to ensure, among other things, that voting systems are  physically secured against tampering and intentional damage,  cryptographic keys for wireless encryption are actively managed,  actions taken when using wireless communication are logged, and the  authenticity of certified software is confirmed using the National  Software Reference Library. EAC plans to update the practices in the  voting system guidelines and to compile a broader framework of  guidance for election administration and management practices that  incorporates the best practices tool kit and further promotes security  and reliability for voting systems. EAC has begun working with the  National Association of State Elections Directors to establish a working  group to develop additional guidelines and procedures for election  management and operations and has identified the personnel who will  support this effort. This fall, EAC expects the working group to develop  a comprehensive outline for the election management guidelines  document and to prioritize the topics to be developed for the initial  version scheduled to be released in December 2006.

This rewrite is  expected to extensively change the existing standards and include, among  other features, quality management for system development, more testable  standards, and specifications for ballot formats. However, neither TGDC  nor NIST has defined specific tasks, measurable outcomes, milestones, or  resource needs for addressing the next draft of standards. Consequently,  the time frame for states and local jurisdictions to implement the security  and reliability improvements associated with the next version of the  standards is unknown. The undefined time frame for completing the  standards is likely to cause concern for states required to comply with the  federal standards by statute, administrative rule, or condition of HAVA  payments, and will further delay the adoption of widely acknowledged  capabilities needed for secure and reliable systems.", "Voting system certification. While EAC is working to define the scope of a  system certification process, much remains to be done before such a  process is put in place. Specifically, EAC still needs to establish policies,  criteria, and procedures to govern certification reviews and decisions for  existing standards, as well as the proposed 2005 standards. However, the  specific steps and time frames for EAC to execute each stage of its  certification responsibilities have not yet been decided. Until EAC  establishes a comprehensive system certification program, its processes  may be inconsistent or insufficiently rigorous to ensure that all certified  systems meet applicable standards.", "Software library. NIST established a software reference library for voting  systems, but the usefulness of this library is questionable. The initial set of  voting system software deposited into the library was not comprehensive,  no additional voting system software has been submitted to the reference  library since the 2004 general election, and neither EAC nor NIST has  identified specific actions to encourage participation from states, local  jurisdictions, vendors, or independent testing authorities for the 2006  federal election cycle. Additionally, state and local jurisdictions require  specialized tools and technical support to verify that reference library  software signatures match those of their own software versions, but no  consolidated and easily accessible list of sources for these tools and  services is currently available to state and local jurisdictions. Further, NIST  did not keep statistics on the extent to which state and local jurisdictions  used the library during the 2004 election cycle to verify installation of  certified software by their vendors, and thus, it could not determine  whether its service was meeting state and local needs. Without the  continuous incorporation of certified software into the library and  processes that can be effectively implemented by state and local  governments, these entities are likely to face difficulty in ensuring that  their tested and operational voting systems are the same as those that were  certified. Further, without a mechanism for determining how the library is  being used and how it can be improved, the potential benefits of the library  may be greatly diminished.", "Clearinghouse for information on problems and leading practices. To  fulfill its role as a clearinghouse for information on voting system  problems, EAC continues to explore issues of data collection for problems  with voting systems through enhancing its survey instrument to collect  problem information from election officials and working with NIST to  determine how to share this information. However, neither EAC nor NIST  has defined specific tasks or time lines for establishing procedures for  sharing problems or a repository for collecting them. The continued  absence of a national clearinghouse for voting system problems means that  segments of the election community may continue to acquire and operate  their systems without the benefit of critical information learned by others  regarding the security and reliability of those systems. Regarding its efforts  to develop broad guidance on election administration practices, EAC has  initial plans for moving forward, but lacks a process and schedule for  compiling and disseminating this information on a regular basis.

Multiple organizations have compiled  recommended practices for vendors and election officials to use to  improve the security and reliability of voting systems, and EAC has  initiated activities to improve voluntary voting system standards, system  testing programs, and management support to state and local election  authorities. However, important initiatives are unlikely to affect the 2006  elections due, at least in part, to delays in the appointment of EAC  commissioners and in funding the commission. Specifically, key security- related improvements to voting system standards will not be completed in  time, improvements to the national system certification program are not  yet in place, and efforts to provide management support to state and local  jurisdictions through a software library and information sharing on  problems and recommended practices remain incomplete. Further, EAC  has not consistently defined plans, processes, and time frames for  completing these activities, and as a result, it is unclear when their results  will be available to assist state and local election officials.

First, they noted that the draft lacked citations linking security problems  and vulnerabilities to the reports in the bibliography and lacked context  when referring to experts. We have since provided citations and context,  where applicable. Second, commissioners expressed concern that the  report portrays voting system problems as systemic, but does not provide  context for evaluating the extent of the problems\u2014that is, how frequently  these issues arise or whether the problems occur in a large percentage of  electronic voting systems or jurisdictions. We do not agree that we portray  the problems as systemic. Our report states that many of the issues  involved specific voting system makes and models or circumstances in the  elections of specific jurisdictions, and that there is a lack of consensus on  the pervasiveness of the concerns. This is due in part to a lack of  comprehensive information on what system makes and models are used in  jurisdictions throughout the country. Nonetheless, the numerous examples  of systems with poor security controls point to a situation in which vendors  may not be uniformly building security and reliability into their voting  systems, and election officials may not always rigorously ensure the  security and reliability of their systems when they acquire, test, operate,  and manage them. Third, commissioners expressed concern that our report  relies on reports produced by others without substantiation of the claims  made in those reports, and provides specific examples that they felt should  be verified with election officials. While our methodology focused on  identifying and grouping problems and vulnerabilities identified in issued  reports and studies, where appropriate and feasible, we sought additional  context, clarification, and corroboration from the authors, election  officials, and security experts. In one of the specific examples offered by  EAC, we understand that the Florida demonstration may not have offered  an accurate assessment of the system\u2019s vulnerabilities to outsiders, but it  has value in identifying vulnerabilities to knowledgeable insiders. In  another example, EAC takes issue that we found no concerns with the  security and reliability during the acquisition phase of the voting system life  cycle and noted that they learned from state and local officials that a  number of voting equipment units have recently been rejected during the  acceptance testing phase of the acquisition process demonstrating quality  assurance or reliability concerns. We do not question EAC\u2019s point, but this  issue did not surface in the reports we analyzed and the interviews we  held\u2014so we did not include it in our report. This issue, however, shows  that there could be security and reliability issues that are not documented  in existing reports. Assessing security and reliability issues and  determining their pervasiveness are items that EAC can explore and share  in its role as a clearinghouse for information on problems with electronic  voting systems.", "EAC commissioners also commented that our report focuses exclusively  on EAC as the answer to the questions surrounding electronic voting, and  stated that EAC is but one participant in the process of ensuring the  reliability and security of voting systems. They noted that while EAC,  TGDC, and NIST are working to develop a revised set of voting system  guidelines (standards), it is the voting system vendors that must design and  configure their systems to meet those guidelines and the state and local  election officials that must adopt the guidelines and restrict their purchases  of voting systems to ones that conform to the guidelines. While we agree  that EAC is one of many entities with responsibilities for improving the  security and reliability of voting systems, given its leadership role in  defining voting system standards, in establishing programs both to accredit  laboratories and to certify voting systems, and in acting as a clearinghouse  for improvement efforts across the nation, we believe that our focus on  EAC is appropriate and addresses the objective of our requesters regarding  the actions that federal agencies have taken.", "EAC and NIST officials also provided detailed technical corrections, which  we incorporated throughout the report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the report date.

Powner, Director  Information Technology Management Issues  Mr. Randolph C. Hite, Director  Information Technology Architecture and Systems  United States Government Accountability Office  RE:  Draft Report GAO 05-956, Elections:  Federal Efforts          To Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic          Voting Systems are Under Way, but Key Activities          Need to be Completed  Thank you for the opportunity to comment on draft GAO Report 05-956.  The EAC  appreciates the time and effort put forth by GAO during the preparation of this document  and the willingness of GAO staff to discuss pertinent issues at length with the EAC,  NIST and other key players in the election community.  As you know this letter follows a  combined exit conference and discussion of GAO\u2019s draft report.  Because our meeting  was scheduled late in the process, there may be some comments set forth below that have  already been addressed.", "It is apparent from our review of the draft report that GAO has taken steps in this  engagement to understand the election process in addition to evaluating the electronic  voting systems in use in that process.  EAC is also pleased that GAO recognizes and  highlights the decentralized nature of the election process in the United States, the  intricacies this decentralization brings to our election system and the critical roles played  by local, state and Federal election officials in this process.", "While the overall quality of the report is quite high, the EAC does have some issues we  feel need to be addressed prior to the final publication of this document.  During our  September 7, 2005 meeting, we highlighted and provided to you a list of technical  corrections to the facts as stated in the draft report.  For your convenience, a copy of that  list, as amended based upon the conversations in that meeting, has been attached to this  letter.  (Appendix \u201c1\u201d)", "GAO\u2019s draft report does not refer to sources.", "Although the bibliography in Appendix V of the report lists numerous studies on the  security and reliability of electronic voting, few if any, of these studies are cited or  footnoted within the body of the report.  The report generally refers to \u201csecurity experts  and others\u201d without providing any specific reference to the individual sources or the  reports on which the statements that follow such generalities are based.  Including  specific citations where appropriate would lend much needed support to various broad  statements and generalizations made throughout the report regarding the lack of security  and reliability of electronic voting systems.", "GAO\u2019s draft report does not give context to the identified security and reliability  issues.", "GAO identifies several incidences of voting system security or reliability problems.   However, the report does not provide a context of the pervasiveness or relative obscurity  of these issues.  There is no statistical evidence offered as to how frequently these issues  arise or whether problems occur in a large or small percentage of electronic voting  system usage.  While it has been offered by GAO that these reported problems or issues  systemic, the report fails to identify whether the identified problems are voting system  specific, jurisdiction specific, or cross lines of both manufacturers and voting  jurisdictions.", "GAO\u2019s draft report reflects significant reliance on reports produced by others  without substantiation of the claims made in those reports.", "The EAC is concerned about instances of electronic voting system failures highlighted in  the report that do not appear to have been thoroughly researched and analyzed.  As an  example page 26 or the report states, in part, that:  \u201c\u2026computer security experts working with a local election supervisor in Florida  demonstrated that someone with access to an optical scan voting system could falsify  election results without leaving any record of this action in the system\u2019s audit logs by  using altered memory cards.\u201d This statement should be verified with election officials  and voting systems experts at the state level in Florida to assure its accuracy, and to get a  full understanding of the details and validity of this so-called \u201cdemonstration.\u201d", "In another example, on page 25 of the draft report, GAO relies on the reports contained in  its bibliography to state that there are no significant concerns with security or reliability  at the acquisition phase of the voting system life cycle.  Conversations with state and  local election officials that have recently purchased electronic voting equipment would  reveal that a significant number of voting systems are rejected during the acceptance  testing phase of acquisition.  While this may not point to a security concern, it does  demonstrate a quality assurance or reliability concern.", "EAC is but one participant in the process of assuring reliability and security of  voting systems.", "While GAO has done a good job with recognizing that the decentralization of elections in  this country -- that is federal elections as well as state elections are administered by state  and local election officials \u2013 the report fails to capture EAC\u2019s role in the improvement to  security and reliability of electronic voting systems.   EAC is the federal agency  responsible for establishing a uniform set of guidelines (testing standards) against which  voting systems can be measured.  EAC, its advisory committee \u2013 the Technical  Guidelines Development Committee --, and the National Institute of Standards and  Technology are working diligently to develop a revised set of voting system guidelines.   However, the guidelines are only one piece of the puzzle.  It is the voting system vendors  that must design and configure their systems to meet those guidelines and the state and  local election officials that must adopt these guidelines and restrict their purchases of  voting systems to those that conform to the guidelines.  GAO\u2019s draft report focuses  exclusively on EAC as the answer to the questions surrounding electronic voting.  In  reality, EAC simply cannot change the security and reliability of voting systems alone.", "At our meeting on September 7, 2005, EAC identified a number of technical corrections  related to specific facts or statements made in the report.  In addition to the items  enumerated in writing, our discussions produced several other technical errors that  needed correction.  For your convenience, an updated list of technical comments has been  attached to this letter as Appendix \u201c1\u201d.", "The EAC agrees with GAO that the implementation of the five recommendations  presented in this report will improve the voting process and the public perception  regarding the security and reliability of electronic voting systems.  Prior to the issuance  of this report and prior to EAC receiving a draft of this report, EAC took significant steps  toward accomplishing the very processes, procedures and methods recommended by  GAO.  Provided below is additional information concerning EAC\u2019s efforts relative to  each of the five recommendations.", "Recommendation 1:  Collaborate with NIST and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee to define specific tasks, measurable outcomes, milestones,  and resource needs required to improve the voting system standards that affect  security and reliability of voting systems.", "NIST and EAC have begun to define specific tasks and outcomes for subsequent  iterations of the VVSG document.  These issues will be discussed in detail during  the TGDC Plenary Session on September 29, 2005 in Boulder, Colorado.  A  crucial task which will allow both EAC and NIST to most effectively direct  scarce resources and to prioritize upcoming tasks is the development of a  comprehensive vulnerability analysis of electronic voting systems.  NIST and the  U.S. election community will begin gathering threat analysis material and  information during the upcoming meeting on this topic scheduled for October 7,  2005 at the NIST complex in Gaithersburg, Maryland.", "Recommendation 2:  Expeditiously establish documented policies, criteria, and  procedures for certifying voting systems that will be in effect until the national  laboratory accreditation program for voting systems becomes fully operational;  define tasks and time frames for achieving the full operational capability of the  national voting system certification program.", "EAC began the initial transition of the voting system testing and certification  program as required by HAVA by adopting at its August 23, 2005 public meeting  a frame work for the interim and future voting system certification processes.  A  copy of the document describing the processes that was adopted by the  Commission is attached as Appendix \u201c2\u201d.", "The initial task in the interim certification process will be a two-part transition of  the current NASED accredited ITA\u2019s to the EAC.  Part one will be a simple  documentation and transition process which will allow the current ITA\u2019s to  continue testing voting systems to the 2002 VSS.  Part two of this task will  provide for an interim accreditation process to ensure that these labs are  competent to test to the new requirements of the 2005 VVSG once that document  has been adopted by EAC.", "By October 1, 2005, EAC will begin registering those vendors who intend to have  systems evaluated through the EAC conformance testing process.  An integral  component of the EAC\u2019s vendor registration process will be a requirement that  vendors notify EAC of problems encountered with their certified products in the  field and to suggest solutions to any problem encountered.  Resources permitting,  EAC will consider options to enhance this program to include investigation and  analysis of reported voting system problems and methods of communicating these  issues to the entire election community.", "During this same timeframe, EAC will initiate contractual agreements with a  group of technical experts for the review of voting system test reports. By January  1, 2006, EAC will be in a position to fully implement conformance testing of  voting systems and to begin the process of issuing voting system certifications.", "Recommendation 3:  Improve management support to state and local election  officials by collaborating with NIST to establish a process for continuously updating  the National Software Reference Library for voting system  software; take effective  action to promote the library to state and local governments; identify and  disseminate information on resources to assist state and local governments with  using the library; and assess use of the library by states and local jurisdictions for  the purpose of improving library services.", "In 2005, EAC contracted with NIST to develop an interface to the National  Software Reference Library (NSRL) that would be more readily usable by the  state and local election officials.  See MOU with NIST attached as Appendix \u201c3\u201d. In addition, EAC and NIST seek through the same agreement to expand the  capabilities of the NSRL to allow users to verify not only EMS software but also  software that has been installed and used on a voting system.", "In 2004, EAC began the effort of encouraging voting system vendors to submit  their software versions to the NSRL for cataloguing.  Upon the transition of  voting system certification to EAC, EAC will require all vendors who submit  voting systems for certification to file their software with NSRL.", "Recommendation 4:  Improve management support to state and local election  officials by collaborating with TGDC and NIST to develop a process and associated  timeframes for sharing information on the problems and vulnerabilities of voting  systems.", "In its framework for the voting system certification process, EAC has  contemplated the need for information relative to the strengths and weaknesses,  certification and decertification of voting systems.  As such, EAC will introduce  additional transparency to the process of voting system certification and  decertification.  In addition, EAC has demonstrated its desire to gather and  disseminate data regarding voting system problems in its 2004 Election Day  Survey.  Results of that survey will be released this month and will identify voting  system problems that occurred on election day, as reported by the 50 states and 5  territories.", "Recommendation 5:  Improve management support to sate and local election  officials by establishing a process and schedule for periodically compiling and  disseminating recommended practices related to security and reliability  management throughout the system life cycle (including the recommended practices  identified in this report) and ensuring that this process uses information on the  problems and vulnerabilities of voting systems.", "In 2005 and 2006, EAC and the National Association of State Election Directors  (NASED) will work together to develop a comprehensive set of management  guidelines that will accompany the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines.  Testing  voting systems for conformance to uniform standards is only half of the equation  involved with administering secure elections.  The management processes,  physical security, and protocols used to accept, program, test and maintain voting  systems is an equally important part of conducting fair and accurate elections. The management guidelines to be developed by EAC and NASED will focus on  these issues.", "The United States Election Assistance Commission would like to take the opportunity to  thank GAO for its work, dedication and concern about the technology and processes that  underlie one of America\u2019s most precious freedoms, the right to vote.  EAC and GAO join  the legions of election officials throughout the country that work tirelessly to conduct  free, fair and accurate elections.", "It has been our pleasure to work with GAO on this historic study and analysis of our  country\u2019s voting systems.  It is critical that the federal government and our state and local  counterparts analyze the means by which we conduct elections with the goal of always  improving public confidence and security in our election process. We hope that the  comments offered today will be of assistance to GAO and lend to the applicability and  credibility of its report.", "Congress and the nation can rest assured that EAC will continue is vigilant efforts to help  our nation\u2019s election officials implement the requirements of the Help America Vote Act  of 2002 and to work to continually improve our elections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the National Institute of Standards and Technology", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Mark Braza, Barbara Collier, William  Cook, Dan Gordon, Richard Hung, Kevin Jackson, Stanley Kostyla, Linda  Lambert, Paula Moore, Colleen Phillips, Jay Smale, Amos Tevelow, and  Jessica Waselkow made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": ["We selected the following reports, analyses, testimonies, and other  documents because of their relevance to the security and reliability of  electronic voting systems.
