GAO (1) examined existing research on the effects of counterfeiting and piracy on consumers, industries, government, and the U.S. economy; and (2) identified insights gained from efforts to quantify the effects of counterfeiting and piracy on the U.S. economy. GAO interviewed officials and subject matter experts from U.S. government agencies, industry associations, nongovernmental organizations, and academic institutions, and reviewed literature and studies quantifying or discussing the economic impacts of counterfeiting and piracy on the U.S. economy, industry, government, and consumers.

Consumers are particularly likely to experience negative effects when they purchase counterfeit products they believe are genuine, such as pharmaceuticals. Negative effects on U.S. industry may include lost sales, lost brand value, and reduced incentives to innovate; however, industry effects vary widely among sectors and companies. The U.S. government may lose tax revenue, incur IP enforcement expenses, and face risks of counterfeits entering supply chains with national security or civilian safety implications. The U.S. economy as a whole may grow more slowly because of reduced innovation and loss of trade revenue. Some experts and literature also identified some potential positive effects of counterfeiting and piracy. Some consumers may knowingly purchase counterfeits that are less expensive than the genuine goods and experience positive effects (consumer surplus), although the longer-term impact is unclear due to reduced incentives for research and development, among other factors. Three widely cited U.S. government estimates of economic losses resulting from counterfeiting cannot be substantiated due to the absence of underlying studies. Generally, the illicit nature of counterfeiting and piracy makes estimating the economic impact of IP infringements extremely difficult, so assumptions must be used to offset the lack of data. Efforts to estimate losses involve assumptions such as the rate at which consumers would substitute counterfeit for legitimate products, which can have enormous impacts on the resulting estimates. Because of the significant differences in types of counterfeited and pirated goods and industries involved, no single method can be used to develop estimates. Each method has limitations, and most experts observed that it is difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the economy-wide impacts. Nonetheless, research in specific industries suggest that the problem is sizeable, which is of particular concern as many U.S. industries are leaders in the creation of intellectual property."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In October 2008, Congress passed the Prioritizing Resources and  Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 (PRO-IP Act) (P.L. 110- 403), to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of U.S. government  efforts to protect the intellectual property (IP) of U.S. industries and IP  rights holders.

We conducted a literature search of studies and estimates of the  economic impact of IP infringements published since 1999 to examine  various aspects of the economic impacts of counterfeiting and piracy, and  to identify other insights about the role IP plays in the U.S. economy.  Among the studies we reviewed was the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) 2008 report, The Economic  Impact of Counterfeiting and Piracy. Although this study was global  rather than focused on the U.S. economy, its unique nature and  prominence as the most comprehensive attempt to quantify the impacts of  counterfeiting and piracy warranted its inclusion within our reviews. We  also interviewed subject matter experts from a range of governmental,  nongovernmental, academic and industry sources, and OECD officials to  discuss efforts to quantify the economic impacts of counterfeiting and  piracy and to obtain their views on the range of impacts of counterfeits  and piracy, insights on counterfeiting activities and markets, and the role  of IP in the U.S. economy. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion of the  impacts and insights on counterfeiting and piracy, we do not distinguish  between imported counterfeit and pirated goods and those produced  domestically. The literature we reviewed and experts we spoke with  focused primarily on imported counterfeit goods rather than those  produced within the United States. We determined that the U.S.  government did not systematically collect data and perform analysis on  the impacts of counterfeiting and piracy on the U.S. economy and, based  on our review of literature and interviews with experts, we concluded that  it was not feasible to develop our own estimates or attempt to quantify the  economic impact of counterfeiting and piracy on the U.S. economy.

Under TRIPS, all WTO member  countries are obligated to establish laws and regulations that meet a  minimum standard for protecting various areas of IP rights. It also  provides for enforcement measures for members. One of USTR\u2019s priorities  in recent years has been negotiating free trade agreements. Since 2000,  USTR has completed negotiations for free trade agreements that have  entered into force with Australia, Bahrain, Central America, Chile, Jordan,  Morocco, Oman, Peru, and Singapore.

First, the U.S. has been the source of a large share of technological  improvements for many years and, therefore, stands to lose if the  associated IP rights are not respected in other nations. Secondly, a  prominent economist noted that IP protection appears to be one of the  factors that has helped to generate the enormous growth in the world  economy and in the standard of living that has occurred in the last 150  years. This economist pointed out that the last two centuries have created  an unprecedented surge in growth compared to prior periods. Among the  factors attributed to creating the conditions for this explosion in economic  growth are the rule of law, including property rights and the enforceability  of contracts.", "While these conditions are clearly important for generating economic  growth, determining the contributions of innovation to economic growth  at the level of the overall economy has been a challenging task.  Economists have used a variety of techniques to better understand the role  of innovation in growth, and historical evidence shows that growth rates  have periodically been driven upward by major technological  improvements, beginning with the industrial revolution and the role of  electricity, and continuing with the current revolution in information  technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Protections Related to IP", "paragraphs": ["Generally, individual countries grant and enforce IP rights.

These seizures have been concentrated  among certain types of products. For example, seizures of footwear,  wearing apparel, and handbags accounted for about 57 percent of the  aggregate domestic value of goods seized in those 6 years. Table 1 shows  the percent of total domestic value for different types of commodities  seized as well as the domestic value of all goods seized and total number  of seizures. The value of wearing apparel and cigarette seizures generally  declined, while the value of pharmaceutical seizures generally increased.  Several factors influence trends in seizure values. For example, values of  seized goods can vary from year to year due to counterfeiters\u2019 responses to  changes in marketplace demand or enforcement actions. For instance, in  fiscal year 2006, a federal enforcement investigation resulted in the seizure  of 77 cargo containers of counterfeit Nike Air Jordan shoes and one  container of counterfeit Abercrombie & Fitch clothing. The estimated  domestic value of these goods was about $19 million, representing about  12 percent of the total domestic seizure value that year. In addition, the  level of federal border enforcement effort varies across ports, resulting in  different seizure rates, which is discussed in a later section of this report.", "According to CBP data, seized counterfeit goods are dominated by  products from China. During fiscal years 2004 through 2009, China  accounted for about 77 percent of the aggregate value of goods seized in  the United States. Hong Kong, India, and Taiwan followed China,  accounting for 7, 2, and 1 percent of the seized value, respectively. CBP  data indicate certain concentrations of counterfeit production among  these countries: in 2009, about 58 percent of the seized goods from China  were footwear and handbags; 69 percent of the seized goods from Hong  Kong were consumer electronics and watch parts; 91 percent of the seized  goods from India were pharmaceuticals and perfume; and 85 percent of  seized goods from Taiwan were computers and consumer electronics. CBP  data show that goods were also seized frequently from Russia, Korea,  Pakistan, Vietnam, and certain Southeast Asian countries. Unlike imported  counterfeits, there is little information on the extent and sources for  domestically produced counterfeits. According to the Congressional  Research Service, the United States is especially concerned with foreign  counterfeits of U.S. intellectual property. Compared to foreign countries,  counterfeits produced in the United States are estimated to be relatively  low.", "Another significant aspect of IP infringement is the piracy of digital  copyrighted products, which is not captured by CBP seizure data. The  development of technologies that enable the unauthorized distribution of  copyrighted works is widely recognized as leading to an increase in piracy.  The rapid growth of Internet use, in particular, has significantly  contributed to the increase. Digital products are not physical or tangible,  can be reproduced at very low cost, and have the potential for immediate  delivery through the Internet across virtually unlimited geographic  markets. Sectors facing threats from digital piracy include the music,  motion picture, television, publishing, and software industries. Piracy of  these products over the Internet can occur through methods including  peer-to-peer networks, streaming sites, and one-click hosting services.  There is no government agency that systematically collects or tracks data  on the extent of digital copyright piracy.", "These technological developments, along with an increase in the  sophistication of packaging for counterfeit goods, have changed the nature  of counterfeiting and piracy substantially in recent years.

According to experts we spoke with, a key characteristic of these types of  counterfeit goods, which distinguishes their effects from other types of  counterfeiting or piracy, is that U.S. consumers are likely to have been  deceived about the origin of the product. In addition, some studies and an  expert reported that counterfeiters have increasingly diversified beyond  their traditional products, such as luxury goods, to more functional  products such as baby shampoo and household cleaners, and will continue  to expand their product portfolios since the profit incentives are large.  Examples of the types of counterfeit products that may have negative  health and safety effects on consumers are presented below.", "Counterfeit pharmaceuticals may include toxic or nonactive ingredients,  correct ingredients in incorrect quantities, or other mislabeling.

These sources further  noted that the economic effects vary widely among industries and among  companies within an industry. The most commonly identified effect cited  was lost sales, which leads to decreased revenues and/or market share.  Many industries lose sales because of consumers\u2019 purchases of counterfeit  and pirated goods, particularly if the consumer purchased a counterfeit  when intending to purchase a genuine product. In such cases, the industry  may lose sales in direct proportion to the number of counterfeit products  that the deceived consumers purchased. Industries in which consumers  knowingly purchase counterfeits as a substitute for the genuine good may  also experience lost sales. For example, recording companies have lost  sales on a wide scale as a result of pirated music distributed over the  Internet and producers of high-end fashion goods have lost sales from  purchases of counterfeit goods made to look similar to genuine products.", "Lost revenues can also occur when lower-priced counterfeit and pirated  goods pressure producers or IP owners to reduce prices of genuine goods.  In some industries, such as the audiovisual sector, marketing strategies  must be adjusted to minimize the impact of counterfeiting on lost  revenues. Movie studios that use time-related marketing strategies\u2014 introducing different formats of a movie after certain periods of time\u2014 have reduced the time periods or \u201cwindows\u201d for each format as a  countermeasure, reducing the overall revenue acquired in each window.  Experts stated that companies may also experience losses due to the  dilution of brand value or damage to reputation and public image, as  counterfeiting and piracy may reduce consumers\u2019 confidence in the  brand\u2019s quality. Consumers who are unaware that a product is counterfeit  may blame the manufacturer of the legitimate good for negative effects of  the fake. Some manufacturers learn of the existence of counterfeit  versions of their products from returns of inferior counterfeit goods.", "Companies are affected in additional ways. For example, to avoid losing  sales and liability issues, companies may increase spending on IP  protection efforts. In addition, experts we spoke with stated that  companies could experience a decline in innovation and production of  new goods if counterfeiting leads to reductions in corporate investments  in research and development. Another variation in the nature of the effects  of counterfeiting and piracy is that some effects are experienced  immediately, while others are more long-term in nature, according to the  OECD. The OECD\u2019s 2008 report cited loss of sales volume and lower  prices as short-term effects, while the medium- and long-term effects  include loss of brand value and reputation, lost investment, increased  costs of countermeasures, potentially reduced scope of operations, and  reduced innovation.", "Finally, one expert emphasized to us that the loss of the IP rights is much  more important than the loss of revenue. He stated that the danger for the  United States is in the accelerated \u201clearning effects\u201d\u2014companies learn  how to produce and will improve upon these goods.

IP owners or producers of  legitimate goods who lose revenue because of competition from  counterfeiters pay less in taxes. The U.S. government also incurs costs due  to IP protection and enforcement efforts. Researchers have found  anecdotal evidence that organized criminal and terrorist organizations are  involved in counterfeiting and piracy. A 2009 RAND Corporation study, for  example, presented case studies showing the involvement of organized  crime or terrorist groups involved in film piracy to generate funding for  their activities. Because criminal networks are involved, government law  enforcement priorities may be affected since more resources are devoted  to combating these networks. Researchers have identified economic  incentives that have contributed to the increase in counterfeiting and  piracy in recent years. Economic incentives include low barriers to  entering the counterfeiting and piracy business, potentially high profits,  and limited legal sanctions if caught.", "The federal government also incurs costs to store and destroy counterfeit  and pirated goods. Seized goods have to be secured, as they have potential  value but cannot be allowed to enter U.S. commerce. Storage may be  prolonged by law enforcement actions, but the goods are generally  destroyed or otherwise disposed of when they are determined to be illegal  and are no longer needed. According to CBP officials, as seizures have  increased, the agency\u2019s storage and destruction costs have grown and  become increasingly burdensome. CBP reported that it spent about $41.9  million to destroy seized property between fiscal years 2007 and 2009.", "Counterfeits also pose a threat to the reliability of supply chains that have  national security or civilian safety significance.

IP-related industries play  an important role in the growth of the U.S. economy and contribute a  significant percentage to the U.S. gross domestic product. IP-related  industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries and  contribute to a higher standard of living in the United States. To the extent  that counterfeiting and piracy reduce investments in research and  development, these companies may hire fewer workers and may  contribute less to U.S. economic growth, overall.

For example, consumers in the United States and other  countries purchase counterfeit copies of high-priced luxury-branded  fashion goods at low prices, although the products\u2019 packaging and sales  venues make it apparent they are not genuine.

This expert identified Internet  infrastructure manufacturers (e.g., companies that make routers) as  possible beneficiaries of digital piracy, because of the bandwidth demands  related to the transfer of pirated digital content.

The assumed rate at which a consumer is willing to  switch from purchasing a fake good to the genuine product is a key  assumption that can have a critical impact on the results of an economic  loss estimate.

However, this  one-to-one substitution rate requires three important conditions: (1) the  fake good is almost identical in quality to the genuine one; (2) the  consumer is paying full retail price for the fake product; and (3) the  consumer is not aware he is purchasing a counterfeit product. When some  of these conditions are not met (e.g., the consumer paid a significantly  lower price for the counterfeit), the likelihood that the consumer would  have purchased the genuine product at full price is not clear. Substitution  rates also vary by industry, since factors such as product quality,  distribution channels, and information available about the product can  differ significantly.", "Value of fake goods. Valuation of the fake goods constitutes another set of  assumptions that has a significant impact. There are several measures of  value that can be used, such as the production cost, the domestic value, or  the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. For example, CBP announced in  a January 2010 press release that it had seized 252,968 DVDs with  counterfeit trademarks. The agency reported that the manufacturer\u2019s  suggested retail price of the shipment was estimated to be more than $7.1  million and the domestic value was estimated at $204,904. Officials from  the International Trade Commission stated that counterfeits are very  difficult to price and estimates of economic impact would benefit from  including a range of prices, from the spot price of the fake on the street  corner at the bottom to the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price at the  top.", "The level or extent of deception that consumers face is also an important  factor to consider when developing assumptions for the substitution rate  and value of the fake goods. If a consumer is completely deceived, it could  be reasonable to assume a one-to-one substitution rate (i.e., the purchase  of a legitimate good in lieu of the counterfeit one) and a full retail price  (i.e., the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail sales price). Price, packaging, and  location of the transaction are the most important signs to the consumer  indicating the legitimacy of a good. Many of the experts we interviewed  said that a one-to-one substitution rate is not likely to exist in most  circumstances where counterfeit goods are significantly cheaper than the  legitimate goods. Some experts also noted that the level of consumer  deception varies across industries. For example, consumers who purchase  counterfeit pharmaceuticals are more likely to be deceived, particularly  when the counterfeit good is sold through the same distribution channel as  the genuine product. Some experts observed that few, if any, consumers  would willingly purchase a pharmaceutical product they knew might be  counterfeit. However, the extent of deception among consumers of  audiovisual products is likely lower because sales venues for counterfeit  audiovisual goods tend to be separate from the legitimate ones. Unless the  assumptions about substitution rates and valuations of counterfeit goods  are transparently explained, experts observed that it is difficult, if not  impossible, to assess the reasonableness of the resulting estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Three Widely Cited Estimates Sourced to U.S. Agencies Cannot Be Substantiated", "paragraphs": ["Three commonly cited estimates of U.S. industry losses due to  counterfeiting have been sourced to U.S. agencies, but cannot be  substantiated or traced back to an underlying data source or methodology.  First, a number of industry, media, and government publications have  cited an FBI estimate that U.S. businesses lose $200-$250 billion to  counterfeiting on an annual basis. This estimate was contained in a 2002  FBI press release, but FBI officials told us that it has no record of source  data or methodology for generating the estimate and that it cannot be  corroborated. Second, a 2002 CBP press release contained an estimate that  U.S. businesses and industries lose $200 billion a year in revenue and  750,000 jobs due to counterfeits of merchandise. However, a CBP official  stated that these figures are of uncertain origin, have been discredited, and  are no longer used by CBP. A March 2009 CBP internal memo was  circulated to inform staff not to use the figures. However, another entity  within DHS continues to use them. Third, the Motor and Equipment  Manufacturers Association reported an estimate that the U.S. automotive  parts industry has lost $3 billion in sales due to counterfeit goods and  attributed the figure to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The OECD  has also referenced this estimate in its report on counterfeiting and piracy,  citing the association report that is sourced to the FTC. However, when we  contacted FTC officials to substantiate the estimate, they were unable to  locate any record or source of this estimate within its reports or archives,  and officials could not recall the agency ever developing or using this  estimate.

Due to these challenges and the lack of  data, researchers have developed different methodologies.

This approach provides hard evidence of the minimum  quantity of counterfeit goods, but a major limitation is that levels of border  enforcement efforts can vary. For example, in our study of seizures made  by the CBP field offices, we calculated \u201cseizure rates\u201d for the top 25 U.S.  ports, based on the dollar value of IP seizures at each port compared to  the dollar value of IP-related imports there. These ports accounted for  over 75 percent of the value of all IP-related imports into the United States  in fiscal year 2005. We found that the top 3 ports seized over 100 times  more IP counterfeits than the lowest 5 of these ports per dollar of IP- related imports. As a result, it appears that the importance of IP  enforcement and the skill of the personnel at the ports have significant  impact on the level of seizures. This suggests that seizure data might be  useful as a floor, but are not indicative of the actual level of U.S. imports of  counterfeit goods.", "A study conducted by the Los Angeles County Economic Development  Corporation, A False Bargain: The Los Angeles County Economic  Consequences of Counterfeit Products, used extrapolation of seizure  data as one of its three approaches to estimate the economic impact of  counterfeits.The authors noted that the key variable in extrapolating  seizure data from CBP was to determine CBP\u2019s success rate in interdicting  illegal goods, which they acknowledged was \u201cunknowable.\u201d One of the  study\u2019s estimates that used CBP seizures to extrapolate the value of  counterfeit and pirated goods in Los Angeles County calculated a range  between $1 billion and $4.6 billion in 2005. This range was based on  different assumptions used for seizure rates and other variables.", "Another challenge when extrapolating seizure data is determining the  dollar value to assign to the seized good, which can have a significant  impact on the magnitude of the estimates.

However, a  survey can be a labor-intensive project and can cost in the millions of  dollars. Moreover, one expert stated that the bias in surveys is hard to  identify.

Their main findings are: (1)  downloading reduces legitimate purchases by individuals by 20 percent in  the sample, that is, every five music downloads substitute one legitimate  purchase; (2) on average, respondents downloaded music that they valued  one-third to one-half less than their legitimately purchased music,  suggesting that some of the music that was downloaded would never have  been purchased as an album; and (3) while downloading reduces per  capita expenditures by $25, it raises per capita consumers\u2019 surplus by $70.
