Although more than 68 percent of this assistance consisted of food aid, U.S. assistance has also supported other needs, such as water and sanitation, shelter, and health care. Since 2003, humanitarian organizations have made significant progress in increasing the number of people in Darfur receiving aid. In addition, malnutrition and mortality rates in Darfur dropped, a trend that U.S. and other officials attribute in part to humanitarian assistance efforts. However, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the entities providing U.S. humanitarian assistance have encountered several challenges that have hampered delivery of, or accountability for, humanitarian services in Darfur. These challenges include continued insecurity in Darfur; Sudanese government restrictions on access to communities in need; the timing of funding; and an incapacity to ensure monitoring of, and reporting on, U.S.-funded programs. AMIS has taken several positive actions in Darfur to pursue its mandate, although some actions have been incomplete or inconsistent. For example, to monitor compliance with a 2004 cease-fire agreement--one mandate component--AMIS investigated alleged cease-fire violations and identified numerous violations; however, the resulting reports were not consistently reviewed at higher levels or made fully publicly available to identify those violating the agreement. The U.S. government, via private contractors, provided about $280 million from June 2004 through September 2006 tobuild and maintain 32 camps for AMIS forces in Darfur, according to the Department of State. Numerous challenges have been identified by African Union or U.S. officials, among others, as negatively affecting AMIS's efforts in Darfur. These challenges include inadequacies in AMIS's organization, management, and capacity, such as inconsistent interpretation of the AMIS mandate; its relatively small forces; limited or poorly allocated resources; and a lack of intelligence regarding, and cooperation from, the parties to the conflict. A transition from AMIS to a UN peacekeeping operation is being considered, although the Sudanese government has rejected such a transition. A possible NATO-assisted review of AMIS operations has not been conducted. Meanwhile, insecurity and violence continue in Darfur."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, violent conflict broke out in the Darfur region of western Sudan  when rebel groups, believing that the region was marginalized by the  Sudanese government, led attacks against the government.

In addition, although nutrition  among IDPs in Darfur remains precarious, UN nutritional reports show  improvement since 2004 and attribute the improvement partly to  external assistance and large-scale food aid. According to UN  Emergency Food Security and Nutrition Assessments, the prevalence of  global acute malnutrition in Darfur was reported at 11.9 percent in  March of 2006, a significant decrease from the 21.8 percent reported in  October 2004.", "Furthermore, several mortality surveys have concluded that mortality  rates in Darfur decreased from 2004 to 2005. For example, surveys  conducted by the World Health Organization and M\u00e9decins Sans  Fronti\u00e8res (also known as Doctors Without Borders) reported mortality  rates ranging between 1.5 to 9.5 deaths per 10,000 people per day in  2004. In September 2005, the UN World Food Program reported that the  crude mortality rate in Darfur had dropped below the emergency  threshold of 1 death per 10,000 persons per day, as defined by Sphere.  Humanitarian assistance provided for Darfur by the United States and  other international donors has been cited as contributing to improved  mortality rates in Darfur. Experts and NGO, UN, and U.S. officials noted  that other factors, such as reduced violence, can also contribute to a  decrease in mortality rates.", "Despite the efforts of the humanitarian organizations to increase the  numbers of people receiving humanitarian assistance, as well as provide  assistance to help reduce malnutrition and mortality rates, the situation in  Darfur remains precarious.

The provision of approximately 56 percent  of 2006 U.S. food aid funding late in the fiscal year made it difficult for  the UN World Food Program to distribute supplies throughout Darfur in  a timely fashion. In particular, because of the 6-month lag between  confirmation and distribution of donations, the delay made it difficult  for the program to preposition food prior to the rainy season, according  to a World Food Program official. Owing in part to this delay, the  program announced in April 2006 that, beginning in May, it would  reduce rations in Darfur to half the minimum daily requirement (from  2,100 calories to as few as 1,050 calories per day) to extend limited food  stocks. In response, the Sudanese government donated sorghum, and  the President of the United States directed USAID to ship emergency  food stockpiles to Darfur, raising the rations to 84 percent (1,770  kilocalories) of the daily requirement for Darfurians receiving food aid.  In June, the cereal component of the ration was fully restored.

This outcome  aligns with previous GAO findings that lack of sufficient, timely  donations contributed to food aid shortfalls in other emergency  situations.", "Impact on nonfood assistance. The delay of U.S. nonfood humanitarian  assistance, as well as a reduction in funding from other international  donors, led NGO and UN officials to anticipate a negative impact on  nonfood humanitarian operations in Darfur.

According to a senior PAE official in  Darfur, key costs associated with building the camps included supplying  generators and, particularly as construction was beginning, transporting  supplies and equipment via aircraft. Construction of the camps, which  together can house 9,300 people, was complicated by the difficulty of  finding international staff willing to come to Darfur and local staff  possessing adequate skills. In addition, the remote locations of camp sites,  combined with the inadequate condition of roads throughout the region,  made it difficult to transport building supplies to the sites; PAE officials  told us that in some cases, supplies were transported across insecure areas  via donkeys. Further, the various augmentations of AMIS over time  (including the introduction of the civilian police component) had to be  incorporated into preexisting building plans. Moreover, the relatively small  size of some of the land parcels provided by the government of Sudan made  it difficult for PAE to, for example, construct sufficient perimeter  protection around camps. Other sites provided by the government are in  vulnerable locations; for instance, PAE officials identified one camp that  was built in a natural \u201cbowl,\u201d making protection problematic, although  steps were recently taken to relocate portions of this camp.", "According to PAE and State officials, PAE\u2019s current costs for maintaining  the camps, as well as AMIS communications equipment and vehicles, are  about $7.8 million per month. PAE faces additional challenges in  maintaining AMIS facilities, with the provision of water a key difficulty.  According to a PAE situation report dated May 5, 2006, there are significant  concerns regarding the provision of an uninterrupted supply of water to  several AMIS camps. In some cases, unprotected water bore holes have  been sabotaged. In the past, PAE also experienced the theft of jet fuel.

According to an official from the African  Union\u2019s Darfur Integrated Task Force, AMIS needs about 200 interpreters;  however, as of February 2006, AMIS had only about 70 interpreters. The  lack of interpreters has been attributed to the difficulty in finding people  who speak both Arabic and English.

Further, continued resistance and lack of cooperation from  the government of Sudan, as well as continued insecurity and conflict  within Darfur, have made it nearly impossible for humanitarian  organizations to provide consistent and complete coverage to the affected  residents and IDPs throughout Darfur. Although USAID has taken steps to  ensure more complete reporting, the limitations in its oversight of U.S.  assistance have made it difficult to accurately determine the impact of U.S.  humanitarian assistance.
