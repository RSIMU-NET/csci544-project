To determine how susceptible State\u2019s systems are to unauthorized access, we tested the department\u2019s technical and physical controls for ensuring that data, systems, and facilities were protected from unauthorized access. We tested the operation of these controls to determine whether they existed and were operating effectively. We contracted with a major public accounting firm to assist in our evaluation and testing of these controls. We determined the scope of our contractor\u2019s audit work, monitored its progress, and reviewed the related work papers to ensure that the resulting findings were adequately supported. During our testing, we performed controlled penetration attacks at dial-in access points, the department\u2019s Internet gateways, and public information servers. We also performed penetration activities to access security controls on State\u2019s major internal networks. In addition, we performed social engineeringactivities to assess user awareness, and attempted to gain physical access to two State facilities.", "We attempted to access State\u2019s sensitive data and programs under conditions negotiated with State Department officials known as \u201crules of engagement.\u201d These rules were developed to assist us in obtaining access to State\u2019s facilities and information resources and to prevent damage to any systems or sensitive information. Under the rules, all testing was required to take place within the department\u2019s headquarters building between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. and was physically monitored by State employees and contractor personnel. In addition, State monitors were authorized to stop our testing when we obtained access to sensitive information or systems. We were also required to inform State personnel about the types of tests we planned to conduct prior to the testing. As agreed with State, we limited the scope of our testing to unclassified systems.", "To identify what State is doing to address the issue of unauthorized access to its information systems, we discussed with department officials their efforts to protect these systems and reviewed supporting documentation. For example, we obtained information on the department\u2019s initiatives to improve the security of its mainframe computers and establish a centrally managed information system security officer program at headquarters. We also discussed with department officials preliminary plans to expand the use of the Internet and reviewed supporting documentation. We reviewed numerous evaluations of information security at domestic State locations and foreign posts performed by the department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. We reviewed recent reports submitted by State to the President and the Congress under provisions of the 1982 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act, which outlined known information management and technology weaknesses and plans for corrective actions. We reviewed the department\u2019s policy guidance on information security as contained in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 1 and Volume 12, Chapter 600, and its Fiscal Year 1997-2001 Strategic and Performance Management Plan for Information Resources Management. We visited a computer security assessment center in Fairfax, Virginia, which the department uses primarily for certifying and accrediting software to be used on State information systems.", "To evaluate State\u2019s security program management and formulate recommendations for improvement, we compared State\u2019s practices to guidelines in two National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications, the \u201cGenerally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems\u201d and \u201cAn Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook,\u201d as well as other guides and textbooks. In addition, we reviewed a Department of State Inspector General report on unclassified mainframe systems security. We also relied on our work to identify the best information security management practices of non-federal organizations which is presented in our Executive Guide Information Security Management: Learning From Leading Organizations (GAO/AIMD-98-21 Exposure Draft, November 1997).

First, while simulating outside attackers without knowledge of State\u2019s systems, we were able to successfully gain unauthorized access to State\u2019s networks through dial-in connections to modems. Having obtained this access, we could have modified or deleted important data, shut down services, downloaded data, and monitored network traffic such as e-mail and data files.", "We also tested internal network security controls and found them to be inadequate. For example, we were able to gain privileged (administrator) access to host systems on several different operating platforms (such as UNIX and Windows NT). This access enabled us to view international financial data, travel arrangements, detailed network diagrams, a listing of valid users on local area networks, e-mail, and performance appraisals, among other sensitive data.", "Our tests also found that security awareness among State employees is problematic. We were able to gain access to State\u2019s networks by guessing user passwords, bypassing physical security at one facility, and searching unattended areas for user account information and active terminal sessions. For example, in several instances we were able to enter a State facility without required identification. In an unlocked work area for one office, we found unattended personal computers logged onto a local area network. We also found a user identification and password taped to one of the computers. Using these terminals, we were able to download a file that contained a password list. In another unlocked area, we were able to access the local area network server and obtain supervisor-level access to a workstation. With this access, we could have added or deleted users, implemented unauthorized programs, and eliminated audit trails.", "Our tests of dial-in-security, internal network security, and physical security demonstrated that information critical to State\u2019s operations as well as to the operations of other federal agencies operating overseas can be easily accessed and compromised. For example, we gained access to information that detailed the physical layout of State\u2019s automated information infrastructure. These data would make it much easier for an outsider who had no knowledge of State\u2019s operations or infrastructure to penetrate the department\u2019s computer resources.

For example, while top management at State is aware of longstanding problems associated with its information management and information security and has reported a number of these high-risk and material weaknesses to the President and the Congress under provisions of the 1982 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act, these weaknesses remain unresolved. For example, mainframe computer security was identified as a material weakness 10 years ago but has not yet been corrected. \u201cThe lack of senior management\u2019s involvement in addressing authority, responsibility, accountability and policy is the critical issue perpetuating the Department\u2019s lax approach to mainframe security . . . . In addition, the lack of clear management responsibility has resulted in incomplete and unreliable security administration . . . .\u201d", "Many mid-level State officials told us that the information security problems we and others identified during our review were already known throughout the department. Collectively, they believed that senior State management was not convinced of the seriousness of the problems and were unable or unwilling to commit the requisite attention and resources to resolve them. They noted that budget requests for security measures, such as information systems security officers, were approved but later rescinded. Many officials said that while the assignment of a chief information officer (CIO) was a critical step in elevating the importance of information management and security throughout the department, the CIO does not have the authority needed to ensure that improvements are made throughout State\u2019s decentralized activities. They also said that budgets for important controls, such as Bureau of Diplomatic Security information security evaluations at worldwide posts, are severely constrained and that the same security deficiencies are found and ignored year after year.

Many offices and functional bureaus also manage, develop, and procure their own networks and systems. In addition, according to Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials, some of the approximately 250 posts operated by State around the world have established their own network connections, further complicating security and configuration management. \u201cSince there is no enterprise-wide authority for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information as it traverses the unclassified network, it is extremely difficult to detect when information is lost, misdirected, intercepted or spoofed.

One significant exception to this is the comprehensive risk analysis performed by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, which evaluated the risks associated with Internet connectivity.", "Computer security evaluations performed at posts located around the world by Bureau of Diplomatic Security staff further demonstrate that State officials are not addressing and correcting risks appropriately. The evaluations revealed numerous problems at foreign posts such as use of inappropriate passwords and user identifications, failure to designate an information systems security officer, poor or nonexistent systems security training, and lack of contingency plans. Diplomatic security staff also told us that they have found that some posts have installed modem connections and Internet connections without approval, further complicating the department\u2019s ability to manage and secure its networks.

State also provides policy guidance in other formats, including instructions, cablegrams, letters, and memoranda. These policies are deficient in several respects. First, they fail to acknowledge some important security responsibilities within the department. For example, while the security manual details responsibilities of system managers and information systems security officers, it does not address the information security responsibilities of the Department\u2019s chief information officer (CIO). The CIO\u2019s authority and ability to operate effectively would be enhanced with departmental policy recognition of the legislatively prescribed security responsibilities. State\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual was updated in February 1997 to describe the CIO position, but it does not discuss any information security responsibilities.", "Second, the Foreign Affairs Manual does not require and consequently provides no mandate for, or guidance on, the use of risk assessments. As previously discussed, the department does not routinely assess and manage its information security risks. There is no specific State policy requiring threat and vulnerability assessments, despite their known value.", "Third, State\u2019s policy manual does not sufficiently address users\u2019 responsibilities. For example, the manual does not emphasize that users should be accountable for securing their automated data, much as they are held responsible for securing classified paper documents. And it does not adequately emphasize the importance of information and computer resources as critical assets that must be protected. A significant finding in the department\u2019s Internet risk analysis is that users and even systems administrators \u201cdo not feel that their unclassified data is sensitive and therefore spend little to no effort in protecting the data from external disclosure.\u201d Clearly stated policy and effective implementation could contribute greatly to increased awareness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Is Not Adequately Promoting Awareness", "paragraphs": ["Often, computer attacks and security breakdowns are the result of failures on the part of computer users to take appropriate security measures. For this reason, it is vital that employees who use a computer system in their day-to-day operations be aware of the importance and sensitivity of the information they handle, as well as the business and legal reasons for maintaining its confidentiality and integrity. In accepting responsibility for security, users need to follow organizational policies and procedures, and acknowledge the consequences of security violations. They should also devise effective passwords, change them frequently, and protect them from disclosure. Further, it is important that users not leave their computers, workstations, or terminals unattended, and log out when finished using their computers. In addition, users should help maintain physical security over their assigned areas and computer resources.", "Many computer users at State had weak passwords that were easily guessed, indicating that they were unaware of or insensitive to the need for secure passwords. During our testing of State\u2019s systems, we were able to guess passwords on a number of machines on various networks using both manual guessing and automated password cracking programs. One way to prevent password guessing is to ensure that users use complex passwords such as those composed of alphanumeric, upper- and lower-case characters. However, there was no evidence that State was training its users to employ these techniques. We also found little evidence that State was training its users to prevent unauthorized access to information. For example, we called a user under the pretense that we were systems maintenance personnel and were able to convince her to disclose her password.", "We also bypassed physical security at a State facility and searched unattended areas for user account information and active terminal sessions. For example, in several instances we were able to enter a facility without the required State identification by using turnstiles designed for handicapped use. Once inside the facility, we entered unlocked work areas and found unattended personal computers logged onto a local area network.

For example, State has very little departmentwide capacity to respond to security incidents and individual bureaus currently handle incidents on an ad hoc basis. Problems experienced are not shared across the department because the incidents are not reported or tracked centrally and very little documentation is prepared. Furthermore, State does not regularly test its systems and network access controls through penetration testing. Finally, State has limited ability to visit all its worldwide locations to perform security evaluations.", "Our study of information security management at leading organizations found that an organization must monitor and evaluate its policies and other controls on a regular basis to periodically reassess whether it is achieving its intended results. Testing the existence and effectiveness of controls and other risk reduction efforts can help determine if they are operating effectively. Over time, policies and controls may become inadequate because of changes in threats, changes in operations, or deterioration in the degree of compliance.", "Because breaches in information security, computer viruses, and other related problems are becoming more common, an aggressive incident response capability is an important control and a key element of a good security program. Organizations need this capability to respond quickly and effectively to security incidents, help contain and repair any damage caused and prevent future damage. In recognition of the value of an incident response capability, federal agencies are now required by the Office of Management and Budget to establish formal mechanisms to respond to security incidents. Many organizations are now setting up emergency response teams and coordinating with other groups, including the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability and Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team. Knowing that organizations have a formidable response capability has proved to be a deterrent to hackers and other unauthorized users.", "State acknowledges that it needs the capability to detect and react to computer incidents and information security threats in a timely and efficient manner. At the time of our review, Department personnel were drafting incident response procedures. Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials told us that they are beginning to develop an incident response capability at the laboratory that they use to evaluate and accredit systems and software. Information management officials also told us that efforts were underway to obtain some services from the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability that would help them detect and react to unauthorized access to their systems.", "As discussed earlier, Bureau of Diplomatic Security performs evaluations of field locations to identify and make recommendations for correcting security weaknesses. However, Bureau of Diplomatic Security officials told us that budget constraints limit their ability to perform these evaluations and visit all locations on a systematic and timely basis. State officials also told us that they need to periodically assess the vulnerabilities of and threats to their systems. They also acknowledged the need for and importance of developing a reporting mechanism that can be used across the department to share information on vulnerabilities and incidents.", "An additional control mechanism that could help State ensure that controls are in place and working as intended, and that incident response capability is strong, is the annual financial statement audit. This audit is required to be conducted annually by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. A part of this audit could involve a detailed examination of an agency\u2019s general and application computer controls.

First, designating expanded Internet usage as a priority does not mean that State should proceed before it fully implements appropriate security controls. If State expands Internet connectivity without effectively mitigating the significant additional risks that entails, it will increase its already serious vulnerabilities to individuals or organizations seeking to damage State\u2019s operations, commit terrorism, or obtain financial gain.", "Second, State does not explain how \u201ccoordination on architecture and security functionality\u201d between the Chief Information Officer, Office of Information Management, and Bureau of Diplomatic Security will reduce Internet risks, including computer attacks from those wishing to steal information or disable the department\u2019s systems. As noted in this report, the organizations cited by State share various information security responsibilities, but have different missions and interests. This assertion does not address our recommendation that State establish an organization unit with responsibility for and authority over all information security activities, including protecting the department from computer attacks via Internet.", "Third, State identified a number of controls with it believes will reduce Internet security risks, including establishing a (logically) separate network (enclave) dedicated to Internet usage, and proactively monitoring the network and handling incidents. If effectively implemented and maintained, these measures can help reduce security risks. However, State did not specify how it planned to implement these controls, what resources it has allocated to these efforts, or if they would be completed before State expands its Internet usage. Our point is that State must actually implement and maintain security measures to mitigate these risks prior to increasing Internet usage.", "Finally, we discussed State\u2019s risk analysis of expanded Internet usage in our report. This analysis identifies numerous risks associated with expansion and options for addressing them. It is not sufficient that \u201cknown risk factors are being considered in the Internet expansion\u201d; as previously noted, State must mitigate these risks prior to increasing Internet usage.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we will not distribute it until 30 days from its date.
