Within available resources,  agencies must tailor these efforts to encourage voluntary compliance and  to inform regulated entities of regulatory requirements. While regulations  can generate substantial benefits to society, they also have costs, and  thus decisions agencies make about their regulatory designs and the way  that they enforce those regulations are important. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) estimated annual benefits from major  federal regulations issued in fiscal years 2005 through 2015 to be from  $208 billion to $672 billion, and estimated annual costs from $57 billion to  $85 billion.", "You asked us to review how agencies make key decisions related to  regulatory design, compliance and enforcement, and updating of  regulations.

Available regulatory designs range from  prescriptive regulations that specify the adoption of a certain technology  or action to designs that generally provide regulated entities with more  discretion and options for compliance, and in some instances hybrid  designs that incorporate both prescriptive and less prescriptive elements.  Alternatives to prescriptive regulations provide regulated entities with  greater flexibility.

In addition, requirements dealing  with exposures to toxic materials must be formulated in the terms of  \u201cobjective criteria and the performance desired\u201d whenever practicable.  The Clean Air Act provides EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) with  varying degrees of discretion to consider different regulatory designs  when developing its regulatory programs.

The second, the use of monitoring,  enforcement, and data reporting, ensures that regulations are followed  and deters noncompliance.

One way that agencies do this is by providing regulatory  guidance to regulated entities in the forms of Frequently Asked  Questions, tools, or factsheets. We reported in 2015 that agencies used a  wide variety of guidance to interpret new regulations and clarify policies in  response to questions or compliance findings. However, we have also  recommended that selected agencies could further help regulated entities  comply, and agencies have implemented those recommendations by  offering further clarifications and guidance.

Some of the selected agencies described frequent interaction with  regulated entities that were homogeneous or easily identified. As a result,  officials said it is easier for their agencies to ensure that regulated entities  are aware of applicable requirements, and that there may be less need to  invest in compliance assistance. For example, the operators of the  pipelines PHMSA regulates are a small and well known community.  Similarly, FSIS inspectors must be present at each meat, poultry, or egg  products facility, at frequencies determined by the type of operation being  conducted, for it to function. MSHA inspects a fixed number of mines, and  its inspectors are often onsite; however, MSHA officials stated that some  mines are better at complying with health and safety standards than other  mines.", "In contrast, large and heterogeneous communities present different  needs and considerations that may inform agencies\u2019 compliance  assistance and enforcement resource decisions. When regulated entities  are less likely to engage with inspectors or other federal officials,  agencies\u2019 decisions on allocating resources to ensure all regulated  entities understand requirements and to elicit voluntary compliance are  important. As previously discussed, OSHA regulates and monitors a large  and diverse community of regulated entities. EBSA monitors  approximately 685,000 private retirement plans and 2.2 million health  plans, and similar numbers of other welfare benefit plans. CMS regulates  more than 15,000 large and small nursing home facilities across the  country. In contrast to its pipeline-related regulations, PHMSA also  regulates a broad spectrum of transportation operators and hazardous  materials, requiring a different approach to disseminating information and  providing outreach.", "At the selected agencies we reviewed, agency officials told us that the  main objective of their regulatory enforcement efforts is to achieve  compliance with regulatory requirements. The selected agencies we  reviewed took different approaches to achieve compliance, and used  compliance and enforcement tools to escalate pressure to get regulated  entities to comply. For example, FDA officials told us that when the  agency identifies noncompliance, it may not immediately sanction a  regulated entity. Rather, the agency may begin with a meeting or call with  the regulated entity to address the noncompliance, and gradually  implement more serious regulatory compliance measures (such as a  negative inspection report or warning letter) or even seek an injunction  from the relevant court(s) if it cannot resolve the noncompliance.", "APHIS also uses a range of compliance assistance activities to promote  compliance and reserves its enforcement authority for the most serious  situations and noncompliance. For example, APHIS officials told us it  offers facilities struggling to maintain compliance the opportunity to work  with trained compliance specialists to develop options and plans to  promote future compliance. PHMSA officials told us the agency uses the  Systems Integrity Safety Program as a non-adversarial tool that provides  compliance assistance to regulated entities not currently in compliance.  They said that the agency generally will not initiate enforcement actions  against regulated entities enrolled in this program, but will pursue them if  there are violations that PHMSA believes to be willful, and where a safety  violation presents an imminent hazard.", "Despite a common objective to elicit compliance, selected agency  approaches to resource allocations for compliance and enforcement  differ. While some agencies consider allocations for compliance and  enforcement to implement each individual regulation, others allocate  resources across regulations and regulatory programs. For example,  Labor allocates compliance assistance and enforcement resources for  individual regulations depending on multiple factors, such as the nature of  the regulation and underlying subject matter. In contrast, EPA allocates  resources across regulations, programs, and regions. Its Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance works with each regional office  to allocate enforcement and compliance assistance resources for the  various programs across EPA.", "In addition, certain agencies we reviewed distinguish between compliance  assistance and enforcement activities, while others view these activities  as a joint effort. For example, EBSA allocates its resources between  benefits advisors, who provide compliance assistance, and their  enforcement staff. Conversely, OSHA inspectors provide compliance  assistance to regulated entities in addition to their enforcement roles,  supplementing onsite outreach and education provided by compliance  assistance specialists located in regional offices.", "To appropriately allocate their enforcement and compliance resources,  selected agencies we reviewed also collect and review data to identify  noncompliance trends. For example:", "OSHA uses collected data to identify national and local special  emphasis programs to highlight specific workplace health and safety  issues as the focus of targeted outreach and enforcement efforts.", "EBSA\u2019s national office annually establishes enforcement priorities\u2014 and shifts resources to respond with new emphases\u2014through its  guidance outlined in its Enforcement Program Operating Plan. In  preparing this guidance, EBSA assesses current enforcement  activities, identifies recent enforcement trends, analyzes available  information regarding industry activities and areas of noncompliance,  and reviews current policy considerations to identify possible areas of  potential risk within the employee benefit plan industry.", "EPA officials told us they use their National Enforcement Initiatives to  prioritize resources to compliance concerns that are particularly  entrenched or problematic. Further, EPA initiated its Next Generation  Compliance (NextGen) strategy to structure regulations and permits  with new monitoring and information technology, expanded  transparency, and innovative enforcement activities. NextGen was  designed to increase transparency and real time information made  possible by electronic reporting and advanced monitoring, and allows  the agency and its stakeholders the opportunity to experiment with  innovative approaches. Furthermore, EPA stated that it and its  stakeholders are better able to identify and solve environmental  issues, and address large regulated communities with approaches  that go beyond traditional single facility inspections and enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Made Efforts to Make Compliance Data Transparent and Accessible", "paragraphs": ["Transparency and availability of data are important to promoting  compliance and achieving regulatory objectives.

In 2007 and 2014, we reported on retrospective reviews of  individual regulations, which agencies use to evaluate how existing  regulations work in practice. As mentioned previously, two executive  orders issued in 2017 also emphasize the importance of retrospective  review, and officials from two agencies told us that they are currently  examining their regulatory evaluation processes in response to these  directives. To supplement retrospective review efforts, officials told us that  they collect feedback from both internal and external stakeholders on the  effectiveness of their regulatory design and enforcement decisions.

MSHA initially proposed specifying certain  requirements for a technology but used a performance-based  approach in its final rule. This experience subsequently informed  MSHA\u2019s proposed design for its new rule for proximity detection  systems for mobile machines, in which the agency proposed a  performance standard from the outset of the rulemaking.", "A BIS enforcement official told us that his office requested a revision  to an existing regulation that was difficult to enforce because it did not  provide clear requirements for how companies could determine when  a government-identified \u201cred flag\u201d\u2014a party on BIS\u2019 Unverified List\u2014 could be resolved. BIS received similar feedback from advisory  committees and revised the regulation for clarity.", "According to APHIS officials, they evaluate the effectiveness of their  compliance and enforcement activities by tracking compliance rates  under the Animal Welfare Act and through feedback from their  regulated entities. USDA officials also stated that interactions with  inspectors and listening sessions provide the department\u2019s agencies  with feedback.", "Selected agency officials cited concerns about changing the design of  established regulatory programs and the resources required for the rulemaking process. Two of our selected agencies mitigated these  concerns by piloting new regulatory designs. USDA implemented an  ongoing project\u2014the HACCP Inspection Models Project\u2014to assess the  viability of applying potential performance-based regulations to ensure  food safety at hog and poultry processing facilities. After assessing  inspection findings for the poultry pilot project and in response to public  comments on the program, they ultimately determined that the regulation  should be broadened to additional facilities. FAA used feedback from  pilot studies, in which more than 30 public-use airports participated, to  inform a proposed rule for Airport Safety Management Systems.", "Agencies also typically have flexibility to continue to change and adjust  their compliance and enforcement strategies in response to feedback and  evaluation without going through the rulemaking process to amend a final  regulation. As previously mentioned, agencies assess the effectiveness of  their enforcement and compliance efforts by collecting data to target their  enforcement efforts. In addition, selected agencies identified evaluations  of their enforcement and compliance efforts, including:", "DOL\u2019s Chief Evaluation Office officials told us they work with Labor  components to (1) develop and implement research studies, (2)  address how collected information is used to assess effectiveness,  and (3) support data analysis to inform management decision making.  For example, the office worked with OSHA to pilot changes to issuing  and following up citations to increase employer responsiveness.

EPA has also conducted research on what makes a regulation more  likely to be complied with and identified principles and tools to aid in  writing more effective regulations. For example, EPA directs rule  drafters to use clear and objective regulatory requirements and  applicability criteria, to structure regulations to make compliance  easier than noncompliance, and to leverage regulated entities and/or  third parties to assess compliance and prevent noncompliance. It also  encourages agency officials to leverage accountability and  transparency through e-reporting to government and public access to  data on websites.", "According to PHMSA officials, they developed formal enforcement  goals, strategies, and metrics after reviewing leading practices for  enforcement, including reviewing the compliance strategies at other  DOT subcomponents.

We also  asked department officials about subcomponents\u2019 use of compliance  activities other than traditional compliance assistance and enforcement.  To further inform our selection of subcomponents, we reviewed past  Inspector General and our own work on types of regulatory designs and  compliance strategies. We did not include independent regulatory  agencies in our scope as they are not subject to directives from the Office  of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs. Furthermore, many independent agencies promulgate and  administrate financial regulations, which present different considerations  and have been the focus of other work we performed.
