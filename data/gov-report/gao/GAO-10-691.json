To promote a more durable humanitarian solution to the plight of North Korean refugees, Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act in 2004. In reauthorizing the Act in 2008, Congress found that delays in processing North Korean refugees have led refugees to abandon their quest for U.S. resettlement.

The United States opened cases for 238 North Korean refugee applicants from October 2004 through March 2010, and 94 of these North Koreans arrived in the United States. As part of its recent actions to facilitate the processing of North Korean refugees, State has placed a high priority on these cases and provided additional staff time and resources to process these cases. However, according to U.S. officials, some U.S. requirements, such as conducting and clearing security checks, can delay U.S. processing. According to officials from the U.S. government and international organizations, the policies of some host countries also can affect U.S. processing of North Korean refugees. For example, some host countries delay granting North Korean refugees permission to leave their countries. Average processing times for North Koreans did not improve from fiscal years 2006 to 2008, the most recent year for which complete data were available. State officials said that one host country limited U.S. government access to North Koreans in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, resulting in longer average processing times for cases created in those years. While processing times for North Koreans were lower in fiscal year 2006 than those of some other refugee populations, the processing times were generally comparable in fiscal year 2008. From October 1, 2004, through March 2, 2010, at least 33 North Koreans have sought asylum protection to remain in the United States, but the actual number is likely higher. Of the 33 North Koreans, 9 individuals have been granted asylum, 15 are still pending, and 9 are categorized as \"other decisions,\" meaning their cases have been denied, dismissed, or withdrawn, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data. The actual number of individuals is likely higher for several reasons including agencies' difficulties in compiling information. North Koreans can seek asylum protection through two processes--the affirmative or the defensive. In the affirmative process, individuals who are physically in the United States may present an asylum application to USCIS and undergo a non-adversarial interview to determine their eligibility for asylum. In the defensive process, applicants request that the Department of Justice grant them asylum as a defense against removal from the United States. USCIS data do not include information on North Koreans who first claimed asylum before an Immigration Judge in the defensive process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Famine killed hundreds of thousands of North Koreans in the 1990s and  compelled a large number of others to leave in search of food, economic  opportunities, and escape from a repressive regime with a history of  human rights abuses.

Some of  the North Koreans who have escaped from North Korea desire to seek  resettlement in other countries, such as the Republic of Korea (known as  South Korea) and the United States, where they may be eligible for  resettlement benefits. North Korean refugees often face difficult and  dangerous journeys transiting to countries where they can seek  resettlement. Along the way, they are vulnerable to forced repatriation,  human trafficking, and lack of protection from the countries they transit  through. North Koreans face various economic, linguistic, social, medical,  and other challenges when resettling in the United States and South Korea.

We calculated the processing times for North Korean cases  created between fiscal years 2006 and 2008 to show the total number of  days between case creation and arrival in the United States. We do not  include cases created in fiscal year 2009 because all the refugees have not  arrived in the United States and thus the data are not complete.

To determine the number of North Koreans who have  sought asylum to remain in the United States and the process by which  they may do so, we reviewed documentation and data from U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) within DHS and from the Executive Office for  Immigration Review (EOIR) within the Department of Justice (DOJ).

According to South Korean officials,  since the South Korean constitution considers all Koreans on the Korean  Peninsula, including North Koreans, to be citizens of South Korea, North  Koreans generally are entitled to South Korean citizenship, with some  exceptions. However, the 2004 NKHRA sought to clarify that North  Koreans are not barred from eligibility for refugee or asylum consideration  in the United States on account of any legal right to citizenship that they  may enjoy under the South Korean constitution. Accordingly, USCIS and  EOIR officials told us that North Korean citizens applying for asylum who  have not availed themselves of South Korean citizenship only need to  establish a fear of persecution or torture in North Korea, while those  North Koreans who have availed themselves of South Korean citizenship  must establish a fear of persecution or torture in both countries. USCIS  and EOIR make a determination regarding the North Korean applicant\u2019s  citizenship before determining eligibility for U.S. asylum. DHS/USCIS  officials stated that at least one North Korean with South Korean  citizenship was placed in the defensive asylum process after the individual  was found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in both North  and South Korea. According to EOIR data, the North Korean was granted  asylum."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Number of North Koreans Who Have Sought Asylum in the United States Is Likely Higher than 33", "paragraphs": ["DHS/USCIS identified 33 North Koreans\u2014including their dependents  (some of whom may not be North Korean)\u2014who have sought asylum in  the United States since fiscal year 2005 through either the affirmative  asylum or credible fear process.

Because Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights  Act (NKHRA) in 2004, we focused our data collection efforts on fiscal  years 2005 through 2010.", "To assess how the U.S. government processes North Korean refugees, we  reviewed documents from the Departments of State (State) and Homeland  Security (DHS) related to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).  We also interviewed officials from State\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees,  and Migration (PRM); State\u2019s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs;  State\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; State\u2019s Office to  Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons; State\u2019s Office of the Special  Representative for North Korea Policy; DHS Security Advisory Opinion  Review Board; and DHS/U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services  (USCIS). Additionally, in Asia we interviewed representatives from the  International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the regional Overseas  Processing Entity (OPE) to understand the various steps in overseas and  domestic refugee processing. We spoke with both U.S.- and South Korean- based nongovernmental organizations (NGO), academics, think tanks, and  resettled North Koreans living in the United States to learn about the  characteristics of the North Korean refugee population; the challenges that  North Korean refugees face in their journeys from North Korea to gain  access to refugee admissions processing in Asia; and factors that North  Koreans consider when deciding in which country to resettle. We also  analyzed aggregate and country-specific data from State\u2019s Worldwide  Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) to determine the  processing times for North Korean refugees from fiscal years 2005 to 2010.  We asked State to provide us WRAPS data on an individual level because  some cases in WRAPS include more than one individual. To determine the  reliability of WRAPS data on North Korean refugees, we interviewed  State/PRM and OPE officials who input, monitor, and use these data about  procedures for collecting data and ensuring their accuracy. We also  reviewed the data at various stages of the refugee resettlement process  and analyzed the WRAPS Privacy Impact Assessment. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable to calculate the processing times for  North Korean cases created (1) between fiscal years 2006 and 2008 for the  total number of days between case creation and arrival in the United  States, and (2) between fiscal years 2006 and 2009 for the total number of  days between case creation and DHS approval of the case. We made this  determination because decisions on DHS approval had been made for all  pending cases created in fiscal year 2009 and prior years, but not all of the  pending cases that were created in fiscal year 2009 had arrived in the  United States, and therefore we did not have complete data on arrivals for  that year. However, although we worked to identify delays in U.S.  processing through interviews and an examination of the aggregate data,  we did not have access to individual-level data on the factors that might  influence processing times. Consequently, we were not able to probe these  factors using statistical modeling techniques, and cannot comment on the  extent to which changes in processing times might be attributable to  factors such as State Department or Asian countries\u2019 actions.", "To determine the number of North Koreans who have sought asylum to  remain in the United States and the process by which they may do so, we  reviewed relevant statutes as well as documentation and data from USCIS  and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within DHS and  from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) within the  Department of Justice (DOJ). We also interviewed officials from these  agencies. We analyzed data from USCIS\u2019s Refugees, Asylum, and Parole  System (RAPS) to determine the number of North Korean affirmative  asylum applicants processed from fiscal years 2005 to 2010. To determine  the reliability of RAPS data on North Korean asylum applicants, we  interviewed DHS/USCIS officials about their procedures for collecting  affirmative asylum application data and ensuring their accuracy. In  addition, we asked about data limitations and analyzed the RAPS Privacy  Impact Assessment and System of Records. We also obtained data from  USCIS\u2019s Asylum Prescreening System (APSS) to determine the number of  North Korean credible fear applicants processed between fiscal years 2005  and 2010. To determine the reliability of APSS data on North Korean  asylum applicants, we interviewed DHS/USCIS officials about their  procedures for collecting the credible fear data and ensuring their  accuracy. USCIS databases contain data on all citizens of North Korea in  both affirmative and credible fear cases, according to USCIS. We  requested data on North Korean asylum cases in the defensive process  from EOIR. However, EOIR was not able to provide comprehensive data  on its North Korean asylum cases without a manual review of individual  cases. According to EOIR officials, asylum applicants with North Korea as  their country of birth may have been categorized as South Koreans in  EOIR databases because, in accordance with eligibility requirements in the  INA, the database only tracks country of nationality and not birth, making  a manual review necessary to provide accurate data. EOIR officials also  stated that they did not have resources necessary to perform a manual  review. We determined that the RAPS and APSS data were sufficiently  reliable to report on the North Korean affirmative asylum cases and  credible fear cases from fiscal years 2005 to 2010. However, these data  may not represent all North Korean asylum cases filed during this time  period because EOIR was not able to provide data on North Koreans who  first claimed asylum defensively in front of an EOIR Immigration Judge.", "To describe the resettlement benefits offered to North Korean refugees  both in the United States and in South Korea and to describe the  resettlement experiences of North Koreans, which are discussed in  appendixes II and III of this report, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and policies regarding government-funded refugee resettlement programs  in both countries. We obtained documentation and spoke with officials at  State/PRM and the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s (HHS)  Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). Through field work in South Korea,  we met with South Korean officials from the Ministry of Unification to  discuss the assistance and social services that the South Korean  government provides to North Koreans. Information on South Korea\u2019s  resettlement program to North Koreans was provided by the South Korean  Ministry of National Unification and was not independently verified. We  also visited the Hanawon Social Adaptation Education facility, a South  Korean government-run facility, to observe the social adaptation training  provided to North Koreans and the Hangyeore Middle and High School to  see how North Korean students receive special educational courses to  prepare them for entrance into the South Korean school system. In  addition, we spoke with six resettlement agencies that have resettled  North Koreans in the United States: Episcopal Migration Ministries,  International Rescue Committee, Church World Service, Lutheran  Immigration and Refugee Service, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops,  and World Relief. We met with NGOs in both the United States and South  Korea who provide services to resettled North Koreans to discuss the  challenges that they have faced in serving this population. We also  interviewed several North Korean refugees who have resettled in the  United States about their experiences. Their views or experiences may not  be representative of all North Korean refugees. German, British, Japanese,  and Canadian foreign officials and embassies provided us with data on  North Koreans who have sought humanitarian protection in countries  other than the United States.
