Representatives have been designated in each DHS procurement office to help ensure that small businesses have opportunities to compete for DHS's contract dollars. In contrast, lack of clear accountability is hampering DHS's efforts to integrate the acquisition functions of its numerous organizations into an effective whole. DHS remains a collection of disparate organizations, many of which are performing functions with insufficient oversight, giving rise to an environment rife with challenges. Some of DHS's organizations have major, complex acquisition programs that are subject to a multitiered investment review process to help reduce risk and increase chances for successful outcomes in terms of cost, schedule, and performance. Part of the review process features a knowledge-based acquisition approach pioneered by successful commercial firms. DHS's adaptation of this best practices approach, however, does not require two critical management reviews and is missing some key information before decisions are made to invest additional resources. In addition, contractor tracking and oversight is not fully incorporated into DHS policy and guidance.

This mammoth task\u2014one of the  biggest mergers ever to take place within the federal government\u2014 involves a variety of transformational efforts, one of which is to design and  implement the necessary management structure and processes for  acquiring goods and services. In January 2003, we designated DHS\u2019s  implementation and transformation as high-risk because of the size and  complexity of the effort and the existing challenges faced by the  components being merged into the department. As it progresses through  the early stages of its merger and transformation, DHS has an opportunity  to put into place the necessary elements to become a 21st century federal  department with a high-quality acquisition organization that effectively  supports its critically important missions.", "DHS has some of the most extensive acquisition needs within the U.S.  government. In fiscal year 2004, the department obligated $9.8 billion to  acquire a wide range of goods and services\u2014such as information systems,  new technologies, weapons, aircraft, ships, and professional services.

We reviewed agency directives, memorandums, and  other documentation; interviewed agency officials; and analyzed agency  systems and processes. For the purposes of this report, the term  acquisition refers to the overall effort to acquire goods and services and  involves a host of activities. Acquisition begins when an agency establishes  its requirements and moves through a process that involves soliciting  providers of goods and services, awarding contracts, monitoring  performance, and handling various contract administration duties. In some  cases, acquisition can include development of a new product, such as a  weapon system or a database system. Acquisition also can be the simple  purchase of existing products. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which  governs acquisitions within the federal government, defines the term  procurement as being synonymous with acquisition.

The intent behind DHS\u2019s merger and transformation was to  improve coordination, communication, and information sharing among the  multiple federal agencies responsible for protecting the homeland. Critical  to performing the homeland security mission is the effective interaction  between and integration of these agencies and organizations.

DHS already has begun to  demonstrate that its strategic sourcing program can foster collaboration  across the department and at the same time maximize the department\u2019s  overall buying power.

To identify commodities with the most  potential for savings, strategic sourcing officials conducted a spend  analysis using available acquisition databases, such as the Federal  Procurement Data System, and input from DHS senior management. The  following 15 commodities were identified as having potential to leverage  the department\u2019s buying power:    aviation,    boats,    business wireless communications,    copiers,    energy,    enterprise software agreements,  facilities,  facilities security,    vehicle fleets,    mail,    office supplies,    professional services,    uniforms, and    weapons.", "Consistent with best practices, the strategic sourcing group then  established commodity councils composed of representatives from across  DHS. The commodity councils were assigned responsibility for further  collection and refinement of historical procurement data in order to better  assess future purchasing strategies. Typically, members from the strategic  sourcing group and the DHS organization with the most expertise in a  particular commodity serve as council cochairs. For example, a Coast  Guard official is a cochair for the boats commodity council.", "Commodity council cochairs said they were willing to devote time to the  strategic sourcing initiatives because they recognized the unique  opportunity DHS had to move forward to leverage buying power across  the department. Further, the cochairs were virtually unanimous in telling  us that the councils enable stakeholders to build awareness of a particular  commodity and develop strong relationships throughout DHS. They said  the councils foster a sense of community in which the various  organizations can share information, participate in forums, find  commonalities, engage in open and productive communication, and make  smarter and more collaborative business decisions. For example, the  weapons commodity council routinely shares information on ammunition.  When one DHS organization is low on ammunition, others help meet the  need. Appendix IV contains more detail on initiatives that several  commodity councils have undertaken.", "In fiscal year 2004, 4 commodity councils\u2014office supplies, boats, energy,  and weapons\u2014reported approximately $14.1 million in cost savings and  cost avoidances, and department officials expect the savings to continue  to grow. The savings have resulted from DHS negotiating lower rates with  suppliers and leveraging resources across the department. Figure 2 depicts  the savings trend over a 12-month period. The September 2004 surge  resulted when authorized DHS employees began purchasing pistols  through two large contracts, a strategy spearheaded by the weapons  commodity council.", "Some councils are encountering a problem faced by many federal  departments and agencies, namely, a shortage of comprehensive data  upon which to draw an accurate and detailed picture of what is being  spent on certain commodities over time. Strategic sourcing officials and  commodity council members told us that they cannot take full advantage  of spend analyses, nor can they accurately chart historical spending,  because DHS\u2019s acquisition databases do not contain enough procurement  data. The problem is compounded by the fact that when parts of existing  agencies, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the  Department of Justice, joined DHS, detailed information on its spending  history was not available. Without an accurate analysis of how DHS  organizations historically purchased a commodity, council members will  likely continue to rely on a patchwork of estimates, as well as information  from suppliers, to glean information on spending history and develop  purchasing strategies for the future.", "In addition, some commodity council members have found it challenging  to balance council duties with the demands and responsibilities of their  full-time positions within DHS. Officials told us that council meetings and  activities sometimes stall because council members must shift attention to  their full-time positions. Many commodity councils did not make much  progress during the last month of fiscal year 2004, we were told, because  council members\u2019 time was diverted to year-end priorities. Our prior work  on strategic sourcing shows that leading commercial companies often  establish full-time commodity managers to more effectively manage  commodities. Commodity managers help commodity councils define  requirements with internal clients, negotiate with potential vendors, and  resolve performance or other issues arising after a contract is awarded  and can help maintain consistency, stability, and a long-term strategic  focus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Business Program Off to Good Start", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s small business program has also had initial successes, reporting  that 35 percent of fiscal year 2004 obligations were awarded to small  business prime contractors, exceeding the department\u2019s goal of   23 percent.

The small business office, in  conjunction with the procurement staff across the department, has created  an outreach program that advises small businesses on ways to market  goods and services to DHS. Small business representatives have been  designated in each DHS procurement office, and each office is required to  submit a forecast of upcoming contract opportunities above $100,000.

An integrated acquisition organization is  essential to the department\u2019s success in executing policies and processes  to effectively obligate and administer billions of dollars in acquiring what  DHS needs to accomplish its mission. An October 2004 DHS management  directive emphasizes the need for an integrated acquisition organization  and reiterates the Chief Procurement Officer\u2019s responsibility to manage,  administer, and oversee all acquisition activity across DHS and to establish  a qualified acquisition workforce. In practice, these responsibilities are  spread throughout the department with unclear accountability. Further  hampering efforts to effectively integrate the acquisition function, the  directive provides that the Coast Guard and the Secret Service are  statutorily exempt from its application. We found no reasonable basis to  conclude that the directive could not be made applicable to them. The  various organizations within DHS continue to operate in a largely  disparate manner, with a lack of centralized oversight of compliance with  the department\u2019s acquisition regulation and policies. Staffing disparities  across the procurement organizations have only recently begun to be  addressed. We found that staffing shortfalls led Procurement Operations  to rely extensively on outside agencies for contracting support\u2014often for  a fee\u2014and that this office lacked adequate internal controls to properly  manage this interagency contracting activity.

It directs managers from each organization to commit  resources to training, development, and certification of acquisition  professionals. The directive also highlights the Chief Procurement  Officer\u2019s broad authority, including    management, administration, and oversight of departmentwide  acquisition, financial assistance, strategic sourcing, and competitive  sourcing programs;    promotion of career development and establishment of qualifications,  training, and certification standards for the acquisition and financial  assistance workforce;    development and publication of departmentwide acquisition and  financial assistance regulations, directives, policies, and procedures;    designation of all heads of contracting activities; and    development and maintenance of contracting officer warrant and  financial assistance officer programs, including designation of qualified  persons as contracting officers and financial assistance officers.", "However, the directive may not achieve its goal of creating an integrated  acquisition organization, because it creates unclear working relationships  between the Chief Procurement Officer and heads of DHS\u2019s principal  organizations. For example, the Chief Procurement Officer and the  director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement share responsibility for  recruiting and selecting key acquisition officials, preparing performance  ratings for the top manager of the contracting office, and providing  appropriate resources to support the Chief Procurement Officer\u2019s  initiatives. The policy leaves unclear how the responsibilities will be  implemented or what enforcement authority the Chief Procurement  Officer has to ensure that initiatives are carried out. In addition, directors  are only required to \u201cconsider\u201d the allocation of resources to meet  procurement staffing levels in accordance with the Chief Procurement  Officer\u2019s analysis.

The Coast Guard is one of the largest  organizations within DHS, with obligations accounting for about $2.1  billion in fiscal year 2004, nearly 23 percent of the department\u2019s total.  According to the directive, the Coast Guard is exempted by statute. We  disagree. We are not aware of any explicit statutory exemption that would  prevent the application of this directive. While several provisions in the  Homeland Security Act would limit the range of management initiatives  concerning the Coast Guard, none of them would appear to be applicable  in this case. For example, the Homeland Security Act requires the Coast  Guard to be maintained as a distinct entity within the department. Other  limitations prevent the transfer of assets, alteration of missions, and  changes in reporting relationships. The act also expressly provides that  \u201cthe authorities, functions, and capabilities of the Coast Guard to perform  its missions shall be maintained intact and without significant reduction  after the transfer of the Coast Guard to the department.\u201d We find nothing  in the directive that contravenes these limitations. Nothing in the  document would reasonably appear to threaten the status of the Coast  Guard as a distinct entity or otherwise impair its ability to perform  statutory missions.", "We raised the question of statutory exemption with the DHS General  Counsel, who shared our assessment concerning the explicit statutory  exemptions. He viewed the applicability of the management directive as a  policy matter, noting that \u201cthe determination of whether the application of  all or part of this  would impact the [Coast  Guard\u2019s] ability to perform its mission is not a legal matter and is more  appropriately made by DHS policy officials.\u201d We agree that DHS officials,  with sufficient reasons, could make a policy decision that a particular  management directive impacts the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to perform its  missions. In this instance, however, we found no evidence that such a  decision had been made.", "The directive also provides that the Secret Service is exempted by statute.  As with the Coast Guard, we are unaware of any specific statutory  exemption that would prevent the application of the directive. The  Homeland Security Act requires the Secret Service to be maintained as a  distinct entity within the department. The 2005 Homeland Security  Appropriations Act reiterates this requirement and imposes additional  limitations on altering reporting relationships.

The eighth organization, Procurement Operations, created to  meet the needs of the many DHS organizations that do not have colocated  procurement support, has a direct reporting chain to the Chief  Procurement Officer.", "Until recently, the Chief Procurement Officer, whom DHS\u2019s top leadership  delegated with the key responsibility of ensuring compliance with the  department\u2019s acquisition regulation and policies, had only two staff  members to carry out this duty. Consequently, the department\u2019s  acquisition oversight program relies extensively on self-assessments by  personnel in each procurement organization. A component of the  oversight program is a recent initiative to review DHS acquisition plans,  according to dollar thresholds, and to perform on-site evaluations of each  procurement organization. The fiscal year 2005 budget provided the Chief  Procurement Officer with five additional staff, but it is too soon to tell  whether this number will be adequate to effectively implement the  oversight program. Further, it remains unclear what the result would be if  an organization were found not to be in compliance with DHS\u2019s acquisition  regulation and policies.", "Our prior work shows that in a highly functioning acquisition organization,  the chief procurement officer is in a position to oversee compliance with  acquisition policies and processes by implementing strong oversight  mechanisms. Adequate oversight of acquisition activities across DHS is  imperative, in light of the department\u2019s mission and the problems that have  been reported by us and inspectors general for some of the large agencies  and organizations within the department. These reports have highlighted  the lack of important management controls for monitoring contractors and  ensuring efficiencies and effectiveness in the acquisition process. For  example, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General  reported that during its first year of operation, the Transportation Security  Administration relied extensively on contractors to accomplish its  mission. It also found that contracting officers wrote contracts without  clearly defined deliverables, and on occasion, contractors themselves  were permitted to determine requirements and define deliverables. As a  result, the cost of those initial contracts ballooned. The Transportation  Security Administration is in the process of devising policies and  procedures that require adequate procurement planning, contract  structure, and contract oversight. We have also reported that the former  U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service did not have the basic  infrastructure\u2014including oversight of procurement activities\u2014to ensure  that its contracting office was effective.

However, the department  faces challenges in implementing the plan.", "As part of its acquisition workforce planning efforts, the department has  not conducted an assessment of whether contracting staff within DHS are  appropriately distributed for the varying workloads in each procurement  organization. Our analysis shows that some disparities may exist. We  divided the obligated fiscal year 2004 dollars for each contracting office by  the number of contracting staff. While this approach is limited in that it  does not take into account the complexity of the acquisitions being  performed, it can provide senior leadership with an indication of whether  disparities may exist in the contracting workforce.

That year, Procurement Operations contracting staff on  the average handled $101 million per employee, whereas the contracting  staff for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center on the average  handled close to $2.7 million per employee. Disparities such as this may  indicate the need to assess the numbers of contracting staff across the  department to determine whether imbalances exist and whether actions  are needed to correct the imbalances.", "Another challenge to effectively implementing the acquisition workforce  plan pertains to the lack of enforcement of DHS\u2019s certification program.  While the plan calls for program managers responsible for acquisitions to  be certified in accordance with DHS\u2019s established training and experience  requirements, in practice, the means to enforce compliance is lacking. In  January 2005, the Director for the Acquisition Workforce Program, within  the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, determined that only   22 percent of the identified programs in the department had program  managers that had documented that they had the training and experience  requirements for certification. While the Office of the Chief Procurement  Officer has issued a management directive requiring program mangers to  meet the department\u2019s certification and training requirements\u2014and the  number of certified program managers has been increasing\u2014 accountability for complying with the certification program rests with the  principal organizations to whom the program managers report.

Lacking in-house capability, Procurement Operations has  turned extensively to interagency contracting, and we found that  management controls were not in place to effectively oversee this activity.  Interagency contracting occurs when a federal agency obtains supplies or  services through another federal agency, either by placing orders on  existing contracts that have already been awarded by the other agency, or  by asking the other agency to award and administer contracts or issue and  administer task orders on its behalf. Use of these contracts demands a  high degree of business acumen and flexibility on the part of the federal  acquisition workforce.", "We found that Procurement Operations had transferred almost 90 percent  of its obligations to other federal agencies through interagency agreements  in fiscal year 2004. For example, DHS transferred $12 million to the  Department of the Interior\u2019s National Business Center to obtain contractor  operations and maintenance services at the Plum Island Animal Disease  Center.

Based on a random sample of   136 interagency agreements between Procurement Operations and outside  agencies, we found that the office had not complied with the requirements  in the directive. We can project, for example, that in fiscal year 2004:    94 percent of Procurement Operations\u2019 files did not document that the  contracting staff had conducted the required analysis of alternatives to  justify the decision to pay an outside agency for contracting support;    47 percent of the files did not identify the contracting officer\u2019s  technical representative, although this information is required to be in  the files;    35 percent of the files did not contain the required determination and    96 percent of the files lacked an indication that contractor oversight  had been performed.", "Further, we found that Procurement Operations was not tracking how  much it is paying in fees to other agencies for contracting support.

In September 2004, DHS\u2019s Office of General Counsel reviewed   20 of Procurement Operations\u2019 interagency agreements and found that   16 were not legally sufficient. For example, 13 agreements appeared to  require performance by a contractor, but appropriate documentation was  not included in the contract files. Three were insufficient because it was  unclear whether the servicing agency would perform cost/price analysis  and trade-off, or whether Procurement Operations had conducted a  technical competition and expected the servicing agency to award without  a trade-off.

Although the  DHS budget for fiscal year 2005 includes $8.9 million to add contracting  staff through the fund, we found that the mechanics of making the fund  viable have not been worked out. Currently, Procurement Operations is  negotiating agreements with each organization it supports to determine  the terms and conditions of support and the dollar level to be contributed  to the fund.

In classifying  investments as level 1, DHS considers the following criteria: contract  costs; importance to DHS strategic and performance plans; high  development, operating, or maintenance costs; high risk; high return; and  significance in resource administration. Investments classified as levels   2, 3, or 4 are considered lower-level acquisitions and follow different  investment review processes. In addition, many of the major DHS  organizations, such as the Transportation Security Administration and the  Coast Guard, have their own review processes, which occur prior to  higher-level review in the department. Figure 4 illustrates who is involved  in the decision-making process and the levels of review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Policy Governing the Review Process Has Established a Solid Risk Management Framework, Additional Best Practices Would Benefit DHS", "paragraphs": ["DHS has adopted several best practices from lessons learned from leading  commercial companies and successful federal programs that, if applied  consistently, could refine its ability to reduce risk to meet cost and  delivery targets for major investments. One of the best practices is a  knowledge-based approach, or framework, for managers to hold reviews  at key decision points in order to reduce risk before investing resources in  the next phase of a program\u2019s development. The investment review policy  provides guidance to program managers to provide knowledge about  important aspects of a product at key points in the acquisition process and  encourages them to reduce technology risk through demonstration prior  to beginning a project. The policy also encourages program managers to  demonstrate a product\u2019s design with critical design reviews and reduce  manufacturing risk prior to a production decision. However, we found,  based on our extensive body of work on this knowledge-based approach,  that additional program reviews and knowledge deliverables could be  incorporated into the process as internal controls to better position DHS  to make well-informed decisions on its major, complex investments.", "Figure 5 generally depicts the major phases of the knowledge-based  approach and the positioning of three knowledge points, or gates, when  key reviews are scheduled. The figure applies the knowledge-based  approach to DHS\u2019s investment review framework and displays an  exclamation mark where key reviews or information are missing.", "As shown in figure 5, DHS review points do not fully align with the  knowledge-based approach. For example, DHS does not require a review  to ensure that an investment\u2019s design performs as expected before  investing in a prototype. In addition, DHS\u2019s mandatory review to proceed  to production does not occur until after low-rate initial production is well  under way. DHS does have a review for low-rate initial production;  however, it is at the discretion of the Investment Review Board. Our past  work has shown that successful investments reduce risk by ensuring that  high levels of knowledge are achieved at these key points of development.  We found that investments that were not reviewed at the appropriate  points faced problems\u2014such as redesign\u2014that resulted in cost increases  and schedule delays.", "We also found that some critical information is not addressed in DHS\u2019s  investment review policy or the guidance provided to program managers.  In other cases, it is made optional. For example, before program start  (knowledge point 1) is approved, DHS policy requires program managers  to identify an acquisition\u2019s key performance requirements and to have  technical solutions in place. This information is then used to form cost and  schedule estimates for the product\u2019s development to ensure that a match  exists between requirements and resources. However, DHS policy does  not establish cost and schedule estimates for the acquisition based on  knowledge from preliminary designs. At knowledge point 2, while DHS  policy requires program managers to identify and resolve critical  operational issues before proceeding to production, initial reviews\u2014such  as the system and subsystem reviews\u2014are not mandatory.", "Not all investments require the use of every piece of information included  under a knowledge-based approach. Many of DHS\u2019s major investments use  commercial, off-the-shelf products that do not require the same level of  review as a complex, developmental investment would. However, DHS is  investing in a number of major, complex systems, such as the Coast  Guard\u2019s Deepwater Program and the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status  Indicator Technology (US-VISIT), which incorporate new technology and  therefore require greater adherence to the knowledge-based approach in  order to ensure risk is reduced before committing to the next phase of the  investment. In addition, the added reviews and information included in the  knowledge-based approach may still be required for programs that use  existing technology, such as the Counter-MANPADS program, which  involves placing military technology on commercial aircraft.", "In addition to the knowledge-based approach and its associated controls,  DHS\u2019s investment review policy and guidance adopt a number of other  important acquisition management practices, such as requiring program  managers to submit acquisition plans and project management plans.  However, a key practice, contractor tracking and oversight, is not fully  incorporated in the policy and guidance. We have cited the need for  increased contractor tracking and oversight for several large DHS  programs. For example, we previously reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s  Deepwater program needed increased management and contractor  oversight. One activity of contract tracking and oversight requires that a  quantitative set of software and system metrics are used to define and  measure product quality and contractor performance. The Coast Guard  had not developed measurable performance goals or adhered to effective  procedures for holding the contractor accountable for its ongoing  performance. In addition, we previously recommended that the US-VISIT  program should improve attention to implementing acquisition best  practices. While DHS agreed, and the US-VISIT program office has  assigned responsibility for implementing the recommended management  controls, the department has not yet developed explicit plans or time  frames for defining and implementing acquisition best practices.

Further information on our methodology  and sampling error rates is as follows:  In fiscal year 2004, the Office of Procurement Operations predominately  obtained contracting services for its customers through the issuance of  interagency agreements with other government agencies. We drew our  sample from an original population of 984 agreements. Of the 150 items we  initially sampled, the department deleted 14 of these agreements and  withdrew them from the data. As a result, we adjusted the population of  agreements to which we are making estimates to 892 agreements. All  estimates are to these 892 agreements based upon a sample size of   136 agreements. In addition, 4 files were missing and were not able to be  reviewed, and one agreement was a duplicate. This resulted in only 131  files being reviewed.
