State\u2019s detailed statistical information about its Year 2000 effort is constantly changing as State\u2019s Year 2000 program evolves and remediation efforts progress. The information in our report represents the official figures reported to OMB in May 1998. The figures that State claims are more current are not substantially different from those reported in May 1998 and would not have any significant impact on our findings and recommendations. 2. Our assessment of the relative priority of fixing mission-critical and nonmission-critical systems did not include systems that State had designated as \u201ccompliant.\u201d Instead, this assessment is based on the comparative number of noncompliant mission-critical and nonmission-critical systems that have completed the implementation phase. Only 2 (5 percent) of the 40 mission-critical noncompliant systems had been implemented as of May 1998 whereas 31 (21 percent) of the 146 nonmission-critical noncompliant systems had been implemented. We agree that systems currently considered \u201ccompliant\u201d may not actually meet criteria for compliance and need to undergo their own, separate certification process. 3. State\u2019s comments indicate that it is still taking a flawed approach to contingency planning. Like the prioritization of systems, contingency planning needs to be a top down rather than a bottom up process. That is, agencies must first identify their core business processes and assess the Year 2000 risk and impact of these processes. Subsequently, they can develop plans for each core business process and infrastructure component. As noted in our Year 2000 Contingency Planning Guide, this approach enables agencies to consider and mitigate risks that extend beyond individual applications or systems. For example, as noted in our report, State depends on information and data provided by other federal agencies, international organizations, and private sector entities. It also depends on services provided by the public infrastructure, including power, water, transportation, and voice and data telecommunications. Neither of these dependencies will be considered if contingency planning is focused on individual internal systems. 4. State provided no evidence of increased identification and awareness of commercial bank interfaces. Neither could the Department identify the number of international interfaces it might have. 5.
