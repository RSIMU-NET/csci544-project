Ground radars are sensors used to detect and track targets, and precision guided munitions are weapons intended to accurately engage and destroy enemy targets.", "This report examines the extent to which potential overlap or duplication exists across the military services' (1) ground radar and (2) air-to-ground precision guided munitions programs.

The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), which validates requirements for DOD's largest acquisition programs, did not find unnecessary redundancy, and Air Force officials stated that G/ATOR could not meet all of the 3DELRR's requirements.", "The Army's AN/TPQ-53 Counterfire Radar and the Marine Corps' G/ATOR Block II have some overlapping requirements, but the AN/TPQ-53 does not meet certain key G/ATOR Block II requirements, therefore reducing the risk that the programs are duplicative. In this case, urgent operational needs and different acquisition approaches also led the Army and Marine Corps to establish separate acquisition programs.", "As a result of reviews conducted by the JROC and DOD's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), which develops guidance for analyzing alternative ways to fulfill capability needs, the Air Force made positive changes to the 3DELRR program, such as reducing some requirements to improve program affordability. CAPE also expanded the alternatives considered on acquisition programs to minimize potential duplication. DOD missed an opportunity to assess whether the capabilities of the AN/TPQ-53 and G/ATOR Block II were unnecessarily redundant. The JROC did not review the AN/TPQ-53 requirements because it was initially fielded to meet an urgent need and did not meet the dollar threshold to automatically trigger a review. However, the AN/TPQ-53 transitioned to the traditional, non-urgent needs acquisition process at which point the JROC could have reviewed it. Ensuring that the JROC and CAPE review new ground radar acquisitions could help DOD avoid duplication.", "DOD's active air-to-ground precision guided munitions programs are not duplicative, but potential for duplication exists in the future. The active programs share some capabilities, but characteristics such as the aircraft that can launch them distinguish them from one another. To the extent that overlapping capabilities exist, DOD officials said these capabilities provided needed flexibility for military operations. Cooperation among the military services contributed to the current lack of duplication. GAO found one example of potential future duplication. Both the Army and the Navy plan to buy the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System through fiscal year 2015 to meet their guided rocket needs, but starting in fiscal year 2016, they may pursue separate, potentially duplicative, efforts.

An all weather seeker capability allows a munition to  reach its target regardless of weather conditions or other obscurants,  such as smoke. For example, the Direct Attack Moving Target  Capability was developed to hit moving targets, but it does not have  the all weather seeker capability that would allow it to hit all moving  targets in all weather conditions.

DOD also provided technical comments that were  incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to assign all new  ground radar capability requirement documents with a Joint Staff  designation of \u201cJROC Interest.\u201d DOD responded that although it is likely  that new ground radar capability would be given the Joint Staffing  Designator of \"JROC Interest,\" the \u201cJROC Interest\u201d designation should  not be a required designation because it ignores the tiered Joint Staff  designation system process. DOD also noted that it would lessen the  impact and importance of the Functional Capabilities Boards and their  role to ensure minimization of duplication across the portfolio.", "We acknowledge that the Joint Staff has a process for determining Joint  Staff designations and for minimizing duplication across portfolios.", "However, as we point out in our report, DOD missed an opportunity to  review whether the capabilities of the Army\u2019s AN/TPQ-53 Counterfire  Radar and the Marine Corps\u2019 G/ATOR Block II were unnecessarily  redundant or duplicative because the requirements document for the  AN/TPQ-53 was given a lower-level designation. The way to ensure this  does not occur in the future is to make the \u201cJROC Interest\u201d designation  mandatory for all new ground radar programs. Hence, we still believe  without this designation for all new ground radar programs, the JROC and  CAPE may not have the opportunity to review programs that do not meet  the dollar threshold for an automatic \u201cJROC Interest\u201d designation and  may miss additional opportunities to encourage collaboration across the  military services.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation to require the Army and  Navy to assess whether a single solution and cooperative, preferably  competitive, contracting strategy offers the most cost effective way to  meet both services\u2019 needs if both services continue to pursue the  acquisition of Hydra-70 rocket guidance kits. DOD noted that it has a  process to consider redundancies across the services\u2019 programs, but it  was unclear what actions it planned to take to assess if the services could  use a single contracting strategy to meet its guided rocket needs. We  continue to believe that DOD should assess this option as part of its  consideration of potential redundancies.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Vice Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff; and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and  the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

We reviewed and analyzed documentation on  system requirements, capabilities, and other distinguishing factors to  determine if potential overlap or duplication exists. We interviewed  Department of Defense (DOD) officials in the Joint Staff; Offices of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology, and Logistics  and Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation; and the Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to discuss ground radar and air-to- ground precision guided munition programs as appropriate. We also  reviewed DOD analysis and interviewed DOD officials to identify  instances in which DOD found potential overlap or duplication during  acquisition and requirements reviews and what actions DOD took, if any,  in response to any identified potential overlap or duplication.", "For ground radar programs, we reviewed the mission, acquisition life  cycle, and basic system characteristics of the military services\u2019 active  ground radar programs, to determine which programs may have  overlapping or duplicative requirements and capabilities.

We excluded  the Army\u2019s AN/TPQ-50, which is in production, from our analysis because  unlike the other radar system we reviewed, it is a lightweight, man  portable radar. We also excluded Sentinel and Patriot from our analysis  because these programs are fielded systems undergoing modification.  Within our scope, we compared the common Key Performance  Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA) found in the program  requirements documents across the radars primarily performing air  surveillance and air defense and counterfire target acquisition missions.  KPPs are the performance attributes of a system considered critical to the  development of an effective military capability. KSAs are the attributes or  characteristics considered to be essential, but not critical enough to be  designated a KPP. The KPPs and KSAs included range, probability of  detection, search volume, reliability, availability, maintainability, and  transportability/mobility, as appropriate.", "For air-to-ground precision guided munitions, we reviewed the type,  acquisition life cycle, and select system characteristics of the military  services\u2019 active air-to-ground precision guided munitions programs, to  determine which programs may have overlapping or duplicative  requirements and capabilities.

Within our scope, we conducted an analysis comparing the precision  guided munitions characteristics that we determined, in consultation with  DOD subject matter experts, were most critical to assessing the system\u2019s  capabilities.
