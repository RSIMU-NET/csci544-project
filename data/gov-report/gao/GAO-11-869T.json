The overall mission of the GNDA is to use an integrated system of radiation detection equipment and interdiction activities to combat nuclear smuggling in foreign countries, at the U.S. border, and inside the United States. Terrorists smuggling nuclear or radiological material into the United States could use these materials to make an improvised nuclear device or a radiological dispersal device (also called a \"dirty bomb\"). The detonation of a nuclear device in an urban setting could cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and devastate buildings and physical infrastructure for miles. While not as damaging, a radiological dispersal device could nonetheless cause hundreds of millions of dollars in socioeconomic costs as a large part of a city would have to be evacuated--and possibly remain inaccessible--until an extensive radiological decontamination effort was completed. Accordingly, the GNDA remains our country's principal strategy in protecting the homeland from the consequences of nuclear terrorism. The GNDA is a multi-departmental effort coordinated by DHS's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). DNDO is also responsible for developing, acquiring, and deploying radiation detection equipment to support the efforts of DHS and other federal agencies. Federal efforts to combat nuclear smuggling have largely focused on established ports of entry, such as seaports and land border crossings. However, DNDO has also been examining nuclear detection strategies along other potential pathways and has identified several gaps in the GNDA, including (1) land border areas between ports of entry into the United States; (2) international general aviation; and (3) small maritime craft, such as recreational boats and commercial fishing vessels. Developing strategies, technologies, and resources to address these gaps remains one of the key challenges in deploying the GNDA. Some progress has been made, but DHS and other federal agencies have yet to fully address gaps in the global nuclear detection architecture. Specifically, this testimony discusses DHS's efforts to (1) address our prior recommendations to develop a strategic plan for the GNDA, including developing strategies to prevent smuggling of nuclear or radiological materials via the critical gaps DNDO identified, (2) complete the deployment of radiation detection equipment to scan all cargo and conveyances entering the United States at ports of entry, and (3) develop new technologies to detect nuclear or radioactive materials. This testimony is based on our prior work on U.S. government efforts to detect and prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials issued from October 2002 through September 2010.

In 2002, we  reported on the need for a comprehensive plan for installing radiation  detection equipment, such as radiation portal monitors, at all U.S. border  crossings and ports of entry. We reported that this plan should (1)  address vulnerabilities and risks; (2) identify the complement of radiation  detection equipment that should be used at each type of border entry  point\u2014air, rail, land, and sea\u2014and whether equipment could be  immediately deployed; (3) identify longer-term radiation detection needs;  and (4) develop measures to ensure that the equipment is adequately  maintained. More recently, in July 2008, we testified that DNDO had not  developed an overarching strategic plan and recommended that DHS  coordinate with the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State to  develop one. In January 2009, we recommended that the Secretary of  Homeland Security develop a strategic plan for the domestic part of the  global nuclear detection strategy to help ensure the success of initiatives  aimed at closing gaps and vulnerabilities in the United States. We stated  that this plan should focus on, among other things, establishing time  frames and costs for the three gaps DNDO had identified\u2014land border  areas between ports of entry, aviation, and small maritime vessels. DHS  agreed with the recommendation that we made in our 2008 testimony on  the need for an overarching strategic plan to guide future efforts to  combat nuclear smuggling and move toward a more comprehensive  global nuclear detection strategy. DHS did not comment on our 2009  recommendation to develop a plan for the domestic portion of the GNDA  but noted that it aligned with DNDO\u2019s past, present, and future actions.", "As we will discuss today, some progress has been made, but DHS and  other federal agencies have yet to fully address gaps in the global nuclear  detection architecture.

The  strategic plan establishes a broad vision for the GNDA, identifies cross- cutting issues, defines several objectives, and assigns mission roles and  responsibilities to the various federal entities that contribute to the GNDA.  For example, the Department of Energy has the lead for several aspects  of enhancing international capabilities for detecting nuclear materials  abroad, DHS has the lead for detecting nuclear materials as they cross  the border into the United States, and the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission has the lead on reporting and sharing information on lost or  stolen domestic radiological material. In addition, earlier this year, DNDO  released the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Joint Annual  Interagency Review 2011. This review describes the current status of  GNDA and includes information about the multiple federal programs that  collectively seek to prevent nuclear terrorism in the United States.", "However, neither the strategic plan nor the 2011 interagency review  identifies funding needed to achieve the strategic plan\u2019s objectives nor  establishes monitoring mechanisms to determine programmatic progress  and identify needed improvements\u2014key elements of a strategic plan that  we previously identified in our recommendations. Furthermore, while the  plan and the 2011 interagency review discuss previously identified gaps  in the domestic portion of the architecture, neither discusses strategies,  priorities, timeframes, or costs for addressing these gaps.", "In our view, one of the key benefits of a strategic plan is that it is a  comprehensive means of establishing priorities, and using these priorities  to allocate resources so that the greatest needs are being addressed. In  times of tight budgets, allocating resources to address the highest  priorities becomes even more important. Accordingly, while DNDO\u2019s new  strategic plan represents an important step forward in guiding the  development of the GNDA, DNDO could do more to articulate strategies,  priorities, timeframes and costs in addressing gaps and further deploying  the GNDA in order to protect the homeland from the consequences of  nuclear terrorism. In discussing these issues with DHS officials, they  indicated that they will be producing a GNDA implementation plan later  this year that will address several of these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Continues to Make Progress in Deploying Radiation Detection Equipment", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in June 2010, DHS has made significant progress in  deploying both radiation detection equipment and developing procedures  to scan cargo and conveyances entering the United States through fixed  land and sea ports of entry for nuclear and radiological materials,  deploying nearly two-thirds of the radiation portal monitors identified in its  deployment plan. According to DHS officials, the department scans nearly  100 percent of the cargo and conveyances entering the United States  through land borders and major seaports.

Similarly, at major seaports, according  to DHS officials, the department scans nearly all containerized cargo  entering U.S. seaports for nuclear and radiological materials. DHS has  deployed radiation portal monitors to major American seaports that  account for the majority of cargo entering the United States. However,  some smaller seaports that receive cargo may not be equipped with these  portal monitors.

Much of the scanning for radioactive materials  that takes place at these ports of entry is conducted with portable, hand- held radioactive isotope identification devices. According to DHS officials,  international rail traffic represents one of the most difficult challenges for  radiation detection systems due to the nature of trains and the need to  develop close cooperation with officials in Mexico and Canada. In  addition, DHS officials told us that rail companies resist doing things that  might slow down rail traffic and typically own the land where DHS would  need to establish stations for primary and secondary screening.

DHS officials stated that their  experience in scanning air cargo at a few major international airports in  the United States has helped them develop scanning procedures and  inform current and future deployment strategies for both fixed and mobile  radiation detection equipment. These officials said that they believe that  further operational experience and research is necessary before they can  develop practical mobile scanning strategies and procedures.

Specifically, we have reported on longstanding problems with DNDO\u2019s  efforts to deploy advanced spectroscopic portal (ASP) radiation detection  monitors. The ASP is a more advanced and significantly more expensive  type of radiation detection portal monitor to replace the polyvinyl toluene  (PVT) portal monitors in many locations that the Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), an agency within DHS, currently uses to screen cargo  at ports of entry. We have issued numerous reports regarding problems  with the cost and performance of the ASPs and the lack of rigor in testing  this equipment. For example, we found that tests DNDO conducted in  early 2007 used biased test methods that enhanced the apparent  performance of ASPs and did not use critical CBP operating procedures  that are fundamental to the performance of current radiation detectors.  In addition, in 2008 we estimated the lifecycle cost of each standard  cargo version of the ASP (including deployment costs) to be about  $822,000, compared with about $308,000 for the PVT portal monitor, and  the total program cost for DNDO\u2019s latest plan for deploying radiation  portal monitors to be about $2 billion. Based in part on our work, DHS  informed this Committee in February 2010, after spending over $280  million, that the department had scaled back its plans for the development  and use of ASP technology.", "In September 2010, we also reported that DNDO was simultaneously  engaged in the research and development phase while planning for the  acquisition phase of its cargo advanced automated radiography system  (CAARS) to detect certain nuclear materials in vehicles and containers at  CBP ports of entry. DNDO pursued the deployment of CAARS without  fully understanding that it would not fit within existing inspection lanes at  ports of entry and would slow down the flow of commerce through these  lanes, causing significant delays. DHS spent $113 million on the program  since 2005 and cancelled the acquisition phase of the program in 2007.  As we reported in September 2010, no CAARS machines had been  deployed, and CAARS machines from various vendors were either  disassembled or sitting idle without being tested in a port environment.", "DNDO\u2019s problems developing the ASP and CAARS technologies are  examples of broader challenges DHS faces in developing and acquiring  new technologies to meet homeland security needs. Earlier this month,  we testified that DHS has experienced challenges managing its  multibillion-dollar acquisition efforts, including implementing technologies  that did not meet intended requirements and were not appropriately  tested and evaluated, and has not consistently completed analysis of  costs and benefits before technologies were implemented. In June  2011, DHS reported to us that it is taking steps to strengthen its  investment and acquisition management processes across the  department. For example, DHS plans to establish a new model for  managing departmentwide investments, establish new councils and  boards to help ensure that test and evaluation methods are appropriately  considered, and is working to improve the quality and accuracy of  program cost estimates. As we testified, we believe these are positive  steps and, if implemented effectively, could help the department address  many of its acquisition challenges. However, it is still too early to assess  the impact of DHS\u2019s efforts to address these challenges. Going forward,  we believe DHS will need to demonstrate measurable, sustained  progress in effectively implementing these actions.", "Chairman Lungren, Ranking Member Clarke, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
