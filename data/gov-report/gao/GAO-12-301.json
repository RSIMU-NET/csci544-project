Of that amount, $16.7 billion remains outstanding, and most of these investments were concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions. In particular, as of January 31, 2012, 25 institutions accounted for $11.2 billion, or 67 percent, of outstanding investments. As of November 30, 2011, Treasury estimated that CPP would have a lifetime income of $13.5 billion after all institutions exited the program. As of January 31, 2012, 341 institutions had exited CPP, almost half by repaying CPP with funds from other federal programs. Institutions continue to exit CPP, but the number of institutions missing scheduled dividend or interest payments has increased. For example, as of November 30, 2011, the number of institutions that had missed their quarterly payments rose to 158, a marked increase from 8 in February 2009, even though CPP had fewer participants. The number of CPP institutions designated as problem banks\u0097that is, demonstrating financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that threatened their continued financial viability\u0097also rose from 47 in December 2009 to 130 in December 2011.

In particular, the remaining CPP institutions tended to be less profitable and hold riskier assets than other institutions of similar asset size. Among other things, they had significantly lower returns on average assets and higher percentages of noncurrent loans than former CPP and non-CPP institutions. They also held less regulatory capital and reserves for covering losses. Although GAO\u0092s analysis found differences in the financial health of remaining and former CPP institutions, Treasury\u0092s quarterly financial analysis of CPP institutions did not distinguish between them.

These investments were made  through the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), which was the first and  largest initiative under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  Specifically, Treasury\u2019s authority under TARP enabled it to buy or  guarantee up to almost $700 billion of the \u201ctroubled assets\u201d that it deemed  to be at the heart of the crisis, including mortgages, mortgage-backed  securities, and any other financial instruments, such as equity  investments. Treasury created CPP in October 2008 to provide capital to  viable financial institutions by using its authority to purchase preferred  shares and subordinated debt. In return for its investments, Treasury  received dividend or interest payments and warrants. The program was  closed to new investments on December 31, 2009, and since then  Treasury has continued to oversee its CPP investments and collect  dividend and interest payments and sell warrants. Some participants have  repurchased their preferred shares or subordinated debt and exited the  program with the approval of their primary bank regulators.", "Rather than purchasing troubled mortgage-backed securities and whole  loans, as initially envisioned under TARP, Treasury used CPP  investments to strengthen financial institutions\u2019 capital levels. Treasury  determined that strengthening capital levels was the more effective  mechanism to help stabilize financial markets, encourage interbank  lending, and increase confidence in lenders and investors. Treasury  believed that strengthening the capital positions of viable financial  institutions would enhance confidence in the institutions themselves and  the financial system overall and increase the institutions\u2019 capacity to  undertake new lending and support the economy. Financial institutions  interested in receiving CPP investments sent their applications directly to  their primary federal banking regulators, which performed the initial  evaluations. Institutions were evaluated to determine their long-term  strength and viability, and weaker institutions were encouraged by their  regulators to withdraw their applications. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial  Stability (OFS), established to implement TARP, made the final decisions,  although the regulators provided recommendations for approving or  denying applications.

As of January 31, 2012,  Treasury had received $211.5 billion in repayments and income from its  CPP investments, exceeding the amount originally disbursed by $6.6  billion (see fig. 2).

In considering whether to nominate  directors, Treasury said that it proceeds in two steps. First, after an  institution misses five dividend or interest payments, Treasury sends OFS  staff members to observe board meetings. Second, once an institution  has missed six dividend payments, Treasury decides whether to  nominate a board member based on a variety of considerations, including  what it learns from the board meetings, the institution\u2019s financial condition,  the function of its board of directors, and the size of its investment.January 31, 2012, Treasury had elected 12 board members to 7 CPP  institutions.", "At the same time that the number of institutions missing dividend  payments has risen, the number of CPP institutions on FDIC\u2019s problem  bank list has generally increased. FDIC compiles a list of banks with  demonstrated financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that  threaten their continued financial viability and publicly reports the number  of such institutions on a quarterly basis. While some CPP funds were  disbursed to bank holding companies, FDIC\u2019s problem bank list does not  include them. FDIC accounted for bank holding companies participating in  CPP when their subsidiary depositories were designated as problem  banks.

The institutions\u2019 financial strength will also be a primary factor in whether  they make dividend payments, and institutions that continue to miss  payments may have difficulty exiting CPP. Financial institutions that are  on the problem bank list because of their financial weaknesses, as  identified by their regulators, may also face challenges exiting the  program. In late 2013, CPP dividend and interest rates will begin  increasing (as described earlier), and the increase may prompt  institutions to repay their investments more quickly.

For the quarter ending December 31, 2011, remaining  CPP institutions had a median return on average assets of 0.25,  compared with 0.74 for former CPP institutions and 0.69 for the non-CPP  group. The return on average equity measure, which shows the profit a  company generates with the money shareholders have invested, showed  a similar but more pronounced relationship.

First, remaining CPP institutions had a consistently higher percentage of  noncurrent loans than former CPP institutions and the non-CPP group  from March 2008 to December 2011 (see fig. 10). While the median  noncurrent loan percentage increased over time for each group before  leveling off, the rate of growth was steeper and the period of growth  lasted longer for the remaining CPP institutions.

Both  remaining and former CPP institutions had higher proportions of  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans  compared with the non-CPP group (see fig. 11). As we have reported,  delinquencies on commercial real estate loans have more than doubled  since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, and such loans are prone to  volatility because of high transaction costs, rigid and constrained supply,  and a number of other factors. While remaining CPP institutions had  about the same proportion of commercial real estate loans overall as the  former CPP institutions (about 35 percent), they had a noticeably higher  proportion of construction and land development loans compared to the  non-CPP group. Although these loans made up only about 4 to 8 percent  of the banks\u2019 overall portfolios, construction and land development loans  are generally considered to be particularly risky. For example, they often  have long development times and can include properties that are built  without firm commitments from buyers or lessees.", "Compared with former CPP institutions and the non-CPP group,  remaining CPP institutions held less regulatory capital as a percentage of  assets. Regulators require minimum amounts of capital to lessen an  institution\u2019s risk of default and improve its ability to sustain operating  losses. Capital can be measured in several ways, but we focused on Tier  1 capital, which includes both risk-based and common risk-based  measures, because it is the most stable form of regulatory capital. The  Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio measures Tier 1 capital as a share of risk- weighted assets, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio measures common  equity Tier 1 as a share of risk-weighted assets.", "Remaining CPP institutions had lower Tier 1 capital levels than former  CPP institutions and the non-CPP group. On a quarterly basis, for  example, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for remaining CPP participants  generally remained well below those for the former CPP institutions and  the non-CPP group from March 2008 to December 2011 (see fig. 12).  While Tier 1 capital levels of the remaining institutions have trended  slightly upward since December 2009, levels for the other two groups  rose at a slightly higher rate, increasing the gap between the groups.

For the remaining CPP institutions, TARP  funds comprised a median of 25 percent of the institution\u2019s Tier 1 capital.  As was the case with the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the common  equity Tier 1 ratio for remaining CPP institutions generally remained well  below those for the former CPP institutions and the non-CPP group from  March 2008 to December 2011 (see fig. 12). However, the differences  between both CPP groups and the non-CPP group were more  pronounced possibly because common equity Tier 1 generally does not  include TARP funds. While the ratio for remaining CPP institutions  stayed relatively stable from March 2008 to December 2010, it has since  begun increasing slightly. As of December 31, 2011, the common equity  Tier 1 ratio was lower for remaining CPP institutions than the other two  groups. In particular, common equity Tier 1 for remaining CPP institutions  comprised a median of 10.53 percent of risk-weighted assets, compared  with 12.09 percent for former CPP institutions and 14.68 percent for the  non-CPP group.", "In addition to holding less regulatory capital than former CPP institutions  and the non-CPP group, remaining CPP institutions also had significantly  lower reserves for covering losses. On a quarterly basis, the median ratio  of reserves to nonperforming loans was consistently lower for remaining  CPP institutions than for the other groups from March 2008 to December  2011 (see fig. 14). The ratio for all three groups declined in 2008 and  2009, and while it began to stabilize for the non-CPP group in 2010, it  continued to decline for remaining CPP institutions. As of December 31,  2011, the ratio of reserves to nonperforming loans was lower for  remaining CPP institutions (40.87) than for former CPP participants  (70.93) and the non-CPP group (59.56). We also compared loan loss  provisions to net charge-offs and found that the remaining CPP  institutions had lower ratios (74.48) than former CPP institutions (92.47)  but higher than the non-CPP group (72.78).", "Remaining CPP institutions also had noticeably higher Texas Ratios than  former CPP institutions and the non-CPP group. The Texas Ratio helps  determine a bank\u2019s likelihood of failure by comparing its troubled loans to  its capital. The higher the ratio, the more likely the institution is to fail.  On a quarterly basis, median Texas Ratios for remaining CPP institutions  remained consistently above those for former CPP institutions and the  non-CPP group from March 2008 to December 2011 and rose at a faster  rate (see fig. 15). Since December 2010, median Texas Ratios for  remaining CPP institutions have stabilized, while those for former CPP  and the non-CPP group have shown slight decreases. As of December  31, 2011, remaining CPP institutions had a median Texas Ratio of 51.14,  compared with 20.06 for former CPP institutions and 17.20 for the non- CPP group.

The analysis  included financial data in three categories: balance sheet and off-balance  sheet items, performance ratios, and asset quality measures. Treasury  grouped the institutions by asset size and separated institutions that  received CPP funds from those that did not.", "However, Treasury did not compare remaining CPP institutions to former  CPP institutions. While Treasury\u2019s analysis is intended to measure CPP\u2019s  effect on the financial institutions that participated, its analysis could also  provide useful information about the relative likelihood of remaining  institutions to repay their investments and exit the program. Our analysis  found differences in the financial condition of remaining and former CPP  institutions, suggesting that the remaining CPP institutions could face  challenges in repaying CPP funds and exiting the program. Treasury said  that it did not perform this analysis because the quarterly CPP report was  designed only to group banks into categories based on asset size and to  analyze the differences between CPP and non-CPP institutions.", "In our prior work, we noted that Treasury should ensure transparency in  providing financial assistance to private market participants, especially  given the unprecedented government assistance it provided to the  banking industry during the recent financial crisis. We also  recommended that Treasury ensure that external stakeholders, including  Congress and the public, are informed about the program\u2019s current  strategy.", "Treasury\u2019s quarterly CPP analysis is a useful tool in providing  transparency about the public\u2019s investment in financial institutions. In  addition, Treasury makes public a variety of products on its website\u2014 including transaction reports, dividend and interest reports, and monthly  105(a) reports\u2014that account for all investments and provide program- level summaries for all TARP programs. However, the usefulness and  transparency of Treasury\u2019s quarterly CPP analysis\u2014which includes  detailed bank financial measures\u2014could be enhanced by distinguishing  between former and remaining CPP institutions because the financial  characteristics of these two groups differ. As a result, Congress and the  public would benefit from a more complete and meaningful picture of the  condition of the remaining institutions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CPP repayments and other income surpassed the program\u2019s original  investment disbursements, and as institutions continue to exit CPP, this  surplus continues to grow. Furthermore, Treasury\u2019s latest estimate  (November 30, 2011) projects CPP\u2019s lifetime income to be $13.5 billion.  However, a growing number of the remaining institutions have missed  scheduled dividend or interest payments or appeared on FDIC\u2019s problem  bank list. As a result, there is increased concern regarding the speed at  which institutions will be able to repay remaining funds and how much of  these funds Treasury will ultimately recover. In particular, our analysis  showed that institutions remaining in CPP were generally less profitable,  held riskier assets and less regulatory capital, and had lower reserves for  covering losses compared with institutions that repaid their CPP  investment and those that never participated in the program. Despite the  noticeably different financial profiles for remaining and former CPP  institutions, Treasury\u2019s quarterly analysis of CPP institutions does not  distinguish between these two groups. As we have indicated in past  reports on TARP, transparency remains a critical element in the  government\u2019s unprecedented assistance to the financial sector. Such  transparency helps clarify to policymakers and the public the costs of  TARP assistance and the government\u2019s intervention in various markets.  Enhancing the quarterly CPP analysis by distinguishing between  remaining and former CPP participants will help Treasury provide  Congress and the public with a more transparent and comprehensive  understanding of the status of CPP and the institutions that participate   in it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide Congress and the public with more transparent and  comprehensive information on remaining CPP institutions and enhance  its reporting, the Secretary of the Treasury should consider analyzing and  reporting on remaining and former CPP participants separately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Treasury for its review and comment.

In particular, we  used Treasury\u2019s January 2012 Monthly 105(a) Report to Congress to  determine the dollar amounts of outstanding investments, the number of  remaining and former participants, and the geographical distribution of  each as of January 31, 2012. We also used data from Treasury\u2019s  Dividends and Interest reports from February 2009 through November  2011 to determine the extent to which participants had missed payments  throughout the life of the program. We interviewed Treasury officials to  compare our missed payment counts with theirs and noted the reasons  for any differences. Finally, we obtained from FDIC summary information  on its quarterly problem bank list to show the trend of CPP institutions  appearing on the list from December 2008 through December 2011.", "To assess the financial condition of institutions that received investments  under CPP, we reviewed industry documents\u2014including summaries of  monitoring data used by banking regulators and Treasury\u2014to identify  commonly used financial measures for depository institutions. These  measures help demonstrate an institution\u2019s financial health related to a  number of categories including profitability, asset quality, capital  adequacy, and loss coverage. We obtained such financial data for all  depository institutions using SNL Financial\u2014a private financial database  that contains publicly filed regulatory and financial reports. We merged  the data with SNL Financial\u2019s CPP participant list to create the three  comparison groups\u2014remaining CPP institutions, former CPP institutions,  and a non-CPP group comprised of all institutions that did not participate  in CPP. We analyzed financial data on 352 remaining CPP institutions  and 256 former CPP institutions that exited CPP through full repayments  or conversion to the Community Development Capital Initiative or the  Small Business Lending Fund, accounting for 608 of the 707 CPP  participants (see table 1). Our analysis focused on institutions with less  than $10 billion in assets, which constituted nearly all of the remaining  CPP institutions. Of the 99 CPP institutions excluded from our analysis,  11 were active participants with more than $10 billion in assets; 37 were  former participants with more than $10 billion in assets; and 51 had no  data available in SNL Financial, had been acquired, or were defunct. We  compared the remaining and former CPP institutions to a non-CPP group  of 8,040 active financial institutions for which financial information was  available. We chose to present median values, but we also analyzed  weighted averages and found the results to be similar. Financial data  were available from SNL Financial for 427 of the 608 CPP institutions,  and we accounted for an additional 181 institutions using the financial  information of the holding company\u2019s largest subsidiary from SNL  Financial. All financial information reflects quarterly regulatory filings on  December 31, 2011, unless otherwise noted. We downloaded all financial  data from SNL Financial on February 20, 2012. Finally, we compared our  analysis with Treasury\u2019s quarterly analysis of CPP institutions, and we  also leveraged our past reporting on the Troubled Asset Relief Program  (TARP), as well as that of the Special Inspector General for TARP, as  appropriate.", "We determined that the financial information used in this report, including  CPP program data from Treasury and financial data on institutions from  SNL Financial, was sufficiently reliable to assess the condition and status  of CPP and institutions that participated in the program. For example, we  tested the Office of Financial Stability\u2019s internal controls over financial  reporting as it relates to our annual audit of the office\u2019s financial  statements and found the information to be sufficiently reliable based on  the results of our audits of fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial  statements for TARP. We have assessed the reliability of SNL Financial  data\u2014which is obtained from financial statements submitted to the  banking regulators\u2014as part of previous studies and found the data to be  reliable for the purposes of our review. We verified that no changes had  been made that would affect its reliability.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2011 to March 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
