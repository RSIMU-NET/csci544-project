In light of concerns raised by recent security breaches involving resellers, GAO was asked to determine how the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State and the Social Security Administration use personal data from these sources. In addition, GAO reviewed the extent to which information resellers' policies and practices reflect the Fair Information Practices, a set of widely accepted principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal data. GAO also examined agencies' policies and practices for handling personal data from resellers to determine whether these reflect the Fair Information Practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and State and the Social Security Administration reported that they used personal information obtained from resellers for a variety of purposes. Components of the Department of Justice (the largest user of resellers) used such information in performing criminal investigations, locating witnesses and fugitives, researching assets held by individuals of interest, and detecting prescription drug fraud. The Department of Homeland Security used reseller information for immigration fraud detection and border screening programs. Uses by the Social Security Administration and the Department of State were to prevent and detect fraud, verify identity, and determine eligibility for benefits. The agencies spent approximately $30 million on contractual arrangements with resellers that enabled the acquisition and use of such information. About 91 percent of the planned fiscal year 2005 spending was for law enforcement (69 percent) or counterterrorism (22 percent). The major information resellers that do business with the federal agencies we reviewed have practices in place to protect privacy, but these measures are not fully consistent with the Fair Information Practices. For example, the principles that the collection and use of personal information should be limited and its intended use specified are largely at odds with the nature of the information reseller business, which presupposes that personal information can be made available to multiple customers and for multiple purposes. Resellers said they believe it is not appropriate for them to fully adhere to these principles because they do not obtain their information directly from individuals. Nonetheless, in many cases, resellers take steps that address aspects of the Fair Information Practices. For example, resellers reported that they have taken steps recently to improve their security safeguards, and they generally inform the public about key privacy principles and policies. However, resellers generally limit the extent to which individuals can gain access to personal information held about themselves, as well as the extent to which inaccurate information contained in their databases can be corrected or deleted. Agency practices for handling personal information acquired from information resellers did not always fully reflect the Fair Information Practices. That is, some of these principles were mirrored in agency practices, but for others, agency practices were uneven. For example, although agencies issued public notices on information collections, these did not always notify the public that information resellers were among the sources to be used. This practice is not consistent with the principle that individuals should be informed about privacy policies and the collection of information. Contributing to the uneven application of the Fair Information Practices are ambiguities in guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding the applicability of privacy requirements to federal agency uses of reseller information. In addition, agencies generally lack policies that specifically address these uses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent security breaches at large information resellers, such as  ChoicePoint and LexisNexis, have highlighted the extent to which such  companies collect and disseminate personal information.

Before advanced  computerized techniques made aggregating and disseminating such  information relatively easy, much personal information was less accessible,  being stored in paper-based public records at courthouses and other  government offices or in the files of nonpublic businesses. However,  information resellers have now amassed extensive amounts of personal  information about large numbers of Americans, and federal agencies  access this information for a variety of reasons. Federal agency use of such  information is governed primarily by the Privacy Act of 1974, which  requires that the use of personal information be limited to predefined  purposes and involve only information germane to those purposes.", "The provisions of the Privacy Act are largely based on a set of principles for  protecting the privacy and security of personal information, known as the  Fair Information Practices, which were first proposed in 1973 by a U.S.  government advisory committee.

We obtained additional information on these contracts and uses  in discussions with agency officials to ensure that all relevant information  had been provided to us.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed documentation from five  major information resellers and conducted site visits at three of them to  obtain information on privacy and security policies and procedures and  compared these with the Fair Information Practices. In conducting our  analysis, we identified the extent to which reseller practices were  consistent with the key privacy principles of the Fair Information  Practices. We also assessed the potential effect of any inconsistencies;  however, we did not attempt to make determinations of whether or how  information reseller practices should change. Such determinations are a  matter of policy based on balancing the public\u2019s right to privacy with the  value of services provided by resellers to customers such as government  agencies. We determined that the five resellers we reviewed accounted for  most of the contract value of personal information obtained from resellers  in fiscal year 2005 by the four agencies we reviewed. We did not evaluate  the effectiveness of resellers\u2019 information security programs.", "To address our third objective, we identified and evaluated agency  guidelines and management policies and procedures governing the use of  personal information obtained from information resellers and compared  these to the Fair Information Practices. We also conducted interviews at  the four agencies with senior agency officials designated for privacy issues  as well as officials of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  obtain their views on the applicability of federal privacy laws and related  guidance to agency use of information resellers. We performed our work  from May 2005 to March 2006 in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area;  Little Rock, Arkansas; Alpharetta, Georgia; and Miamisburg, Ohio.

Nonpublic information, such as  personal information contained in product registrations, insurance  applications, and other business records, was also generally inaccessible.  In recent years, however, advances in technology have spawned  information reseller businesses that systematically collect extensive  amounts of personal information from a wide variety of sources and make  it available electronically over the Internet and by other means to  customers in both government and the private sector. This automation of  the collection and aggregation of multiple-source data, combined with the  ease and speed of its retrieval, have dramatically reduced the time and  effort needed to obtain information of this type. Among the primary  customers of information resellers are financial institutions (including  insurance companies), retailers, law offices, telecommunications and  technology companies, and marketing firms.", "We use the term \u201cinformation resellers\u201d to refer to businesses that vary in  many ways but have in common the fact that they collect and aggregate  personal information from multiple sources and make it available to their  customers. These businesses do not all focus exclusively on aggregating  and reselling personal information. For example, Dun & Bradstreet  primarily provides information on commercial enterprises for the purpose  of contributing to decision making regarding those enterprises. In doing so,  it may supply personal information about individuals associated with those  commercial enterprises. To a certain extent, the activities of information  resellers may also overlap with the functions of consumer reporting  agencies, also known as credit bureaus\u2014entities that collect and sell  information about individuals\u2019 creditworthiness, among other things. As is  discussed further below, to the extent that information resellers perform  the functions of consumer reporting agencies, they are subject to  legislation specifically addressing that industry, particularly the Fair Credit  Reporting Act.", "Information resellers obtain personal information from many different  sources. Generally, three types of information are collected: public records,  publicly available information, and nonpublic information.", "Public records are a primary source of information about consumers,  available to anyone, and can be obtained from governmental entities.  What constitutes public records is dependent upon state and federal  laws, but generally these include birth and death records, property  records, tax lien records, motor vehicle registrations, voter  registrations, licensing records, and court records (including criminal  records, bankruptcy filings, civil case files, and legal judgments).", "Publicly available information is information not found in public  records but nevertheless publicly available through other sources.  These sources include telephone directories, business directories, print  publications such as classified ads or magazines, Internet sites, and  other sources accessible by the general public.", "Nonpublic information is derived from proprietary or nonpublic  sources, such as credit header data, product warranty registrations, and  other application information provided to private businesses directly by  consumers.", "Private sector businesses rely on information resellers for information to  support a variety of activities, such as  conducting pre-employment background checks on prospective   verifying individuals\u2019 identities by reviewing records of their personal   marketing commercial products to consumers matching specified   preventing financial fraud by examining insurance, asset, and other  financial record information.", "Typically, while information resellers may collect and maintain personal  information in a variety of databases, they provide their customers with a  single, consolidated online source for a broad array of personal  information.

Instead, U.S. law includes a number of separate statutes that  provide privacy protections for information used for specific purposes or  maintained by specific types of entities. The major requirements for the  protection of personal privacy by federal agencies come from two laws, the  Privacy Act of 1974 and the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of  2002. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)  also addresses the protection of personal information in the context of  securing federal agency information and information systems.", "The Privacy Act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and  use of personal information maintained in systems of records. The act  describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information  about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his or her  name or another personal identifier. It also defines \u201csystem of records\u201d as a  group of records under the control of any agency from which information is  retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The  Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a  system of records, they must notify the public by a notice in the Federal  Register identifying, among other things, the type of data collected, the  types of individuals about whom information is collected, the intended  \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and procedures that individuals can use to review  and correct personal information.", "The act\u2019s requirements also apply to government contractors when  agencies contract for the development and maintenance of a system of  records to accomplish an agency function. The act limits its applicability  to cases in which systems of records are maintained specifically on behalf  of a government agency.", "Several provisions of the act require agencies to define and limit  themselves to specific predefined purposes. For example, the act requires  that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be  collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an  individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program. The act also  requires that an agency inform individuals whom it asks to supply  information of (1) the authority for soliciting the information and whether  disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; (2) the principal  purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (3) the routine  uses that may be made of the information; and (4) the effects on the  individual, if any, of not providing the information. According to OMB, this  requirement is based on the assumption that individuals should be  provided with sufficient information about the request to make a decision  about whether to respond.", "In handling collected information, the Privacy Act also requires agencies to,  among other things, allow individuals to (1) review their records (meaning  any information pertaining to them that is contained in the system of  records), (2) request a copy of their record or information from the system  of records, and (3) request corrections in their information. Such  provisions can provide a strong incentive for agencies to correct any  identified errors.", "Agencies are allowed to claim exemptions from some of the provisions of  the Privacy Act if the records are used for certain purposes. For example,  records compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes can be exempt  from a number of provisions, including (1) the requirement to notify  individuals of the purposes and uses of the information at the time of  collection and (2) the requirement to ensure the accuracy, relevance,  timeliness, and completeness of records. A broader category of  investigative records compiled for criminal or civil law enforcement  purposes can also be exempted from a somewhat smaller number of  Privacy Act provisions, including the requirement to provide individuals  with access to their records and to inform the public of the categories of  sources of records. In general, the exemptions for law enforcement  purposes are intended to prevent the disclosure of information collected as  part of an ongoing investigation that could impair the investigation or allow  those under investigation to change their behavior or take other actions to  escape prosecution. \u2026information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory,  and policy requirements regarding privacy; (ii) to determine the risks and effects of  collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic  information system; and (iii) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes  for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.", "Agencies must conduct PIAs (1) before developing or procuring  information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in a personally identifiable form or (2) before initiating  any new data collections involving personal information that will be  collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology if the  same questions are asked of 10 or more people. OMB guidance also  requires agencies to conduct PIAs when a system change creates new  privacy risks, for example, changing the way in which personal information  is being used. The requirement does not apply to all systems. For example,  no assessment is required when the information collected relates to  internal government operations, the information has been previously  assessed under an evaluation similar to a PIA, or when privacy issues are  unchanged.", "FISMA also addresses the protection of personal information. FISMA  defines federal requirements for securing information and information  systems that support federal agency operations and assets; it requires  agencies to develop agencywide information security programs that extend  to contractors and other providers of federal data and systems. Under  FISMA, information security means protecting information and  information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction, including controls necessary to preserve  authorized restrictions on access and disclosure to protect personal  privacy, among other things.", "OMB is tasked with providing guidance to agencies on how to implement  the provisions of the Privacy Act and the E-Government Act and has done  so, beginning with guidance on the Privacy Act, issued in 1975. The  guidance provides explanations for the various provisions of the law as  well as detailed instructions for how to comply.

According to GSA officials, use of  the schedule contracts allows agencies to obtain the best price and reduce  their procurement lead time. Since these contracts have been  prenegotiated, agencies do not need to issue their own solicitation. Instead,  agencies may simply place a task order directly with the vendor, citing the  schedule number.

These principles  center on limiting the collection and use of personal information and  require data accuracy based on that limited purpose and limited use of the  information. However, the information reseller industry presupposes that  the collection and use of personal information is not limited to specific  purposes, but instead that information can be collected and made available  to multiple customers for multiple purposes.

Concomitantly, individuals are not afforded an opportunity to express or  withhold their consent when the information is collected. Resellers said  they believe it may not be appropriate or practical for them to provide  notice or obtain consent from individuals because they do not collect  information directly from them. One reseller noted that in many instances  the company does not have a direct relationship with the data subject and  is therefore not in a position to interact with the consumer for purposes  such as providing notice.

In a  well-publicized incident, in February 2005, ChoicePoint disclosed that  unauthorized individuals had gained access to personal information by  posing as a firm of private investigators. In the following month, LexisNexis  disclosed that unauthorized individuals had gained access to personal  information through the misappropriation of user IDs and passwords from  legitimate customers.

In January 2006, ChoicePoint reached a settlement  with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that the company did  not have reasonable procedures to verify the identity of prospective new  users. The company agreed to implement new procedures to ensure that it  provides consumer reports only to legitimate business for lawful purposes.  In the mean time, both information resellers reported that they had taken  steps to improve their procedures for authorizing customers to have access  to sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers. For example,  one reseller established a credentialing task force with the goal of  centralizing its customer credentialing process. In order for customers of  this reseller to obtain products and services containing sensitive personal  information, they must now undergo a credentialing process involving a  site visit by the information reseller to verify the accuracy of information  reported about the business. Applicants are then scored against a  credentialing checklist to determine whether they will be granted access to  sensitive information. In addition, both resellers reported efforts to  strengthen user ID and password protections and restrict access to  sensitive personal information (including full driver\u2019s license numbers and  Social Security numbers) to a limited number of customers, such as law  enforcement agencies (others would be able to view masked information).  Although we did not test the effectiveness of these measures, if  implemented correctly, they could help provide assurance that sensitive  information is protected appropriately.", "In addition to enhancing safeguards on customer access authorizations,  resellers have instituted a variety of other security controls.

Resellers generally would report  the information as they have it rather than attempting to determine which  entry is correct. This information is important to customers such as law  enforcement agencies. Further, resellers stated that making corrections to  their databases could be ineffective because the data are continually  refreshed with updated data from the source, and thus any correction is  likely to be changed back to its original state the next time the data are  updated. In addition, as discussed in the collection limitation section,  resellers stated their belief that it would not be appropriate to allow the  public to access and correct information held for certain purposes, such as  fraud detection and locating criminals, since providing such rights could  undermine the effectiveness of these uses (e.g., by allowing criminals to  access and change their information).

This practice is consistent with  the data quality principle that data should be accurate, current, and  complete. Agency policies and practices with regard to the other four  principles, however, were uneven. Specifically, agencies did not always  have policies or practices in place to address the purpose specification,  openness, and individual participation principles with respect to reseller  data. The inconsistencies in application of these principles as well as the  lack of specific agency policies can be attributed in part to ambiguities in  OMB guidance regarding the applicability of the Privacy Act to information  obtained from resellers.

Finally, components within each of the  four agencies did not consistently hold staff accountable by monitoring  usage of personal information from information resellers and ensuring that  it was appropriate; thus, their application of the accountability principle  was uneven."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Procedures Reflect the Collection Limitation, Data Quality, Use Limitation, and Security Safeguards Principles", "paragraphs": ["The collection limitation principle establishes, among other things, that  organizations should obtain only the minimum amount of personal data  necessary to process a transaction. This principle also underlies the  Privacy Act requirement that agencies maintain in their records \u201conly such  information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish  a purpose of the agency.\u201d Regarding most law-enforcement and  counterterrorism purposes, which accounted for 90 percent of usage in  fiscal year 2005, agencies generally limited their personal data collection in  that they reported obtaining information only on specific individuals under  investigation or associates of those individuals. Having initiated  investigations on specific individuals, however, agencies generally reported  that they obtained as much personal information as possible about the  individuals being investigated, because law enforcement investigations  require pursuing as many investigative leads as possible.", "The data quality principle states that, among other things, personal  information should be relevant to the purpose for which it is collected and  be accurate. This principle is mirrored in the Privacy Act\u2019s requirement for  agencies to maintain all records used to make determinations about an  individual with sufficient accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and  completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness.", "Agencies reported taking steps to mitigate the risk of inaccurate  information reseller data by corroborating information obtained from  resellers. Agency officials described the practice of corroborating  information as a standard element of conducting investigations. Officials  from several law enforcement component agencies, including ATF and  DEA, said corroboration was necessary to build legally sound cases from  investigations. For example, U.S. Secret Service officials reported that they  instruct agents that the information obtained from resellers should be  independently corroborated, and that none of it should be used as probable  cause for obtaining warrants.", "Further, FBI officials from FTTTF noted that obtaining data from  information resellers helps to improve the overall quality and accuracy of  the data in investigative files. Officials stated that the variety of private  companies providing personal information enhances the value, quality, and  diversity of the information used by the FBI, noting that a decision to put  an individual under arrest is based on \u201cprobable cause,\u201d which is  determined by a preponderance of evidence, rather than any single source  of information, such as information in a reseller\u2019s data base.", "Likewise, for non law-enforcement use, such as debt collection and fraud  detection and prevention, agency components reported procedures for  mitigating potential problems with the accuracy of data provided by  resellers by obtaining additional information from other sources when  necessary. For example, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys uses  information resellers to obtain information on assets possessed by an  individual indebted to the United States. According to officials, should  information contained in the information reseller databases conflict with  informataion provided by an individual, further investigation takes place  before any action to collect debts would be taken. Likewise, officials from  the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) component of DHS  and the Office of Consular Affairs within the Department of State reported  similar practices. While these practices do not eliminate inaccuracies in  data coming into the agency, they help ensure the quality of the information  that is the basis for agency actions.", "The use limitation principle provides that personal information should not  be disclosed or used for other than a specified purpose without consent of  the individual or legal authority. This principle underlies the Privacy Act  requirement that prevents agencies from disclosing records on individuals  except with consent of the individual, unless disclosure of the record  would be, for example, to another agency for civil or criminal law  enforcement activity or for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose  for which the information was collected.", "Although agencies rely on resellers\u2019 multipurpose collection of information  as a source, agency officials said their use of reseller information was  limited to distinct purposes, which were generally related to law  enforcement or counterterrorism. For example, the Department of Justice  reported uses specific to the conduct of criminal investigations on  individuals, terrorism investigations, and the location of assets and  witnesses. Other Justice and DHS components, such as the Federal  Protective Service, U.S. Secret Service, FBI, and ATF, also reported that  they used information reseller data for investigations. For uses not related  to law enforcement, such as those reported by State and SSA, use of  reseller information was also described as supporting a specific purpose  (e.g., fraud detection or debt collection).", "The use limitation principle also precludes agencies from sharing personal  information they collect for purposes unrelated to the original intended use  of the information. Officials of certain law enforcement components of  these agencies reported that in certain cases they share information with  other law enforcement agencies, a use consistent with the purposes  originally specified by the agency. For example, the FBI\u2019s FTTTF supports  ongoing investigations in other law enforcement agencies and the  intelligence community by sharing information obtained from resellers  (among other information) in response to requests about foreign terrorists  from FBI agents or officials from partner agencies.", "The security safeguards principle requires that personal information be  reasonably protected against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This  principle also underlies the Privacy Act requirement that agencies establish  appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure  the security and confidentiality of records on individuals. This principle is  further mirrored in the FISMA requirement to protect information and  information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction, including through controls for confidentiality.", "While we did not assess the effectiveness of information security or the  implementation of FISMA at any of these agencies, we found that all four  had measures in place intended to safeguard the security of personal  information obtained from resellers. For example, all four agencies cited  the use of passwords to prevent unauthorized access to information  reseller databases. Further, agency components such as ATF, DEA, CBP,  and USCIS, reported that they limit access to sensitive personal  information (e.g., full Social Security number, driver\u2019s license number) to  those with a specific need for this information. Several agency components  also reported that resellers were promptly notified to deactivate accounts  for employees separated from government service to protect against  unauthorized use. As another security measure, several components,  including DEA and the FBI, reported that resellers notified them when  accounts were accessed from Internet addresses at unexpected locations,  such as outside the United States.", "Another measure to prevent unauthorized disclosure reported by law  enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, ICE, and Secret Service, is the use  of \u201ccloaked logging,\u201d which prevents vendor personnel from monitoring the  queries being made by law enforcement agents. Officials in FBI\u2019s FTTTF  reported that, in order to maintain the integrity of investigations, resellers  are contractually prohibited from tracking or monitoring the exact persons  or other entities being searched by FTTTF personnel. Law enforcement  officials stated that the ability to mask searches from vendors is important  so that those outside law enforcement have no knowledge of who is being  investigated and so that subjects of an investigation are not \u201ctipped off.\u201d", "Agency adherence to the collection limitation, data quality, use  limitation, and security safeguards principles was based on general  business procedures\u2014including law-enforcement investigative practices\u2014 that reflect security and civil liberties protections, rather than written  policies specifically regarding the collection, accuracy, use, and security of  personal information obtained from resellers. Implementation of these  practices provides individuals with assurances that only a limited amount  of their personal information is being collected, that it is used only for  specific purposes, and that measures are in place to corroborate the  accuracy of the information and safeguard it from improper disclosure.

Agency officials said that  they generally did not prepare system-of-records notices that would  address these principles because they were not required to do so by the  Privacy Act. The act\u2019s vehicle for public notification\u2014the system-of- records notice\u2014becomes binding on an agency only when the agency  collects, maintains, and retrieves personal data in the way defined by the  act or when a contractor does the same thing explicitly on behalf of the  government. Agencies generally did not issue system-of-records notices  specifically for their use of information resellers largely because  information reseller databases were not considered \u201csystems of records  operated by or on behalf of a government agency\u201d and thus were not  considered subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act. OMB guidance on  implementing the Privacy Act does not specifically refer to the use of  reseller data or how it should be treated. According to OMB and other  agency officials, information resellers operate their databases for multiple  customers, and federal agency use of these databases does not amount to  the operation of a system of records on behalf of the government. Further,  agency officials stated that merely querying information reseller databases  did not amount to agency \u201cmaintenance\u201d of the personal information being  queried and thus also did not trigger the provisions of the Privacy Act. In  many cases, agency officials considered their use of resellers to be of this  type\u2014essentially \u201cad hoc\u201d querying or \u201cpinging\u201d of reseller databases for  personal information about specific individuals, which they believed they  were not doing in connection with a formal system of records.", "In other cases, however, agencies maintained information reseller data in  systems for which system-of-records notices had been previously  published. For example, law enforcement agency officials stated that, to  the extent they retain the results of reseller data queries, this collection and  use is covered by the system of records notices for their case file systems.  However, in preparing such notices, agencies generally did not specify that  they were obtaining information from resellers. Among system of records  notices that were identified by agency officials as applying to the use of  reseller data, only one\u2014TSA\u2019s system of records notice for the test phase of  its Secure Flight program\u2014specifically identified the use of information  reseller data. Other programs that involve use of information reseller data  include the fraud prevention and detection programs reported by SSA and  State as well as law enforcement programs within ATF, the U.S. Marshals,  and USCIS. For these programs, associated system of records notices  identified by officials did not specify the use of information reseller data.", "In several of these cases, agency sources for personal information were  described only in vague terms, such as \u201cprivate organizations,\u201d \u201cother  public sources,\u201d or \u201cpublic source material,\u201d when information was being  obtained from information resellers. In one case, a notice indicated  incorrectly that personal information was collected only from the  individuals concerned. Specifically, USCIS prepared a system of records  notice covering the Computer Linked Application Information Management  System, which did not identify information resellers as a source. Instead,  the notice stated only that \u201cinformation contained in the system of records  is obtained from individuals covered by the system.\u201d", "The inconsistency with which agencies specify resellers as a source of  information in system-of-records notices is in part due to ambiguity in OMB  guidance, which states that \u201cfor systems of records which contain  information obtained from sources other than the individual to whom the  records pertain, the notice should list the types of sources used.\u201d Although  the guidance is unclear what would constitute adequate disclosure of  \u201ctypes of sources,\u201d OMB and DHS Privacy Office officials agreed that to the  extent that reseller data are subject to the Privacy Act, agencies should  specifically identify information resellers as a source and that merely citing  public records information does not sufficiently describe the source.", "The individual participation principle gives individuals the right to access  and correct information that is maintained about them. However, under the  Privacy Act, agencies can claim exemptions from the requirement to  provide individual access and the ability to make corrections if the systems  are for law enforcement purposes. In most cases where officials identified  system-of-record notices associated with reseller data collection for law  enforcement purposes, agencies claimed this exemption. Like the ability to  mask database searches from vendors, this provision is important so that  the subjects of law enforcement investigations are not tipped off.", "Aside from the law enforcement exemptions to the Privacy Act, adherence  to the purpose specification and openness principles is critical to  preserving a measure of individual control over the use of personal  information. Without clear guidance from OMB or specific policies in place,  agencies have not consistently reflected these principles in their collection  and use of reseller information. As a result, without being notified of the  existence of an agency\u2019s information collection activities, individuals have  no ability to know that their personal information could be obtained from  commercial sources and potentially used as a basis, or partial basis, for  taking action that could have consequences for their welfare."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Privacy Impact Assessments Could Address Openness, and Purpose Specification Principles but Are Often Not Conducted", "paragraphs": ["The PIA is an important tool for agencies to address privacy early in the  process of developing new information systems, and to the extent that PIAs  are made publicly available, they provide explanations to the public about  such things as the information that will be collected, why it is being  collected, how it is to be used, and how the system and data will be  maintained and protected.

The DHS Privacy Office guidance on  conducting PIAs points out, for example, that a program decision to obtain  information from a reseller would constitute a new source of information,  requiring that a PIA be conducted. However, although the DHS guidance  clearly states that PIAs are required when personally identifiable  information is obtained from a commercial source, it also states that  \u201cmerely querying such a source on an ad hoc basis using existing  technology does not trigger the PIA requirement.\u201d Like OMB\u2019s guidance,  the DHS guidance is not clear, because agency personnel are left to make  individual determinations as to whether queries are \u201con an ad hoc basis.\u201d", "In one case, a DHS component prepared a PIA for a system that collects  reseller data but had not identified in the assessment that resellers were  being used.

For example, in describing controls placed on the use of  commercial data, officials from component agencies identified measures  such as instructing users that reseller data are for official use only and  requiring users to sign statements of responsibility attesting to a need to  access the information reseller databases and that their use will be limited  to official business.

Information resellers believe that application of  the relevant principles of the Fair Information Practices is inappropriate or  impractical in these situations. Given that reseller data may be used for a  variety of purposes, determining the appropriate degree of control or  influence individuals should have over the way in which their personal  information is obtained and used\u2014as envisioned in the Fair Information  Practices\u2014is critical. To more fully embrace these principles could require  resellers to change the way they conduct business, and currently resellers  are not legally required to follow them.

These clarifications should specify the  circumstances under which agencies should make disclosures about  their uses of reseller data so that agencies can properly notify the public  (for example, what constitutes a \u201csystematic\u201d incorporation of reseller  data into a federal system). The guidance should include practical  scenarios based on uses agencies are making of personal information  from information resellers (for example, visa, criminal, and fraud  investigations).   the Director of OMB direct agencies to review their uses of personal  information from information resellers, as well as any associated system  of records notices and privacy impact assessments, to ensure that such  notices and assessments explicitly reference agency use of information  resellers.  the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary  of State, and the Commissioner of SSA develop specific policies for the  collection, maintenance, and use of personal information obtained from  resellers that reflect the Fair Information Practices, including oversight  mechanisms such as the maintenance and review of audit logs detailing  queries of information reseller databases\u2014to improve accountability for  agency use of such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Justice\u2019s  Assistant Attorney General for Administration (reproduced in appendix  III), from the Director of the DHS Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office  (reproduced in appendix IV), from the Commissioner of SSA (reproduced  in appendix V), and from State\u2019s Assistant Secretary and Chief Financial  Officer (reproduced in appendix VI).

We recognize that law enforcement purposes are afforded the  opportunity for exemptions from some of the provisions of the Privacy Act.  The report acknowledges this fact. We also agree and acknowledge in the  report that the Fair Information Practices serve as a framework of  principles for balancing the need for privacy with other public policy  interests, such as national security and law enforcement.", "DHS also agreed on the importance of guidance to federal agencies on the  use of reseller information and stated that it is working diligently on  finalizing a DHS policy for such use. The agency commented that its  Privacy Office has been reviewing the use and appropriate privacy  protections for reseller data, including conducting a 2-day public workshop  on the subject in September 2005.

However, our report does not  suggest that data from resellers should receive special treatment. Instead,  our report takes the widely accepted Fair Information Practices as a  universal benchmark of privacy protections and assesses agency practices  in comparison with them. State also interpreted our draft report to state  that fraud detection, as a purpose for collecting personal information, is  not related to law enforcement. However, the draft does not make such a  claim. We have categorized agency uses of personal information based on  descriptions provided by agencies and have categorized fraud detection  uses separately from law enforcement to provide insight into different  types of uses. We do not claim the two uses are unrelated. Finally, the  department stated that in its view, it would be bad policy to require  specification of sources such as data resellers in agency system of records  notices. In contrast, we believe that adding clarity and specificity about  sources is in the spirit of the purpose specification practice and note that  DHS has recently issued guidance on privacy impact assessments that is  consistent with this view.", "OMB stated that, based on a staff-level meeting of agency privacy experts,  it believes agencies recognize that when personal data are brought into  their systems, this fact must be reflected in their privacy impact  assessments and system-of-record notices.

General comments made by resellers  and our evaluation are summarized below:  Several resellers raised concerns about our reliance on the OECD  version of the Fair Information Practices as a framework for assessing  their privacy policies and business practices. They suggested that it  would be unreasonable to require them to comply with aspects of the  Fair Information Practices that they believe were intended for other  types of users of personal information, such as organizations that collect  information directly from consumers. Further, they commented that our  draft summary appeared to treat strict adherence to all of the Fair  Information Practices as if it were a legally binding requirement. In  several cases, they suggested that it would be more appropriate for us to  use the privacy framework developed by the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) organization in 2004, because the APEC  framework is more recent and because it explicitly states that it has  limited applicability to publicly available information.", "As discussed in our report, the OECD version of the Fair Information  Practices is widely used and cited within the federal government as well  as internationally. In addition, the APEC privacy framework, which was  developed as a tool for encouraging the development of privacy  protection in the Asia Pacific region, acknowledges that the OECD  guidelines are still relevant and \u201cin many ways represent the  international consensus on what constitutes honest and trustworthy  treatment of personal information.\u201d Further, our use of the OECD  guidelines is as an analytical framework for identifying potential privacy  issues for further consideration by Congress\u2014not as legalistic  compliance criteria. The report states that the Fair Information  Practices are not precise legal requirements; rather they provide a  framework of principles for balancing the needs for privacy against  other public policy interests, such as national security, law enforcement,  and administrative efficiency. In conducting our analysis, we noted that  the nature of the reseller business is largely at odds with the principles  of collection limitation, data quality, purpose specification, and use  limitation. We also noted that resellers are not currently required to  follow the Fair Information Practices and that for resellers to more fully  embrace them could require that they change the way they do business.  We recognize that it is important to achieve an appropriate balance  between the benefits of resellers\u2019 services and the public\u2019s right to  privacy and point out that, as Congress weighs various legislative  options, it will be critical to determine an appropriate balance. We have  made changes in this report to clarify that we did not attempt to make  determinations of whether or how information reseller practices should  change and that such determinations are a matter of policy based on  balancing the public\u2019s right to privacy with the value of reseller services.", "Several information resellers stated that the draft did not take into  account that public record information is freely available. For example,  one reseller stated that public records should be understood by  consumers to be open to all for any use not prohibited by state or  federal law. Another stated that information resellers merely effectuate  the determination made by governmental entities that public records  should be open to all.", "However, the views expressed by the resellers do not take into account  several important factors. First, resellers collect information for their  products from a variety of sources, including information provided by  consumers to businesses. Resellers products are not based exclusively  on public records. Thus a consideration of protections for public record  information does not take the place of a full assessment of the  information reseller business. Second, resellers do not merely pass on  public record information as they find it; they aggregate information  from many different sources to create new information products, and  they make the information much more readily available than it would  be if it remained only in paper records on deposit in government  facilities. The aggregation and increased accessibility provided by  resellers raises privacy concerns that may not apply to the original  paper-based public records. Finally, it is not clear that individuals give  up all privacy rights to personal information contained in public  records. The Supreme Court has expressed the opinion in the past that  individuals retain a privacy interest in publicly released personal  information. We therefore believe it is important to assess the status of  privacy protections for all personal information being offered  commercially to the government so that informed policy decisions may  be made about the appropriate balance between resellers\u2019 services and  the public\u2019s right to privacy.", "Several resellers also noted that the draft report did not address the  complexity of the reseller business\u2014the extent to which resellers\u2019  businesses vary among themselves and overlap with consumer  reporting agencies.

Working with liaisons at the four federal  agencies we were requested to review, we identified officials responsible  for the acquisition and use of personal information from information  resellers. Through these officials, we obtained applicable contractual  documentation such as statements of work, task orders, blanket purchase  agreements, purchase orders, interagency agreements, and contract terms  and conditions.", "To address our first objective, we obtained and reviewed contract vehicles  covering federal agency use of information reseller services for fiscal year  2005. We also reviewed applicable General Services Administration (GSA)  schedule and Library of Congress FEDLINK contracts with information  resellers that agencies made use of by various means, including through  issuance of blanket purchase agreements, task orders, purchase orders, or  interagency agreements. We analyzed the contractual documentation  provided to determine the nature, scope, and dollar amounts associated  with these uses, as well as mechanisms for acquiring personal information.  In an effort to identify all relevant instances of agency use of information  resellers and related contractual documents, we developed a list of  structured questions to address available contract documents, uses of  personal information, and applicable agency guidance. We provided these  questions to agency officials and held discussions with them to help ensure  that they provided all relevant information on uses of personal information  from information resellers. To further ensure that relevant contract  vehicles were identified, we asked major information resellers about their  business with the four agencies. We also interviewed officials from GSA  and the Library of Congress to discuss the mechanisms available to federal  agencies for acquiring personal information and to identify any additional  uses of these mechanisms by the four agencies.", "To further address our first objective, we categorized agency use of  information resellers into five categories: counterterrorism, debt  collection, fraud detection/prevention, law enforcement, and other. These  categorizations were based on the component and applicable program\u2019s  mission, as well as the specific reported use of the contract. In identifying  relevant uses of information resellers, we were unable to identify small  purchases (e.g., purchases below $2,500), as agencies do not track this  information centrally. In addition, to the extent practicable, we excluded  uses that generally did not involve the use of personal information. For  example, officials from several component agencies reported that their use  of the LexisNexis and West services was primarily for legal research rather  than for public records information. In other cases, reported amounts may  reflect uses that do not involve personal information because agencies  were unable to separate such uses from uses involving personal  information.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and reviewed relevant  private sector laws and guidance, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the  Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Information Practices. We also  identified major information resellers in agency contractual agreements for  personal information and held interviews with officials from these  companies, including Acxiom, ChoicePoint, Dun & Bradstreet, LexisNexis,  and West, to discuss security, quality controls, and privacy policies. In  addition, we conducted site visits at Acxiom, ChoicePoint, and LexisNexis,  and obtained written responses to related questions from West. These five  resellers accounted for approximately 95 percent of the dollar value of all  reported contracts with resellers. To determine the extent that they reflect  widely accepted Fair Information Practices, we reviewed and compared  information reseller\u2019s privacy policies and procedures with these  principles. In conducting our analysis, we identified the extent to which  reseller practices were consistent with the key privacy principles of the  Fair Information Practices. We also assessed the effect of any  inconsistencies; however, we did not attempt to make determinations of  whether or how information reseller practices should change. Such  determinations are a matter of policy based on balancing the public\u2019s right  to privacy with the value of services provided by resellers to customers  such as government agencies.", "To address our third objective, we identified applicable guidelines and  management controls regarding the acquisition, maintenance, and use of  personal information from information resellers at each of the four  agencies. We also interviewed agency officials, including acquisition and  program staff, to further identify relevant policies and procedures. Our  assessment of overall agency application of the Fair Information Practices  was based on the policies and procedures of major components at each of  the four agencies. We also conducted interviews at the four agencies with  senior agency officials designated for privacy as well as officials of the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to obtain their views on the  applicability of federal privacy laws (including the Privacy Act of 1974 and  the E-Government Act of 2002) and related guidance on agency use of  information resellers. In addition, we compared relevant policies and  management practices with the Fair Information Practices.", "We assessed the overall application of the principles of the Fair  Information Practices by agencies according to the following categories: 1. General. We assessed the application as general if the agency had  policies or procedures to address all major aspects of a particular  principle. 2. Uneven. We assessed the application as uneven if the agency had  policies or procedures that addressed some but not all aspects of a  particular principle or if some but not all components and agencies had  policies or practices in place addressing the principle.", "We performed our work at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice,  and State in Washington, D.C.; at the Social Security Administration in  Baltimore, Maryland; Acxiom Corporation in Little Rock, Arkansas;  ChoicePoint in Alpharetta, Georgia; Dun & Bradstreet in Washington, D.C.;  and LexisNexis in Washington, D.C., and Miamisburg, Ohio.
