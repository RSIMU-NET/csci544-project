Unless FDA decides that the proposed study is unsafe, clinical testing may begin 31 days after this application is submitted to FDA. While clinical trials progress through several phases aimed at establishing safety and efficacy, the manufacturer develops the processes necessary to produce large quantities of the drug that meet the quality standards for commercial marketing.", "When all this has been done, the pharmaceutical firm submits an NDA that includes the information FDA needs to determine whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing process can ensure its quality. The first decision FDA must make is whether to accept the NDA or to refuse to file it because it does not meet minimum requirements. Once FDA has accepted an NDA, it decides whether to approve the drug on the basis of the information in the application and any supplemental information FDA has requested. FDA can approve the drug for marketing (in an \u201capproval letter\u201d) or it may indicate (in an \u201capprovable letter\u201d) that it can approve the drug if the sponsor resolves certain issues. Alternatively, FDA may withhold approval (through a \u201cnonapprovable letter\u201d that specifies the reasons).

The number of NDAs for new molecular entities (NMEs) and priority NDAs remained relatively stable over the years. Overall, 17 percent of the NDAs were for priority drugs. (See table 1.)", "A large percentage of the applications were not approved. Only 390 of the 700 NDAs submitted through 1992 had been approved by May 16, 1995. In other words, 44 percent of the applications submitted were for drugs that FDA did not find to be safe and effective or that sponsors chose not to pursue further. NMEs were approved at a higher rate than non-NMEs (64 percent to 52 percent), and priority drugs were approved more often than standard drugs (76 percent to 52 percent). This means that whether an NDA is or is not ultimately approved is as relevant a question as how long approval takes. (See table 2.)", "The data in table 2 show that NDAs that are submitted by experienced sponsors and priority NDAs are more likely to be approved than standard NDAs or NDAs submitted by sponsors with little experience with the process. These results are supported by a regression analysis that shows that both the NDA\u2019s priority and the sponsor\u2019s experience are statistically significant predictors of outcome (see appendix I for our definition of sponsor experience and appendix V for the regression analysis).

In addition, the reductions in time came for NDAs submitted throughout the period of our study. This finding is consistent with FDA\u2019s statements that review time has decreased in recent years.", "Alternative presentations of the data demonstrate the same result. For example, table 4 shows that the number of months that passed before half of all submissions were approved declined from 58 months for NDAs submitted in 1987 to 33 months for 1992 submissions. Since just 56 percent of the NDAs submitted between 1987 and 1992 were approved, this measure captures the approval period for almost all the approvals that will ultimately be granted. Similarly, table 4 shows that the proportion of submitted NDAs that were approved within 2 years increased from 23 percent for NDAs submitted in 1987 to 39 percent for NDAs submitted in 1992.", "Closer examination of the individual NDAs shows that they differed considerably in how long it took before a final decision was made. Some NDAs were approved within a few months (the shortest was 2 months); others took years (the slowest was 96 months). The variation was similar among applications that were not approved. Some were withdrawn on the day they were submitted. The longest outstanding application was 92 months old.", "This considerable variation raises the question of what differentiates one NDA from the next: Do some factors predict the time it will take to reach a final decision? When we tested potential explanatory variables, we found that the priority FDA assigned to an application and the sponsor\u2019s experience in submitting NDAs were statistically significant predictors of how long review and approval took.

We examined both the degree to which FDA was on time and the factors that influenced whether it made its decisions on time. The criteria for \u201con time\u201d performance that we used in this analysis were established under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992. Although on-time performance may be seen as one indicator of FDA\u2019s efficiency, it is important to note that FDA is not required to meet these criteria until 1997.", "Of all the decisions FDA made on the NDAs submitted between 1987 and 1993, 67 percent were on time. Simpler decisions (for example, refusals to file) were made on time more often than relatively complex decisions (for example, priority applications in which the first decision was an approval). Overall, the on-time percentage remained relatively stable, varying between a low of 62 percent for NDAs submitted in 1992 and a high of 72 percent for NDAs submitted in 1987.

Second, the percentage of NDAs for drugs that are viewed by FDA as offering an important therapeutic advance is relatively small. As we pointed out in table 1, only 17 percent of all NDAs were given priority status. Third, our data on drug review and approval show that approximately one fifth of the time in that process comprises activities for which sponsors are responsible.", "With respect to time, NDAs are moving more quickly through the drug review and approval process. Whether this improvement is because of actions by FDA or the pharmaceutical industry or some other factors is an issue that is beyond the scope of this report.

Second, most reports of drug approval times, including those published by FDA, measure time for drugs approved during a particular period, regardless of when they were submitted. Some approved drugs may have been submitted much earlier. By limiting our analysis to new drug applications submitted (but not necessarily approved) in 1987 and later, we have limited the maximum value of review time.

For example, FDA may have sent one not-approvable letter when the review of one section of the NDA was complete and additional not-approvable letters as other sections of the review were completed.

This can be seen from table II.4.", "As the table shows, a considerable proportion of the approvals in every year except for 1994 were for older NDAs that had been under review for a long time. The first years in which FDA seemed to make progress in reducing the backlog were 1992 and 1993, when larger percentages of older applications were approved.

Clearly, this is because many of the applications had not had time to \u201cmature\u201d by the time we collected our data. While more than 50 percent of NDAs submitted in every year from 1987 to 1992 were approved by May 1995, comparatively few of the NDAs submitted in 1993 and 1994 had been approved. Most importantly, the only NDAs from 1993 and 1994 that were approved were those that had been approved relatively quickly. As a result, the average approval time for NDAs submitted in 1987-92 is 26.4 months, while the average time for approved NDAs submitted in 1993 and 1994 is 12.6 months. Because of this bias, we excluded NDAs submitted after 1992 whenever we examined final status.", "Final status as of May 16, 1995. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding.

As table VI.1 shows, the approval rates for 1991 and 1992 are equivalent to those from earlier years. That is, almost all the NDAs from 1991 and 1992 for which approval ultimately would be expected have already been approved by FDA. Approval times for those years are not likely to increase much.", "The question that remains is whether the trend in decreasing time that we observed for submissions between 1987 and 1992 continued for 1993 and 1994 submissions. That question cannot be answered definitively until the 1993 and 1994 cohorts have had time to mature. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the trend continues.

MCA publishes information similar to that contained in FDA\u2019s statistical reports, including data on workload (number and type of submissions) and time (how long it takes to review applications). MCA\u2019s 1994-95 annual report indicates that the assessment of an application for a new active substance (the apparent equivalent of what FDA terms a new molecular entity) took an average of 56 working days. This figure stands in sharp contrast to FDA\u2019s reports that show an average approval time of 20 months for applications for NMEs approved in 1994. No doubt, the sharp contrast in these two averages is one factor creating the impression that approval times are much shorter in the United Kingdom than they are in this country.", "However, closer examination of the data in MCA\u2019s annual report shows that they should be compared to our data on FDA with caution. Most importantly, the drug review process in the United Kingdom is very different from that in the United States. In the United Kingdom, MCA\u2019s assessment is only the first step in a multistage process of drug review and approval. All applications for new active substances are also automatically referred to a government body called the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM). CSM\u2019s expert subcommittees also assess the application, and these assessments, along with those from MCA, are provided to CSM. CSM then provides advice to the Licensing Authority, which actually grants or denies the product license. However, the rate of rejection of applications or requests for modifications or additional information is very high (99 percent for applications submitted 1987-89), although many of these issues are minor and quickly resolved. Applications with remaining unresolved issues then go through a formal appeals process that may involve additional work on the part of the applicant, reassessment by MCA or CSM, and, in rare cases, the involvement of another body called the Medicines Commission. Thus, the total time until the license is actually granted is considerably longer than the period of initial assessment by MCA. In contrast, the time FDA reports includes all the steps between an accepted NDA and the final decision on it.", "When one examines total time for both processes, the United Kingdom does not appear to be dramatically faster than the United States. One recent study compared approval times for 11 drugs that were approved in both countries during the period 1986-92. The median time in the United States (about 23 months) was 15 percent longer than the median time in the United Kingdom (20 months). The most recent data from MCA show that overall approval times are actually somewhat longer than that. These data indicate that MCA granted licenses for applications representing 32 new active substances during the 12-month period ending September 30, 1994. The median time for granting a license was 30 months and the average was 24 months. The fastest license was granted in about 4 months, the slowest in 62 months.", "FDA\u2019s data for the calendar year ending December 31, 1994, indicate that the agency approved a total of 22 new molecular entities. The median approval time was 18 months, average approval time about 20 months. The fastest approval reported by FDA took about 6 months and the slowest about 40 months.", "Thus, the most recent data show that approval times for NMEs are actually shorter in the United States. In addition, a broader perspective shows that approval processes in many industrialized nations may be converging.Approval times over the past 10 years for France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States all seem to be moving toward the 2-year point. The trend in the United States (which had lengthy times throughout the mid-1980s) has been toward more rapid times, whereas the process has been getting slower in some of the other (originally faster) countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["This report was prepared by Martin T.
