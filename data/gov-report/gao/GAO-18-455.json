GAO analyzed the most recent program participation data (1996-2017) and finance data (2015-16 school year); reviewed available HBCU master plans; visited nine HBCUs of different sizes and sectors (public and private); and interviewed Education officials and other stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), stakeholders, and planning documents identified extensive and diverse capital project needs at HBCUs and GAO found HBCUs rely on a few funding sources\u2014such as state appropriations and tuition and fees\u2014to address those needs. HBCUs responding to GAO's survey reported that 46 percent of their building space, on average, needs repair or replacement. Based on a review of master plans\u2014which assess the condition of HBCU facilities\u2014and visits to nine HBCUs, GAO identified significant capital project needs in the areas of deferred maintenance, facilities modernization, and preservation of historic buildings. The Department of Education's (Education) HBCU Capital Financing Program has provided access to needed funding for some HBCUs and has helped modernize their facilities to improve student recruitment. However, fewer than half of HBCUs have used the program, according to Education data, which was specifically designed to help them address capital project needs (see figure).", "Education has undertaken several efforts to help HBCUs access and participate in the HBCU Capital Financing Program. For example, Education conducts outreach through attending conferences. However, some HBCUs in GAO's survey and interviews were unaware of the program. Moreover, public HBCUs in four states reported facing participation challenges due to state laws or policies that conflict with program requirements. For example, participants are required to provide collateral, but public HBCUs in two states reported they cannot use state property for that purpose. In March 2018, a federal law was enacted requiring Education to develop an outreach plan to improve program participation. An outreach plan that includes direct outreach to individual HBCUs and states to help address these issues could help increase participation. Without direct outreach, HBCUs may continue to face participation challenges. In addition, two HBCUs recently defaulted on their program loans and 29 percent of loan payments were delinquent in 2017. Education modified a few loans in 2013 and was recently authorized to offer loan deferment, but has no plans to analyze the potential benefits to HBCUs and the program's cost of offering such modifications in the future. Until Education conducts such analyses, policymakers will lack key information on potential options to assist HBCUs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends Education (1) include direct outreach to individual HBCUs and steps to address participation challenges for some public HBCUs in its outreach plan, and (2) analyze the potential benefits and costs of offering loan modifications in the program.

In addition, more than one-third of African- Americans receiving a doctorate in science, technology, engineering, or  mathematics fields obtained their undergraduate degrees from an  HBCU, and many received their doctorates from an HBCU. Like many of  the nation\u2019s approximately 4,400 colleges and universities (colleges), the  101 HBCUs undertake capital projects to help ensure their students have  well-maintained, safe, and functional facilities. Despite their prominent  role providing access to higher education for African-Americans and  others, HBCUs have faced challenges acquiring the robust revenue  streams needed to undertake capital projects. Moreover, a study in 2015  examined HBCU activity in the bond market and found that HBCUs have  a harder time finding investors, which results in higher costs compared to  similar, non-HBCU colleges.", "Recognizing these challenges, in 1992 the HBCU Capital Financing  Program (Capital Financing Program) was created to provide HBCUs with  access to low-cost loans for campus repair, renovation, and construction.  Our 2006 review of this program found that just 14 HBCUs participated in  the Capital Financing Program, despite extensive and diverse capital  project needs reported by HBCU officials.", "In light of these issues, you asked us to review funding for capital projects  at HBCUs, and the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) administration  of the Capital Financing Program.

We also interviewed stakeholders at two HBCU  organizations representing most HBCUs, three higher education  organizations that focus on facilities, and from foundations and research  organizations. In addition, we visited nine selected HBCUs to tour  facilities in three states (Alabama, Louisiana, and North Carolina). To  further examine challenges HBCUs might face funding capital projects,  we analyzed data from Education\u2019s Integrated Postsecondary Education  Data System (IPEDS) to learn more about select financial characteristics  of all HBCUs. We also used these data to examine differences between  HBCUs\u2019 and similar non-HBCUs\u2019 institutional, student, and financial  characteristics. We identified the comparison group of similar non-HBCUs  using a statistical matching technique.

The  Emergency Act amended certain provisions of the Capital Financing  Program for these colleges. For example, the Emergency Act included  provisions such as a lower interest rate and lower fees for cost of  issuance (both set at one percent or less), elimination of the escrow  requirement, and deferment of both principal and interest payments for a  3-year period. Despite these more generous loan provisions, these four  HBCUs experienced challenges repaying these loans due to difficulties  they faced rebuilding their enrollment and finances to the levels before  the hurricanes.

Education  officials and several stakeholders also said this reliance can put the  HBCUs at a financial disadvantage when seeking additional external  funding, such as from the bond market. Diversity of revenues is a key  metric when determining a college\u2019s credit rating, which uses a college\u2019s  financial profile to assess its ability to pay its financial obligations.  Colleges with lower credit ratings, for example, may face challenges  accessing the bond market, or pay more to issue a bond, according to  several stakeholders. Using IPEDS data from the 2015-16 school year,  we found that HBCUs may face challenges with revenue diversity  because a large proportion of their revenue is from government funding  (federal, state, and local) and tuition and fees. A college\u2019s wealth, such as  the size of its endowment, can also affect a college\u2019s credit rating,  according to officials from two credit rating agencies. Officials from a  higher education association and a foundation noted that many HBCUs  have small endowments and as a result may face challenges accessing  financing. Our analysis of IPEDs data shows that HBCUs\u2019 median  endowments are about half the size of similar non-HBCUs (see table 3).", "Not all HBCUs face these challenges, however.

Officials from most public  HBCUs we interviewed (5 of 6), however, said state appropriations are  often limited to academic or administrative buildings, and colleges are  responsible for financing and maintaining other projects and building  spaces, such as residence halls or student centers. Furthermore, officials  from all public HBCUs we interviewed (6 of 6) reported that state funds  are often not sufficient to adequately address both routine repairs and  their deferred maintenance backlog. Declines in state funding for higher  education in recent years have also introduced financial uncertainty,  particularly for HBCUs, according to officials from half of the public  HBCUs and many stakeholders we spoke with. For example, officials at  one public HBCU we visited said that as a result of cuts in the state\u2019s  capital budget, the college does not have enough funding to address  emergency or deferred maintenance needs and they are running a deficit.

Specifically, over two-thirds of survey respondents (24 of 35) cited the  opportunity to refinance existing debt. According to officials from  Education and the designated bonding authority, HBCUs can see  substantial savings using the program. Data provided by the designated  bonding authority showed that HBCUs that refinanced debt in the  program from 2012 through 2016 saved a median of 14 percent of the  overall loan cost. One survey respondent, for example, reported that as  a result of the savings generated by refinancing existing bonds the  college was able to purchase a residence hall. Almost half of the  participating HBCUs that responded to the survey question on why they  used the program (15 of 32) reported that they did not have access to  other funding. Officials from one organization representing almost three- quarters of the private HBCUs told us this program is particularly  important for small private HBCUs that have limited resources and for  private HBCUs that do not have access to state funding and may not  have the capacity to issue bonds. Officials from most public HBCUs we  interviewed (4 of 6) also noted that because states do not typically fund  buildings such as residence halls or student centers, the Capital  Financing Program can help address that funding gap."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Has Taken Some Steps to Help HBCUs Participate in the Capital Financing Program, but Further Action Is Needed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Conducts Outreach, but Some HBCUs Reported Being Unaware of the Capital Financing Program", "paragraphs": ["Education and its designated bonding authority have taken some steps to  increase awareness of the Capital Financing Program, but some HBCUs  and university system officials reported in our survey and interviews that  they were unaware of the 26-year-old program.

Nonetheless, according to officials at three state university systems,  these systems generally play a role in coordinating colleges\u2019 capital  budget requests, and their awareness of the Capital Financing  Program could help Education in its efforts to increase participation  among public HBCUs. For example, officials at one state university  system told us they are always interested in learning about low-cost  ways to help their colleges with capital projects, and they would be  interested to learn more about how the Capital Financing Program  could help their public HBCUs. In addition, one surveyed public HBCU  that was unaware of the program suggested Education work with  state university system offices, as they are the ones responsible for  facilitating and approving colleges\u2019 capital funds.

In 2016, about three-quarters of HBCUs experienced a  change in at least one key leadership position, according to our  analysis of Education reports, and several stakeholders we talked to  cited the frequency of leadership change as a challenge. Given the  frequency of changes in key leadership positions at HBCUs,  consistent outreach to this group is particularly important.", "This lack of program awareness among individual HBCUs and state  university systems can hinder participation. Since our 2006 report on the  Capital Financing Program, participation has increased from 14 to 46  HBCUs, but the total remains at fewer than half of all HBCUs. While the  program is only available for capital financing of projects that meet  specific criteria, it serves as a potentially important resource for HBCUs  that continue to face challenges diversifying their funding sources to meet  capital project needs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, enacted in  March 2018, requires Education to create and execute an outreach plan  to work with states and the Capital Financing Advisory Board to improve  outreach to states and help additional public HBCUs participate in the  program.

According to our analysis of survey  responses and interviews, about one-third of non-participating public  HBCUs across four states (13 of 37) report being unable to use the  program due to at least one federal requirement placed on the college,  which conflicts with state law, policy, or practice. These features include  requirements for pooling escrow funds, collateral, and lending directly to  HBCUs (see table 4).", "Education has taken steps to address public HBCUs\u2019 concerns with the  escrow requirement, but not the other state-level provisions that create  challenges. In 2006, GAO recommended that Education consider  alternatives to the escrow pool requirement, and Education submitted a  legislative proposal to Congress, most recently in 2017, to require fees  instead. However, Education has not systematically coordinated with  states to address other laws or policies that create challenges or to  identify potential solutions to help more public HBCUs participate in the  program. For example, based on one college\u2019s interpretation of state law,  officials from Education and the designated bonding authority told us  HBCUs in that state could not participate because of the state\u2019s  requirement that such loans be issued to a third-party. However, state  university system officials in this state told us this requirement may not  prohibit participation. They said a clearer explanation of the benefits and  obligations of the program from Education would be helpful to determine  whether the state\u2019s HBCUs could participate. Officials at an HBCU in  another state with restrictions suggested that Education work with the  states to help states develop regulations that do not hinder access to the  program. Officials from the university system in that state said they would  be open to working with Education to find a way to allow their HBCUs to  participate.", "Some state university systems and colleges have successfully developed  solutions that could also be helpful for states whose laws or policies  create similar challenges. For example, officials we spoke with from one  state university system said a state statute was recently changed after an  HBCU\u2019s application to the program had to be withdrawn because of a  state law prohibiting using tuition revenue as collateral. Those changes  were enacted in early 2018, and state university system officials said they  are moving forward on HBCU participation in the program.", "Our prior work highlights the importance of coordinating among key  stakeholders to achieve results. Education\u2019s strategic plan prioritizes  supporting educational institutions and increasing college access, and  coordinating with external stakeholders such as state university systems  to achieve those goals. While Education is aware that many public  HBCUs face state-level restrictions on participating in the Capital  Financing Program, a senior Education official said the Capital Financing  Program does not provide support to states whose laws or policies create  such challenges. Education officials said they work with colleges on a  case-by-case basis, and only work directly with state university systems  when invited to by the interested HBCU. However, officials from one  university system noted that it would be helpful for Education to keep both  the college and the system informed of the program given the system  office\u2019s level of involvement in capital financing decisions. Officials we  interviewed from three of the four public HBCUs in states with laws or  policies that create these challenges said they are interested in  participating in the Capital Financing Program. One HBCU official said  given the low interest rate, his HBCU would refinance all its existing  capital debt into the program if given the opportunity.

For example, two HBCUs  defaulted on their Capital Financing Program loans in the last 2 years,  and 29 percent of loan payments were delinquent in 2017. HBCU  officials we interviewed reported that financial challenges stemming from  two events\u2014the 2008 economic recession and a recent change to federal  student financial aid\u2014have decreased enrollment at some HBCUs and  affected HBCUs\u2019 ability to repay their loans on time. For example, officials  from two private HBCUs told us that they experienced declining  enrollment as a result of the 2008 recession. In addition, changes made  in 2011 to the Parent PLUS loan program\u2014a program used by parents to  help pay for their student\u2019s tuition\u2014resulted in increased denials of these  loan applications, according to Education and officials from several  HBCUs. As a result, some students could no longer afford to attend  college, and the loss of tuition revenue created additional financial  hardship for the colleges, according to officials from several HBCUs and  an HBCU organization official. Education issued new regulations in 2014  that revised the Parent PLUS loan criteria, enabling more families to  qualify for these loans. However, HBCUs had already lost significant  amounts of tuition revenue as a result of the 2011 changes, according to  Education officials.", "HBCUs and stakeholders have called for loan modifications to potentially  assist colleges in financial distress and help them avoid defaulting on  their Capital Financing Program loans. According to key stakeholders and  officials from eight HBCUs, there is a need for the program to have ways  to assist HBCUs facing financial difficulties. For example, officials from  four HBCUs we interviewed and four additional HBCUs we surveyed  suggested additional program flexibility, such as forgiving, reducing, or  temporarily suspending loan payments, could be helpful for some  colleges. Stakeholders also suggested that loan deferment\u2014allowing  colleges to postpone payments without penalty\u2014or other flexible payment  options could help some colleges facing financial hardship. The  Consolidated Appropriations Act, enacted in March 2018, appropriated  $10 million for Education to defer participating HBCUs\u2019 Capital Financing  Program loans to assist colleges experiencing financial difficulties.  Under this provision, loans can be deferred for up to 6 years for  participating HBCUs demonstrating financial need and meeting certain  conditions. These funds are available for Education to authorize loan  deferments until the end of fiscal year 2018. Little is known, however,  about how loan modifications would affect participating HBCUs or the  program.", "According to a senior Education official, the agency assessed the  potential for loan deferment in 2010 and estimated that it would cost the  federal government about $150 million annually. However, neither the  program office nor Education\u2019s budget office, which is responsible for  estimating the costs of policy changes, were able to provide any  information on how Education arrived at this estimate. Furthermore,  Education has not assessed whether several other types of loan  modifications identified by stakeholders, or those used for HBCUs  impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, could be beneficial to other  participating HBCUs that are having trouble making timely loan  payments.", "Federal internal control standards state that agency management should  plan for significant external events, analyze its effects on achieving  program goals, and appropriately respond to those events. While  Education and its designated bonding authority review each applicant\u2019s  credit and ability to take on a Capital Financing Program loan, this review  reflects an HBCU\u2019s current financial health at the time of its application.  Given that Capital Financing Program loans can be up to 30 years, major  external changes such as an economic recession are possible over the  life of the loan. Such events may affect an HBCU\u2019s ability to make timely  loan payments and may increase the potential of an HBCU to default on  its Capital Financing Program loan. According to Education\u2019s fiscal year  2019 budget request, the HBCU portfolio is experiencing greater financial  stress as evidenced by an increase in loan delinquencies, and the federal  government is at risk of incurring additional costs to manage the  program. Analyzing the effects of deferring loans and other types of loan  modifications on program participation and on program costs could help  Education determine how best to assist participating HBCUs experiencing  financial difficulties while minimizing the federal government\u2019s costs.  However, a senior Education official said the agency does not plan to  analyze (1) whether loan modifications could be helpful to program  participants; or (2) the effect offering these modifications could have on  the cost of the program. According to Education officials, modifications to  the terms of Capital Financing Program loans cannot occur without  statutory change. Nonetheless, Education is responsible for providing  advice to Congress about what additional steps might be taken to  improve the operation and implementation of the program. Conducting  analyses on the effect of loan modifications, including recently authorized  deferments, to help colleges avoid default and successfully participate in  the program, and on the potential costs absorbed by Education of  delayed or reduced payments, would enable Education to fulfill this  responsibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HBCUs play a vital role in providing higher education opportunities for  African-Americans.

If none of the non-HBCUs identified using institution size,  sector, and highest degree offered lied within the same state as the  HBCUs, we used Census-based divisions to create the matched set of  HBCUs and non-HBCUs.", "Table 5 summarizes the number of institutions within each matched set.  Seventy-three of the 100 HBCUs were matched using state, while 27  were matched using Census-based divisions.", "We conducted this matched analysis because an unmatched analysis of  the 100 HBCUs and all 3,529 non-HBCUs is potentially vulnerable to  spurious differences in outcomes between HBCUs and non-HBCUs that  arise from an imbalance of key factors underlying these two types of  institutions. For example, public 2-year institutions make up a smaller  proportion of HBCUs compared to non-HBCUs (10 and 28.6 percent,  respectively), while public 4-year institutions make up a larger proportion  of HBCUs compared to non-HBCUs (39 and 19.6 percent, respectively).  This imbalance could lead to differences in outcomes arising from  characteristics inherent in the type of institution, not a comparison of  HBCUs to non-HBCUs. Matching HBCUs to non-HBCUs would lead to a  similar underlying distribution of key factors, which improves the  comparability of HBCUs and non-HBCUs.", "We used the matched sets to compare HBCUs to non-HBCUs on student  financial aid and financial outcomes. For each of these variables and  across the matched sets, we estimated descriptive statistics (mean,  median, range) for HBCUs and non-HBCUs. However, in order to  compare HBCUs to non-HBCUs, we accounted for similarities within each  matched set. The varying number of HBCUs and non-HBCUs within each  matched set required an analysis which is, in principle, an extension of a  paired t-test. In this analysis, differences and correlations within each  matched set are accounted for when estimating the overall difference  between HBCUs and non-HBCUs. More specifically, we performed a  linear mixed effects model with the basic form:  yij ~ \u03b2ijHBCUij + bijClusterij + \u03c3ij, for the jth institution in the ith cluster  bik ~ N(0, \u03b7), for the kth institution in the ith cluster  where y is the outcome variable of interest; \u03b2 is the parameter of interest,  the fixed-effect coefficient that quantifies the overall difference between  HBCUs and non-HBCUs; \u03c3 is the residual error that is not accounted for  by HBCU status or clusters; b is the random-effect coefficient that  accounts for correlations within clusters and quantifies the different  effects of the k institutions within each cluster set (i.e., the k HBCU and  non-HBCU institutions are nested within each cluster set); and b  estimates the separate and distinct effects for each cluster set and is  assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution, with a variance of \u03b7.", "The p-value estimated was used to assess whether there was a  statistically significant difference between HBCUs and non-HBCUs for the  outcome variables of interest.", "We stratified the matched sample by public and private education sector  and used the model above to obtain estimates specific for public and  private colleges. This education sector specific analysis was not further  stratified by 2- and 4-year college types due to small sample sizes.", "In order to further explore differences with public and private colleges, we  expanded the model above as such:  yij ~ \u03b2ijHBCUij + \u03b3ijSectorij + \u03b5ijHBCUij*Sectorij + bijClusterij + \u03c3ij, for  the jth institution in the ith cluster  Where the parameters described above remain the same and \u03b3 is the  difference between public and private colleges, after adjusting for being  an HBCU and \u03b5 is the difference within difference, assessing whether the  HBCU\u2013non-HBCU difference within public colleges is different from the  HBCU\u2013non-HBCU difference within private colleges.", "Wilcoxon Test for Clustered Data  The linear mixed effects model above assumes that data are normally  distributed (i.e., follow a bell-shaped curve). In order to assess whether  these assumptions hold, we performed a Wilcoxon test that is extended  for clustered data. The Wilcoxon test ranks values and is free of  distributional assumptions, and assumes that all data are independent  (i.e., not correlated).
