From 1986 to 1990, the District of Columbia\u2019s average annual rate of alcohol-related deaths was almost twice as high as the national rate. Alcohol use by adolescents is of particular concern, because in addition to causing immediate problems, it can lead to a lifelong pattern of alcohol misuse.

According to the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA), about 14 million Americans meet the medical diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or alcoholism, and an estimated 100,000 alcohol-related deaths occur each year. About half of the nation\u2019s high school students report current alcohol use, a significant minority drink heavily, and few have difficulty obtaining alcohol. The younger the age of drinking onset, the greater the chance that an individual will develop a clinically defined alcohol disorder at some point in life.", "All states heavily regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. Some states take a more direct approach to controlling sales than others. Eighteen states, including Virginia, are generally referred to as \u201ccontrol\u201d states, because the final sale to consumers of, typically, liquor and in some cases wine and beer as well can occur only in state-operated stores at prices established by state beverage control boards. State-operated stores are the exclusive retailers of all legal liquor sold for off-premises consumption throughout Virginia. Final prices are set by Virginia\u2019s Department of Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC).", "The District of Columbia and the remaining 32 states, including Maryland, are referred to as \u201clicense\u201d states, because the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages is carried out by private license holders. Maryland, however, is not completely a license state, because 1 of its 22 counties\u2014Montgomery County, which borders the District\u2014is a control jurisdiction. The county Department of Liquor Control is the exclusive wholesaler of all alcoholic beverages sold within its boundaries. The Department is also the exclusive retailer of liquor sold for off-premises consumption.", "To raise revenue and to help prevent alcohol misuse, most states and the District of Columbia levy both excise taxes and retail sales taxes on alcoholic beverages. Some county and city governments also impose their own alcohol taxes. In order to determine whether the District\u2019s taxes on alcohol are greater or less than those in surrounding jurisdictions and other states, one needs to compare the District\u2019s combined\u2014sales and excise\u2014tax structure with the tax structures in the other jurisdictions. Such a comparison is complicated by the fact that alcohol excise tax rates are generally stated as fixed amounts per unit of volume, but sales tax rates are almost always ad valorem (stated as percentages of product prices). The combined tax burden within a given jurisdiction will vary by type, size, and value of beverage and, in some cases, by type of retail establishment.", "It is also difficult to compare the alcohol tax systems in license jurisdictions with those in control jurisdictions. In a license state, private sector wholesalers determine wholesale prices, taking into account their costs, including the excise taxes that they pay to the state. Private sector retailers charge their own mark-ups on top of those wholesale prices. For these states, one can readily determine what share of the final price of the alcoholic beverage is attributable to the excise tax.", "In a control state such as Virginia, where the government acts as a monopoly wholesaler and retailer of liquor, the government collects revenue from the sale of alcohol in two ways: (1) by earning the profits that private sector wholesalers and retailers would otherwise have earned and (2) by imposing an excise tax on the alcohol. One cannot easily determine how much of the combined revenue that the state collects should be considered the profits of the state\u2019s alcohol sales operations and how much should be considered an excise tax. The state may make a distinction between the price mark-up that it charges and the excise tax that it levies, but this distinction has little meaning to consumers or taxpayers. There is a wide range of mark-up/excise tax rate combinations that the state could have set to yield the same amount of revenue and impose the same costs on consumers.", "One way to define an \u201ceffective\u201d excise tax rate on alcohol in a control state is to say that it equals the statutory excise tax rate, plus any cost that the state control system imposes on consumers above what those consumers would have borne if that system were not in place. For example, if a state-run store imposes a higher mark-up than a private dealer would have, then this additional cost to consumers can be considered part of the effective tax.

We also interviewed officials from the District\u2019s Office of Tax and Revenue and from the alcohol beverage control commissions in the District; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Virginia. We also obtained alcohol tax information for the 50 states from the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). In an effort to determine whether the pricing policies of Montgomery County and Virginia result in effective tax rates that are higher than the statutory tax rates for certain alcoholic beverages, we obtained lists of the wholesale prices that Montgomery County charges on all of the alcoholic beverages that it sells to retailers in the county and lists of the wholesale prices for wine and liquor that private sector wholesalers charge retailers in the remainder of Maryland. The latter prices are published in the Maryland Beverage Journal. We compared Montgomery County\u2019s prices (effective during January 1998) to those of the private wholesalers for (1) 14 liquor items identified by the Virginia ABC Commission or DISCUS as top sellers, (2) a random sample of an additional 28 liquor items from Montgomery County\u2019s price list, and (3) a random sample of 29 wine items from the county\u2019s price list. We could not make a comparison of beer wholesale prices, because the state of Maryland requires publication of only liquor and wine wholesale prices, not beer prices.", "As one possible way to determine whether Virginia\u2019s controlled prices for liquor are, on average, higher than the competitive market prices in the same region, we considered doing a survey comparing prices in Virginia with those in the District and its Maryland suburbs for the top-selling liquor items. However, representatives of the District\u2019s Alcohol Retailers Association told us that a common retail pricing practice is to sell selected popular items at a large discount, possibly even at a loss, in order to attract customers who will then also buy items that have higher price mark-ups. For this reason, a survey limited to just the best-selling items would probably be misleading. The retailers\u2019 representatives also indicated that it would be very difficult to obtain good estimates of the average prices in each jurisdiction, because there are so many different brands and bottle sizes, and the prices for each item are likely to vary considerably across different types of retail outlets in each jurisdiction. It was beyond the scope of this study to undertake the extensive retail price survey and analysis needed to make such estimates.", "To determine how much higher the District\u2019s alcohol excise tax rates would be if they had been indexed for inflation, we raised these rates by the same percentage increase as the average increase in alcoholic beverage prices since the last time each rate was changed. To compute the average price increases, we used the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s quarterly Consumer Price Index alcoholic beverage component for the Washington metropolitan area. We also compared the combined\u2014excise and sales\u2014tax burdens on typical alcoholic beverages over time.", "To determine whether existing empirical research indicates that raising the District\u2019s alcohol taxes is likely to reduce alcohol abuse, particularly among youths, and related health problems, we reviewed and summarized several surveys of the relevant academic literature that have been published in recent years. We then obtained comments on our summary from five academic and government experts in this field of research and modified our summary to reflect those comments.", "To identify which states earmarked their alcoholic taxes for specific purposes, we used the latest summarization of state tax earmarking prepared by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The latest available earmarking information is for fiscal year 1993. We did not independently verify the accuracy of this information.", "To describe the characteristics of alcohol prevention programs and legal and regulatory strategies that researchers have deemed effective, we identified and reviewed selected literature on alcohol prevention research and evaluated syntheses of research literature. Given the vast literature on this subject and the time available to us, we relied heavily on information presented in NIAAA\u2019s 1997 publication, Alcohol and Health. We also interviewed key officials responsible for overseeing alcohol prevention research for youth and other populations at NIAAA. To obtain information on the District of Columbia\u2019s alcohol laws and regulations, we interviewed the Executive Director of the D.C. Alcoholic Beverages Control Board, reviewed relevant provisions of the District of Columbia\u2019s codes and municipal regulations, and examined reports provided by the Board. To obtain information on how the District\u2019s alcohol laws are being enforced, we interviewed responsible officials of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. We obtained similar information from officials responsible for managing and enforcing alcoholic beverage programs in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties in Maryland and the City of Alexandria and Arlington County in Virginia.

In order to conform its combined statutory tax rates to those in Maryland, the District would have to lower its taxes on all alcoholic beverages. The only way for the District to make its statutory taxes similar to those in Virginia, across the entire range of alcoholic beverages, would be to adopt a single sales tax rate for alcoholic beverages that is close to Virginia\u2019s and to adopt excise tax rates that are all very close to Virginia\u2019s. This change would lower taxes on beer and high-priced wine in the District while raising the tax on liquor and low-priced wine.", "The District would face a difficult enforcement task if it adopted the ad valorem excise tax rate on liquor that Virginia currently levies. Virginia\u2019s liquor excise tax is computed as 20 percent of the liquor price after the state has taken its combined wholesale and retail price mark-up. To levy an equivalent tax, the District would have to impose the 20-percent rate on the final prices that retail stores charge their customers before applying the sales tax. This tax would be more difficult to enforce than the District\u2019s current liquor excise tax, because (1) it would have to be collected from a much greater number of taxpayers; (2) taxpayers would have more of an incentive to understate their liquor sales, because the tax rate paid by each taxpayer would be higher than it currently is; and (3) to verify compliance, District auditors would have to examine a taxpayer\u2019s detailed sales receipts. Virginia does not face these enforcement difficulties, because it collects the tax from its own stores. No license state levies an ad valorem alcohol excise tax.", "It would be difficult for the District to devise an ad valorem liquor tax that closely approximates the tax that Virginia imposes on liquor sold for on-premises consumption. Restaurants and bars in Virginia buy their liquor from state-run stores at retail prices that already reflect the 20 percent excise tax. Those prices are not equivalent to either the wholesale prices that restaurants and bars in the District pay for their liquor or to the prices that District restaurants and bars charge their final customers. Consequently, the District could not replicate Virginia\u2019s tax simply by imposing a tax rate on either the wholesale or final prices. The District would have to define a new tax base that approximates the state-determined prices on which Virginia\u2019s excise tax is imposed.", "We are unable to say whether average alcohol prices and revenues from alcohol taxes would increase or decrease if the District conformed its statutory alcohol tax rates to those in Virginia. In order to estimate the effects on average prices and revenues, we would need to know the distribution of alcohol sales in the District, by beverage type and by price range. However, this information does not exist. The total value of alcohol sales in the District each year is unknown. Without knowing how average prices would be affected, it is not possible to predict how total alcohol consumption in the District would be affected by this specific change in the District\u2019s tax structure. The decrease in the combined tax on beer likely would cause beer consumption to increase, and the increase in the combined tax on liquor likely would cause liquor consumption to decline. In order to determine whether such a trade-off would be desirable, we would have to be able to estimate the relative sizes of the changes in beer and liquor consumption. The data needed to make such estimates do not exist. National surveys indicate that beer is the alcoholic beverage of choice among youths who drink alcoholic beverages.

In contrast, the inflation-adjusted excise tax rate on liquor would be more than twice as high as the current rate.", "Since the time that all of these excise tax rates were last increased, two changes have been made to the special sales tax rates for alcoholic beverages. In 1992 the sales tax rate for alcoholic beverages sold for off-premises consumption was increased from 6 percent to 8 percent. In 1994 the rate for on-premises consumption was increased from 9 to 10 percent.

Researchers have concluded that the alcohol industry is oligopolistic, meaning that it is dominated by a few large suppliers. There is no generally accepted theory of how prices are determined in an oligopolistic industry; therefore, the exact extent to which alcohol excise taxes will affect the prices of alcoholic beverages is uncertain. Nor is there clear empirical evidence to indicate what portion of a tax increase will be passed along to alcoholic beverage consumers in the form of increased prices. Some researchers have estimated that past alcohol excise tax increases have caused prices to increase by more than the full amount of the tax increase. Other economists have suggested that the extent to which excise tax increases are passed along to consumers varies depending on the characteristics of the markets where consumers purchase their beverages. Such characteristics include how responsive market demand is to price changes and how much competition among sellers exists in the markets.

Those individuals could avoid a District tax increase that was passed on to consumers by making their purchases in Maryland or Virginia. If the cost of shifting the location of their purchases is less than the cost imposed by the District tax increase, then their cost of consumption would not have risen by the full 10 cents per gallon. In contrast, these individuals could not avoid a full increase in the federal excise tax that was passed on to consumers by shifting their purchases. Because the District tax would increase the cost of consumption for some consumers by less than a similar federal tax increase would, it would produce smaller aggregate behavioral changes.In addition to reducing the beneficial behavioral effects of an alcohol tax increase, the shifting of sales would reduce the potential revenue gains for the District.

A third approach combines these two by creating multiple communitywide strategies, such as using education and skill-building programs to support new laws and regulations.

The main goals of school-based programs are to decrease the overall prevalence and level of drinking among youth; reduce the progression of alcohol consumption to problem levels; and, ideally, prevent young persons from starting to drink.

The District of Columbia and the states of Maryland and Virginia use a number of enforcement techniques to ensure compliance with state and local laws covering, among other things, who may serve or be served alcohol, the type of alcohol that can be sold, and the time during which alcohol can be sold. Appendix V describes selected provisions of alcohol control laws, along with related penalties, for the District, Maryland, and Virginia.", "Alcohol beverage control (ABC) boards establish conditions for issuing licenses to sell alcohol and rely on a cadre of enforcement officials to monitor compliance with these regulations and impose penalties for violations. Owners of licensed drinking establishments and alcohol servers can be punished by fines and short jail terms if they violate alcohol-related laws and regulations. The District and neighboring jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia devote different levels of resources to enforcement. For example, the ratio of enforcement officials to licensees in the District is about 1 to 400; the ratio in the City of Alexandria is about 1 to 150. In Virginia, unlike Maryland and the District, ABC enforcement officials have enhanced authority, which, among other things, allows them not only to fine the establishment that sells alcohol to underage purchasers, but also to fine the employee and the youth attempting to purchase alcohol. ABC officials in the District and Maryland would like similar enforcement authority granted to their staff, because they believe that this authority is a highly effective deterrent to underage drinking. Following is a description of several legal and regulatory strategies whose effectiveness has been demonstrated by research.", "Studies of server training programs reveal that they can modify servers\u2019 and managers\u2019 knowledge and beliefs about alcohol service and bring about changes in serving practices that help reduce the rate and amount of alcohol consumed by patrons. Such training increased staff intervention with intoxicated patrons and increased servers\u2019 willingness to suggest alternative beverages and forms of transportation. Research also shows that server intervention can be greatly enhanced through increased enforcement of alcohol control laws and server liability laws.", "Several researchers have explored the effectiveness of increasing the visibility of enforcement and the rigorousness of prosecution of alcohol control laws. They found declines in both the number of arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol obtained at bars and restaurants and incidents of alcohol service to researchers posing as intoxicated patrons. Research also shows that liability laws have affected the behavior of persons who serve alcohol, which in turn affects the drinking practices of patrons. Server liability laws place the server at risk of committing a violation for serving alcohol to underage drinkers or highly intoxicated patrons. Further, under civil liability, or dram shop laws, an alcohol server has potential legal responsibility for damage that intoxicated patrons and underage drinkers inflict on themselves or others. The financial loss that bar and restaurant servers and managers may incur is expected to deter serving practices that could increase a patron\u2019s risk of a motor vehicle accident and other liabilities.", "The minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) policy has been heavily studied, with numerous research findings demonstrating the effectiveness of a higher MLDA in preventing injuries and deaths among youth. For example, the MLDA of 21 is estimated to save more than 1,000 young lives each year. A recent review of 50 studies provided evidence that raising the legal drinking age to 21 reduced youth drinking and related problems, such as traffic crashes. In response to many concerns about people under the age of 21 easily obtaining alcohol, research has also suggested that the MLDA could become even more effective with increased enforcement, including deterrents for adults who might sell or provide alcohol to minors.", "Lower legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits for youth and adults have been found to decrease alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Many states have lowered legally allowable BAC limits for young drivers in an effort to reduce their involvement in alcohol-related crashes; for these states, BACs range from .00 to .05. An analysis of the first four states to lower BAC levels found that these states experienced a decline in teenage nighttime fatal crashes 30 percent greater than declines in nearby comparison states that did not lower the BAC limit. A number of states have also lowered the legal BAC for adults from .10 to .08 percent.

These communitywide programs incorporate strategies to both regulate the physical and social conditions in which drinking occurs and educate individuals about alcohol use and enhance their ability to reduce or resist drinking. Early research indicated that using multiple approaches produced only temporary changes in drinking behavior and the prevalence of alcohol-related problems. Programs were redesigned in response to these findings, and preliminary data suggest that these newer multifaceted strategies may be more successful in reducing alcohol consumption than either individual or environmental approaches alone. For example, in several states implementation of a strong educational program, along with lowering the legal BAC limit for teen drivers, was reported to significantly reduce nighttime fatal automobile crashes. A 5 year community prevention trial that combined several strategies, including mobilizing the community, increasing enforcement of drinking and driving laws, and enforcing underage sales laws, resulted in a reduction in alcohol-involved traffic crashes of about 10 percent a year and significant reductions in alcohol sales to minors.

Common problems include questions about the validity of self-reported data, the selection of inappropriate research designs and statistical analyses, lack of comparable experimental and control groups, and the potential impact of high attrition rates. Evaluations of early school-based programs, for example, relied heavily on self-reported data to measure alcohol use, which raises concerns about possible underreporting or overreporting by program participants. Although recent studies have attempted to address many methodological challenges that commonly face researchers of prevention programs, concerns continue to surface.

There is a clear presumption that higher taxes on alcoholic beverages are correlated with higher prices for those beverages. In general, however, the link between alcohol taxes and alcohol prices requires further study. Economists believe that the extent to which any excise tax increase is passed along to consumers varies depending on the characteristics of the markets in which consumers purchase their beverages. Such characteristics would include how responsive market demand is to price changes and how much competition among sellers exists in the market. Most researchers studying the economics of alcohol consumption assume that the full amount of the excise tax increase is passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In the absence of more complete evidence, researchers believe these are the best assumptions that can be made. Many researchers have used the variation in state-level excise tax rates across states as a proxy for the variation of alcohol prices across states.", "Researchers have estimated a range of values for the degree to which consumption of beer, wine, or liquor responds to changes in the prices of these beverages. A comprehensive survey of empirical research conducted between 1983 and 1992 on the effect of price increases on alcohol consumption found that in response to a 10 percent beer price increase, beer consumption would decline by between 1.2 percent and 10.7 percent, with most studies estimating that the change in consumption would be less than 5 percent.", "Generally, studies have tended to show that liquor and wine consumption is somewhat more responsive to price changes than is beer consumption. Experts estimated that liquor consumption would decline by between 5 percent and 10 percent in response to a 10 percent liquor price increase, but most of the estimates for wine were in the range of 5 to 20 percent.", "Other, generally more recent, studies have used data from surveys of individual alcohol consumption. These studies have found higher estimates for the consumption response to an increase in the price of alcohol. NIAAA\u2019s 1997 report to Congress reviewed and summarized the post-1992 studies of the effect of alcohol price increases on consumption. According to this report, there continues to be substantial variation in estimates of the responsiveness of alcohol consumption to changes in alcohol prices.", "One reason why the effects of price increases on alcohol consumption remain uncertain is the quality of the data that researchers have to work with. To make more precise estimates of the effects of price increases on alcohol consumption, one would need to use accurate measures of the prices that individual consumers pay for various types of alcohol rather than consumption data aggregated to a state or national level. However, collecting price data for a large sample of consumers is difficult and costly. There may also be problems with the data on alcohol consumption that have been used in the empirical literature\u2014self-reported consumption data\u2014which tend to understate actual consumption. The use of alternatives to self-reported consumption data, such as expenditures on alcoholic beverages, may introduce a different set of errors and biases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence Indicates That Both Light and Heavy Drinkers Are Responsive to Alcohol Prices, Although Some of the Heaviest Drinkers May Be Less Responsive", "paragraphs": ["Light, moderate, and fairly heavy drinkers respond to alcohol price increases by cutting back on consumption. However, among a relatively small number of the very heaviest drinkers\u2014those often considered to be addicted to alcohol\u2014some researchers have found very little, if any, response to changes in price, while others have found some price responsiveness. One study found that consumers in the middle of the distribution of drinkers were the most sensitive to price changes, and very light and very heavy drinkers were less sensitive. This study also found that the higher the price of alcohol, the less likely consumers were to have any days of heavy drinking. Another study that examined the effects of alcohol prices on the frequency of heavy drinking and drunk driving found that a higher price of alcohol was associated with significant reductions in the frequency of heavy drinking for males of all ages, for females of all ages, and for females aged 21 and younger, but not for males aged 21 and younger.", "In another study, the same researcher has found that reported familiarity with the health consequences of drinking was important in determining the extent to which the heaviest drinkers responded to price changes. The least-informed heavy drinkers did not appear to be sensitive to price changes, but the best-informed heavy drinkers appeared to be very sensitive. The author notes that the heaviest-drinking, least-informed consumers might be alcoholics who are in denial over the adverse consequences of drinking. He and a colleague also note that his finding is consistent with results of the Manning et al. study that found that very light and very heavy drinkers were less sensitive to price than others.

One explanation of the greater price sensitivity of younger drinkers is that younger drinkers may have less income to spend than their older counterparts. Whatever the reason for the greater price sensitivity of younger drinkers, there may be public policy implications. If older drinkers\u2014those with a long-term lifestyle that includes heavy drinking\u2014are less sensitive to price while younger drinkers are more sensitive to price, higher alcohol taxes may have a two-fold effect. Higher alcohol prices may be an effective policy for reducing youth alcohol consumption and its related problems, as well as in reducing the likelihood of developing a long-term lifestyle that includes heavy drinking.", "Most researchers have found that beer is the beverage of choice among youths who drink alcoholic beverages. Some researchers have concluded that beer is disproportionately preferred by higher risk groups\u2014for example, by those who drink a lot during a typical session far more than by those who drink moderately. It also has been noted that beer drinkers are more likely to drive while intoxicated than drinkers of other alcoholic beverages. Additionally (as noted above) researchers believe that the responsiveness of alcohol consumption to changes in its price is greater for youth than for adults. One study estimated that a 10-percent increase in the price of beer could cause youths\u2019 consumption to decline by 23 percent. For those 17 to 29, another study found that on average, a 10-percent increase in the price of beer would lead to about a 7-percent decrease in consumption in the long run. Yet another study found that after the states increased their legal drinking ages to 21 in the late 1980s, the price sensitivity of youth alcohol use fell.", "Recent studies show that the drinking behavior of youths who are frequent, heavy, or binge drinkers is especially sensitive to alcohol price changes. One study found that a 10-percent decline in the price of beer would increase the number of youths (aged 16 to 21) who drink beer 4 to 7 times per week by about 10 percent. The same 10-percent decline in price would cause the number of youths (aged 16 to 21) who consumed no beer per week to fall by about 7 percent. Another study by some of the same experts found that the number of youths who drink six or more cans of beer on a typical drinking day would decline by about 31 percent in response to a price increase of 10 percent; the number of youths who drink only 1 to 2 cans of beer on a typical drinking day would decline by about 12 percent in response to a price increase of 10 percent. In contrast, another recent study suggests that prices would have little impact on drinking and binge drinking among male college students. The effects of alcohol taxation on heavy and binge drinking are of special interest because of the high fatality rates from drunken driving that are associated with it. Alcohol involvement in motor vehicle accidents is estimated to be three times higher in the 18- to 20-year-old group than it is in the general population.

There is a consensus in the empirical literature that an increase in the price of alcoholic beverages would reduce the number of lives lost in vehicle fatalities. According to one study, the occurrence of drunk driving declines as its full price increases. The study also found the risk of death or injury from an auto accident rises precipitously with the intensity of drinking; i.e., binge drinking. Another study found that higher state beer excise tax rates were associated with reductions in motor vehicle fatalities for youths aged 15 through 24.Likewise, in another study the state beer excise tax rate exhibited large negative and statistically significant associations with total driver fatalities, night driver fatalities, and alcohol-involved fatalities for both drivers of all ages and drivers 18 to 20 years old. Other researchers found higher state beer tax rates to be weakly associated with a reduced propensity to drive drunk.", "A recent study of the relation between beer prices and drunken driving included a relatively comprehensive set of explanatory variables and examined a variety of different model specifications. This study found that a 10-percent increase in the price of beer would result in an almost 10-percent decrease in the fatality rate from drunken driving, a 14-percent decrease in the fatality rate from nighttime drunken driving, and a 14-percent decrease in the fatality rate from drunken driving for those aged 18 to 20. Another recent study estimated that alcohol prices have a negative and significant effect on binge drinking\u2014the behavior that leads to drunken driving\u2014with a 10-percent increase in the price of alcohol leading to a 9-percent decrease in the expected number of binge episodes per month.", "Two studies have found that the excise tax rate on liquor has a negative and significant effect on the liver cirrhosis death rate. In contrast, other researchers found higher alcohol prices were not significantly related to lower death rates from liver cirrhosis.
