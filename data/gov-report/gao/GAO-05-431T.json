This strategy would allow a gradual drawdown of its forces based on the multinational force neutralizing the insurgency and developing Iraqi military and police services that can independently maintain security. U.S. government agencies do not report reliable data on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are trained and equipped. As of March 2005, the State Department reported that about 82,000 police forces under the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and about 62,000 military forces under the Iraqi Ministry of Defense have been trained and equipped. However, the reported number of Iraqi police is unreliable because the Ministry of Interior does not receive consistent and accurate reporting from the police forces around the country. The data does not exclude police absent from duty. Further, the departments of State and Defense no longer report on the extent to which Iraqi security forces are equipped with their required weapons, vehicles, communications equipment, and body armor. The insurgency in Iraq has intensified since June 2003, making it difficult to transfer security responsibilities to Iraqi forces. From that time through January 2005, insurgent attacks grew in number, complexity, and intensity. At the same time, the multinational force has faced four key challenges in increasing the capability of Iraqi forces: (1) training, equipping, and sustaining a changing force structure; (2) developing a system for measuring the readiness and capability of Iraqi forces; (3) building loyalty and leadership throughout the Iraqi chain of command; and (4) developing a police force that upholds the rule of law in a hostile environment. The multinational force is taking steps to address these challenges, such as developing a system to assess unit readiness and embedding US forces within Iraqi units. However, without reliable reporting data, a more capable Iraqi force, and stronger Iraqi leadership, the Department of Defense faces difficulties in implementing its strategy to draw down U.S. forces from Iraq."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss challenges in transferring security  responsibilities from the multinational force to the Iraqi military and  police forces.

MNF-I identified problems in training and equipping them as among the  reasons for their poor performance.  Training of police and some defense  forces was not uniform and varied widely across Iraq.  MNF-I\u2019s  commanders had the leeway to institute their own versions of the  transitional police curriculum, and the training for some defense forces  did not prepare them to fight against well-armed insurgents.  Further,  according to the CPA Director of Police, when Iraqi police voluntarily  returned to duty in May 2003, CPA initially provided limited training and  did not thoroughly vet the personnel to get them on the streets quickly.

On February 3, 2005, the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the  insurgency in Iraq had built up slowly during the first year, then became  very intense from summer 2004 through January 2005. Figure 1 provides  Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) data showing these trends in enemy  initiated attacks against the coalition, its Iraqi partners, and infrastructure.  Overall attacks peaked in August 2004 due to a rise in violence in Sunni- dominated regions and an uprising by the Mahdi Army, a Shi\u2019a insurgent  group led by radical Shi\u2019a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.  Although the November  2004 and January 2005 numbers were slightly lower than those for August,  it is significant that almost all of the attacks in these 2 months took place  in Sunni-majority areas, whereas the August attacks took place  countrywide.  MNF-I is the primary target of the attacks, but the number of  attacks against Iraqi civilians and security forces increased significantly  during January 2005. On March 1, 2005, the CENTCOM Commander told  the Senate Armed Services Committee that more Iraqi security forces than  Americans have died in action against insurgents since June 2004.", "Insurgents have demonstrated their ability to increase attacks around key  events, according to the DIA Director\u2019s February 2005 statement before  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. For example, attacks spiked  in April and May 2004, the months before the transfer of power to the Iraqi  interim government; in November 2004 due to a rise in violence in Sunni- dominated areas during Ramadan and MNF-I\u2019s operation against  insurgents in Fallujah; and in January 2005 before the Iraqi elections. The  DIA Director testified that attacks on Iraq\u2019s election day reached about  300, double the previous 1 day high of about 150 during last year\u2019s  Ramadan. About 80 percent of all attacks occurred in Sunni-dominated  central Iraq, with the Kurdish north and Shia south remaining relatively  calm.", "In February and March 2004, the DIA Director and CENTCOM Commander  presented their views of the nature of the insurgency to the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Armed Services Committee,  respectively. According to these officials, the core of the insurgency  consists of Sunni Arabs, dominated by Ba\u2019athist and former regime  elements.  Shi\u2019a militant groups, such as those associated with the radical  Shi\u2019a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, remain a threat to the political process.   Following the latest round of fighting last August and September, DIA  concluded that al-Sadr\u2019s forces were re-arming, re-organizing, and training,  with al-Sadr keeping his options open to employ his forces. Jihadists have  been responsible for many high-profile attacks that have a  disproportionate impact, although their activity accounts for only a  fraction of the overall violence.  Foreign fighters comprise a small  component of the insurgency and a very small percentage of all detainees.   DIA believes that insurgents\u2019 infiltration and subversion of emerging  government institutions, security, and intelligence services will be a major  problem for the new government.", "In late October 2004, according to a CENTCOM document, MNF-I  estimated the overall size of active enemy forces at about 20,000.

The government planned to form this larger army  by including the Iraqi National Guard and accelerating the training and  recruitment of new troops.  In addition, in late 2004, the Ministry of  Interior added the Mechanized Police Brigade, a paramilitary, counter- insurgency unit that will consist of three battalions that will deploy to  high-risk areas.  It also created the paramilitary, army-type Special Police  Commando brigades.", "According to DOD document supporting the February 2005 supplemental  request, the Iraqi government planned to add a number of additional  military elements, primarily support units, to the force structure over the  next year.

We obtained and  reviewed further breakdowns of briefings on the supplemental request.  To  identify challenges in developing the Iraqi police force, we interviewed  police trainers in Jordan and reviewed the State Department\u2019s Country  Report on Human Rights Practices for 2004.", "We obtained comments on a draft of this statement from State and DOD,  including CENTCOM.  All generally agreed with our statement and  provided technical comments that we have incorporated as appropriate.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
