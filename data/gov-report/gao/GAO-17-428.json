Department of Defense (DOD) guidance requires the accounting of certain contractor personnel during contingency operations, but is unclear for steady-state environments. PACOM issued limited guidance in November 2016 to address accountability processes in contingency and steady-state environments, and PACOM and some of its components use multiple mechanisms to account for contractor personnel, resulting in inconsistencies in the numbers of contractor personnel accounted for, which could present difficulties in an emergency or contingency operation. Additionally, PACOM lacks a foreign vendor vetting process due to a lack of DOD guidance identifying what vendor vetting processes should be established at combatant commands. PACOM has taken some action on vendor vetting, such as including vetting in exercises and screening some contractor personnel, but it lacks a process that includes details, such as under what circumstances a vetting cell should be established. DOD guidance specifying under what circumstances a vetting cell should be established would better position PACOM to avoid contracting with the enemy in high-threat areas.", "PACOM established an interim operational contract support (OCS) organizational structure through a pilot program that ends in June 2017. PACOM officials stated that, upon completion of the pilot, they intend to establish the structure as an enduring OCS capability within the command's logistics directorate. The intent is to provide the combatant command, subordinate unified commands, and service components a central entity to integrate OCS across joint functions, such as directorates dealing with personnel or intelligence. However, service component officials stated that PACOM's OCS organizational structure might have been more effective if it engaged all joint staff functions, including directorates beyond logistics. DOD, Joint Staff, and PACOM guidance identify the important role that directorates beyond logistics should play as stakeholders in OCS. Similarly, GAO has previously reported on the challenges DOD has faced integrating OCS in functional areas beyond logistics. By considering ways to expand its OCS organizational structure beyond the logistics directorate and better integrate the equities of other directorates, PACOM could be better positioned to build on the progress made during the pilot program.", "PACOM has integrated OCS into key planning documents, as required by guidance, by developing OCS annexes for 6 of its 11 operational, concept, and campaign plans. Officials added that they will continue to update the remaining plans as planning cycles and resources allow. However, the annex appendixes generally lack key details, such as contractor management and support estimates. PACOM officials told GAO that such details are determined through requirements development at the service component commands, but challenges exist related to these issues due to unclear guidance. Without guidance that clarifies the requirements-development process for OCS annexes, PACOM will continue to lack important details that are needed to determine OCS requirements for operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOD and PACOM develop or update guidance related to contractor personnel accountability, vendor vetting, and OCS organizational structure; and that PACOM develop guidance that clarifies requirements development for plans.

Specifically, the PACOM OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration has  three primary purposes: establish a capability to address current PACOM gaps regarding the  ability to plan and integrate OCS into operations and training;  contribute to the department\u2019s mandate to improve acquisition  processes through training and continuous improvement in the  qualifications and experience both of the acquisition workforce and of  nonacquisition personnel; and  inform OCS force development across DOD.", "PACOM officials provided examples of how the OCS Mission Integrator  Demonstration has enhanced OCS capabilities at PACOM through  training in Joint Operational Contract Support Planning and Execution  Courses at PACOM, and the integration of key OCS features or practices  into four major exercises, including the OCS Joint Exercise 2015,  Talisman Sabre, Pacific Sentry, and Keen Edge. See appendix II for  additional details on the integration of OCS into these exercises.", "The OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration team comprises military  personnel assigned to PACOM, two Joint Contingency Acquisition  Support Office (JCASO) civilian planners, and six contractor personnel.  These personnel are all located in PACOM\u2019s J4 logistics directorate and  the logistics directorates in three of PACOM\u2019s service component  commands, although the distribution has varied during the 3 years of the  experiment. Officials stated that this horizontal and vertical integration\u2014 horizontally across the PACOM logistics directorate and vertically down to  the logistics directorates within the service components\u2014will remain in  place through 2017, and acknowledged it has both advantages and  disadvantages. For example, PACOM officials stated that maintaining a  separate OCS branch within the logistics directorate simplifies  assignment tasking, but makes it more difficult to embrace OCS outside  of the designated OCS billets.", "DOD, Joint Staff, and PACOM guidance indicate the important role  directorates beyond logistics should play as stakeholders in OCS. As  described by Joint Publication 4-10, an OCS Integration Cell leads the  OCS planning and integration efforts across multiple staff sections,  helping to ensure OCS is fully embedded and integrated throughout the  command structure, as depicted in figure 2 below.", "In October 2016, DOD issued Command and Staff Guide to Operational  Contract Support, which identifies key OCS questions a commander  should ensure staff across multiple directorates can answer. For  example:  J1 personnel directorate: How many DOD contractors are in the  operational area? What is the breakdown of contractor personnel with  respect to U.S. citizens, third-country nationals, and local nationals?", "J2 intelligence directorate: How are vendors being vetted? How are  the vetting results communicated within DOD and among U.S.  government agencies?", "J3 operations directorate: How is the command measuring the  operational impacts of contracts? What is our process for determining  base access?", "Further, joint doctrine identifies a key OCS principle that states that  contracted support is not restricted to logistics support, but may include  significant nonlogistic support as well. Joint doctrine also notes that close  coordination between all primary and special staff members is required to  ensure OCS planning balances effectiveness with efficiency and risk  while seeking to attain the commander\u2019s strategic end state. The Joint  Staff is in the process of developing an OCS planning manual that,  according to officials, would encourage OCS integration with all staff  directorates at a combatant command. Specifically, officials stated the  manual will discuss ways in which a command can ensure OCS equities  are being considered from all directorates, including hosting OCS  Integration Cell meetings open to all command staff. However, as of  February 2017, this manual had not been issued.", "PACOM guidance also recognizes the important role directorates beyond  logistics should play as stakeholders in OCS. Specifically, PACOM\u2019s OCS  guidance identifies recommended planning considerations for command  directorates, including nonlogistics directorates, with respect to OCS  within the command\u2019s area of responsibility in preparation for a  contingency operation. For example:  J1 Manpower and Personnel Directorate is to provide status reports  (through SPOT) to DOD on contractors authorized to accompany the  force and to develop contractor reception policies and procedures in  coordination with the J3 Operations Directorate.", "J2 Intelligence Directorate is to conduct intelligence-specific activities  associated with data reported in SPOT, as required.", "J3 Operations Directorate is to integrate SPOT data into Anti- Terrorism Force Protection networks.", "J5 Strategic Planning and Policy Directorate is to provide awareness  on joint planning tools in regard to generating OCS requirements and  identifying capability gaps.", "While each of these directorates has OCS responsibilities as outlined  above, they did not have representation in the OCS Mission Integrator  Demonstration. PACOM officials acknowledged that maintaining its OCS  Integration Cell within the logistics directorate complicates assignment  tasking outside of that directorate and reinforces the view of OCS as a  separate function, making it difficult to integrate OCS efforts in other  directorates. In addition, PACOM service component officials told us that  the OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration might have been more  effective if it integrated individuals from all joint staff functions, including  other directorates beyond logistics. Officials from one component told us  they thought a key purpose of the OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration  was to engage all staff directorates in OCS issues and integrate OCS  across all joint functions to best optimize total force capability, which may  not have been optimally met by placing the pilot program within the  logistics directorate.", "PACOM has not determined the size and organizational structure of an  entity managing OCS following the conclusion of the pilot in June 2017.  PACOM officials told us the future OCS capability, at a minimum, will  consist of one military officer and the two civilian embedded planners  from JCASO and will remain within the logistics directorate.", "We have previously reported that because DOD doctrine recognizes that  OCS is more than just logistical support, it is important that a significant  culture change occur, one that emphasizes OCS throughout all aspects of  the department, including planning, training, and personnel requirements.  Moreover, as we reported in 2013, DOD has faced challenges integrating  OCS in functional areas beyond logistics. For example, we determined  that combatant commands and their components were not planning for  the potential use of contractors in areas where they may be needed  beyond logistics such as communications. Additionally, we reported that  OCS planners embedded in a combatant command do not typically focus  on OCS matters in areas beyond logistics, leaving DOD at risk of being  unprepared to plan and manage deployed contractor personnel across  functional areas and provide the necessary oversight during future  operations. By considering ways to integrate individuals from all joint staff  functions beyond the logistics area into its enduring OCS organizational  structure, PACOM may be better positioned to build upon the progress  made during the OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration and more  effectively integrate OCS across the command."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PACOM Has Integrated OCS Annexes into Operational and Concept Plans, but the Information Lacks Details on Contractor Management and Support Estimates", "paragraphs": ["PACOM has integrated OCS into 6 of its 11 operational, concept, and  campaign plans for potential contingencies by developing OCS  annexes\u2014known as Annex Ws\u2014 that are required by DOD guidance for  certain plans, but the annexes lack details on contractor management  and support estimates in required appendixes. PACOM planners from  the OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration as well as the plans  directorate worked with logistics directorate officials at PACOM  headquarters, the service component commands, and subordinate unified  commands to develop the annexes. PACOM officials noted that although  the 5 remaining plans do not require the annex, they will update them with  Annex Ws as planning cycles dictate and resources allow, and noted that  personnel will have to prioritize planning efforts when the OCS Mission  Integrator Demonstration pilot program ends in June 2017, as previously  discussed.", "According to joint doctrine, an Annex W is the primary means used by  combatant command staff, subordinate staff, service components, and  other organizations to document OCS in operation plans. DOD  Instruction 3020.41 directs combatant commanders to include an Annex  W in operation plans and in concept plans with time-phased force and  deployment data. Additionally, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Manual 3130.03 identifies the key components of an Annex W, including  a description of key OCS-related planning assumptions and limiting  factors, key tasks for subordinate units, and commercial sourcing for  nonlogistics support such as intelligence and communications, as well as  logistics support such as commodities, base life support, and common  equipment maintenance. PACOM\u2019s annexes generally include these  elements, such as assumptions about the number and types of services  that may require contract support (e.g., bottled water, base life support,  construction, and maintenance).", "However, we determined that PACOM Annex Ws lacked detailed  information in appendixes required by guidance. Specifically, Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3130.03 identifies the key components of  an Annex W, including three appendixes. For example, these  appendixes should include a", "Summary of Contracting Capabilities and Capacities Support  Estimate, which identifies the estimated numbers of support personnel  for each assigned unit, designated locations, and key contracting  organizations;", "Contractor Management Plan, which focuses on contractor personnel  and equipment tasks, to include contractor personnel accountability,  as well as government-furnished support and equipment; and", "Summary of Contractor Support Estimate, which includes estimates of  the number of contractors authorized to accompany the force by  operational phase and capability area.", "We found PACOM\u2019s Annex Ws do not have precise information in their  Summary of Contracting Capabilities and Capacities Support Estimate,  Contractor Management Plans, and Summary of Contractor Support  Estimate appendixes. While the details of these annexes are classified, in  general the appendixes did not always include the estimated number of  support personnel or key contracting organizations. Additionally, some of  the appendixes did not include the number of contractors authorized to  accompany the force by operational phase and capability area.", "PACOM officials stated that they face several challenges with regard to  including this detail in appendixes. For example, PACOM headquarters  and service component officials identified challenges related to planning  cycles and the tendency of operational planners to review only the  annexes that pertain to their own issue areas. Additionally, officials stated  that other challenges hinder requirements development, which is a  necessary step to developing the needed details for Annex W  appendixes. For example, requirements development can be hindered by  limited access to the operational environment in order to conduct site  surveys, as well as dependence on host nations to support site surveys.  Officials also stated that lack of visibility into details regarding the  capabilities that will be available during a contingency makes it difficult to  develop detailed requirements.", "Despite these limitations, progress has been made by selected PACOM  subordinate commands regarding requirements development. For  example, officials from III Marine Expeditionary Force stated that they are  working to address this concern through the development of a Marine  Requirements and Resourcing Review Board. According to officials, this  board will focus not just on requirements, but also on the resources that  will be needed to obtain them. The board reviews all contracts for III  Marine Expeditionary Force, validates the resourcing for those contracts,  prioritizes the current and future requirements in relation to the resources,  and makes recommendations to the Deputy Commanding General.  Because the board validates not just the requirement but also the  resources available to fulfill that requirement, officials stated that it should  help to obtain information that could be useful in Annex Ws and their  accompanying appendixes.", "PACOM officials acknowledged the need to address these challenges  and conducted a series of five OCS planning working groups from  November 2016 to January 2017 to discuss the development of OCS  requirements in support of planning efforts. Additionally, OCS working  groups housed within the logistics directorate have been integrated into  PACOM\u2019s daily planning activities in order to ensure that OCS equities  are considered within the command\u2019s activities. The establishment of  working groups and incorporation of OCS equities into the command\u2019s  regular planning activities demonstrate progress in improving the  development of OCS requirements. However, a lack of clarity continues  to exist with respect to the roles and responsibilities associated with  headquarters and service component officials and the level of detail  needed in the development of Annex Ws and their appendixes.  Specifically, PACOM officials stated that this information is not included in  the completed Annex W appendixes that PACOM expects the  requirements generators within the service components to provide.  However, service component and subordinate unified command officials  stated that they need additional guidance from PACOM or their service  headquarters to determine the level of detail that is needed.", "Combatant commanders have discretion regarding the amount of detail  needed in the relevant annexes and their appendixes both at the  combatant command and subordinate levels. However, service  component officials stated that additional direction or an established  mechanism for communication from PACOM headquarters or their  service headquarters could help to clarify the level of detail needed to  enhance the usefulness of the Annex Ws and their accompanying  appendixes. Also, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that management should assign responsibility and  delegate authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, including determining  the level of authority that should be delegated to key roles. Without  guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities as well as the process for  requirements development to inform the development of Annex Ws and  their appendixes, the annexes will continue to lack important details that  are needed to determine OCS requirements and adequately plan for  future operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While PACOM has taken steps to manage and oversee OCS, challenges  remain in areas such as accounting for the total number of contractor  personnel, vendor vetting, the enduring OCS organizational structure, and  OCS requirements-development planning for incorporation into  operational plans. PACOM\u2019s November 2016 personnel accountability  guidance demonstrates progress toward addressing the collection of  contractor personnel data, but it does not specifically account for third- country nationals and local nationals or specify a system of record to be  used for all contractor personnel in steady-state environments.  Additionally, DOD accountability guidance on the types of contractor  personnel to account for in steady-state environments remains unclear.  PACOM also has not established a foreign-vendor vetting process to  preemptively identify vendors that support criminal, terrorist, or other  sanctioned organizations due in part to a lack of DOD guidance  specifying under what conditions a vendor vetting process or cell should  be established. Additionally, without updated guidance that integrates  individuals from directorates beyond logistics into the OCS Integration  Cell, PACOM may lose some of the ground gained during the OCS  Mission Integrator Demonstration. Finally, PACOM has made progress in  developing OCS annexes to plans, but those annexes do not include  precise and important details on contractor management. OCS is a critical  force multiplier that supports U.S. military forces in the region when they  respond rapidly to crises, such as threats including North Korea.  PACOM\u2019s readiness is evaluated against its ability to execute operational  and contingency plans, which place a premium on forward-stationed,  ready forces that can exercise, train, and operate with our partner nations\u2019  militaries, and on follow-on forces, including contractor support, to be able  to respond to operational contingencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following six  actions:  To enable the department to enhance its visibility over contractor  personnel for whom it may become responsible in the event of  contingency and other applicable operations, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, update accountability guidance clarifying the types of  contractor personnel that are to be accounted for in a steady-state  environment.", "To enable PACOM to consistently account for contractor personnel in its  area of responsibility, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the PACOM Commander to clarify contractor personnel accountability  guidance for the collection of all contractor personnel data in a steady- state environment and specify a system of record, such as SPOT, for the  collection of this information.", "To ensure that combatant commands are not contracting with entities that  may be connected to or supporting prohibited organizations, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, develop and issue guidance that  clarifies the foreign-vendor vetting steps or process that should be  established at each combatant command, including the operational  conditions under which a foreign-vendor vetting cell should be  established.", "To ensure that PACOM is not contracting with entities that may be  connected to or supporting prohibited organizations, we recommend that,  while awaiting DOD guidance on vendor vetting, the Secretary of Defense  direct the PACOM commander to consider developing vendor vetting  guidance as other combatant commands have done, to prepare for the  event that PACOM becomes actively engaged in hostilities.", "To enable OCS to be fully embedded in the command structure at the  command and continue to build upon the progress of integrating OCS into  the command, we recommend that as PACOM updates OCS guidance,  the Secretary of Defense direct the PACOM Commander to consider  ways to ensure all joint staff functions beyond the logistics area are fully  integrated into its OCS organizational structure and OCS Integration Cell.", "To enable PACOM to better identify OCS requirements and incorporate  those requirements into Annex Ws and their appendixes, we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct the PACOM Commander to develop  guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities and the process that  should be followed for OCS requirements development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD and PACOM concurred  with two recommendations and partially concurred with four  recommendations. Comments from DOD and PACOM are summarized  below and reprinted in appendix III. DOD and PACOM also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD concurred with the first recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  update accountability guidance clarifying the types of contractor  personnel that are to be accounted for in a steady state environment. In  its response, DOD stated that DOD Instruction 3020.41, Operational  Contract Support, is being updated, and will include guidance on the  types of contractor personnel that are to be accounted for in Phase 0  operations, when directed by the combatant commander or joint task  force commander, using SPOT. The department will also update  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3150.13C, Joint Personnel  Reporting Structure\u2014Personnel Manual, to clarify the types of contractor  personnel that are to the accounted for, based on the updates to DOD  Instruction 3020.41. We agree that these guidance updates, when  completed and issued as stated, would meet the intent of the  recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with the second recommendation that the  PACOM Commander clarify contractor personnel accountability guidance  for the collection of all contractor personnel data during a steady state  environment and specify a system of record, such as SPOT, for the  collection of this information. In its response, PACOM stated that the  accountability instruction issued in November 2016, referenced earlier in  this report, prescribes guidance for the reporting of DOD-affiliated  personnel, to include contractors, in crisis, contingency, and steady state  operations using the Joint Personnel Status Report as the system of  record. Additionally, PACOM noted that it is conducting a feasibility  assessment of implementing SPOT in Phase 0 operations in three  countries where the majority of contractors currently work, and will  conduct a review of its accountability instruction to further clarify  contractor accountability and visibility guidance. We agree that the review  of accountability guidance and the feasibility assessment would be  beneficial in further clarifying contractor accountability and visibility  guidance. As we discuss in the report, in the absence of clear  accountability guidance from DOD, PACOM has used multiple  mechanisms for contractor personnel accountability, which has resulted in  inconsistent reporting. Additionally, PACOM\u2019s accountability guidance  issued in November 2016 is limited in that it excludes foreign-national  contractor personnel. This recommendation was intended to provide  PACOM with the flexibility to identify a system of record in its  accountability guidance for the collection of contractor personnel  accountability information in a steady-state or Phase 0 environment so  that PACOM could utilize a single mechanism for contractor personnel  accountability. Without updated guidance to clarify what types of  contractor personnel are to be accounted for in Phase 0 operations, as  well as the identification of a system of record for contractor personnel  accountability information, PACOM may not have a comprehensive and  consistent accounting of contractor personnel in its area of responsibility,  which could potentially limit PACOM\u2019s visibility over contractor personnel  for whom it may be responsible in the event of a contingency operation or  an emergency.", "DOD partially concurred with the third recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  develop and issue guidance that clarifies the foreign vendor vetting steps  or process that should be established at each combatant command,  including the operational conditions under which a foreign vendor vetting  cell should be established. DOD agreed that it needs to develop and  issue overarching guidance. As a result, DOD noted that, in October  2016, OSD and Joint Staff established a quarterly working group to  develop a framework for intelligence-based vendor threat mitigation\u2014 vendor vetting\u2014objectives across DOD. The working group identified  three major objectives for DOD, including providing an overarching  framework, identifying a DOD lead for program policy and oversight, and  improving information sharing across DOD and other federal agencies.  DOD indicated that an office within OSD, as part of the working group,  has incorporated inputs through a draft directive type memorandum that  will provide guidelines to meet the objectives while ensuring combatant  commands retain the flexibility needed to tailor vetting programs to meet  their specific theater and mission needs. However, DOD noted that under  section 164 of Title 10, U.S. Code, combatant commanders have the  authority to organize commands and forces as necessary to carry out  missions. We agree with DOD\u2019s assessment, and as we discuss in the  report, the establishment of a foreign-vendor vetting cell may not be  appropriate for all operations or circumstances. However, publishing  guidance for the combatant commanders to consider in their decision and  approach to establishing a foreign vendor cell would provide important  information to guide their efforts. Therefore, we continue to believe that  publishing DOD guidance identifying relevant operational conditions and  how a vetting cell should be established would better position PACOM  and other combatant commands to avoid contracting with the enemy in  high-threat areas.", "DOD concurred with the fourth recommendation that while awaiting DOD  guidance on vendor vetting, the PACOM commander consider developing  vendor vetting guidance as other combatant commands have done in the  event that they become actively engaged in hostilities. In its response,  PACOM stated that they have begun gathering facts and best practices  regarding vendor vetting, and in the absence of DOD guidance, both the  process and echelon at which vetting should occur deserves additional  study and refinement. PACOM also stated that implementation of vendor  vetting will be dependent on resource availability and priority, and ability  to leverage the capabilities and accesses of a broader community of  concern. We agree that PACOM\u2019s further study and refinement of vendor  vetting processes in its geographic area of responsibility would be  beneficial in the absence of DOD vendor vetting guidance, and would  meet the intent of the recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with the fifth recommendation for the PACOM  Commander to consider ways to ensure all joint staff functions beyond  the logistics area are fully integrated into its OCS organizational structure  and OCS Integration Cell. In its response, PACOM stated that it will  continue the ongoing process of publishing an updated OCS instruction,  as we discussed in the report, including specific primary and special staff  responsibilities related to OCS. However, PACOM stated that it integrates  staff with the OCS Integration Cell through its established process for  daily activities, including an OCS working group, but does not plan to  physically integrate other staff members into the OCS Integration Cell.  PACOM noted that it routinely integrates OCS with the greater staff by  inviting representatives to the established OCS working group, based on  agenda items, attending routine activities hosted by other staff  directorates, and hosting an internal OCS working group with  headquarters staff. We noted a number of these actions in the report and  agree that they are beneficial to the integration of OCS throughout the  staff directorates. Additionally, we recognize that Joint Publication 4-10  does not specifically call for representation from all staff within the OCS  Integration Cell itself, and notes only that the OCSIC should be made up  of a mixture of specially trained personnel with operational-level logistics  and contingency contracting experience, as DOD states in its comments.  However, as also noted in our report, PACOM officials stated that  maintaining its OCS Integration Cell within the logistics directorate  complicates assignment tasking outside of that directorate and reinforces  the view of OCS as a separate function, making it difficult to integrate  OCS efforts in other directorates. In addition, PACOM service component  officials told us that the OCS Mission Integrator Demonstration might  have been more effective if it integrated individuals from all joint staff  functions, including other directorates beyond logistics. Accordingly, we  continue to believe that PACOM should consider additional ways to  ensure all joint staff functions beyond the logistics area are fully  integrated into its OCS organizational structure and OCS Integration Cell.", "DOD partially concurred with the sixth recommendation for the PACOM  Commander to develop guidance that clarifies roles and responsibilities  and the process that should be followed for OCS requirements  development. In its response, PACOM stated that its requirements  determination in support of planning requires improvement, but that its  guidance is clear. Specifically, PACOM stated that existing published  guidance from the Joint Staff logistics directorate and PACOM logistics  directorate is clear and concise, and identifies the roles and  responsibilities of the command and subordinate units regarding planning  and the process of determining requirements. PACOM agreed that a  need exists to emphasize existing guidance to subordinate commands in  order to assist them in developing and documenting requirements.", "Emphasizing existing guidance is a good first step in improving the  requirements development and documentation process. However, as  discussed in the report, PACOM officials also stated that some key details  are not included in the completed Annex W appendixes, which the  command expects requirements generators within the service  components to provide. Service component officials stated that additional  direction or an established mechanism for communication from PACOM  headquarters or their service headquarters could help to clarify the level  of detail needed to enhance the usefulness of the Annex Ws and their  accompanying appendixes.
