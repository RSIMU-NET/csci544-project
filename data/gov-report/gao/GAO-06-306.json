In light of these events, Congress asked GAO to determine whether (1) internal controls provided reasonable assurance that improper payment of unallowable contractor costs would not be made or would be detected in the normal course of business, (2) payments to contractors were properly supported as a valid use of government funds, and (3) FBI maintained proper accountability for assets purchased with Trilogy project funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FBI's review and approval process for Trilogy contractor invoices, which included a review role for the General Services Administration (GSA) as contracting agency, did not provide an adequate basis to verify that goods and services billed were actually received and that the amounts billed were appropriate, leaving FBI highly vulnerable to payments of unallowable costs. This vulnerability is demonstrated by FBI's payment of about $10.1 million in questionable contractor costs we identified using data mining, document analysis, and other forensic auditing techniques. These costs included first-class travel and other excessive airfare costs, incorrect charges for overtime hours, potentially overcharged labor rates, and charges for which the contractors could not provide adequate supporting documentation to substantiate the costs purportedly incurred. FBI also failed to establish controls to maintain accountability over equipment purchased for the Trilogy project. These control lapses resulted in more than 1,200 missing pieces of equipment valued at approximately $7.6 million that GAO identified as part of its review. In addition, in its own inventory counts, FBI identified 37 pieces of Trilogy equipment valued at approximately $167,000 that had been lost or stolen."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For several years Congress recognized that the Federal Bureau of  Investigation\u2019s (FBI) information technology (IT) systems were archaic and  inadequate for efficiently and effectively investigating criminal cases.

Initiated in mid-2001,  Trilogy\u2014FBI\u2019s largest IT upgrade to date\u2014was intended to modernize  FBI\u2019s IT infrastructure and systems and provide needed applications to  help FBI agents, analysts, and others do their jobs.", "The Trilogy project consisted of two primary efforts: an IT infrastructure  update and an upgrade of FBI\u2019s investigative applications. While ultimately  successful in providing the infrastructure update, the project was not a  success with regard to upgrading the investigative applications. Further,  the project experienced numerous schedule delays and cost increases.  Project costs, which were originally estimated at approximately $380  million, eventually escalated to approximately $537 million. Although the  scheduled completion date for the overall Trilogy project was June 2004,  after September 11, 2001, FBI required an accelerated deployment plan and  moved up the expected completion dates. The completion date for the  portion of Trilogy related to upgrading FBI\u2019s IT infrastructure was  accelerated from May 2004 to July 2002. After several delays, the upgrade  was completed in April 2004, a month before the original due date. While  the overall scheduled completion date for the investigative application  upgrades, which became known as the Virtual Case File (VCF), was  originally June 2004, the due date for the first VCF deliverable was  accelerated to December 2003.

GAO also reported on weaknesses in FBI\u2019s IT systems  development and management capabilities, including contractor oversight.", "Because of these issues, you asked us to audit the costs of the Trilogy  project, the majority of which represented the purchase of goods and  services from contractors. Our objectives were to determine whether   (1) FBI\u2019s internal controls provided reasonable assurance that payment of  unallowable contractor costs would not be made or would be detected in  the normal course of business, (2) FBI\u2019s payments to contractors were  properly supported as a valid use of government funds, and (3) FBI  maintained proper accountability for assets purchased with Trilogy project  funds.", "To address these objectives, we used various internal control standards and  guidance as a basis to assess FBI\u2019s internal controls over the payments  made with Trilogy funds.  We also reviewed FBI policy and procedure  manuals; applicable federal regulations, including the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Federal Travel Regulation, and Joint Travel  Regulations (JTR); prior GAO and DOJ OIG reports on Trilogy issues;  Trilogy contract documents and interagency agreements; contractor  invoices; and other documentation supporting goods provided and services  rendered.  We performed data mining and forensic auditing techniques to  select transactions to determine whether payments to contractors were  properly supported as a valid use of government funds. We tested  accountable property to determine whether assets were entered in FBI\u2019s  property system and conducted a physical observation of selected assets to  validate their existence. In addition, we conducted interviews with officials  from FBI, General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Systems  Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM), Department of the Interior  (DOI), and Trilogy contractors. We also performed walkthroughs to gain an  understanding of the processes used to review and approve invoices and  account for property.

FBI and GSA provided  written comments, which are reprinted in appendixes III and IV,  respectively. FBI and GSA also provided technical comments, which we  have incorporated as appropriate. We also discussed with Trilogy  contractors any findings that related to them. We performed our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards in  Washington D.C. and at two FBI field sites and various other GSA and  contractor locations in Virginia from May 2004 through December 2005.  Our scope and methodology are discussed in greater detail in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the need to modernize its IT systems, FBI proposed a major  technology upgrade plan to Congress in September 2000. FBI\u2019s Information  Technology Upgrade Project, which FBI subsequently renamed Trilogy,  was FBI\u2019s largest automated information systems initiative to date.  Trilogy  consisted of three parts: (1) the Information Presentation Component  (IPC) to upgrade FBI\u2019s computer hardware and software, (2) the  Transportation Network Component (TNC) to upgrade FBI\u2019s  communication network, and (3) the User Application Component (UAC)  to upgrade and consolidate FBI\u2019s five most important investigative  applications.", "To expedite the contracting process, FBI entered into an interagency  agreement with GSA to support FBI\u2019s use of the FEDSIM Millennia  governmentwide acquisition contract for the implementation of Trilogy\u2019s  three functional components, IPC, TNC, and UAC. FEDSIM, serving as  contracting agency, was to provide all contract administrative services  necessary to support the task orders. Because the Trilogy project was so  large, DOJ required FBI to use two contractors for the three Trilogy  components. FBI combined the IPC and TNC portions of Trilogy into one  task order because both components involved physical infrastructure  enhancements. IPC provided for new desktop computers, servers, and  commercial-off-the-shelf automation software, including Web-browser and  e-mail to enhance usability by the agents. TNC upgraded the complete  communication infrastructure, including high-capacity wide-area and local- area networks, authorization security, and encryption of data transmission  and storage. The IPC/TNC task order was awarded in May 2001 to DynCorp  (now Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC)). The IPC/TNC upgrades  would provide the physical infrastructure needed to run the applications  developed under UAC, the third Trilogy component.", "The third component of Trilogy\u2014the UAC task order\u2014was awarded in  June 2001 to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The  goal of UAC was to replace FBI\u2019s paper case files with electronic files and  improve efficiency.  The heart of the UAC portion became the development  of the VCF system to replace the obsolete Automated Case Support system,  FBI\u2019s primary investigative application that uploads and stores case files  electronically.", "The above two Trilogy contracts were awarded on a cost-plus-award fee  basis for labor charges, meaning that the contractor\u2019s costs incurred are  reimbursed and fees may be awarded to the contractor based on  performance. The FAR states that cost-reimbursement type contracts may  only be used if appropriate government surveillance during performance  will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost  controls are used.  The aspects of these contracts related to the purchase of  equipment were based on fixed-price arrangements, meaning that a set  price for the equipment is agreed to up front.", "In addition to the two primary contracts discussed above, FBI awarded two  additional contracts to assist with the technical oversight, monitoring, and  integration of the two primary Trilogy contracts described above.  The first  of the two additional contracts was awarded in February 2001, also through  GSA FEDSIM, to Mitretek for Systems Engineering and Technical  Assistance (SETA) services. Under the SETA contract, Mitretek was  required to assist FBI with a wide array of tasks, including program and  contract management, fiscal and budgetary oversight, cost estimating, and  several other technical aspects of the Trilogy project. The second of the  two additional contracts was awarded to SAIC for the integration of the  three Trilogy components.", "In July 2004, the VCF was scaled back to the Initial Operating Capability  and the remaining deliverables were cancelled after the (1) initial  deliverable was rejected by FBI and (2) VCF was determined to be  infeasible and cost prohibitive to implement as originally envisioned.  After  a 90-day limited pilot that ended in March 2005, VCF offline and the pilot  results were then to be analyzed by FBI for requirements development of  its new electronic information management system initiative. In August  2005, FBI released a solicitation for proposals to develop FBI\u2019s new  electronic information management system, referred to as Sentinel.  The  solicitation was sent to more than 40 eligible companies under a National  Institutes of Health governmentwide acquisition contract.

This occurred in part because responsibility for the review  and approval of invoices was not clearly defined in the Mitretek contract  and in the interagency agreements related to Trilogy project oversight.  In  addition, contactor invoices frequently lacked detailed information  required by the contracts and other additional information that would be  needed to facilitate an adequate invoice review process.

Figure 1 illustrates this invoice review and  approval process.", "Our review disclosed serious gaps in the review process for each of the  major categories of contractor costs, as follows.", "Labor\u2014According to GSA, it typically reviewed labor charges by looking  for unusual or excessive hours worked or rates charged and recalculating  some amounts to ensure mathematical accuracy. GSA also stated that its  personnel generally compared average fully burdened labor rates (labor,  overhead, fringe benefits, and general and administration costs) charged to  ceiling rates (maximums) established in the Trilogy contracts. However,  GSA was not able to provide us with an explanation for or evidence of how  they resolved clearly questionable labor charges we identified, including  hours billed far in excess of a normal pay period. For example, we  identified one individual who charged 371 hours for one 4-week period (an  average of 93 hours per week) and 359 in the following 5-week period (an  average of 70 hours per week). There was no evidence that GSA had  questioned whether these seemingly excessive hours were valid. GSA  stated that these types of issues were usually resolved on the telephone and  therefore they usually did not maintain any documentation of their  inquiries.", "On-site members of the review team indicated that they generally knew the  contractor employees working on the project and reviewed the hours billed  for reasonableness. However, the review team did not have a systematic  process in place to help ensure that individuals listed on invoices had  actually worked on Trilogy the number of hours being billed or that the job  classifications and related billing rates were appropriate. In addition, there  was no documented assessment of whether the overall hours being billed  for a particular activity were in line with expectations.", "Subcontractor Labor\u2014The review team paid contractor invoices for  subcontractor labor without any attempt to assess the validity of the  charges. The GSA official responsible for paying the invoices stated that  the review team relied on the contractors to properly bill for the costs  related to their subcontractors and to validate the subcontractor invoices.  However, the review team had no process in place to assess whether or not  the contractors were properly validating their subcontractor labor charges  or to assess the allowability of those charges. In addition, we found that  CSC, which billed the bulk (i.e., about $116 million) of the subcontractor  labor costs, did not always have sufficient documentation of  subcontractor charges to enable CSC, or anyone else, to perform any  assessment of the allowability of those costs. For example, the only  supporting documentation CSC could provide us for about $2 million in  subcontractor labor charges we selected for review were subcontractor  invoices that lacked some of the basic information needed to assess the  labor costs, such as the names of the subcontractor employees, hours  billed, or individual labor rates.", "Travel\u2014These charges were reviewed differently by the review team for  SAIC and CSC invoices.  For SAIC travel, GSA told us they compared  invoiced amounts to travel authorizations and verified the per diem and  lodging rates in the authorizations to those prescribed under the Federal  Travel Regulation.  However, travel authorizations were not always  submitted and approved before travel occurred and in some cases were  based on actual amounts. The review team told us that they reviewed SAIC  travel vouchers or receipts in a few instances over 4 years when amounts  billed were higher than expected to verify the amounts charged on the  travel invoices. However, there was no systematic process to review travel  costs billed to the Trilogy project. For CSC travel, because CSC\u2019s travel  authorizations did not include details by employee or the estimated cost for  each trip and frequently covered several trips, the GSA official who paid  the invoices told us she relied on members of the review team that worked  on-site to review the travel invoices. These on-site review team officials  indicated that their review process was based on their general  understanding of who was traveling. However, we determined that no one  on the review team obtained travel vouchers or receipts to verify that  amounts billed by CSC were a necessary and proper charge to the Trilogy  project and were reasonable based on the location and length of travel  required.", "Other Direct Costs (ODC)\u2014These charges were paid without validation  of the actual amounts included in the invoices. The review team relied on  contractors to obtain purchase orders for ODC charges. For SAIC ODC  invoices, the review team generally tracked actual charges billed on  invoices compared to purchase order amounts. However, there was no  review of receipts or other documentation to validate the actual charges on  invoices. CSC ODC invoices were paid without matching the charges to a  purchase order or documentation of the actual cost incurred. Therefore,  the review team had no basis for confidence that CSC ODC charges were  approved ahead of time or appropriately billed. CSC ODC charges also  included subcontractor ODC. We asked CSC for supporting documentation  for selected subcontractor ODC and found that CSC\u2019s only support was  subcontractor invoices that included only a brief description of the nature  of the charge and the amount. No supporting receipts or other  documentation necessary to verify the charges was provided. For example,  CSC billed FBI for ODC of $456,211 on an invoice submitted in November  2003. The only description on the invoice for these charges was \u201cother  direct costs.\u201d We requested from CSC any documentation they had in their  files to support this charge from its subcontractor, CACI Inc. - Federal  (CACI). CSC was able to provide an invoice with one line entitled  \u201cfacilities/materials\u201d and a spreadsheet with a general summary of the  charges. Further, the e-mail exchange presented in figure 2 shows that CSC  recognized that they did not have enough detail to review the ODC charge,  but approved the invoice anyway. As noted below, the final entry in the  exchange is, \u201cIt\u2019s not what we asked for but at this point it doesn\u2019t really  matter. Approve it.\u201d", "Equipment\u2014Charges for equipment purchased by contractors and billed  to FBI were reviewed merely by tracking the total cost of equipment  invoices to ensure that the total amount did not exceed the approved  amount on purchase orders. However, neither GSA, FBI, nor Mitretek  performed procedures to ensure that individual equipment items billed by  the contractors were actually received before payment.  Discussions with  the contractors revealed that this was a high-risk area because some of the  invoices they submitted were for equipment that had not yet been delivered  to FBI.  The review team approved and paid these invoices without  question.  In addition, FBI purchased some IPC/TNC equipment directly  from vendors and delivered the equipment to contractor locations, but did  not have a mechanism in place to physically verify receipt of that  equipment at FBI sites before paying the related invoices. There was also  no subsequent verification by the review team that all equipment  purchased through contractors and vendors was ultimately received by  FBI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Invoice Review Responsibilities Were Not Clearly Defined", "paragraphs": ["The insufficient invoice review and approval process was at least in part  the result of a lack of clarity in the interagency agreement between FBI and  GSA FEDSIM, as well as in FBI\u2019s oversight contract with Mitretek.

While  contract management and oversight teams were identified in the  interagency agreements, key roles and responsibilities for the review and  approval of invoices were not clearly defined. For example, the terms and  conditions of the interagency agreement with GSA only vaguely described  GSA\u2019s role in contract administration. However, the agreement did not  specify the invoice review and approval steps to be performed. Likewise,  the Mitretek contract provided a general description of its oversight duties,  but did not specifically mention its responsibilities related to the invoice  review and approval process. We did note, however, that FBI did not  approve an invoice for payment until after it was notified by Mitretek that it  had reviewed the invoice.

However, we found that the contractors, particularly CSC, often  did not meet these requirements. For example:  CSC labor invoices did not include information related to individual  labor rates or indicate which overhead rates were applicable to each  employee\u2014information needed to verify mathematical accuracy and to  determine that the components of the labor charges were valid.", "CSC invoices provided a summary of travel charges by category (airfare,  lodging, etc.), but did not provide required information related to an  individual traveler\u2019s trip costs.

For example, in one case a traveler flew first class round trip  between Providence, Rhode Island and San Francisco, California for  $2,159. We estimated that a coach-class ticket for this same trip would have  cost $1,119. In addition, 1 day after returning to Providence, this traveler  flew back to San Francisco.  The documentation provided by CSC did not  explain or justify this first-class travel or unusual travel itinerary.  The CSC  contract called for airfare to be reimbursed to the extent allowable  pursuant to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), which state that travelers  must use basic economy or coach class unless the use of first-class travel is  properly authorized and justified. Because the documentation provided  by CSC for the 19 first-class tickets costing $20,025 that we identified did  not contain authorizations or justifications, the cost of this travel in excess  of a coach-class ticket is potentially unallowable. Table 2 provides specific  examples of these potentially unallowable first-class travel costs.", "During our review of FBI\u2019s payments for travel costs, we also identified 75  unusually expensive coach-class tickets that were purchased by the  contractors for $100,847, which exceeded basic coach-class fares by  approximately $49,848. Upon further inquiry with several airlines, we  determined that most of these tickets were for \u201cfull fare\u201d coach-class  tickets.  We noted that the airlines used most often by the contractors  indicated that it is possible to obtain a free upgrade to first class with the  purchase of the more expensive full-fare coach ticket. We found that in  some instances, the current price of a full-fare coach ticket was higher than  the current price of a first-class ticket. As discussed above, the JTR  requires travelers to use basic economy or coach class unless the use of  first-class travel is properly authorized and justified. The JTR defines  economy class as basic accommodations that include a service level  available to all passengers regardless of fare paid. Since full-fare coach  tickets allow a traveler to upgrade to first class at no additional cost, full- fare coach class does not appear to be basic accommodations available to  all passengers regardless of fare paid. As such, the purchase of full-fare  coach-class tickets is a questionable cost. While the contracts incorporated  the JTR, we determined that the JTR applies to civilian employees of the  Department of Defense and is not considered appropriate \u201ctravel  regulations\u201d for contractors. The FAR, which would be appropriate for  contractors, requires the use of the lowest customary standard, coach, or  equivalent airfare and indicates that costs in excess of the lowest  standard, coach, or equivalent airfare are unallowable. Had these  provisions of the FAR been applied, the excessive cost of these tickets  would have been potentially unallowable.", "We noted 62 full-fare coach tickets billed by CSC for $85,336, compared to  an estimated cost of $41,978 for the basic fully refundable coach-class  fares.

For designated EWW periods, exempt staff (professional staff normally not  eligible for overtime compensation) would be paid a pro rata share  (straight time) of their weekly salary based on the extended hours worked.

Our examination identified the following issues:  CACI could not adequately support almost $3 million that it paid to one  event planning company. Since FBI decided to conduct their training off- site, CACI hired an event planner, which it paid almost $3.2 million to  reserve hotel conference rooms, rent computer equipment for training  sessions, and set up the conference rooms for the training.

This  purchase order provided for payment of 50 percent of this amount to the  event planner at the time the purchase order was issued (to cover costs  that include prepayments for obtaining training facilities) and four equal  monthly payments for the remaining balance. CACI provided us with the  purchase order, which included a description of the services to be  performed by the event planner. They also provided us copies of  invoices from the event planner that included general descriptions of  the services billed. CACI could not provide any further evidence of the  actual costs of goods or services that were provided by the event  planner, such as hotel invoices for the rental of conference rooms.   CACI stated that documentation supporting actual costs of the event  planner was not applicable because its agreement with the event  planner was \u201cfixed priced.\u201d CACI stated that the payment terms in the  purchase order required only that CACI pay the event planner a series of  payments in fixed amounts.

In addition,  FBI did not perform an overall reconciliation of total assets ordered and  paid for to those received.

FBI\u2019s most recent biennial inventory of accountable assets occurred in the  spring of 2005.  To complete its inventory, FBI used scanner technology,  directing employees responsible for performing the inventory to scan all  items found at FBI locations that contained a bar code.  PMA was updated  to reflect the items that were located and scanned during the inventory and  generated reports to identify new accountable assets that were not  previously entered in the system.

We estimated this value using the lowest  per-unit-cost based on the Trilogy equipment-pricing sheets that were  prepared by FBI and used in recording the cost of the same types of assets  in PMA.  If we could not identify a price for a certain type of accountable  asset in FBI\u2019s equipment-pricing sheets, we identified the lowest price on  the accountable and capitalized assets spreadsheet prepared by FBI\u2019s  finance division.

For example, FBI told  us some purchased components that were a part of an accountable asset  unit may have been bar coded even though the item by itself was not an  accountable item.  Using FBI guidance on accountable property, we  determined that 103, or about 11.1 percent, of the missing 926 CSC- purchased assets may represent nonaccountable units. Because FBI was  unable to provide us with location information for these items, we could  not definitively determine whether they represent nonaccountable  components or are separate accountable assets that were not in PMA and  could not be located.

The officials  stated the equipment was not originally required to be bar coded or tracked  in PMA, but that it was tracked several different ways by serial number.   The officials also explained that the problem resulted mostly from FBI  modifications to the equipment that required revisions to the serial  numbers listed in the invoices.

FBI  also provided additional information related to Trilogy assets we identified  as missing. In written comments reprinted in appendix IV, GSA stated that  it accepted our recommendations, did not believe that 1 of them was  needed, and described some of the improvements to its internal controls  and other business process changes already implemented. GSA also  expressed concern with some of our observations and conclusions related  to the invoice review and approval process and our analysis of airfare  costs. FBI and GSA also provided technical comments, which we have  incorporated as appropriate.", "In its comments, FBI stated that executive management at FBI has directed  a sustained effort to address and correct weaknesses identified in our  report and other Trilogy reviews. FBI further stated that attention is being  focused on four areas: (1) audit capability, (2) property management,   (3) contracting services, and (4) IT investments.  If properly implemented,  the activities outlined in FBI\u2019s letter should help improve FBI  accountability for future IT acquisitions and other contract services.  In this  regard, vigilant oversight will be needed to ensure controls are correctly  designed and operating effectively to protect assets and prevent improper  payments.", "Further, in its comments, FBI stated that more than 44,000 pieces of  accountable property were successfully deployed and tracked in the FBI\u2019s  PMA during the Trilogy project. FBI also stated that the 1,404 items we  initially reported as missing or improperly documented represented  approximately 3 percent of the accountable assets.  We question both of  these statements.  Because of the control weaknesses discussed in our  report, FBI does not have a reliable basis to know the number of Trilogy  assets it purchased or how many should have been tracked as accountable  assets. Further, since we did not test all the assets purchased, more may be  missing.", "FBI also stated that as of January 2006, it had accounted for more than  1,000 of the 1,404 items we reported as missing or improperly documented.   During our agency comment period, FBI indicated that it found 237 items  we previously identified as missing and provided evidence, not made  available during our audit, to sufficiently account for 199 of these items.", "We adjusted the missing assets listing in our report to reflect 1,205 (1,404 \u2013  199) assets as still missing.  In February 2006, FBI informed us that the  approximately 800 remaining items noted in its official agency response  included (1) accountable assets not in PMA because they were either  incorrectly identified as nonaccountable assets or mistakenly omitted,   (2) defective accountable assets that were never recorded in PMA and  subsequently replaced, and (3) nonaccountable assets or components of  accountable assets that were incorrectly bar coded.", "We considered these same issues during our audit and attempted to  determine their impact.  For example, as stated in our report, FBI told us  that components of some nonaccountable assets that were part of a larger  accountable item may have been mistakenly bar coded.  Using FBI  guidance on accountable property, we determined that 103 or about 11  percent of the 926 missing assets purchased by CSC may have represented  nonaccountable components.  Because FBI could not provide us with the  location information, we could not definitively determine whether the  items were accountable assets or not.  During the course of our audit, FBI  was not able to provide us with any evidence to support their other  statements regarding the reasons the assets could not be located.  While we  are encouraged by FBI\u2019s current efforts to account for these assets, its  ability to definitively determine their existence has been compromised by  the numerous control weaknesses identified in our report.  Further, the fact  that assets have not been properly accounted for to date means that they  have been at risk of loss or misappropriation without detection since being  delivered to FBI\u2014in some cases for several years.", "While GSA said it accepted all of our recommendations, it expressed  reservations regarding our recommendation that GSA should clearly reflect  appropriate FAR travel cost requirements in future contracts. GSA stated in  its comment letter that it believed that the requirements outlined in the  applicable FAR section 31.205-46 and stipulated in the task orders were  more than adequate. In a subsequent conversation, we asked the GSA  contracting officer why the language in the CSC and SAIC task orders and  the Mitretek contract, which stated that long-distance travel would be  reimbursed to the extent allowable pursuant to the JTR, was considered  appropriate by GSA. The GSA contracting officer stated that, while not  specified in the contract language, the reference to the JTR related only to  per diem rates and allowances when determining the reasonableness of the  travel costs, such as lodging and mileage reimbursements. She further  stated that the FAR would apply to all other travel reimbursement  determinations.", "We do not agree that our recommendation is unnecessary. In our view, the  references to the JTR create ambiguity. The FAR cost allowability clause  52.216-7 states that when determining allowability, in addition to FAR cost  principles, the terms of the contract also apply. Therefore, the reference to  the allowability under the JTR could have caused confusion with the  contractors regarding what long-distance travel costs were allowed,  including airfare costs. We continue to believe that the task orders should  have more clearly described the applicable travel requirements.", "Regarding the invoice review and approval process, GSA stated that each  member of the review team\u2014FBI, GSA, and Mitretek\u2014played a unique and  mutually understood role.  In particular, GSA stated that Mitretek\u2019s role in  the invoice review and approval process was significant and that it was  reasonable for GSA to have relied on input from FBI, via Mitretek, in  approving invoices for payment. GSA also referred to procedures to  preapprove ODC and equipment purchases. Further, GSA stated that it  believed that the procedures to process invoices were generally sound and  that contractors are required to maintain records to adequately  demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, and are reasonable,  allowable, and allocable. GSA also stated that it will have DCAA audit the  contract costs to determine if any costs are unallowable, unreasonable, or  unallocable and will use the audit results as a basis to pursue remedies to  recoup funds and assess penalties as may be applicable.", "We disagree with GSA regarding review team roles and the review process.  Based on discussions with members of the review team, our review of  supporting documentation, and our assessment of the outcomes of the  review process, it is clear that the invoice review and approval process was  inadequate. The roles and responsibilities of the review team members  were not clearly defined or documented and this led to confusion among  the review team members about each member\u2019s role. Regarding Mitretek\u2019s  role, Mitretek officials stated that they performed a limited review of only  labor invoices. Before relying on others, GSA should have verified its  understanding of each member\u2019s roles and responsibilities and confirmed  that the appropriate functions were being performed. In addition, while  there were procedures to preapprove ODC and equipment purchases, the  review team did not effectively link the preapproval and the invoice review  and approval processes, especially in relation to CSC, in part because CSC  invoices lacked detailed information needed to verify that charges billed  were in fact preapproved.", "Further, while contractors are required to maintain records to adequately  support costs, we found that the review team generally did not request  additional documentation such as travel vouchers or subcontractor  invoices to support amounts billed. If the review team had a systematic  process in place to review costs, it may have questioned some of the  excessive airfare we identified and found, as we did, that CSC lacked  documentation to adequately support subcontractor charges. It is a  management function and sound business practice to have a process in  place to ensure that contractors have such documentation. Having such  processes and questioning amounts billed would also allow for corrective  measures to be implemented as, and if, problems were found. In addition,  while we agree that a DCAA audit of contract costs can provide a detective  control to help determine whether contractor costs were proper, reliance  on an after-the-fact audit is not an acceptable replacement for the type of  real-time monitoring and oversight of contractor costs\u2014preventative  controls\u2014we recommend in this report. Further, a DCAA audit of civilian  contractor costs is not automatic and would require an additional cost to  the government to procure. The review team largely operated in an  environment of trust without an adequate basis for knowing whether the  contractor billings were reasonable and costs claimed were allowable.  Effective internal control calls for a sound, on-going invoice review and  approval process as the first line of defense in preventing unallowable  costs.", "Regarding our analysis of travel costs, GSA stated that our conclusions did  not account for the ever-changing travel schedules and itineraries  necessitated by changes in FBI requirements.  GSA also stated that a  hypothetical standard coach-class ticket does not provide a benchmark to  make a valid price comparison, even if adjusted for inflation, because the  airline travel industry has had significant changes with respect to pricing of  airline tickets. GSA also stated that they believe it is impossible at this date  to look back over 5 years and estimate what may have been a reasonable  airfare price.", "We disagree. Our analysis and conclusions related to travel did take into  account the possible conditions that could justify airfare costs in excess of  the lowest customary coach-class fare. The FAR requires supporting  documentation for first-class and other excessive airfare costs of the  nature we identified to justify the higher airfare costs. No such  documentation was provided to us to justify the excessive costs we  identified. To estimate the cost of the coach-class tickets, we assumed that  tickets were purchased 3 days in advance (which was the average based on  the trips we reviewed) and did not include a Saturday night stay over.  Specifically, we (1) used the Web sites of the airlines used by each traveler,  (2) searched for standard fully-refundable coach-class tickets with the  same destinations, (3) calculated an average cost based on the lowest and  highest ticket prices available at the time of our search, and (4) adjusted  the average cost for inflation applicable to airfare. We believe that this  approach, which closely approximated what travelers were doing at that  time, resulted in reasonable estimates as to how much the travel should  have cost. We also believe that adjusting current fares for inflation  applicable to airfare results in a reasonable benchmark to compare to  historical prices, since it does take into account price changes as a result of  changes in the airline industry, including the effects of competition. Lastly,  we fully agree with GSA that the passage of time makes it difficult to  determine historical airfare costs, which is another reason that costs  should be reviewed real time instead of as part of an after-the-fact audit. An  after-the-fact analysis is no substitute for the contemporaneous monitoring  and oversight that we recommend in this report.", "More specific discussions are provided following GSA\u2019s comments, which  are reprinted in appendix IV.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date.

We referred to the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General  report only to provide background information related to previously  reported issues with the Trilogy project. 2. See \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section. 3. Processing invoices timely as envisioned by the Prompt Payment Act  does not lessen the government\u2019s responsibility to verify costs billed by  contractors. It is conceivable that the essential validation work could  have been performed immediately after payment and any adjustments  to correct prior billing errors could have been made to future invoices.   4. No documentation of any such inquiries was provided to support the  General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) comment. Documenting such  inquiries allows a subsequent reviewer to draw similar conclusions and  would be beneficial to any subsequent audit, including by the Defense  Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). 5. Contrary to GSA\u2019s comment, the review team\u2014Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), GSA, and Mitretek\u2014approved CSC\u2019s invoices that  lacked information required by its task order, including employee  billing rates and detail for subcontractor labor. We were not provided  documentation indicating that any Computer Sciences Corporation  (CSC) invoice had been rejected. 6. While the review team compared billed labor rates against Millennia  ceiling rates for certain labor costs, it did not evaluate labor rates  compared to ceiling rates for subcontractor labor, which represented  about $163 million of Trilogy costs. Had the review team reviewed labor  charges more thoroughly, it may have identified the potential  overcharging of labor rates discussed in this report related to DynCorp  Information Systems (DynIS).  7. According to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), it is the  contractor\u2019s responsibility to maintain supporting documentation for  costs billed, including subcontractor labor costs.  8. Based on our discussion with on-site members of the review team, CSC  travel vouchers were not obtained to review amounts billed on travel  invoices. Had the vouchers been reviewed, the review team would have  had a basis for questioning the first-class and excessive airfare costs we  identified. 9. The travel administrator\u2019s obligation to obtain the best fare does not  relieve the government of its responsibility to review travel costs. In  addition, we noted instances where the itinerary from the travel  administrator indicated that a full-fare ticket was obtained at the  traveler\u2019s request, even though the ticket cost more than twice as much  as the lowest logical fare that was also noted on the itinerary.   10. The approval process discussed by GSA relates to the travel  authorization, which was the request to travel. We found that the  review team lacked an adequate process to review travel vouchers that  include the traveler\u2019s receipts to confirm that the authorized trips were  taken and that the costs were in accordance with applicable travel  regulations. Also see comments 8 and 9. 11. The next sentence of the relevant section of the FAR cited by GSA  states, \u201cHowever, in order for airfare costs in excess of the above  standard airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) set forth  above must be documented and justified.\u201d No such documentation was  provided to us for any of the first class or other excessive airfares we  identified. 12. Our report stated that other direct costs (ODC) were paid without  validation of the actual amounts included in the invoices and that the  review team relied on the contractors to obtain purchase orders for  ODC charges. It further stated that neither GSA, FBI, nor Mitretek  performed procedures to ensure that equipment billed by the  contractors was actually received before payment. 13. CSC ODC invoices lacked sufficient detail to validate amounts billed  compared to what was approved and we were not provided  documentation indicating that such information was requested by the  review team. Further, the CSC invoices did not include the detail  necessary for the review team to specifically identify the items  purchased. We also found that some assets were paid for before they  were received and that the FBI did not perform an overall  reconciliation of total assets ordered and paid for to those received.  14. A GSA contracting officer representative told us that he was aware of  the informal extended work week policy agreement, but could not  provide documentation of the policy.  15. Our report stated that DynIS charged labor rates that may have  exceeded rates that GSA asserts were established ceiling rates  pursuant to the task order.  16.
