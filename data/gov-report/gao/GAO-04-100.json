OBO now has mechanisms to more effectively manage the embassy construction program, including (1) an annual Long-Range Overseas Buildings Plan to guide the planning and execution of the program over a 6-year period; (2) monthly project reviews at headquarters; (3) an Industry Advisory Panel for input on current best practices in the construction industry; (4) expanded outreach to contractors in an effort to increase the number of bidders; (5) ongoing work to standardize and streamline the planning, design, and construction processes, including initiation of design-build contract delivery and a standard embassy design for most projects; (6) additional training for OBO headquarters and field staff; and (7) advance identification and acquisition of sites. State's program to replace about 185 vulnerable embassies and consulates is in its early stages, but the pace of initiating and completing new construction projects has increased significantly over the past two fiscal years. As of September 30, 2003, State had started construction of 22 projects to replace facilities at risk of terrorist or other attacks. Overall, 16 projects have encountered challenges that have led or, if not overcome, could ultimately lead to extensions in the completion date or cost increases in the construction contract. According to OBO, project delays have occurred because of such factors as changes in project design and security requirements; difficulties hiring appropriate American and local labor with the necessary clearances and skills; differing site conditions; and unforeseen events such as civil unrest. In addition, the U.S. government has had problems coordinating funding for projects that include buildings for the U.S. Agency for International Development. None of the projects started since OBO instituted its reforms has been completed; thus GAO believes it is too early to assess the effectiveness of the reforms in ensuring that new embassy and consulate compounds are built within the approved project budget and on time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the State  Department has done much to improve physical security at overseas posts,  such as constructing perimeter walls and anti-ram barriers at many  facilities.

As a  result, thousands of American and Foreign Service National U.S.  government employees may be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. In March  2003, we testified on these security deficiencies at overseas diplomatic  facilities, reporting that many facilities are in poor condition, do not meet  fire and safety standards, and are in need of major maintenance.

Along with the input and support of other State Department  bureaus, foreign affairs agencies, and Congress, OBO sets worldwide  priorities for the design, construction, acquisition, maintenance, use, and  sale of real properties and the use of sales proceeds. OBO is composed of  five main offices: Planning and Development, Real Estate and Property  Management, Project Execution, Operations and Maintenance, and  Resource Management. The construction program is located primarily in  the Project Execution Office, specifically in the Construction and  Commissioning Division within that office.", "In response to terrorist threats, the State Department in 1986 began an  embassy construction program, known as the Inman program, to protect  U.S. personnel and facilities. In 1991, we reported that State was unable to  complete as many projects as originally planned due to systemic  weaknesses in program management, as well as subsequent funding  limitations. This construction program suffered from delays and cost  increases due to, among other things, poor program planning, difficulties  acquiring sites, changes in security requirements, and inadequate  contractor performance. Following the demise of the Inman program in the  early 1990s, the State Department initiated very few new construction  projects until the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa, which prompted  additional funding for security upgrades and the construction of secure  embassies and consulates.", "Through State\u2019s security upgrade program, the department has done much  since the 1998 bombings to upgrade physical security at existing overseas  posts without building new embassy or consulate compounds. These  security upgrades have included constructing perimeter walls, anti-ram  barriers, and access control facilities at many posts. However, even with  these improvements, most office facilities do not meet security standards  that State developed to protect overseas diplomatic office facilities from  terrorist attacks and other dangers. As of December 2002, the primary  office building at 232 posts lacked desired security because it did not meet  one or more of State\u2019s five key security standards of (1) 100-foot setback  between office buildings and uncontrolled areas, (2) perimeter walls and/or  fencing, (3) anti-ram barriers, (4) blast-resistant construction techniques  and materials, and (5) controlled access at the perimeter of the compound.  Only 12 posts had a primary building that met all five standards. As a result,  thousands of U.S. and foreign national employees may be vulnerable to  terrorist attacks.", "After the 1998 attacks, State identified facilities at about 185 posts that  would need to be replaced to meet security standards. OBO plans to  construct the replacement facilities on embassy and consulate compounds  that will contain the main office building, all support buildings and, where  necessary, a building for USAID. While State continues to fund some  security upgrades at embassies and consulates, it has shifted its resources  toward those capital projects that would replace existing facilities with  new, secure diplomatic compounds or substantially retrofit existing, newly  acquired, or leased buildings. As shown in figure 1, funding for State\u2019s  capital projects has significantly increased since fiscal year 1998. State  received about $2.7 billion for its new construction program from fiscal  year 1999 through fiscal year 2003 and requested $890 million for fiscal year  2004. OBO in June 2003 estimated that beginning in fiscal year 2005 it  would cost about $17.5 billion to replace the remaining vulnerable posts.", "As of September 30, 2003, State had started construction of 22 projects to  replace embassies and consulates that are at risk of terrorist or other  attacks. Toward the end of fiscal year 2003, State awarded contracts for an  additional 7 projects.

It  describes and provides a justification for the foreign affairs community\u2019s  global and regional capital project requirements. According to OBO, it also  provides the basis for proceeding in a logical and focused fashion to  improve the security, safety, and functionality of facilities overseas. Each  year the plan is updated to capture changes resulting from budget actions  and requirements of posts overseas. According to the latest version of the  plan, State plans to start replacing facilities at 75 vulnerable posts from  fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2008 at an estimated cost of $7.4 billion.", "As described in the March 2003 plan and by OBO officials, State followed a  multistep process in developing its phased site acquisition, design, and  construction schedule for its security capital projects:   The Bureau of Diplomatic Security completed its annual security  evaluation of all the U.S. overseas posts, taking into account many  factors affecting a post\u2019s overall security level. The evaluation listed  vulnerable posts and ranked them in terms of security issues. Because  the terrorist threat is global and because the buildings have fundamental  security problems, Diplomatic Security and OBO officials believe that  there are a great many posts that are very vulnerable and in need of  replacement, and that the differences in vulnerability do not make posts  at the lower end of the list substantially safer than those at the top of the  list. By congressional mandate, these posts are listed and ranked in  bands of 20, through a process discussed in the following paragraphs.", "Congress directed that State spend its security capital funds, which are  funded within the Embassy Security, Construction and Maintenance  account, on the top 80 posts only.", "Working with the security-prioritized list, each regional bureau annually  ranked all posts within its region that were in the top 80 replacement list  based on such factors as threat, survivability, staffing trends, regional  interests, and functionality. OBO officials told us this effort resulted in a  prioritized list for State\u2019s security capital projects for each of the six  regional bureaus, which responds to the global nature of the  transnational terrorism threat. Each year, as new posts are added, these  posts usually go to the end of a bureau\u2019s priority list.", "Finally, OBO combined the prioritized lists from the different regions  into one master list, which, as mentioned above, OBO updates annually.  The first six posts on the list were the top ranked post from each region.  Posts 7 through 12 on the list were the second-ranked posts from each  region, and so on. With the help of its Planning and Real Estate Offices,  OBO then determined if a site already existed to build a new facility and,  if not, when new sites could actually be acquired. When necessary, OBO  rescheduled the list based on the likely available capital security funding  in each year covered in the Long-Range Overseas Buildings Plan,  opportunities or problems in acquiring a site, and constraints on the  ability of construction companies to work in a particular country at the  planned time. This prioritized and scheduled listing of projects then  becomes the security capital portion of the Long-Range Overseas  Buildings Plan.", "State also requests funds for regular capital projects to replace posts not in  the top 80 that have compelling operational or other requirements that  must be addressed. The Long-Range Overseas Buildings Plan includes  descriptions of these regular capital projects.", "OBO\u2019s development of the plan was a major advancement in ensuring the  embassy construction program would be better managed.

The use of contingency and management reserve line items is an industry  practice. In Istanbul, for instance, the cost of the construction contract  increased by about $8.5 million. OBO covered this cost increase by using  funds from the project\u2019s contingency line item, which OBO includes in  project budgets for this purpose.

At the construction site we visited in Yerevan, a project OBO  considered on track as of July 2003, the contractor determined that it had  not thoroughly analyzed the soil conditions at the site and would need to  blast away about 9 feet of rock from the site to make room for the  foundation.

Further, political upheaval in Zimbabwe forced OBO to postpone  construction of the new embassy in Harare from fiscal year 2002 until at  least fiscal year 2005, according to OBO\u2019s most recent Long-Range  Overseas Buildings Plan.

If  USAID does not secure funding for its building at the same time as the new  embassy compound, the compound is constructed as scheduled, but the  USAID building may be built either after the rest of the compound, later in  the construction process, or not at all. If a USAID building is constructed  after the rest of the compound, the overall costs to the government would  likely be higher because the contractor must remobilize the construction  staff. The delay could also pose a security risk and inconvenience to post  operations, as construction personnel and equipment would be coming into  and out of the site on a regular basis. OBO officials told us that five projects  were awaiting funding for the construction of the proposed USAID building  on the compounds.", "At the U.S. embassy in Yerevan, funding for the compound\u2019s USAID  building was not available when the compound construction contract was  awarded. Therefore, USAID staff will not move to the new site concurrent  with the rest of the embassy\u2019s staff. Rather, USAID may be forced to remain  at the current, insecure facility at an additional cost until completion of its  annex unless alternative arrangements can be made. The Ambassador told  us that USAID was one of the most important missions at the embassy and  that not having it colocated on the compound would create a major  inconvenience to the embassy\u2019s operations and decrease mission  effectiveness.
