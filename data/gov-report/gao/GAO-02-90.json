Each year the millions of people  who go to the polls expect that their ballots will be cast in private and  accurately processed and counted. However, events surrounding the  November 2000 presidential election raised broad-based concerns,  including such issues as the performance of different types of voting  equipment, the disqualification of absentee ballots, and the accuracy of  vote tallies and recounts.  As a result, public officials and various interest  groups have proposed a number of reform measures to address the  perceived shortcomings of various election systems.", "As part of the broad congressional interest in these issues, we were asked  to review certain aspects of elections throughout the United States. This  capping report draws upon the extensive body of recent work done by GAO  at the request of several congressional leaders, congressional committees  and Members of Congress on matters surrounding the November 2000  election.   Our work, which culminated in six other reports that are  summarized in the appendices, addressed the following topics: the scope of Congressional authority in election administration,  compilation and maintenance of voter registration lists,  absentee and early voting,  voting assistance for military and overseas voters,  election day administration,   voting accessibility for voters with disabilities,  vote counts, recounts, and certification,   voting technology,  Internet voting, and  status and use of the Federal Election Commission voting equipment  standards.", "This capping report serves three purposes.  First, we discuss how the  constitutional and operational division of federal and state authority to  conduct elections has resulted in great variability in the ways elections are  administered in the United States.  As a result, given this diversity and the  decentralized nature of election administration, careful consideration  needs to be given to the degree of flexibility and the planned timeframes for  implementing new initiatives.", "Second, in order for election reform to be effective, reform proposals must  address all major parts of our election systems\u2014its people, processes, and  technology\u2014which are interconnected and significantly affect the election  process.  We discuss the main challenges that election officials face in each  of these areas and the need to accurately characterize and diagnose related  issues.", "Finally, as Congress considers if and how to address the challenges to our  national election system it will have to deliberate upon a number of reform  proposals. Based on our work, this report offers basic criteria for assessing  a range of election reform proposals.  It is not our intention to advocate any  particular reform proposal, but we believe that these criteria offer a useful  analytical framework with which to consider changes to our nation\u2019s  election system.", "Copies of this report are being sent to the President, the congressional  leadership and all other Members of Congress.

This hallmark of  American democracy unfolded in more than 10,000 local election  jurisdictions, which used several different types of voting equipment,  ranging from hand-counted paper ballots to electronic touchscreen voting  machines.  Staffing the precincts were some 1.4 million dedicated poll  workers who opened the polls, logged in and assisted voters, closed polls,  and in many cases, tabulated the votes cast at the precinct.  These poll  workers were assisted by an army of unseen election workers who  answered phone calls from both voters and poll workers, delivered extra  ballots to precincts, replaced or repaired broken voting machines,  tabulated absentee ballots, and compiled the election results from  individual precincts within their jurisdiction.  This highly decentralized,  complex, and massive logistical effort made it possible for American  citizens to participate in one of the most fundamental democratic  traditions\u2014that of eligible citizens to cast their votes for candidates of  their choice.", "The controversy surrounding the presidential vote in the November 2000  election cast America\u2019s election system in a new and revealing light,  spotlighting issues such as the  accuracy of voter registration lists;  procedures used to accept or disqualify absentee ballots for counting;  variety of ways elections are administered across and within   widely varying types of voting equipment used to cast and count ballots;   many different methods of determining voter intent when voters  improperly or incompletely marked their ballots.", "Several congressional leaders, congressional committees, and Members of  Congress asked us to review our nation\u2019s election systems.  Accordingly,  we focused on issues that may affect the ability of eligible U.S. citizens to  cast their ballots in private and have those ballots counted accurately.", "This capping report draws on a considerable body of work recently done by  GAO on election systems.  We address three main issues that Congress may  wish to keep in mind as it approaches election reform.  First, we examine  the division of federal and state authority to conduct elections and the  resulting variation among election jurisdictions. Second, we describe the  challenges that election officials face as they work with the people,  processes, and technology involved in our administering our nation\u2019s  election systems.  And third, we suggest four criteria that Congress could  use as it weighs the merits of various reform proposals.", "Our work on election systems, which is contained in this capping report  and six separate reports, took us across the United States and around the  world as we employed a variety of methods to answer Congress\u2019 questions.   We conducted a detailed analysis of relevant constitutional provisions,  federal statutes, and federal court decisions as well as state statutes and  regulations on selected election issues.  We met with and reviewed  documents provided by local election officials in 41 election jurisdictions in  22 states and met with officials at the Department of State, the Department  of Defense, the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and the National  Conference of State Legislatures.  We surveyed District of Columbia and  state election directors.  Moreover, we used a mail survey and a telephone  survey and interviews with local election officials to obtain information  about the election process that would generally be representative of the  more than 10,000 local election jurisdictions in the United States.  We also  visited 585 polling places and met with embassy and military personnel  abroad and overseas citizens as well as with manufacturers and testers of  voting equipment.

In turn, states  typically have decentralized this process so the responsibility for  administering and funding elections resides in thousands of local  government election jurisdictions, creating even more variability among  our nation\u2019s election systems.

With regard to the administration of federal elections,  Congress has certain constitutional authorities over both congressional  and presidential elections.  Congress has passed legislation relating to the  administration of federal elections, under its various constitutional  authorities in certain areas, including the timing of federal elections, voter  registration, accessibility provisions for the elderly and persons with  disabilities, and absentee voting. Congress has, however, been most active  with respect to enacting prohibitions against discriminatory voting  practices, which apply in the context of both federal and state elections.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965, for example, established the constitutional  guarantee that no person be denied the right to vote on account of race or  color. In addition, subsequent amendments to the Act expanded it to  include protections for members of language minority groups, as well as  other matters regarding voting registration and procedures.", "Within the broad framework established by the Constitution and federal  statutes, each state sets the requirements for conducting local, state, and  federal elections within the state. For example, states regulate such aspects  of elections as ballot access, registration procedures, absentee voting  requirements, establishment of voting places, provision of election day  workers, and counting and certifying the vote.  The states, in turn have  typically delegated responsibility for administering and funding state  election systems to the thousands of local election jurisdictions\u2014more  than 10,000 nationwide\u2014creating even more variability among our nation\u2019s  election systems.", "State election codes and regulations may be very specific or very general.  In particular, some states have mandated statewide election administration  guidelines and procedures that foster uniformity in the way local  jurisdictions conduct elections. It is common for state provisions to furnish  some guidance regarding voter registration requirements and procedures,  absentee voting requirements and procedures, performance requirements  for voting methods used within the state, establishment of polling places,  provision of election day workers, and the count and certification of the  vote. Other states have guidelines that generally permit local election  jurisdictions considerable autonomy and discretion in the way they run  elections (see figure 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Great Variability Exists in the Ways Various Local Elections Are Conducted", "paragraphs": ["The variability from state to state becomes even more pronounced at the  local level, as local jurisdictions have used the flexibility afforded in state  provisions to create local elections systems that vary from county to  county, and even, in some cases, within counties.  This variation stems  from several factors.  One factor can be a consequence of the size of local  election jurisdictions, which varies considerably.  For example, one rural  county has 208 registered voters in contrast with a large, urban county,  such as Los Angeles County, whose total number of registered voters  exceeds that of 41 states.  The complexity of preparing for and conducting  an election in large jurisdictions is generally greater than in smaller  jurisdictions.  For example, a rural county, with a few thousand voters who  share the same language, prints its ballot in one language.  In contrast, in a  large, urban jurisdiction with a diverse population of 4 million registered  voters prints its ballots in 7 different languages.  This can also have an  effect on the processes and type of voting equipment used.  As illustrated in  figure 2, the magnitude of other key administrative tasks in this large, urban  jurisdiction is a thousand times larger than for the small jurisdiction.", "Variability can also be a consequence of local needs.  For example, a  jurisdiction with a large population segment that moves out of the location  each year might opt for certain voter registration and voter education  processes that reflect the need to address a large voter turnover.  As a  second example, a jurisdiction might use a certain type of voting equipment  based on financial resource availability.  More wealthy jurisdictions have  had the resources necessary to modernize equipment, while others need to  make do with what they have.", "Finally, variability can be a consequence of a jurisdiction\u2019s perceived need  to maintain voting traditions that have been in place for a long time.  In two  jurisdictions we visited, election officials opted to replace lever machines  with full-screen electronic voting machines because this machine uses a  ballot that most closely resembles the type of ballot voters were used to  seeing on lever machines.  This choice was possible because ballots did not  have to be printed in more than two languages in either jurisdiction so the  ballots could fit on a single page.", "Variability among states and local jurisdictions was evident in each major  stage of an election--voter registration, absentee and early voting, preparing  for and conducting election day activities, and vote counting and  certification.

At a minimum, every state and the District of Columbia required  that a voter be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years of age, and a resident.  Additional requirements to vote, such as time in residence, varied.  Due to  variations in voter eligibility requirements, different citizens with the same  qualifications would be eligible to vote in some states but not in others  including (1) those that had completed their sentence after a felony  conviction; (2) those who had been adjudged mentally incompetent; and  (3) those who met all of the qualifications to vote but who had not  registered in accordance with prescribed timeframes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When People Could Vote Varied", "paragraphs": ["In November 2000, citizens had different opportunities for obtaining and  successfully casting absentee ballots due to the differences in absentee and  early voting requirements, administration, and procedures.

Although poll workers  are usually employed for only one day, the success of election  administration largely hinges upon their ability to perform their jobs well.   Depending on state law and the organization and traditions of the local  jurisdiction, poll workers have different titles, levels of pay, training  requirements, and responsibilities.  Some poll workers are elected, some  are appointed, and some volunteer.  Levels of authority and responsibility  that jurisdictions grant to poll workers also ranged from significant  autonomy over the operation of the polling place with final authority to  interpret improper ballot markings to having limited discretion, functioning  primarily as clerks and facilitators who refer issues and problems back to  elections headquarters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Elections Were Conducted Varied", "paragraphs": ["Jurisdictions followed various procedures on election day that created  differences in the way elections were conducted.  For example, to  determine whether a citizen who appeared at the polls was eligible to vote,  some jurisdictions required voters to identify themselves by stating their  names and addresses to the poll workers, who also matched the signature  on the voter application with the voter registration records.  Other  jurisdictions also required voters to present a valid photo identification  card.  In other jurisdictions, a hunting or fishing license was sufficient to  verify one\u2019s identity. Still other jurisdictions required no identification other  than the voter stating his or her name.  If a voter\u2019s name did not appear on  the list of registered voters, some jurisdictions accommodated these  individuals by automatically giving them a provisional ballot which may  have been counted if the voter\u2019s eligibility was verified at a later time.

Consequently, as a practical  matter, congressionally directed changes in the conduct of congressional  elections are likely to affect the administration of state and local elections.   In addition, through the use of its spending power, Congress may  encourage state action by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal  funds.", "Our work found wide variations across the country which have developed  over time in response to local economic, demographic, political, and  cultural traditions in each state and local jurisdiction.  As might be  expected given this variety, local election officials do not share a common  perspective on election reform.  For example, when asked their  preferences for the use of federal funds, should they become available,  local election officials identified a range of spending priorities, with no  clear consensus on the top priority.  Among these priorities were voter  education, voting equipment, poll worker pay, and postage for mailing  voting materials and printing ballots.  Nor was there a consensus among  local election officials on how involved the federal government should be  in state and local election administration and reform.  About 27 percent of  the local jurisdictions we surveyed supported uniform standards for  election administration, and 30 percent supported updated federal  standards for voting equipment.  However, many of the jurisdictions we  visited did not want federal funding for election administration if it meant  sacrificing local autonomy.  Some supported the concept of a federal  clearinghouse for sharing information about election administration  practices.", "We estimate that 54 percent of local election officials support federal funding to subsidize postage for materials mailed to voters, 42 percent support federal funding to help with the operational costs of elections, and over 38 percent support federal funding for voter education.", "Overall, our work suggests that a \"one size fits all\" approach may not be  suitable for every aspect of election administration.  In jurisdictions with a  small number of voters, for example, hand-counted paper ballots may  produce accurate and complete vote counts.  Conversely, full-faced DRE  equipment (this type of machine uses a large, single-page ballot) could not  readily accommodate Los Angeles County's long ballot printed in 7  languages.  Thus, the degree of flexibility afforded local jurisdictions in  implementing any reform should be given careful consideration when  deliberating specific reform initiatives.  Historically, changes in election  administration have been evolutionary rather than revolutionary.  Both  election officials and voters become accustomed to and comfortable with  how elections are planned and conducted in their individual jurisdictions.   Many of the underlying conditions associated with the variations are not  likely to change in the short term.  Large-scale, immediate changes in the  use of people, processes, or technology will not necessarily change those  conditions.

Issues with recruiting and training poll workers, educating voters, and  addressing needs of voters with disabilities posed major people-related  challenges in the November 2000 elections.

The major challenge many jurisdictions  identified regarding voter education was finding sufficient funding.  On the  basis of our mail survey, we estimate that over a third of the jurisdictions  nationwide believed that the federal government should provide monetary  assistance for voter education programs.

For these jurisdictions, obtaining enough poll workers (27  percent) was the most frequently identified major problem the jurisdictions  faced.", "We estimate 51 percent of the jurisdictions nationwide reported that it was somewhat or very difficult to get a sufficient number of poll workers.", "Poll Workers Drawn From Aging Labor Pool Many people who are available for occasional full-day employment as poll  workers are older, perhaps retired, and likely attracted to the work because  of something other than the pay because poll workers are generally paid  low wages.  For example, an election official in a small jurisdiction said  that over 70 percent of their poll workers are over 65 years old. One official  remarked that volunteering is characteristic of an older generation.   Several officials echoed the statement of an official in a small jurisdiction  that \u201cur election workforce is aging and we are having difficulty  recruiting younger workers.\u201d", "Low Pay, Long Hours May Discourage Younger Workers The pool of potential poll workers may be shrinking because poll worker  pay is inadequate to attract employed or more skilled workers and poll  workers often are required to complete a 15- to 18-hour day.  One election  official reported that \u201cince compensation for this job is only $80 to $135  per day, depending upon the election district, it is not sufficient to attract a  younger workforce.\u201d  The length of the day is a complaint of many poll  workers and may even pose an obstacle for younger workers.  Another  official said that, \u201chat they (the election judges) used to consider as a  fun and interesting day and an American duty has become \u2018heavy duty\u2019.\u201d  In  one large jurisdiction, election officials asked poll workers to provide  feedback on their experience in the November 2000 election.  One poll  worker responded that it was \u201cbsolutely, positively too long a day.  I am  26 years old and very athletic and still went home at night and fell asleep  with my clothes on.  With the majority of helpers either older or disabled, I  have no idea how they survived the day.\u201d", "Poll Workers With Specialized Skills Are Often Difficult to Recruit  Another problem is addressing the specialized labor needs unique to  particular polling sites, according to several local election officials.  Some  polling places required poll workers to have specific language skills.   Finding qualified bilingual workers, specifically workers fluent in Asian  languages, is one very large jurisdiction\u2019s biggest recruiting problem.  Some  places had trouble finding poll workers who are able to learn the technical  skills necessary to operate voting equipment.  Officials in one very large  jurisdiction said they have no scarcity of people willing to serve, but finding  people to meet specialized needs is the issue.  Obstacles to recruiting poll  workers may overlap.  One election official wrote that \u201ct is increasingly  difficult to find folks to work for $6 an hour.

Many of our workers are 70+.\u201d", "Minimal Training May Not Have Adequately Prepared Poll Workers  for Election Day  We estimate that 87 percent of jurisdictions nationwide provided some  training for poll workers. Poll worker training courses generally span a few  hours\u2019 time and focus on the key processes that poll workers should follow,  including how to operate voting equipment.  Although most of the  jurisdictions we visited required some poll worker training, election  officials cited instances where poll workers who had attended training still  either did not understand what they were to do or chose not to follow  specific instructions on how to run the polls.  For example, to handle  unregistered voters in one very large jurisdiction, the poll workers were  instructed to provide those voters with questionable credentials a  provisional ballot.  However, some poll workers failed to follow these rules  and turned away some voters from the polling place.

To illustrate this point, officials  from a very large jurisdiction stated that in the November 2000 election  1,500 voters had inserted their punch cards in the recording device upside  down, thus causing their votes to be inaccurately recorded.  Similarly, at a  small jurisdiction that we visited where optical scan equipment was used,  officials reported that some voters incorrectly marked the ovals or used a  nonreadable pen to mark the ballot, resulting in partially read ballots.  In a  medium-sized jurisdiction that we visited, voters selected a candidate on  the optical scan ballot and then wrote the candidate\u2019s name in the write-in  section of the ballot, thus overvoting (making more choices than are  permitted per contest) and spoiling the ballot.  The election officials stated  that they believed that this misunderstanding contributed to the  jurisdictions\u2019 almost 5-percent overvote rate.

Differences in these procedures can have noticeable effects on the  prevalence of undervotes (votes for fewer choices than permitted, such as  not voting for president) and overvotes, for example.  In particular, we  found that some precinct-count optical scan voting equipment can be  programmed to return a voter\u2019s ballot if the ballot is overvoted or  undervoted.  Such programming allows the voter to make any changes  necessary to ensure that the vote is recorded correctly.  However, not all  states allow this.

The following sections further elaborate how Congress might  use each of the four criteria.", "The Appropriate Federal Role in Election Reform A threshold consideration in assessing various proposals and legislation is  the appropriate role of the federal government in effecting election reform.   Pursuant to its constitutional authority, Congress has periodically enacted  legislation that mandates elections be conducted in particular ways.  For  example, Congress has prohibited discrimination based on certain voter  characteristics, such as race or age for both state and federal elections.  In  addition, Congress has broad authority to establish requirements for  congressional elections that are binding on the states.  As a practical  matter, such requirements may also affect state and local elections held in  conjunction with elections to federal office.  Congress has enacted  legislation affecting the timing of federal elections, voter registration,  absentee voting for military and overseas civilian citizens of the United  States, and voting accessibility for the elderly and the disabled in federal  elections.  These statutes have basically focused on facilitating the  opportunity for voters to participate in the voting process and ensuring fair  and equitable treatment of voters.  Aside from direct regulation of election  administration, Congress may also, in exercising its spending power,  encourage state action by attaching conditions to the receipt of federal  funds.  The scope of congressional authority in election administration is  discussed in our March 2001 report.", "This constitutionally-derived authority notwithstanding, election  administration has principally been the responsibility of state and local  jurisdictions that conduct elections for local, state, and federal offices.  As  discussed elsewhere in this report, states and local jurisdictions have  determined voter qualifications, types of voting equipment to be used,  ballot design, selection of poll workers, and what constitutes a vote.   This  historical balance between Congress\u2019 constitutional authority to prescribe  change and the states\u2019 and localities\u2019 traditional roles in defining the terms  of election administration raises fundamental policy issues that must be  confronted in the debate about the federal government\u2019s efforts to pursue  election reform.", "Various reform proposals offered to date differ in the role envisioned for  the federal government.  These can be categorized into essentially four  distinct options for federal action that fall along a continuum of low- to  high- federal involvement.   The first option, falling on the low end of the  continuum, calls for the federal government to provide information,  guidance, and encouragement to states and local jurisdictions to take  action in specific areas.  At the second point on the continuum, a reform  proposal may envision a more involved federal role that calls for the federal  government to provide funds to states and localities to improve election  administration, allowing each jurisdiction to use the funds where it  believes they are most needed.  At the third point on the continuum,  proposals may go a step further suggesting that the federal government   provide funds, contingent on states and local jurisdictions taking specific  actions or achieving specific results.  In this role the federal government  uses a \u201ccarrot\u201d to encourage a desired behavior by states and local  jurisdictions.  However, the states and local jurisdictions still have the  ability to opt for the status quo by refusing the federal funds.  At the fourth  point on the continuum, where election reform would involve the greatest  use of federal authority, the federal government would mandate that state  and local jurisdictions take specific actions or achieve specific results--with  or without accompanying funding.  Historically, this option has been used  when the federal government wishes to guarantee a voter right or  protection.", "By way of illustration, consider how Congress would reach different  conclusions on the issue of replacing existing voting equipment given how  it might use its authority.  Many recommendations from recently completed  studies and congressional legislative proposals call for providing federal  assistance to state and local election jurisdictions for replacing voting  equipment.", "Under the first option, Congress could require the FEC to act as a  clearinghouse to gather and disseminate information and to sponsor  research on the various types of voting equipment.  The federal  government would provide information, assistance, and advice that  would make it easier for that state and local election jurisdictions to  examine their choice of voting equipment in light of national data on  specific practices or issues.  This approach provides a minimal federal  role in affecting change, leaving the greatest discretion and control to  states and local election jurisdictions.  This federal role would not entail  disbursing federal funds to support purchase and installation of new  technologies, leaving acquisition decisions up to local jurisdictions.", "Under the second option, the federal government could create a grant  program that would make federal funding available to states to support  purchase and installation of new voting equipment.  Funds would be  provided with no \u201cstrings\u201d attached regarding which type of equipment  the state could buy.", "Under the third option, the federal government could create a similar  grant program to that in the second option, except that strings would be  attached. For example, funds would only be provided for states to buy  equipment that meets federal standards, or only for certain types of  equipment (e.g., precinct-based optical scanners).  This further limits  local jurisdictions\u2019 discretion in choosing appropriate equipment and  allows states to opt out of the program.", "Under the fourth option, the federal government could mandate that  only certain types of voting equipment could be used in federal  elections.  Congress might or might not provide funding to enable states  without this type of equipment to purchase and install it.  Either way,  jurisdictions would have no choice but to comply with the law and  acquire that voting equipment, regardless of whether this choice best  meets local needs.  This option provides the least discretion.  Because  federal elections are usually conducted in conjunction with state and  local elections, congressional mandates regarding the conduct of federal  elections would likely involve changes in many, if not all, state and local  elections.", "In addition to the appropriate federal role in election reform, the degree to  which reform proposals may affect the accessibility and integrity of an  election system, our work suggests, is an important criterion for Congress  to use in assessing the effect of reform proposals on our election systems.   Some proposals may seek to increase the general public\u2019s access to the  election system.   Accessibility describes the degree to which an election  system promotes inclusiveness, thus making it as easy as possible for the  general population to register to vote and to cast their votes.  For example,  reform proposals that attempt to (1) make voter registration less  cumbersome, (2) give voters more opportunity to cast absentee or early  ballots, or (3) provide voting equipment that all voters can use with ease  can be considered as affecting an election system\u2019s accessibility.  Other  proposals may attempt to increase the system\u2019s integrity, that is, the degree  to which the system is impervious to voter fraud.  For instance, proposals  may implement controls to ensure that (1) voters present identification or  proof of eligibility at the polls on election day or (2) all eligible votes are  counted can be said to affect an election system\u2019s integrity.", "The goal of making the election system more accessible to voters can run at  cross purposes with the goal of ensuring the election system\u2019s integrity.   This tension suggests decision makers should ask how reform proposals  balance the goals of providing all citizens broad access to the voting  process against the public interest in ensuring the integrity of the vote.", "Most election reform proposals address one or both of these concepts to  some degree, with some placing more emphasis on one or the other.  The  weight individual policymakers may place on different concerns could vary,  depending on how they value different attributes.  For example, increasing  the opportunity to use absentee ballots may improve access to the vote, but  it also might negate the possibility of using some of the controls that may  be used at a polling place to assure voter identification and eligibility.  If  increasing access to the vote is deemed more important than ensuring the  presence of rigorous controls, then reform proposals emphasizing  accessibility considerations might be preferred.", "In the past when Congress has taken action to change the election system,  it considered both accessibility and integrity issues.  Constitutional  amendments and federal legislation affecting the election process opened  access to those whose access was either denied or circumscribed\u2014e.g.,  African-Americans, women, language minorities, people with disabilities.   All of these reforms assumed the existence of controls to ensure that only  those who were otherwise eligible among these groups would be able to  register to vote and cast their ballots.  The most recent federal statute  affecting the election process\u2014NVRA, or motor voter act\u2014specifically  recognized the dual goals of access and integrity.  The act established  registration procedures designed to \u201cincrease the number of eligible  citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal office,\u201d without  compromising \u201cthe integrity of the electoral process\u201d or the maintenance of  \u201caccurate and current voter registration rolls.\u201d", "Creating a proper balance between accessibility and integrity is sometimes  difficult, as seen in the following examples which illustrate the inherent  tension between these competing goals:  Requiring that citizens who register to vote present a form of picture  identification with their residence\u2019s address provides some proof of  identify and some assurance that the person resides in the voting  jurisdiction and is therefore eligible to vote in the jurisdiction in which  he or she is registering.  However, this procedure makes it more difficult  for persons to register to vote if they meet registration qualifications but  do not have a driver\u2019s license or other picture identification indicating  their place of residence.", "Providing a provisional ballot to every person who wishes to vote but is  not listed in the poll books at the polling place maximizes the  opportunity of every person to cast a ballot.  The purpose of checking  whether these persons are in fact registered to vote prior to counting  their ballots is to assure that the vote count will include only ballots cast  by eligible voters.", "Election officials may go to nursing homes to review absentee ballot  requests, and accept ballots cast by nursing home residents while the  officials are present to supervise the voting process.  In effect, the  nursing home becomes an unofficial polling place.  Residents are  provided a greater opportunity to vote but with better controls in place  to address the potential that the absentee ballot might be voted by  someone other than the registered voter.", "Allowing remote voting via the Internet may improve some voters\u2019  opportunities to cast a ballot.  Although this method is in an  experimental stage, unresolved questions about its impact on the  integrity of election systems remain.  As with other forms of remote  voting, such as absentee voting by mail, there is a need to ensure that  only eligible voters cast ballots, voter privacy is protected, and voters  are not subject to coercion.", "Integration of People, Processes and Technology As Congress assesses various reform proposals, it may consider both  reforms that address a discrete problem and that address the election  system more broadly.  Congress may also be asked to choose among  proposals that address specific parts of a perceived problem or address  perceived problems in a more systematic fashion.", "Effective election administration requires the appropriate coordination and  integration of people, processes, and technology.  For example,  successfully registering a new voter, whether the person registers by mail,  at the Department of Motor Vehicles, or at the registrar\u2019s office, involves  the coordination and integration of (1) voters and registration workers who  know and follow the registration process, including obtaining the  information required to register successfully;  (2) the process for  registering new voters that guides election workers as they supply the  correct forms to voters, compile and update voter information, and notify  voters of their registration status; and (3) a computer system or other  means of creating and updating a voter registration list to assure an  accurate, current list of registered voters.  Shortcomings in any of three  areas can affect the ability of persons to register successfully and the  accuracy of the registration rolls.", "To illustrate the difference between approaching reforms from a discrete  versus system-wide perspective, consider election reform proposals that  recommend Congress provide assistance to states and localities to  purchase new voting equipment in order to reduce voter error.  Some of  these proposals approach voter error as if it were precipitated by a single  cause, such as the type of voting equipment used.  However, introducing  new technology alone may not necessarily reduce voter error.  In fact,  switching equipment actually may introduce new opportunities for voter  error unless the jurisdiction deals with the people aspects of successfully  fielding new voting technology and offers voter education on how to use  the new equipment effectively.  Moreover, successful implementation must  include processes for dealing with machine failure, ensuring that the  equipment is programmed properly to accurately count the votes for each  office on the ballot and that the ballots and machines are secure.  Failure to  consider the interaction of people, processes, and technology in fielding  new voting equipment may result in increased voter or counting error,  rather than a decrease.", "As a second example, some proposals suggest a change in process that  establishes standard voting hours such that all polling places across the  nation are opened and closed simultaneously, regardless of time zone.  With  this proposal, voters in every part of the country would cast their votes  while the outcome of the election is still unknown, thus negating any  influence that media reports of election results may have.  Although voter  participation might increase as a result, this proposal might also have  unintended consequences for other parts of the election system.  For  example, keeping polling places open at earlier or later hours may increase  the burden placed on poll workers.  Some elections officials currently  report difficulties in securing poll workers who are willing to work 15 to 18  hour days, a situation that might be exacerbated if poll workers were asked  to work even earlier or later.", "Affordability and Sustainability of Proposed Election Reforms The implementation of election reforms will likely increase the overall cost  of our nation\u2019s election systems.  Choosing among election reform  proposals, therefore, should include a careful assessment of the  affordability and sustainability of the reform as well as who is expected to  shoulder the costs.  Simply making funding available to state and local  governments to implement a reform without consideration of whether all  associated lifecycle costs have been considered or how the reform is to be  sustained could result in having to revisit reform issues.", "Historically, incurring the costs of election administration and equipment  has largely fallen to local jurisdictions, with some support provided by the  state governments.  Elections have been conducted over the years with  relatively small budgets, and election officials consistently find themselves  competing for funds with other local government priorities.  Our work  confirmed that election administration is not usually at the top of state and  local funding priorities.  As an official in a large election jurisdiction told  us, election administration is often number 11 in the top 10 priorities of  local government budgets.", "As a result, realistic reform proposals are those that not only identify  solutions to the issues at hand, but are also affordable and sustainable with  achievable financial commitments for the federal, state, and local  government stakeholders.   Along these lines, as Congress assesses reform  proposals, it should consider three factors related to affordability and  sustainability.", "The first factor is the initial outlay required to fully implement the  proposal.  In this regard, the assessment should consider whether the initial  outlay for the proposed reform would be affordable to the state and  localities, including all associated and transition costs (e.g., training  workers and voters to use new equipment and any changes to voting  processes necessitated by new equipment).   For example, were Congress  to implement a proposal that requires all states to develop a state-wide  voter registration system, some states might find themselves unable to  comply unless federal funding sources were forthcoming.  States with  budgetary pressures that prevented them from quickly implementing the  federal requirement could be even less likely to supply the funding to  comply with the federal requirements.  In addition, the costs to the other  components of election administration (e.g., the cost of training election  workers to use the new voting technology) should also be considered.", "The second factor is whether the federal government and/or state and local  jurisdictions could afford the long-term costs of sustaining the proposed  reform over time.   Reform proposals that provide funding for purchasing  new technology could enable some jurisdictions to upgrade their voting  equipment.  To the extent that a local jurisdiction could sustain the funding  needed to continue its use, the performance of voting equipment would be  improved.  For example, if the federal government were to make funds  available to purchase different voting technology (e.g., replacing punch  cards with electronic equipment), it should have some assurance that the  additional resources necessary to sustain the reform (e.g., software,  programming capability, vendor support, and updates) would be available.   However, not all jurisdictions are in a position to make that commitment.", "The third factor is assigning responsibility for costs, and whether all  levels of government could commit to implement and sustain the reform.   As mentioned above, it is doubtful that every local jurisdiction could alone  commit the resources necessary to fund many of the reforms envisioned in  several proposals.  However, they might be in a position to fund some of  them, thereby making a commitment to the success of the reform.  On the  other hand, the question arises as to how much of a federal or state  presence in local election administration is perceived as desirable or  financially possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 4: Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Events surrounding the November 2000 election brought into question the  integrity of our nation\u2019s election systems.

Congressional authority to legislate in this area derives from various  constitutional sources, depending upon the type of election.  With regard to  the administration of federal elections, Congress has constitutional  authority over both congressional and presidential elections.", "Congress\u2019 authority to regulate congressional elections derives primarily  from Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution (known as the  Elections Clause).

A citizen\u2019s access to voting is primarily based on  the appearance of his or her name on a voter registration list, which is  developed from registration applications and compiled and maintained by  election officials using various technologies and information sources.   Election officials nationwide expressed varying degrees of confidence in  the accuracy of their voter registration lists; however, information about  list accuracy and currency, as well as the extent of error, was difficult to  obtain.  Among the challenges identified were processing applications  submitted through sources other than elections offices, such as state motor  vehicle authorities; obtaining accurate and timely information from  numerous sources to update voter registration lists; and using technology  to help process applications and compile registration lists.", "All states allowed some form of absentee or early voting in the November  2000 election; using U.S. Census data, we estimate that for the November  2000 election, about 14 percent of voters nationwide cast their ballots  before election day, three-fourths of them using mail-in ballots and one- fourth voting in person.  However, we found that no national data are  currently maintained on the number of mail-in absentee ballots  disqualified.  Differences in requirements, administration, and procedures  resulted in citizens having different opportunities for obtaining and  successfully casting absentee ballots.  For example, the likelihood of a  ballot being disqualified due to voters\u2019 errors in completing and returning  mail-in absentee ballots varied even, in some instances, among  jurisdictions in the same state. Among the challenges local election  officials face are deciding whether and how to process incomplete and late  mail-in absentee applications and ballots; processing large numbers of  mail-in absentee applications and ballots in a timely manner; and obtaining  adequate staffing, ballots, and locations for conducting early voting.", "Election officials across the country, with some variation, performed  similar duties to prepare for and conduct the November 2000 election.  Our  survey indicated that 57 percent of voting jurisdictions nationwide  encountered major problems in conducting the 2000 election.  While  jurisdictions did not experience the same problems, more than half cited  problems with recruiting enough qualified poll workers. However, because  few jurisdictions systematically collected information on how they  administer elections, what they consider to be major problems may be  based on anecdotal information and limited analysis. From the perspective  of election officials, a major election day challenge is resolving questions  about voter eligibility.  Large numbers of ineligible voters can create long  lines, voter frustration, and problems for poll workers. Many eligibility  issues stem from the reliability of voter registration lists.", "Counting votes is not a simple task.  It involves counting votes cast before  and on election day and may be carried out at the precinct, at a central  location, by hand, or by some type of counting equipment.  Vote counting  problems are highlighted when the election results are close.  A ballot may  not be counted when a voter overvotes\u2014marks for two candidates--or  when the ballot cannot be read by the counting equipment.  What  constitutes a proper mark on a ballot differs based on the type of voting  method used.  According to our survey of state election directors, 31 states  and the District of Columbia have a state law or other provision specifying  what is a proper ballot marking for each voting method, but state guidance  also varied from general to specific.  Forty-seven states and the District of  Columbia have laws with provisions for recount, but they vary.  For  example, 17 states provide for a mandatory recount, but two of these  require a tie vote and another requires a 1 percent or 200 vote difference.   According to officials in 42 of the jurisdictions that had recounts in the 2000  election, none of the recounts altered the original election outcome.   Counting ballots posed several challenges for election officials, including  counting only votes cast by eligible voters; interpreting variations when  ballots are not properly marked; and completing the results of a recount in  a close or contested election in a fair, accurate, and timely manner.", "Four types of voting equipment\u2014punch card, optical scan, lever, and  DRE\u2014were used in 98 percent of all election jurisdictions in 2000.  While a  survey of vendors showed little performance difference among DRE,  optical scan, and punch card equipment, local election officials we  contacted rated DRE as more easy to use than other voting methods.  Only  about 50 percent of jurisdictions collected data on accuracy and few of the  jurisdictions we visited had collected actual performance data on the  voting equipment used in the 2000 election.  Nevertheless the vast majority  of jurisdictions across the nation were satisfied with their respective voting  equipment, based largely on officials\u2019 perceptions of how their equipment  performed.  The cost to replace existing voting equipment depends on the  type of equipment purchased and the number of jurisdictions for which it is  purchased.  We estimated the cost of purchasing optical scan units, not  including certain software costs, could range from $191 million for optical  scan machines that use a central-count unit to about $1.3 billion for optical  scan equipment that counts ballots at the precinct and thus allows for voter  error correction. We estimated the cost of purchasing touchscreen DRE  units to be about $3 billion (including one DRE touchscreen unit per  precinct equipped for voters with disabilities and one central count optical  scan unit per county for absentee ballots). Among the voting equipment  challenges identified by election officials were having reliable measures  and objective data to know whether the technology used is meeting the  jurisdictions\u2019 needs; ensuring that necessary security, testing, and  maintenance activities are performed; and ensuring that the technology  will provide benefits over its useful life commensurate with life cycle costs  and that these collective costs are affordable and sustainable.", "Our review identified three kinds of internet voting--at a polling place; in a  voting \u201ckiosk\u201d at public places, such as malls or libraries; or at any location,  including the voter\u2019s workplace or home through a personal computer.   Although opinion is not unanimous, security is seen as the primary  challenge for Internet voting.

While some installations we visited had  well run programs providing assistance and information to potential voters,  other installations did not meet DOD and service requirements because  they did not provide sufficient numbers of trained Voting Assistance  Officers, voter training, and voting materials.
