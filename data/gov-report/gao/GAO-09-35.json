To reduce these numbers, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) nearly doubled funding for the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). SAFETEA-LU added requirements for states to develop strategic highway safety plans that include four key elements and to publicly report on at least the top 5 percent of hazardous locations on all of their public roads. The act also set aside funds for a legacy rail-highway crossing program and a new high-risk rural road program. As requested, GAO examined (1) states' implementation of HSIP following SAFETEA-LU, (2) HSIP results to date, and (3) FHWA's guidance and assistance to states. GAO analyzed plans from 25 states, including 19 randomly selected states and 6 states that GAO visited. GAO also interviewed FHWA and state safety officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All states adopted strategic highway safety plans, and the 25 state plans that GAO analyzed addressed the 4 key elements added by SAFETEA-LU, although states lacked some of the crash data and analysis capabilities described in the law. GAO's analysis showed that the 25 states (1) involved multidisciplinary safety stakeholders; (2) defined areas of safety emphasis through analyses of state fatality data using crash data analysis systems; (3) identified strategies and projects to address these emphasis areas through infrastructure improvements, behavioral approaches, and emergency medical services; and (4) provided for overall and individual project evaluations. However, many of the 25 states lacked components of the prescribed crash data analysis systems, such as a system for locating crashes and roadway data for local roads. FHWA is developing such a system for the states, but many states lack necessary data for local roads because they do not maintain or operate them. Without the prescribed components, states cannot conduct some of the safety analysis defined by SAFETEA-LU or report to FHWA on their most hazardous locations on all public roads, determine appropriate remedies, and estimate costs--all requirements added by SAFETEA-LU. While FHWA has set a deadline for states to develop the capability to locate crashes on all public roads, it has not done so for roadway data. Because states were not required to submit their strategic highway safety plans to FHWA until October 2007, they have not had sufficient time to implement and evaluate their HSIP strategies and projects; hence, it is too soon to evaluate HSIP results carried out after SAFETEA-LU. However, two of HSIP's statutory funding provisions may not be aligned with some states' safety priorities contained in their strategic plans. First, FHWA data show that most states have not used a new flexible funding provision that allows states to allocate some HSIP funds for behavioral approaches or emergency medical services. Some states may be reluctant to use this provision, according to state officials we interviewed, partly due to an HSIP certification requirement that all state highway safety infrastructure needs have been met. Second, the rail-highway crossing set-aside program does not target a key safety priority ofsome states and provides significant funding to some crossing areas that have relatively few fatalities. Better alignment of federal funding with state priorities in their strategic plans could help ensure that HSIP funding best addresses those priorities. Lastly, as states implement the high-risk rural roads program, they are hindered by limited data on rural roads and crashes, which are needed to identify qualifying roadways and appropriate remedies. FHWA provided comprehensive guidance and training to assist states in preparing their strategic highway safety plans, and participated in states' strategic safety planning processes. FHWA's guidance to states on reporting their most hazardous locations took states' data limitations into account and gave states latitude in defining the methodology and scope of their 5 percent reports. Consequently, these reports vary in content and format and may not increase public awareness of highway safety as intended."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, about 43,000 people were killed and another 290,000 were  seriously injured on public roadways in the United States. Over half of  these fatalities in 2006\u201423,339, or 55 percent\u2014occurred on rural roads  and 324 fatalities, or less than 1 percent, occurred at public rail-highway  crossings. Motor vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death for  people of every age from 4 through 34 in 2005. Moreover, according to a  study by the American Automobile Association, traffic crashes in urban  areas cost an estimated $164 billion in 2005, including the costs of  property damage, lost earnings, medical treatment, emergency services,  pain and lost quality of life, and other costs.", "To reduce the number of crashes, traffic fatalities, and serious injuries on  public roads, Congress passed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), August  2005, nearly doubling the federal funding for the Highway Safety  Improvement Program (HSIP) by authorizing $5.1 billion from 2006  through 2009. SAFETEA-LU identified three programs as part of HSIP\u2014a  safety construction program for all public roads and a set-aside program  for rail-highway crossings, both of which predate SAFETEA-LU, and a  new set-aside program for high-risk rural roads. SAFETEA-LU authorized  about $1.3 billion per year for HSIP, including $220 million per year for  rail-highway grade crossings and $90 million per year for high-risk rural  roads. HSIP funds are distributed to the states according to a formula that  includes, among other things, the numbers of highway lane miles, vehicle  miles traveled, and fatalities\u2014all on federal-aid highways\u2014in each state.  In addition, SAFETEA-LU authorized funding increases for several  programs administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration (FMCSA). These programs provide states with grants to  address traffic safety issues involving passenger and commercial vehicles,  respectively, and to improve safety data.", "Besides authorizing additional funding to improve highway safety,  SAFETEA-LU added a requirement that each state department of  transportation develop and submit new strategic highway safety plans,  approved by the state\u2019s Governor or responsible state agency, to the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which administers HSIP, by  October 1, 2007, to avoid incurring a financial penalty in HSIP funds for  the state. For states to receive full HSIP funding after this date, their plans  had to address four key elements specified in SAFETEA-LU. Specifically,  the plans, first, had to be developed with the participation of a wide range  of stakeholders in the strategic planning process and, second, had to  define areas of safety emphasis through an analysis of state fatality data  performed by a crash data analysis system capable of identifying the  state\u2019s greatest highway safety hazards. Third, to address these safety  emphasis areas, the plans had to include strategies and projects covering  all aspects of highway safety for all public roads. The term \u201call aspects of  highway safety\u201d includes strategies and projects to improve highway  infrastructure; address behavioral challenges such as drunk driving and  seat belt use; and improve emergency medical services, although HSIP  funds are primarily to be used for infrastructure improvements. Fourth,  the plans had to provide for evaluating both the strategic plans themselves,  including the overall progress made under the plans in reducing crashes  and fatalities, and the results of the states\u2019 specific safety projects and  strategies. In addition, to advance public awareness of highway safety  hazards and needs, SAFETEA-LU added a requirement that states publicly  report on at least 5 percent of their most severe hazardous locations. The  states\u2019 \u201c5 percent reports\u201d must include potential remedies for the hazards;  the estimated costs of those remedies; and impediments to implementing  the remedies, other than cost. FHWA must post the states\u2019 5 percent  reports on its Web site.", "This report responds to your request that we assess the progress made  toward accomplishing the HSIP goals set forth in SAFETEA-LU. In  particular, we address the following questions: (1) What steps have states  taken to implement HSIP since SAFETEA-LU? (2) What have been the  results, to date, of states\u2019 efforts in carrying out HSIP, including the results  of their set-aside programs for rail-highway crossings and for high-risk  rural roads? (3) What types of guidance and assistance has FHWA  provided to states to support their planning, implementation, monitoring,  and evaluation of HSIP?", "To respond to all three questions, we adopted an overall approach that  included reviewing pertinent legislation; analyzing the strategic highway  safety plans and related documentation that 25 states submitted to FHWA  in 2007, including 19 randomly selected states and 6 judgmentally selected  states that we visited; reviewing FHWA guidance to states and division  offices; and interviewing FHWA Office of Safety and division officials,  state transportation and safety officials, and a wide range of stakeholders  and interest groups. To select the 6 states we visited\u2014California, Florida,  Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania\u2014we considered the number  of fatalities reported for 2005 and other factors, including the numbers of  fatalities that occurred on rural roads, the number of fatalities at rail- highway crossings, the miles of urban and rural roads in the state, and  geographic distribution. Our findings are not necessarily representative of  all 50 states and the District of Columbia because we did not review a  sufficient number of randomly selected states to generalize our results and  we selected 6 states judgmentally. We conducted this performance audit  from May 2007 through November 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

DOT has a goal of lowering the  fatality rate to 1.0 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled by 2011.", "Through SAFETEA-LU, Congress increased funding for HSIP with the goal  of significantly reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries on all public  roads. HSIP\u2019s funding authorizations, which totaled $5.1 billion for fiscal  years 2006 through 2009, nearly doubled from pre-SAFETEA-LU levels.  SAFETEA-LU authorized funding for three major highway safety  programs, as follows (see fig. 1):    Over $950 million per year, on average, for the long-standing HSIP safety  construction program, which funds safety infrastructure projects\u2014such as  intersection improvements and other safety enhancements\u2014on any public  road.    $220 million per year to continue the rail-highway crossing set-aside  program within HSIP, reserving one-half of the funding for hazard  elimination projects\u2014such as grade separations, reconstruction of  crossing structures, and crossing closures\u2014and the other half for the  installation of protective devices, such as warning signs and gates.    $90 million per year for a new, high-risk rural road set-aside program to  address hazards on rural roads that have above-average crash rates  involving fatalities or serious injuries.", "Besides authorizing increased funding, SAFETEA-LU added several other  requirements for HSIP:    State transportation departments must now prepare a strategic highway  safety plan that addresses four key elements added by SAFETEA-LU. First,  eight types of stakeholders must participate in preparing the plan. Second,  the plan must define areas of safety emphasis through an analysis of state  fatality and serious injury data. Third, the plan must identify strategies and  projects that cover all aspects of highway safety, which include   (1) infrastructure improvements; (2) behavioral approaches, such as  education and enforcement efforts meant to change drivers\u2019 behavior; and  (3) emergency medical services. Fourth, the plan must provide for overall  performance measurement. SAFETEA-LU added a requirement that states  submit the plans to FHWA by October 1, 2007. States without a strategic  plan in place by this deadline would still receive funds for highway safety  improvement, but the amount would be capped at the fiscal year 2007  level.", "To conduct their analyses of fatality and serious injury data, states must  now develop crash data analysis systems that they can use to identify  hazardous locations, potential remedies, and the costs of those remedies.", "To advance public awareness of highway safety hazards and needs, states  must now analyze safety hazards on all of their public roads and report on  at least 5 percent of their most severe hazardous locations\u2014in what is  known as the \u201c5 percent report\u201d\u2014to FHWA for posting on its public Web  site. The report must be based on an analysis of crash data and, for the  identified hazardous locations, must include potential remedies and the  estimated costs of those remedies. Acknowledging that states have  differing levels of data available, FHWA set an August 31, 2009, deadline  for states to address all public roads in this report.", "Under a new provision, states may now direct, or flex, up to 10 percent of  their HSIP funds to behavioral and emergency medical services projects if  they have adopted a strategic highway safety plan and certified that they  have met all of their safety infrastructure needs.", "FHWA administers HSIP, and its Office of Safety provides overall  programmatic direction and guidance. FHWA division offices located in  each state manage program implementation, review states\u2019 annual  highway improvement program reports, and provide oversight of program  funding. For each of the programs within HSIP\u2014the safety infrastructure  construction program, the rail-highway crossing set-aside, and the high- risk rural road set-aside\u2014states must provide FHWA with an annual report  on the projects they have implemented and on their results.", "Other DOT agencies are also involved in state highway safety programs:     NHTSA funds state traffic safety grant programs focused on behavioral  safety issues. For example, the State and Community Highway Safety  Grant program, commonly known as the Section 402 program, funds state  projects that address issues such as impaired driving and seat belt use.  Safety Belt Use grants, which reward states for passing and enforcing  safety belt use laws, can be used for activities ranging from public  education to roadway safety improvements. The State Traffic Safety  Information Systems Improvement grant program, also known as the  Section 408 program, provides funds to states to improve data collection  and analysis and requires that states conduct a highway traffic safety data  assessment and develop a plan to address any findings of this assessment.  Other NHTSA grant programs include Occupant Protection, Alcohol- Impaired Driving Countermeasures, and Child Safety and Booster Seat  Use.", "FMCSA provides states with federal funds to address safety issues  associated with commercial trucks and buses. For example, the Motor  Carrier Safety Assistance Program provides grants to support state  compliance reviews and roadside inspections of commercial trucks. Other  FMCSA grants support border enforcement and safety data improvement  projects.", "FRA maintains an inventory of rail-highway crossings and a crossing crash  reporting system that states use to manage safety at crossings. FRA also  provides states with computer software that assesses safety risks at  crossings by measuring traffic volumes, train speeds, and other factors.  However, FHWA, rather than FRA, administers HSIP\u2019s set-aside program  for rail-highway crossing safety.", "Federal highway safety programs award safety grants to state agencies,  but safety programs and projects are often implemented through local  government agencies and private organizations. For example, FHWA  administers HSIP primarily through state departments of transportation,  which may award subgrants to local government agencies to build safety  improvement projects on locally owned roads. Similarly, NHTSA grants to  state governors\u2019 highway safety offices are often implemented through  subgrants to law enforcement agencies or private organizations involved  in areas such as preventing injuries or drunk driving. FMCSA also awards  grants to state agencies responsible for the Motor Carrier Safety  Assistance Program, and those state agencies may then engage local  agencies, like law enforcement agencies, to carry out the programs as  subgrantees.", "Collectively, SAFETEA-LU authorized $9.5 billion over 4 years for state  safety programs administered by FHWA, NHTSA, and FMCSA. FHWA\u2019s  HSIP received about 53 percent of the authorized funding. The remaining  authorizations were mainly for behavioral programs administered by  NHTSA and FMCSA. However, states have the flexibility to use one type of  NHTSA grant\u2014Safety Belt Use\u2014and NHTSA\u2019s alcohol penalty transfers  for either behavioral projects or infrastructure projects (see fig. 2).  Authorizations for NHTSA\u2019s and FMCSA\u2019s behavioral programs amounted  to about 24 percent and 12 percent, respectively, accounting for over   36 percent of all DOT funding for state highway safety programs.", "The funding that states receive for FHWA\u2019s HSIP is generally higher than  the amount specifically authorized for it, mainly because of the Equity  Bonus Program. The Equity Bonus Program, authorized by SAFETEA-LU,  provides funding to states on the basis of equity criteria, such as a  minimum return on state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. See  appendix II for further information on HSIP funding for states and related  adjustments.", "In July 2008, DOT began preparing for the upcoming 2009 reauthorization  of surface transportation programs, including HSIP, by providing Congress  with a proposal for reforming surface transportation programs, including  HSIP. The proposed reforms for HSIP\u2014which DOT said were designed to  reduce paperwork burdens, better align set-asides to target safety  problems, and provide greater flexibility for states\u2014included, among  other things:    eliminating the requirement for the 5 percent report;  increasing the percentage of HSIP funds potentially available to direct, or  flex, to behavioral safety programs from 10 percent to 25 percent of HSIP  funds; and   ending the mandatory rail-highway crossing set-aside, while preserving the  eligibility of rail-highway crossing projects consistent with each state\u2019s  strategic highway safety plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Highway Safety Plans Included Key Elements Added by SAFETEA-LU, but States Lacked Prescribed Data and Analysis Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["According to FHWA, all 50 states and the District of Columbia complied  with the requirement, added by SAFETEA-LU, that they submit their  strategic highway safety plans to FHWA before October 2007. The 25 state  plans that we reviewed generally addressed the 4 key elements added by  SAFETEA-LU. First, these plans showed evidence of participation in the  strategic planning process by many of the stakeholders specified in the  legislation, and according to FHWA officials, this participation helped  break down the historical separation between planning activities for  infrastructure improvement projects and behavioral programs. Second, the  plans contained safety emphasis areas, which the states defined by  analyzing fatality and serious injury data, as required, and by building on  prior safety planning efforts. Third, to address the states\u2019 safety emphasis  areas, the plans included strategies and projects that covered all aspects of  highway safety, including safety construction improvements, behavioral  approaches, and emergency medical services. Finally, the plans we  reviewed generally provided for evaluating states\u2019 progress toward their  overall goal of reducing fatalities. Although the states had fatality and  serious injury data that were useful for developing their strategic plans,  they often did not have all of the components of crash data analysis  systems required since SAFETEA-LU. These systems include crash  location data, the capability to locate hazardous locations (e.g., a mapping  system that can identify clusters of crashes), roadway inventory data, and  the capability to identify and rank hazardous locations on all public roads  and identify potential remedies. FHWA and the states are taking steps to  address these issues, but the lack of data and analytical capability remains  the principal impediment to states\u2019 implementation of the data-driven  project selection process and reporting requirements specified in  SAFETEA-LU and could be costly to overcome."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Safety Planning Improved with the Increased Involvement of Multidisciplinary Stakeholders in the Strategic Planning Process", "paragraphs": ["In developing their strategic highway safety plans, states increased their  consultation with a wide range of safety stakeholders, as required since  SAFETEA-LU\u2019s enactment, and created a broad-based effort to identify  and address state highway safety issues. Before SAFETEA-LU\u2019s  enactment, state transportation officials were not required to develop  plans for highway safety improvement projects in collaboration with state  officials responsible for behavioral or emergency medical services  programs, although some states had multidisciplinary safety planning  activities under way. For example, highway safety transportation officials  in three of the six states we visited\u2014Florida, Iowa, and Mississippi\u2014said  they had broad-based stakeholder involvement in the planning process  prior to SAFETEA-LU. FHWA had also endorsed this multidisciplinary  approach in a 2001 FHWA program review of HSIP that found a good  multidisciplinary safety management process was a best practice.", "SAFETEA-LU directed state transportation departments, when developing  strategic plans, to consult with eight types of safety stakeholders, such as  metropolitan and regional transportation planning organizations and local  traffic enforcement agencies. Our review of 25 state plans showed that   20 states consulted with at least 5 of the 8 required types of stakeholders.  Twenty states also consulted with types of stakeholders not specifically  identified in SAFETEA-LU, such as local governments and other state  agencies. Stakeholders also typically included NHTSA and FMSCA  regional and state division officials. Although not every state achieved the  participation of every organization listed in the legislation, not all of the  organizations invited to participate did so, according to state highway  safety officials. For example, in two of the six states we visited, Operation  Lifesaver representatives were invited to participate in the planning  process but they were unable to attend.", "To obtain stakeholder input, states held conferences or summit meetings  where participants could express their views. At the six states we visited,  consultation meant that an organization participated in a state safety  summit meeting and possibly participated afterward in an ongoing  committee responsible for implementation in a specific emphasis area. At  summit meetings, participants helped each state identify its key emphasis  areas and potential strategies for addressing them. For example, in  California, the state chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)  participated in a summit meeting that identified impaired driving as an  area for the state to emphasize and identified 10 strategies to reduce the  number of fatalities due to impaired drivers. MADD officials said the  organization also participated on the California committee charged with  developing specific action items to implement the strategies shown in the  strategic plan. In Illinois, the Operation Lifesaver representatives  participated in a summit meeting that identified a strategy to address  crashes at rail-highway crossings and also sat on the committee  responsible for developing action items to address that strategy.", "State highway safety and transportation officials in the states we visited  said the strategic planning process presented a challenge in bringing  stakeholders from different areas together to collaborate on highway  safety. One challenge was to obtain the participation of stakeholders who  might not have been involved in highway safety in the past, such as  hospital representatives and other emergency services providers. Another  challenge was the cost to states of securing conference facilities and  conference materials to conduct summit meetings, according to some  state officials. In one state, the FHWA division office provided about  $20,000 to pay for the conference facilities. Furthermore, officials from  three of the six states we visited said that getting broad-based involvement  in the planning process was difficult because the cost of travel to a central  meeting place was too high for some organizations to participate in the  planning process. For example, Florida state highway officials held a  safety summit in Orlando because it is in the center of the state and added  a second summit in Miami after some potential stakeholders said that  travel costs would be too high for them to participate in the Orlando  summit.", "The integrated approach to safety that brought highway safety  stakeholders together in a joint planning process was the most important  outcome of the program changes attributable to SAFETEA-LU, according  to FHWA officials. Highway safety transportation officials in the six states  we visited agreed that safety planning efforts improved because increased  multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement led to the development of  strategic highway safety plans that encompassed a wide array of safety  strategies and included approaches that have not traditionally been  associated with HSIP. This new planning process helped break down the  separation between engineering and behavioral programs that occurred  when FHWA and state highway departments focused exclusively on  highway construction projects, while NHTSA and FMCSA and their  grantees were responsible for education and enforcement projects that  addressed behavioral issues, such as impaired driving or violations of  safety regulations for commercial drivers and vehicles. The new planning  process also encouraged coordination among the DOT safety agencies  through information sharing and interdisciplinary safety programs. For  example, 21 of the 25 state strategic plans we reviewed cited the  participation of NHTSA and FMCSA officials. State safety officials in  California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania said that the requirements since  SAFETEA-LU served as the catalyst for such involvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Defined Safety Emphasis Areas through Crash Data Analysis and Built on Prior Safety Planning Efforts to Develop Their Strategic Highway Safety Plans", "paragraphs": ["In working with stakeholders to develop their strategic highway safety  plans, states defined safety emphasis areas by analyzing data on crashes  that resulted in fatalities and serious injuries, as required since SAFETEA- LU. According to our reviews of 25 strategic plans, states typically used  data on the types and causes of fatal and serious crashes to help  stakeholders identify safety areas to emphasize in their state strategic  highway safety plans. Previously, states had used data from all crashes to  establish highway safety program priorities, but they had not focused on  crashes resulting in fatalities and serious injuries.", "In analyzing their fatality and serious injury data, states often followed a  preexisting comprehensive safety planning approach created by the  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  (AASHTO). This multidisciplinary approach, built around guidance  published by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program,  identified \u201csafety emphasis\u201d areas, including seat belt use, heavy trucks,  head-on collisions, and rural emergency medical services. In a guide  issued in 1997 and updated in 2004, AASHTO described how a state could  organize its planning process, and some states had used the guide to  develop comprehensive highway safety plans before SAFETEA-LU was  enacted in August 2005. Eighteen of the 25 state plans we reviewed used  AASHTO\u2019s list of safety emphasis areas, but some plans also included  areas of unique importance to the state. The 7 states that did not directly  use AASHTO\u2019s list in their planning picked emphasis areas that were  similar.

Almost all of the 25 state strategic highway safety plans we  reviewed included strategies to reduce safety hazards and identified  programs of projects to address all 3 aspects of highway safety. For  example, all 25 of the state plans called for infrastructure improvements,  such as installing rumble strips or cable median barriers on roadways to  help keep drivers on the roadway and to reduce head-on collisions (see   fig. 4). All 25 plans also identified potential behavioral projects, such as  projects to enforce seat belt laws or speed limits or provide education to  reduce driving under the influence (DUI). Twenty-two of the 25 plans  included some emergency medical services projects, either within its own  or another emphasis area. These projects ranged from decreasing accident  response times to improving medical outcomes data.", "In the 25 state plans we reviewed, the safety emphasis areas identified by  stakeholders frequently did not include rail-highway crossings or high-risk  rural roads, and projects that could be funded through the 2 set-aside  programs within HSIP were also not typically identified as high priorities.  For example, about two-thirds of the state strategic plans we reviewed   (17 of 25), did not identify improvements to rail-highway crossings in their  strategic highway safety plans as a key safety emphasis area. According to  some state department of transportation officials we interviewed, rail- highway crossings were not included as safety emphasis areas because  few fatalities were associated with these areas.", "Similarly, state strategic highway safety plans did not specifically include  high-risk rural roads as a safety emphasis area or high-risk rural road  projects within an emphasis area. Many plans identified projects that  could be applicable to improving rural road safety, such as DUI programs  or efforts to minimize the frequency and consequences of roadway  departures. However, only one plan, from Indiana, included high-risk rural  roads as an emphasis area. Furthermore, although 18 of the 25 plans we  reviewed identified rural roads among the hazardous locations in the state  in their 5 percent reports, these locations may not meet SAFETEA-LU\u2019s  definition of high-risk rural roads\u2014that is, rural major and minor  collectors or rural, locally owned roads where the rates of fatalities and  incapacitating injuries exceed, or are expected to exceed, the statewide  averages. According to state department of transportation officials we  interviewed in 5 of the 6 states we visited, it was difficult to identify  potential high-risk rural road projects, in part because states often had  limited data on locally owned roads. As a result, states did not develop an  overall list prioritizing hazardous locations on high-risk rural roads. Some  states that lacked crash data for locally owned rural roads had to rely on  local governments\u2019 road safety audits or anecdotal information to identify  hazardous locations and propose projects for their high-risk rural roads.", "Since SAFETEA-LU, states have been required to evaluate their HSIP  programs and projects by establishing strategic and performance-based  goals, such as an overall fatality-reduction goal, and measuring their  program or project performance against those goals. All 25 of the state  plans we reviewed identified an overall state fatality-reduction goal. In  addition, 13 of these plans also established goals for the specific emphasis  areas described in their plan. For example, California\u2019s strategic plan has  an emphasis area goal of reducing annual impaired driving fatalities by   15 percent through activities such as driver education and enforcement.  This reduction, combined with the goals for the other emphasis areas in  the strategic plan, is designed to meet the statewide fatality-reduction goal.

In our visits to states, state safety  engineers particularly emphasized the importance of behavioral  approaches to safety, explaining that engineering solutions cannot by  themselves address problems such as impaired or aggressive driving, and  that the most effective remedies for these hazards would be those  addressing driver behaviors, rather than improving infrastructure.", "Although the states\u2019 strategic highway safety plans indicate substantial  interest in implementing behavioral and emergency medical services  projects, as of June 2008, FHWA had approved certifications from seven  states that their infrastructure needs had been met, enabling those states  to flex up to 10 percent of their HSIP funding for behavioral and  emergency medical services projects. Collectively, these seven states plan  to use approximately $13 million for such projects (see table 1).", "Other states are not using HSIP funds to implement behavioral and  emergency medical services projects and may be reluctant to do so, in part  because of the certification requirement. For example, although none of  the six states we visited has requested approval to flex HSIP funds,  officials in two of those states did express interest in doing so. However,  these officials noted that their states could not meet the certification  requirements because of ongoing infrastructure needs and concerns about  the potential legal liability a state could incur by certifying that all of its  infrastructure safety needs have been met. Officials in the other states we  visited agreed that certification would be difficult, but these officials did  not express interest in flexing funds because they had enough  infrastructure projects to use all of the available HSIP funds.", "The 10 percent limit on flexing HSIP funds for behavioral or emergency  medical services projects may also be problematic for some states. For  example, a California official questioned the 10 percent limit, suggesting  that the level of funding a state flexes should be based on the state\u2019s  determination of program needs. Of the seven states approved to flex HSIP  funds, five requested approval to flex 10 percent of their HSIP  apportionment, which is the maximum percentage allowed under the  program. These states\u2019 decisions to flex the maximum allowable  percentage may indicate the high value they place on behavioral or  emergency medical services projects in addressing their highway safety  priorities.

As a result, federal safety dollars may not be aligned with the  priorities states identified in their strategic highway safety plans and may  not target the most effective types of safety projects.

SAFETEA-LU authorized a set-aside of $220 million per year for  this program from HSIP funds and allocates these funds among the states  according to a formula that is based, in part, on the number of rail-highway  crossings in each state. About two-thirds of the 25 state plans we reviewed  (17 of 25) did not identify improvements to rail-highway crossings in their  strategic highway safety plans as a key safety emphasis area. Officials in  two of the six states we visited said funding for crossing set-asides is  unnecessarily large, and they questioned the appropriateness of setting  aside such a large amount of HSIP funding for a program that addresses  the cause of less than 1 percent of fatalities. For example, state  transportation officials in Iowa noted that 20 percent of the nation\u2019s HSIP  funds are directed to crossing safety, but these officials said crossing  improvement is a low-priority area for the state in its strategic highway  safety plan. FHWA officials also indicated to us that the level of funding  for the rail-highway crossing program was disproportionately high, given  the number of fatalities and accidents nationally. Additionally, in preparing  their 5 percent reports, states generally did not report crossings as top  hazards. For example, in our review of the 5 percent reports for 25 states,  we found 1 state\u2014Oregon\u2014that included a crossing on its list of top  hazardous locations, indicating that these locations are not high priorities  for most states.", "Rail-highway crossing projects generally produced limited safety benefits,  such as reducing crashes and fatalities, according to our analysis of  project evaluations from 25 states.

Almost all of the improved locations in 15 of these   21 states showed zero incidents both before and after the improvement.  For example, in its 2007 report, the state of Washington reported no  fatalities in the 3 years before and in the 3 years after the completion of  the 12 crossing projects completed in 2003. Furthermore, in the few states,  such as Delaware, that reported benefit-cost ratios for crossing projects,  ratios were consistently less than one, reflecting infrequent incidents and  benefits too low to justify costs.", "Nevertheless, other states prioritized rail-highway crossing safety in their  strategic highway safety plans because they have determined that crossing  safety projects are effective in improving overall highway safety. About  one-third of the plans we reviewed (8 of 25) identified crossings as a key  emphasis area. For example, Indiana, a state with approximately   4,800 miles of railroad track, emphasized rail-highway crossings in its  strategic highway safety plan, noting that collisions involving vehicles and  trains are more likely to result in fatalities and serious injuries than  collisions involving 2 or more motor vehicles. In its fiscal year 2007 rail- highway crossing program report, Indiana noted that at 67 locations where  crossing projects were completed during 2002 and 2003, 5 crashes that  resulted in fatalities or injuries occurred in the 3 years before the  improvements were made, whereas 2 crashes that resulted in injuries\u2014 and no fatalities\u2014occurred in the 3 years after improvements were made.  In addition, 2 of the 6 states we visited, Mississippi and Illinois, have used  state money to augment federal funds for crossing safety. Specifically, in  2001 and 2003 Mississippi put a total of $8 million of state money into  crossing upgrades in addition to federal funding of $3.3 million for such  upgrades. Illinois, in recent years, has programmed $27 million per year of  state funds to rail safety (including crossings and grade separations), in  addition to the $10 million provided by the federal government through the  crossing program. Additionally, in our review of state rail-highway  crossing reports, we found 1 state, Ohio, that reported crossings were  significantly less dangerous following improvement projects, according to  the state\u2019s assessment of crash risk. Finally, FRA officials noted that  crossing safety is particularly important for those states and communities  with a large proportion of crossings and train traffic, noting that accidents  at crossings can be catastrophic.", "While the rail-highway crossing set-aside program, as implemented under  SAFETEA-LU, required that all of this program\u2019s funding be spent on rail- highway crossing projects, the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act  amended the law to allow states to use rail-highway crossing set-aside  funds for other types of HSIP projects if they certify that they have met all  of their rail crossing needs. In its July 2008 reform proposal, DOT called  for funding rail-highway crossing projects in accordance with each state\u2019s  strategic highway safety plan, without a specific set-aside, or for reducing  the mandatory rail-highway set-aside. While the impact of the recent  technical correction in the law remains to be seen, some states may be  reluctant to certify that they have met all of their rail-highway crossing  needs or they may have legal concerns about the potential liabilities of  such a certification, just as some states were reluctant to make use of  HSIP\u2019s flexible funding provision for those reasons."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "High-Risk Rural Road Program Is Too Recent to Evaluate Results, but Data Limitations and Localities\u2019 Inexperience Are Hindering Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Most states are in the early stages of implementing the high-risk rural road  set-aside program and have yet to obligate significant funds for projects.

Of these   23 states, 16 had already identified projects and approved, funded, or  contracted for at least one infrastructure project, and 7 were still  identifying potential projects, gathering data, or performing other  preliminary activities. Obligations made to date are low because states  remain in the early stages of implementing the program. As of the end of  June 2008, states had obligated $50.3 million, or about 19 percent of the  $270 million authorized by FHWA for the high-risk rural road program  through that period.

For example,  according to our review of 25 state strategic highway safety plans and  reports on the program, few states reported having roadway inventory  data for all public roads (3 of 25) or complete, high-quality crash data for  rural roads (5 of 25), leaving a significant number of states without data on  rural roads and, therefore, without the means to effectively implement the  program. Additionally, officials in 5 of the 6 states we visited noted that  limitations in their crash location and roadway characteristics data made it  difficult for them to identify qualifying roadways and appropriate  remedies.", "Even when data are available, the program may be challenging for states  to implement because of difficulties in analyzing those data. Some state  officials we interviewed said that selecting candidate projects on the basis  of data analysis was challenging because specific locations on rural roads  tend to have lower traffic volumes and few crashes, fatalities, and  incapacitating injuries, even though higher numbers of fatalities happen on  rural roads in general. Consequently, it is difficult for safety engineers and  planners to determine which specific roadway segments, intersections, or  other areas are most in need of improvement. For example, state officials  in Iowa noted that many rural road projects would not be selected on the  basis of crash frequency data and, consequently, other selection criteria,  such as input from local transportation officials, are necessary to pick  locations for improvements in rural areas.", "Additionally, implementing projects on roads that are not owned by the  state may be challenging because administering improvement projects can  be difficult for local governments. Because many of the roadways targeted  by the high-risk rural road program are locally owned and managed, local  agencies need to be involved in implementing projects on those roads.  However, according to a recent FHWA study, local agencies may not have  much experience in managing federal-aid highway contracts.

The booklet recommended  several detailed steps to prepare for developing the plans, including steps  designed to encourage coordination, such as the following:    become familiar with existing safety plans developed for programs funded  by NHTSA and FMCSA, plus plans developed by statewide and  metropolitan planning agencies;   establish a working group to guide the development of the strategic plan;    bring safety partners together at a safety summit to share safety priorities  and discuss critical safety issues.", "FHWA division staff worked closely with the states to help them carry out  their HSIP planning processes. For example, we found FHWA staff listed  among the state planning partners in all 25 of the strategic highway safety  plans that we reviewed. In the six states we visited, FHWA division  officials helped arrange for planning summits to be held, and, in two of the  six states, FHWA staff encouraged highway safety stakeholders to attend.  In Pennsylvania, the FHWA division office helped pay for the safety  summit. In Illinois, FHWA officials helped the state establish a state safety  engineering office. Without that office, compliance with new HSIP  requirements would have been difficult, according to FHWA division  officials. The FHWA division also helped with a summit and two planning  workshops.", "In all six states we visited, FHWA division officials were, to varying  degrees, involved in states\u2019 strategic highway safety planning processes\u2014 for example, by attending safety summit meetings, working on planning  committees for state strategic planning committees, facilitating meetings,  and clarifying FHWA policies and requirements. State officials in every  state we visited indicated that FHWA officials were highly instrumental  and played an important role in providing guidance and assistance during  the development of their strategic highway safety plans. In addition, in all  50 states, FHWA division offices were responsible for reviewing strategic  highway safety plans to assess the planning process and the completeness  of state plans, including whether the states\u2019 data systems covered all  public roads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHWA Gave States Latitude on the Methodology and Scope of Their 5 Percent Reports, Limiting the Reports\u2019 Usefulness in Increasing Public Awareness", "paragraphs": ["In its guidance on the 5 percent report, FHWA gave states broad latitude in  meeting this new reporting requirement. SAFETEA-LU did not specify  criteria or a methodology for states to use in defining the hazardous  locations (e.g., the universe of roads that would be used to select the  locations and the definition of severe or hazardous safety needs) or  determining the exact percentage of hazardous locations states should  identify\u2014beyond specifying that the report should include \u201cat least five  percent\u201d of the most severe hazardous locations in the state\u2014nor did the  legislation include a prescribed format for the 5 percent reports, except to  say that the report must be \u201cclearly understandable.\u201d FHWA officials told  us that, consistent with the changes made by SAFETEA-LU, they did not  define a methodology and left it to the states to set criteria for selecting  locations. Also, as we previously mentioned, FHWA recognized that states\u2019  data varied greatly and that many states lacked data, particularly on local  roads. The guidance instructed states to work with the crash location data  they had and to submit 5 percent reports with an explanation of the data  limitations and a schedule for achieving full coverage of all roads. In   May 2007, to identify and share best practices, FHWA distributed  information on noteworthy practices and examples, based on its analysis  of the 5 percent reports received in 2006. This information contained  suggestions for organizing a 5 percent report, but did not specify a  methodology for states to use in identifying and reporting on the most  severe hazardous locations.", "Consequently, the 5 percent reports submitted to FHWA to date vary  widely in the criteria and methodologies used for selecting the most severe  hazardous locations and, thus, the number of locations reported, the  information included, and the format for presenting the information. First,  states used markedly different definitions of the universe of roads from  which they selected their hazardous locations\u2014some states reported on   5 percent of a large set of roadway locations (e.g., any public road with a  crash involving a fatality or serious injury) and other states reported on   5 percent of a much smaller set of roadway locations (e.g., locations the  state had defined as the \u201cmost hazardous\u201d). As a result of these differing  methodologies, states varied widely in the actual number of hazardous  locations described in their 5 percent reports. For example, according to  FHWA\u2019s review of the 5 percent reports submitted by 50 states and the  District of Columbia in 2006, the number of locations reported per state  ranged from 1 to more than 3,200. Similarly, our review of 25 states\u2019   5 percent reports submitted in 2007 indicates that the variations in  reporting have continued, with the number of locations reported per state  ranging from 5 to 880.", "Second, the information included in 5 percent reports we reviewed also  varied. For example, some reports included remedies and costs for each  hazardous location, as required, while others showed remedies and costs  only for certain locations or for none at all. Third, states also used  different formats to identify the hazardous locations they listed in their   5 percent reports, and some formats may not be meaningful or readily  understandable to the public. For example, the public may find it difficult  to identify a hazardous location when it is identified in the report by the  roadway mile marker, as is done in several reports we reviewed. Given  these differences in format\u2014as well as the differences in methodology and  information included\u2014the 5 percent reports may not be providing  consistent information to the public and fully serving their purpose of  raising public awareness of highway safety hazards and needs, as specified  in SAFETEA-LU and FHWA\u2019s guidance.", "According to FHWA officials, DOT proposed eliminating the 5 percent  report requirement in its July 2008 surface transportation reform proposal  because the department believed that sufficient and more useful  information would exist through the publication of states\u2019 strategic  highway safety plans and HSIP annual reports. Those officials told us that  HSIP\u2019s strategic plans and annual reports provide a more comprehensive  and consistent summary of safety challenges facing the states\u2014and, thus,  offer more promise in contributing to public awareness of safety issues\u2014 than the 5 percent report.

The action plan was to provide more  detailed information about safety programs and projects than the strategic  highway safety plan, describe how programs and projects should be  coordinated and implemented, designate leadership responsibilities for  implementation, and specify funding sources.

The action  plan could be developed with multiagency involvement and could address the implementation of all related DOT safety projects within a specific  emphasis area identified in the strategic highway safety plan, rather than  within a specific DOT safety program. Two of the six states we visited  were developing or had completed action plans. Mississippi is developing  multiagency action plans for the safety emphasis areas within its strate highway safety plan. These action plans describe the expected  effectiveness of proposed projects and identify project costs, keys to  success, any state legislative actions needed, and the lead state  implementing the proposed projects. In April 2008, California officials  completed a formal strategic highway safety action plan based on  collaborative work by seven state safety agencies, including the state  department of transportation, the office responsible for NHTSA safety  grant programs, and the office responsible for FMCSA programs.", "In implementing strategic highway safety plans, FHWA, NHTSA, a FMCSA and their grantees coordinate and collaborate informally when  s we  they have no formal implementation agreements, according to official ay  interviewed from those three agencies. Even though the strategic highw safety plans must consider a comprehensive set of potential approaches to  improve highway safety, only the HSIP funds administered by FHWA must  be spent in accordance with this plan. Nevertheless, both NHTSA and  FMCSA have encouraged their field office staff and grantees to support the  implementation of state strategic highway safety plans through their  respective agencies\u2019 highway safety plans and commercial vehicle safety  plans. For example, although NHTSA has not issued comprehensive  guidance to states on the relationship of the strategic highway safety plan to NHTSA programs, a NHTSA official told us that, in some cases, sta officials responsible for implementing NHTSA programs use the strategic  highway safety plan as a basis for setting their program priorities.  Likewise, according to an FMCSA official, in states that included motor  carrier safety issues in their strategic highway safety plan, FMCSA  program stakeholders also use the state\u2019s strategic highway safety plan t further their programmatic goals. This coordination occurs naturall states, such as Florida and Pennsylvania, where the same officials are  responsible both for planning behavioral projects funded by NHTSA  programs and for implementing HSIP projects. In other states where th s  functions are in different offices, such as California and Iowa, official responsible for behavioral projects held key leadership positions in the  development of the state\u2019s strategic highway safety plan. However, the  nature and extent of this coordination depends on the state, and there is no federal requirement to encourage it. DOT, in its July 2008 surface  transportation reform proposal, called for states to submit their NHTSA  grant applications in conjunction with their strategic highway safety plans  ese  to better ensure coordination.

Although  FHWA expects every state to have the crash location data and a system to  locate crashes on all public roads by August 2009, many states will likely  take longer to obtain the roadway inventory data needed to identify  remedies for hazardous locations and to estimate the costs of those  remedies, as required. FHWA has not set a deadline for states to obtain  these data, nor has it required states to submit schedules to FHWA for  achieving compliance with this requirement. To this end, FHWA has taken  a first step by proposing a large set of potential roadway inventory data  elements in its MMIRE. However, the agency has yet to specify which of  these proposed elements are essential to address HSIP\u2019s requirements for  analysis of hazardous locations on all public roads. Implementing a data- driven project selection process is critical because it provides a fact-based  approach for identifying and ranking safety priorities and demonstrating to  the public that states are using public funds effectively to address their  highest safety priorities. While states have estimated that the costs of  complying fully with the law\u2019s data requirements may be high, SAFETEA- LU significantly increased states\u2019 authorized HSIP funding and placed no  limit on the percentage of HSIP safety construction funds that the states  can use to address data deficiencies.", "While SAFETEA-LU added requirements for states to develop and  implement strategic highway safety plans that consider a wide range of  approaches to improving highway safety, states have limited flexibility to  match funds to their safety priorities. For example, the restrictions on  using HSIP funds for noninfrastructure remedies\u2014including the  requirement for certifying that all highway safety infrastructure needs  have been met before flexing HSIP funds to noninfrastructure projects\u2014 may preclude some states from using these funds for high-priority  behavioral or emergency medical services projects that the states\u2019 data  indicate could save more lives, because of states\u2019 ongoing infrastructure  needs and concerns about the potential legal liability of making such a  certification. Conversely, the requirement to set aside funds for rail- highway crossing improvements may lead states, in some cases, to apply  HSIP funds to projects that have a low priority in those states\u2019 strategic  highway safety plans. Both of these funding restrictions have limited the  ability of some states to implement the full complement of approaches  described in their strategic highway safety plans and to fully achieve the  goal of using data to identify and select projects that best address their  highway safety priorities.", "Based on our work and FHWA\u2019s analysis, the quality and usefulness of the  5 percent reports that states have submitted to FHWA is questionable  because of data and other limitations.
