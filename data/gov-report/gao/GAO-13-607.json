Because of their relatively high losses and lower premium rates, subsidized policies have been a financial burden on the program. Due to NFIP's financial instability and operating and management challenges, GAO placed the program on its high-risk list in 2006. The Biggert-Waters Act eliminated subsidized rates on certain properties and mandated GAO to study the remaining subsidized properties. This report examines (1) the number, location, and characteristics of properties that continue to receive subsidized rates compared with full-risk rate properties; (2) the information needed to estimate the historic cost of subsidies and establish rates for previously subsidized policies that reflect the risk of flooding; and (3) options to reduce the financial impact of remaining subsidized policies.

Depending on factors such as policyholder behavior, the number of subsidized policies will continue to decline over time. For example, as properties are sold and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resolves data limitations and defines key terms, more subsidies will be eliminated. GAO analysis found that remaining subsidized policies would cover properties in every state and territory where NFIP operates, with the highest numbers in Florida, Louisiana, and California. In comparing remaining subsidized and nonsubsidized policies GAO found varying characteristics. For example, counties with the highest and lower home values had a larger percentage of subsidized versus nonsubsidized policies.", "Data constraints limit FEMA's ability to estimate the aggregate cost of subsidies and establish rates reflecting actual flood risks on previously subsidized policies. FEMA does not have sufficient historical program data on the percentage of full-risk rates that subsidized policyholders have paid to estimate the financial impact--in terms of the difference between subsidized and full-risk premium rates--to NFIP of subsidies. Also, because not all policyholders are required to provide documentation about their flood risk, FEMA generally lacks information needed to apply full-risk rates (as required by the Biggert-Waters Act) on previously subsidized policies. FEMA is encouraging these policyholders to voluntarily submit this documentation. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should identify and analyze risks associated with achieving program objectives and develop a plan for obtaining needed data. Without this documentation, the new rates may not accurately reflect a property's full flood risk, and policyholders may be charged rates that are too high or too low relative to their risk of flooding.", "Options from GAO's previous and current work for reducing the financial impact of subsidies on NFIP include (1) adjusting the pace of subsidy elimination, (2) targeting assistance or subsidies based on financial need, or (3) increasing mitigation efforts, such as relocation or elevation that reduce a property's flood risk. However, these options have advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the options are not mutually exclusive, and combining them could help offset some disadvantages.FEMA should develop and implement a plan to obtain flood risk information needed to determine full-risk rates for properties with previously subsidized rates.

The National Flood Insurance  Act of 1968 authorized subsidized rates to encourage participation in  NFIP, especially for properties in high-risk locations that otherwise would  have been charged higher premiums and were built before Flood  Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) became available and the level of risk was  clearly understood. The discounted premiums help achieve the goal of  promoting participation in the program, but do not contribute sufficient  revenues to cover potential losses. We have previously found that  because of their relatively high losses and lower premium rates compared  with policies that are charged rates intended to reflect the actual risk of  flooding (full-risk rates), the policies receiving subsidized rates have been  a financial burden on NFIP.", "Since 2000, NFIP has experienced several years with catastrophic  losses\u2014losses exceeding $1 billion\u2014and has needed to borrow money  from the U.S. Treasury (Treasury) to cover claims in some years.

As of May 2013,  FEMA owed Treasury $24 billion\u2014up from $17.8 billion prior to  Superstorm Sandy\u2014and had not repaid any principal on its loans since  2010. As a result of the program\u2019s importance, level of indebtedness to  Treasury, substantial financial exposure for the federal government and  taxpayers, and FEMA\u2019s management challenges, NFIP has been on our  high-risk list since 2006.

We used the data and information from FEMA officials about their plans  to implement the Biggert-Waters Act to determine which policies would  retain subsidized rates. We determined the number, location, and  coverage amounts of these remaining subsidized policies, the claims and  premiums attributable to them, and the historic frequency with which they  exited the program. For requested information on the financial  characteristics of policies that was not available from FEMA, we used  indicators from publicly available census and real estate data as well as  NFIP policy-level coverage amount data. We used these data to analyze  the similarities and differences in the financial characteristics of properties  with subsidized and full-risk rates. For example, we ranked nationwide  county-level median home value and median household income from the  2007 through 2011 5-year American Community Survey (ACS)\u2014a  continuous survey of households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.We determined the relative ranking for counties with large numbers of  remaining subsidized policies. We also selected five case study counties  to illustrate similarities and differences in characteristics of policies at the  city level within these counties. Results from these case studies cannot  be projected nationwide. We selected the counties based on the number  of relevant NFIP policies, location, and reliability of publicly available real  estate data for the county. We also used the publicly available real estate  data on median home values for cities in these counties. We assessed  the reliability of each data source we used by interviewing agency officials  and gathering and analyzing available information about how the data  were collected and maintained and performed electronic tests of required  data elements. We also spoke with representatives from a private  company that collects and estimates data on real estate values as well as  with an academic and other users of these publicly available real estate  data about the reliability of the data. We determined that the data from  each source we used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We analyzed NFIP\u2019s legislative history and relied on FEMA\u2019s  interpretation and implementation of legislative requirements authorizing  subsidized rates for certain properties in high-risk locations.

Premium subsidies were seen as a way to  achieve the program\u2019s objectives by ensuring that owners of existing  properties in flood zones could afford flood insurance. NFIP has three  components: (1) the provision of flood insurance; (2) the requirement that  participating communities adopt and enforce floodplain management  regulations; and (3) the identification and mapping of floodplains.  Community participation in NFIP is voluntary. However, communities  must join NFIP and adopt FEMA-approved building standards and  floodplain management strategies in order for their residents to purchase  flood insurance through the program. Additionally, communities with  Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)\u2014areas at high risk for flooding\u2014 must participate in NFIP to be eligible for any form of disaster assistance  loans or grants for acquisition or construction purposes in connection with  a flood. Participating communities can receive discounts on flood  insurance if they establish floodplain management programs that go  beyond the minimum requirements of NFIP. FEMA can suspend  communities that do not comply with the program, and communities can  withdraw from the program. As of May 2013, about 22,000 communities  voluntarily participate in NFIP.", "Potential policyholders can purchase flood insurance that covers both  buildings and contents for residential and commercial properties.

Areas with a moderate-to-low risk for  flooding are designated as zones B, C, or X. Areas where analysis of the  flood risk has not been conducted are designated as D zones.", "NFIP offers two types of flood insurance premiums: subsidized and full- risk. Subsidized rates are not based on actual flood risk. According to  FEMA, subsidized rates represent only about 40 percent to 45 percent of  rates that reflect full flood risk. (We discuss how FEMA determines rates  in more detail later in this report.) The type of policy and the subsequent  rate a policyholder pays depend on several property characteristics\u2014for  example, whether the structure was built before or after a community\u2019s  FIRM had been issued and the location of the structure in the floodplain.  Structures built after a community\u2019s FIRM was published must be built to  meet FEMA building standards and pay full-risk rates. Some communities  may implement activities that exceed the minimum standards.", "Prior to the Biggert-Waters Act, subsidized policies accounted for about  21 percent of all NFIP policies, while those with full-risk premiums  accounted for the remaining 79 percent. While the percentage of  subsidized policies has decreased since the program was established,  the number of these policies has stayed fairly constant (see fig. 1).", "As communities were mapped and joined NFIP, new subsidized policies  were added. As shown in figure 2, the percentage change in subsidized  policies generally followed the same trend as the percentage change in  total policies.", "Even with highly discounted rates, subsidized premiums are, on average,  higher than full-risk premiums. The premiums are higher because  subsidized pre-FIRM structures generally are more prone to flooding (that  is, riskier) than other structures. In general, pre-FIRM properties were not  constructed according to the program\u2019s building standards or were built  without regard to base flood elevation\u2014the level relative to mean sea  level at which there is a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in a given  year. For example, the average annual subsidized premium with October  2011 rates for pre-FIRM subsidized properties located in zone A was  about $1,200, while the average annual premium for post-FIRM  properties in the same zone paying full-risk rates was about $500.

Congress also  authorized the use of subsidized premiums because charging rates that  fully and accurately reflected flood risk would be a burden to some  property owners. Table 2 shows the sources of legislative authority for  various subsidized premium rates.", "Since NFIP was established, Congress has enacted legislation to  strengthen certain aspects of the program. The Flood Disaster Protection  Act of 1973 made the purchase of flood insurance mandatory for  properties in SFHAs that are secured by mortgages from federally  regulated lenders. This requirement expanded the overall number of  insured properties, including those that qualified for subsidized premiums.  The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 expanded the  purchase requirement for federally backed mortgages on properties  located in an SFHA.

Nearly all subsidized policies for primary residential properties  continue to have subsidized rates. Figure 3 summarizes our analysis of  the immediate decreases in subsidized policies stemming from the act, by  property type.", "Subsidies on most of the approximately 715,000 remaining subsidized  policies should be eliminated over time. Under provisions of the Biggert- Waters Act, most policies no longer qualify for subsidies if NFIP coverage  lapsed or the properties were sold or substantially damaged. We  estimated that with implementation of the changes in the act addressing  sales and coverage lapses, the number of subsidized policies could  decline by almost 14 percent per year (see fig. 4). At this rate, the number  of subsidized policies would be reduced by 50 percent in approximately 5  years. After about 14 years, fewer than 100,000 subsidized policies would  remain. We based our estimate of the annual decline rate on the average  experience of the last 10 years of NFIP data using policies with similar  characteristics, but the actual outcomes and time required for subsidies to  be reduced could vary. For example, the average annual decline rate for  the most recent 3 years of NFIP data was about 11 percent. At this rate,  the number of subsidized policies would be reduced by 50 percent in  approximately 7 years, and after 18 years, fewer than 100,000 subsidized  policies would remain. Additionally, changes from the act may affect the  behavior of policyholders. For example, policyholders might not allow  their coverage to lapse if they knew that they would lose their subsidy or  they might not be able to sell their properties at the same rate if the flood  insurance was more expensive.", "The Biggert-Waters Act will likely require several years for FEMA to fully  implement. FEMA officials acknowledged that they have data limitations  and other issues to resolve before eliminating some subsidies. We  projected that subsidies on most of the policies required to be eliminated  by the act could be identified in FEMA\u2019s data; however, data limitations  make implementation of some provisions of the act more difficult. For  example, the act eliminated subsidies for residential policies that covered  nonprimary residences. FEMA has data on whether a policy covers a  primary residence but officials stated that it may be outdated or incorrect.  In the past, FEMA did not collect this information for policy renewal so it  may have changed over time. The act also eliminated subsidies for  business policies. However, FEMA categorizes policies as residential and  nonresidential rather than residential and business. As a result, FEMA  does not have the information to identify nonresidential properties, such  as schools or churches that are not businesses and continue to qualify for  a subsidy. Beginning in October 2013, FEMA will require applicants to  provide residential and business status for new policies and renewals.", "Additionally, the act states that subsidies will be eliminated for policies  that have received cumulative payment amounts for flood-related damage  that equaled or exceeded the fair market value of the property, and for  policies that experience damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market  value of the property after enactment. Currently, FEMA is unable to make  this determination as it does not maintain data on the fair market value of  properties insured by subsidized policies. FEMA officials said that they  are in the process of identifying a data source.", "FEMA will have to determine how to apply certain provisions of the  Biggert-Waters Act before eliminating some subsidies. For example, the  act eliminates subsidies for severe repetitive loss policies and provides a  definition of severe repetitive loss for single-family homes. However, it  requires FEMA to define severe repetitive loss for multifamily properties.  FEMA has not yet developed this definition and we estimate that 1,000  multifamily severe repetitive loss policies will continue to receive a  subsidy until the definition is developed and applied. The act also  eliminates subsidies when properties are purchased. However, FEMA  has not yet determined how to apply this provision of the act to  condominium associations. Finally, FEMA officials stated that they have  been applying the provisions of the act that eliminate subsidies only to  pre-FIRM policies.

Also, a  larger percentage of remaining subsidized policies had less than  $100,000 in building coverage than nonsubsidized policies (26 percent  versus 8 percent). The results of our comparison of coverage amounts  could indicate that the subsidized policies were for lower-valued  properties, but the perceived flood risk and cost of coverage also could  affect the coverage amount.

We analyzed the data  to determine relative ranking of the 351 selected counties relative to all  counties and compared the number and percentage of properties that  would continue to receive subsidized rates with properties charged full- risk rates. In general, most of all of the policies in our analysis were in  counties with higher median household income (deciles 1-4), with fewer  policies in the counties with lower median household income counties.  However, counties in the highest and lowest decile in median household  income had higher percentages of remaining subsidized policies than  nonsubsidized policies (see table 5). For example, 19 percent of all  policies in the 351 selected counties were in the highest decile of median  household income. But about 29 percent of the remaining subsidized  policies were in these counties versus about 11 percent of nonsubsidized  policies. One percent of all policies in the selected counties were in the  lowest decile of median household income.

For example,  78 of the 351 selected counties were in the highest decile category for  both median home value and median household income. About 26  percent of remaining subsidized policies were in these counties,  compared with 7 percent of nonsubsidized policies. Selected counties  with higher median household income generally also had higher median  home values, but counties with higher median home values did not  always have higher median incomes.

FEMA officials have  clarified their estimate that 2011 subsidized premiums represented 40  percent to 45 percent of full-risk premium rates, explaining that after  paying for all administrative and other expenses, the remaining  premiums would cover about 40 to 45 percent of the expected  average long-term annual losses.", "Premiums are used to cover not only claims, but also operating  expenses and any debt. According to FEMA officials, 17 percent of  forgone premiums would be needed to pay operating expenses that  would increase if subsidized premiums were increased. Such  expenses consist of premium taxes (about 2 to 2.5 percent of  premium) and agents\u2019 commissions associated with the private  insurance companies that sell and service NFIP policies (about 15  percent of premium). Therefore, about 83 percent would be available  to help cover fixed expenses (which do not vary with premiums) and  to pay losses. During years when losses are less than average, the  program potentially generates a surplus. During higher-loss years,  accumulated surplus could be used to help pay the insured flood  losses that exceed that year\u2019s net premium revenue and reduce the  likelihood of needing to borrow from Treasury. Therefore, additional  premiums could have helped offset FEMA\u2019s need to borrow or put the  agency in a better position to manage catastrophic losses or repay its  debt.", "A similar number but higher percentage of policies were subsidized in  the earlier years of the program, therefore, most of the program\u2019s  premium revenue did not reflect the risk of flooding. In 1978 about 76  percent of policies were subsidized compared with about 20 percent  in 2012. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 expanded the use  of premium subsidies to encourage the purchase of flood insurance  and introduced mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements in  SFHAs as a condition of receipt of direct federal and federally related  financial assistance related to the property.

During this period, nearly  every community with a flood hazard joined NFIP, and policies in  force reached 2 million by 1979.", "The percentage of full-risk premiums that policyholders with  subsidized rates paid was also lower than today. When the program  began, NFIP administrators set the subsidized rates on the basis of  what they considered affordable. However, from 1981 through 1986,  FEMA initiated a series of rate increases for all subsidized policies.  The increases were intended to generate premiums at least sufficient  to cover expenses and losses relative to the historical average loss  year when combined with the premiums paid by policyholders with  full-risk rates.

FEMA also uses  elevation certificates as administrative tools. Elevation certificates are  required for some properties, but optional for others. For example,  communities participating in NFIP must obtain the elevation information  for all new and substantially improved structures. In addition, FEMA  requires elevation certificates to determine rates for post-FIRM buildings  located in high-risk areas, the A and V zones.

According to FEMA, they will phase in these increases at 25  percent per year, consistent with the act, for several years until the rates  reach a specific level or until policyholders supply an elevation certificate  that indicates the property\u2019s risk, allowing FEMA to determine the full-risk  rate. If policyholders voluntarily obtain an elevation certificate that shows  that their risk is lower, they may be able to qualify for lower rates or it may  not take as many years of rate increases to reach the full-risk rate.  However, policyholders at higher risks could be subject to even higher  rates. According to FEMA officials, it will take several years for previously  subsidized policies to reach a full-risk rate and the agency will  communicate to policyholders to encourage them to purchase elevation  certificates to determine their actual flood risk. For example, FEMA has  posted information on its website about program changes as a result of  the Biggert-Waters Act and the importance of obtaining elevation  certificates.", "Although subsidized policies have been identified as a risk to the program  because of the financial drain they represent, FEMA does not have a plan  to expeditiously and proactively obtain the information needed to set full- risk rates for all of them. Instead, FEMA will rely on certain policyholders  to voluntarily obtain elevation certificates. Those at lower risk levels have  an incentive to do so because they can qualify for lower rates. However,  policyholders with higher risk levels have a disincentive to voluntarily  obtain an elevation certificate because they could end up paying an even  higher premium. Without a plan to expeditiously obtain property-level  elevation information, FEMA will continue to lack basic information  needed to accurately determine flood risk and will continue to base full- risk rate increases for previously subsidized policies on limited estimates.  As a result, FEMA\u2019s phased-in rates for previously subsidized policies still  may not reflect a property\u2019s full risk of flooding, with some policyholders  paying premiums that are below and others paying premiums that exceed  full-risk rates.

In prior work, we discussed similar options for addressing the  impact of subsidized policies and the work we conducted for this report  confirmed that, with some modifications to reflect the changes from the  Biggert-Waters Act, these were still generally the prevailing options. addition, our previous and current work have shown that each of the  options has advantages and disadvantages in terms of the impact on the  program\u2019s public policy goals and would involve trade-offs that would  have to be weighed. For example, charging premium rates that fully  reflect the risk of flooding could help improve the financial condition of  NFIP and limit taxpayer costs before and after a disaster. However,  eliminating or reducing subsidized policies could have unintended  consequences, such as increasing premium rates to the point that flood  insurance is no longer affordable for some policyholders and potential  declines in program participation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Adjust the Pace of the Elimination of Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["See GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-13-283 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 2013).", "GAO-09-20. where they lived. Stakeholders also noted that the threat of increased  premium rates would encourage some policyholders affected by  Superstorm Sandy to undertake mitigation efforts as they repaired their  properties.", "Although accelerating the elimination of subsidies could strengthen the  financial solvency of the program, it also entails trade-offs and unintended  consequences. For example, according to FEMA estimates, the  elimination of subsidies for pre-FIRM properties would on average more  than double these policyholders\u2019 premium rates, raising concerns about  the affordability of the coverage and participation in the program. Higher  premium rates might result in reduced participation in NFIP over time as  people either decide to drop their policies or are priced out of the market,  according to FEMA officials and insurance industry stakeholders we  interviewed. The 1999 PwC study estimated that, for communities most  likely to experience a decrease in property values if subsidies were  immediately eliminated, on average 50 percent of policyholders might  cancel their coverage. It is too soon to tell the long-term impacts of the  elimination of subsidies that went into effect in 2013. Even reducing,  rather than eliminating, subsidies could increase the financial burden on  some existing policyholders\u2014particularly low-income policyholders\u2014and  could lead to some of them deciding to leave the program. As a result, if  owners of pre-FIRM properties, which have relatively high flood losses,  cancelled their insurance policies, the federal government\u2014and ultimately  taxpayers\u2014could face increased costs in the form of FEMA disaster  assistance grants to these individuals. However, according to a recent  study, a large proportion of disaster assistance is provided to states,  versus directly to individuals, and the assistance provided to individuals  via grants and low-interest loans is fairly limited in size. An additional  trade-off associated with making immediate increases to premium rates is  resistance from local communities. Stakeholders we interviewed further  noted that increased insurance costs might make some properties more  difficult to sell, particularly pre-FIRM properties in older, inland  communities at high risk of flooding.", "Delaying the elimination of subsidized policies could address stakeholder  concerns about the affordability of flood insurance and the time frames in  the Biggert-Waters Act for implementing full-risk rates, but also has trade- offs. For example, while stakeholders we interviewed supported  provisions of the act to reduce the number of subsidized policies and  moving to full-risk rates, they said that the time frames in the act were  aggressive and could be burdensome for low-income policyholders. They  also stated that more gradual increases for certain policyholders could  keep policies more affordable. They noted there have been proposals to  delay the elimination of subsidies and phasing in of full-risk rates.  However, delaying the elimination of subsidies would continue to expose  the federal government to increased financial risk. And, as previously  noted, not charging full-risk rates contributes to FEMA\u2019s ongoing  management challenges in maintaining the financial stability of NFIP.  NFIP has been on our high-risk list since 2006 because of concerns  about its long-term financial solvency and management issues.

This assistance could take several forms, including direct assistance  through NFIP, tax credits, grants, or vouchers. For example, other federal  programs have targeted subsidies through means tests or other methods.  Such an approach could help ensure that those needing the subsidy  would have access to it and retain their coverage. Alternatively,  stakeholders we interviewed for this report noted that FEMA could  replace the subsidies with vouchers based on financial need to offset  higher premiums. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s Housing Choice Voucher program is administered by  public housing agencies that collect information on applicants\u2019 income  and assets to determine eligibility and voucher amounts. flood insurance policyholders could be collected to assess need,  determine eligibility, and provide appropriate amounts of financial  assistance to families that otherwise could not afford their flood insurance  premiums.", "24 C.F.R. Part 982.", "According to industry stakeholders we interviewed, targeting assistance  based on financial need would help make the planned phased-in premium  increases more affordable. In a recent paper on flood insurance  affordability, the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM)  suggested that a flood insurance voucher program could be developed for  low-income policyholders who may not be able to afford the rate  increases or for those who might need time to adjust to premium  increases. ASFPM\u2019s paper also noted that, while the premium rate  increases required by the Biggert-Waters Act will improve the financial  stability of NFIP, those increases could have a significant impact on flood  insurance affordability for low-income policyholders. In particular, the  ASFPM paper states that assistance will be necessary for some  policyholders to help them transition to either full-risk rates, or to mitigate  their properties, otherwise some property owners might not be able to  afford to remain in their homes. Other insurance industry representatives  and stakeholders have also cited affordability concerns and suggested  that as full-risk rates were phased in, assistance for low-income  individuals could be provided through a voucher system or program  based on financial need. A provision of the act requires FEMA to study  NFIP participation and affordability issues, including offering vouchers  based on income. According to FEMA officials, as of May 31, 2013,  FEMA has consulted with the National Academy of Sciences about  determining how to undertake this study.", "As previously discussed, our comparison of characteristics (such as  median income and median home values) associated with remaining  subsidized and nonsubsidized policies indicates that applying full-risk  rates may be overly burdensome for some property owners and not for  others. For example, we found a higher percentage of subsidized policies  in both counties with lower and very high incomes, indicating that in  certain areas, some subsidized policyholders may find higher flood  insurance rates difficult to afford, while those who were located in higher- income areas may be able to afford premium increases.", "However, it could be challenging for FEMA to develop and administer  such an assistance program in the midst of ongoing management  challenges. Specifically, we have previously found that FEMA has faced  significant management challenges in areas that affect NFIP, including  strategic and human capital planning; collaboration among offices; and  record, financial, and acquisition management. In addition, in previous  work we found that FEMA has faced challenges modernizing NFIP\u2019s  insurance policy and claims management system. Implementing a  financial assistance program would require FEMA to plan and develop  new processes. Representatives from a national insurance professional  organization we interviewed for this report stated that it would be difficult  for FEMA to administer an assistance program and ensure that an  evaluation for assistance was done consistently. In addition, they said  that to administer an assistance program such as vouchers, tax credits, or  grants through the Write-Your-Own companies (insurance companies that  sell and service flood insurance for NFIP), a process would be needed to  ensure that means-testing is evaluated and administered consistently.

While the Biggert-Waters Act eliminated subsidies for severe  repetitive loss properties and for prospective policyholders who refuse to  accept any offer for mitigation assistance (including an offer to relocate)  following a major disaster, properties not built to meet a community\u2019s  flood resistant requirements or in the highest-risk zones could face more  severe damages in the event of a flood. Insurance industry stakeholders  agreed that mitigation could be used to reduce future financial risk for  NFIP.", "Stakeholders we spoke to for this report also commented that since such  mitigation measures often are done at the community level, offering  community-based policies could help encourage more mitigation. This is  consistent with our prior work in which local officials generally support  increased mitigation efforts.incorporating community-based flood insurance into NFIP could help  leverage community resources for mitigation projects that would benefit  the entire community, rather than individual structures. For example,  floodplain mangers noted that with a community-based policy, the local  unit of government could assess fees on all properties benefitting from  community mitigation measures. In addition, because the premium rate  would be on a community versus structure basis, the community, not the  property owner, generally would make development or neighborhood-type  decisions that either increased or decreased risk in the community.", "Industry stakeholders also commented that  Disadvantages associated with mitigation as an option to reduce the  financial impact of the subsidized policies include the expense to NFIP,  taxpayers, and communities. For example, implementing mitigation  measures for tens of thousands of properties that continue to receive  subsidized rates could take a number of years to complete, which could  have an on-going risk to NFIP\u2019s financial health. We have previously  reported that increasing mitigation would be costly and require increased  funding. Furthermore, we found in our past and current work that buyouts  and relocations would be more costly in certain areas of the country and  in some cases the cost for mitigating older structures might be prohibitive.  The effectiveness of mitigation efforts could be limited by FEMA\u2019s reliance  on local communities with varying resources. For example, not all  communities have the staff or resources to fully carry out mitigation, meet  cost-sharing requirements, and enforce compliance.", "As we reported in 2008, even when federal funds are made available to a  community and property owners are interested in mitigating their  properties, property owners still may have to pay a portion of the  mitigation expenses, which could discourage participation in mitigation  efforts. In interviews for this report, stakeholders said that mitigation was  expensive and that as premiums are increased to full-risk rates, some  means of assistance would be helpful for policyholders who may have  difficulty paying for mitigation efforts. Mitigation costs would have to be  weighed against mitigation benefits (possible savings from a decrease in  flood damage).", "In addition, certain types of mitigation, such as relocation or demolition,  might be met with resistance by communities that rely on those properties  for tax revenues, such as coastal communities with significant  development in areas prone to flooding. Furthermore, mitigation activities  are often constrained by conflicting local interests, cost concerns, and a  lack of public awareness of the risks of natural hazards and the  importance of mitigation. Communities\u2019 economic interests often can  conflict with long-term hazard mitigation goals. For example, a community  with a goal of economic growth might allow development to occur in  hazard-prone areas (along the coast or in floodplains).", "Our analysis indicates that the three options discussed above are not  mutually exclusive and may be used together to reduce the financial  impact of subsidized policies on NFIP. For example, accelerating the  elimination of subsidies could be done in conjunction with targeting  assistance to only those policyholders who need help to retain their flood  insurance\u2014thus advancing the goal of strengthening the financial  solvency of NFIP and addressing affordability concerns for low-income  policyholders. In addition, FEMA may be able to build on its existing  mitigation efforts and target assistance for mitigation efforts to those  policyholders who need financial assistance.

To phase out and eventually  eliminate subsidies and revise rates over time, FEMA will need  information on the relative risk of flooding and property elevations  (elevation certificates), which generally had not been required for  subsidized policies prior to the Biggert-Waters Act. The act requires  FEMA to phase in full-risk rates on policies that previously received  subsidies. According to federal internal control standards, agencies  should identify and analyze risks associated with achieving program  objectives, and use this information as a basis for developing a plan for  mitigating the risks and obtaining needed information. Going forward,  FEMA will require new policyholders and those whose coverage has  lapsed to provide elevation information when renewing or obtaining new  policies; however, FEMA will rely on other policyholders who previously  received subsidized rates to voluntarily provide this information. As FEMA  continues to implement the requirements of the act to charge full-risk  rates, the agency plans to assume that all subsidized policies pay about  half of the full-risk premium and has begun phasing-in rate increases  based on this factor for all active policies that are having their subsidies  removed. Without a plan to require all policyholders to obtain elevation  certificates to accurately document their property elevations and relative  risk of flooding, FEMA will lack information that is key to determining  appropriate full-risk rate premiums.

We applied the Federal Emergency Management  Agency\u2019s (FEMA) algorithm to determine which policies were subsidized,  and applied FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the provisions in the Biggert-Waters  Act that eliminate subsidies to determine which policies would retain their  subsidies.FEMA\u2019s implementation of legislative requirements authorizing subsidized  rates for certain properties in high-risk locations.", "We also analyzed NFIP\u2019s legislative history and relied on  To determine the fair market value of properties that would continue to  receive subsidized premium rates, we used other NFIP data and publicly  available information as indicators of value because the fair market  values required by the act were not available in NFIP\u2019s databases. We  used three indicators of home value, (1) NFIP policy-level coverage  amounts, (2) 2007 through 2011 5-year American Community Survey  (ACS) county-level data on median home values, and (3) January 2013,  Zillow city-level median home value index within case study counties.", "For consistency in our message, we compared all the indicators at the  county-level. To place NFIP policies in counties, we used ZIP code  information contained in the NFIP policy file as of June 30, 2012, and  matched those data with U.S. Postal Service and Department of Housing  and Urban Development ZIP code to county data (as of December 2011).  For ZIP codes that crossed county borders, we assigned policies  proportionally to the counties based on the fields available in the ZIP code  to county file.", "We aggregated the total number of policies and remaining subsidized  policies for all counties, and selected 351 counties for our analysis that  contained the majority of the policies. We selected all counties with 500 or  more remaining subsidized policies for single-unit, primary residences  (247 counties). We also included the five counties in each state and  Puerto Rico with the most remaining subsidized policies for single-unit  primary residences, regardless of the total number in the county, to better  ensure a comprehensive national representation. Accordingly, the 351  counties we selected represent 78 percent of all remaining subsidized  policies nationwide, 77 percent of all remaining subsidized policies for  single-unit primary residences, and 77 percent of all NFIP policies. As  more than 99 percent of remaining subsidized policies were in Special  Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), we limited our comparison with  nonsubsidized policies to those for single-unit primary residences in  SFHAs.", "We used NFIP policy data as of June 30, 2012, on coverage amounts as  the first indicator of home value. To determine how building coverage  amounts compared between remaining subsidized and nonsubsidized  policies, we categorized NFIP building coverage amounts using less than  $100,000, $100,000-$149,999, $150,000-$199,999, $200,000-$249,999,  and $250,000, which is the maximum coverage for residential units. We  compared the percentage of policies of each type within each category of  coverage at the county level for the selected counties. We also conducted  this analysis using flood zones, comparing the coverage amounts for A- zone and V-zone policies separately. (The A and V flood zones represent  areas at high risk for flooding, and V zones also indicate coastal areas.)  Coverage amount as an indicator for home value is limited because NFIP  has a maximum building coverage amount of $250,000 per residential  unit. Additionally, the perceived flood risk and cost of coverage could  affect the coverage amount. However, coverage amount can give an  indication of a property\u2019s value relative to other properties.", "As a second indicator of home value, we used 2007 through 2011 ACS 5- year county-level estimates for median home values (known as B25077)  for all counties in the United States and also included the District of  Columbia and Puerto Rico. We included Puerto Rico because of its  relatively large number of NFIP policies. We used 5-year data because  other ACS data sets did not contain data for all the 351 selected counties.  Using county median home value, we ranked all counties and determined  the deciles for the 351 selected counties. We compared the percentage of  remaining subsidized with nonsubsidized policies from the selected  counties in each decile. Because these data are at the county level, areas  within the county of relatively high or low home values are  indistinguishable. We also analyzed the ACS and NFIP coverage data  together, at the county level.", "As a third indicator of home value, we used Zillow city-level median home  value data as of January 2013, within five selected counties. For the  purposes of our county case study analysis, we selected the Zillow Home  Value Index because it was publicly available; covered more housing  units at the city level than other housing indices; was estimated at a  smaller geographic region; and only included nonforeclosure housing  units. We judgmentally selected five case study counties and compared  data at the city level within the county to provide more detailed  illustrations of how home values for properties that continue to receive  subsidies compare with those that pay full-risk rates. These cases are not  projectable to all counties. We selected our case study counties based on  the number of relevant NFIP policies, their location, and the reliability of  the data for the county. Specifically, we selected counties with at least  1,000 remaining subsidized policies and nonsubsidized policies for single- unit primary residences. We selected one county from each of the four  states with the most remaining subsidized policies. We selected Pinellas  County, Florida; Los Angeles County, California; and Ocean County, New  Jersey; however, the Zillow data for Louisiana did not meet our level of  reliability and was eliminated. As Pinellas County is on the Gulf of Mexico,  Los Angeles County is on the Pacific Ocean, and Ocean County is on the  Atlantic Ocean, we chose the other two counties to represent inland  flooding\u2014Cook County, Illinois, and Pima County, Arizona. The Zillow  information for these counties met our criteria for data reliability. For each  county, we determined which NFIP policies may be located in the county  based on ZIP code. Because the NFIP city name was not consistently  entered, two analysts independently matched the NFIP policy city names  to Zillow city names within the county. A third analyst served as the  mediator for differences using alternative location information. Within  each county, we ranked the cities by median home value and distributed  them into quartiles. We compared the number and percentage of  remaining subsidized policies with the nonsubsidized policies in the cities  in each quartile. Additionally, for each case study county, we reviewed the  results from the NFIP coverage and ACS analyses within the county.", "Because owner income data were not available in NFIP\u2019s databases, we  analyzed 2007 through 2011 ACS 5-year data as an indicator of income  levels of owners of remaining subsidized properties. We used 5-year,  county-level data on median household incomes (B19013) for all counties  in the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Using the  median household income data, we ranked all counties and determined  the deciles for the 351 selected counties. We compared the percentage of  remaining subsidized policies with nonsubsidized policies in SFHAs from  the selected counties in each decile. Because these data are at the  county level, areas within the county of relatively high or low household  incomes are indistinguishable. We also analyzed the ACS median home  value and median household income data together, at the county level.", "Because consistent, nationwide aggregate data on sales prices for each  property covered by a remaining subsidized pre-Flood Insurance Rate  Map (FIRM) policy since 1968 were not available from NFIP or other  sources, we determined that the home value analysis was sufficiently  similar to provide an indication of sales prices to respond to this study  element.", "We also used NFIP policy fiscal year-end data from 2002 through 2012 to  estimate the potential annual rate of decline in the number of remaining  subsidized policies over time. Consistent, nationwide aggregate data on  sales dates for each pre-FIRM property since 1968 were not available  from NFIP or other sources. We compared sequential years of policy data  to determine whether each policy with the characteristics of a remaining  subsidized policy continued to have coverage. We first matched company  and policy data and if no match was found, matched on owner name. If a  policy in the first year failed to match by either method, we assumed that  the policy no longer had coverage. We estimated the annual rate of  decline for 10 sequential year pairs. We compared our results with a  recent NFIP policy tenure study by calculating the decline rate from the  reported tenure rate. We estimated the number of remaining subsidized  policies over a 30-year period given the different annual decline rates.", "Because data were not available from NFIP on the number of times each  pre-FIRM property had been sold, we determined that the policy decline  rate analysis was sufficiently similar to provide an indication of extent of  ownership or length of time policies remained in the program to respond  to this study element.", "Additionally, because data were not available from NFIP\u2019s databases on  the extent to which pre-FIRM properties are currently owned by the same  owners as at the time of the original NFIP rate map, we determined that  the policy decline rate analysis was sufficiently similar to provide an  indication of extent of ownership or length of time policies remained in the  program to respond to this study element."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Historic Financial Impact of Subsidized Properties on NFIP", "paragraphs": ["To estimate the financial impact, or cost, of subsidized properties to NFIP,  we attempted to calculate forgone premiums\u2014lost revenue to the  program in premiums\u2014due to subsidies.

We limited  our analysis to 2002 through 2011 because FEMA did not estimate  subsidy rates prior to 2002. Lacking the information to calculate the  ranges associated with the premiums that would have been collected, we  made assumptions based on limited historical information from FEMA,  including the annual Actuarial Rate Reviews from 2002 through 2011,  which state that subsidized premiums were estimated to be between 35  and 45 percent of the full-risk premium (the subsidy rate). Our analysis  did not adjust for potential effects on behavior (such as on program  participation) or changes in operating expenses that could have occurred  had historical rates not been subsidized. In addition, our analysis did not  account for new information provided by FEMA officials that only a portion  of subsidized premiums is available to pay for losses. We plan to analyze  the impact of this new information provided by FEMA in comments on a  draft of this report. We will report the methodology and results of our  estimate separately.

Data  were not available before 2002 that would allow us to determine whether  a policy had the characteristics of a remaining subsidized policy.
