It remains one of the few federally run programs, unlike many other employment training programs that are federally funded but are operated by state or local governments. Job Corps centers are operated by public or private organizations under contract with Labor.", "Recent legislative proposals to consolidate much of the nation\u2019s job training system into block grants to the states has produced debate on the relationship between Job Corps and the states, including whether responsibility for Job Corps should be delegated to the states. A 1995 Senate-passed bill retained Job Corps as a separate federally administered program; a 1995 House-passed bill was silent about the Job Corps\u2019 future as a separate entity. A conference committee is currently attempting to resolve the differences between the two bills. The Senate bill proposes several changes to better integrate Job Corps with state and local workforce development initiatives, including requiring center operators to submit operating plans to Labor, through their state governors; requiring center operators to give nearby communities advance notice of any center changes that could affect them; and permitting the governor to recommend individuals to serve on panels to select center operators. Labor officials stated that the program is already playing a proactive role in ensuring that the National Job Corps program works more closely with state and local employment, education, and training programs.", "According to Job Corps officials, the program has received funding to open nine additional centers\u2014five in program year 1996 and four in program year 1997\u2014all of which will be located in states with existing centers.", "Job Corps\u2019 nine regional directors are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the program at the centers located within their geographic boundaries. Included among their responsibilities are the recruitment of youth for program participation and the assignment of enrollees to one of the program centers. Recruitment is typically carried out by private contractors, the centers, or state employment services under contract with the regional directors. The Job Corps legislation provides some broad guidance with respect to assigning enrollees to centers. It states that participants are to be assigned to the center closest to their residence, except for good cause. Exceptions can include avoiding undue delay in assigning participants to a center, meeting educational or training needs, or ensuring efficiency and economy in the operation of the program.", "The program currently enrolls participants aged 16 to 24 who are severely disadvantaged, in need of additional education or training, and living in a disruptive environment. Our June 1995 report contained an analysis of characteristics of those terminating from Job Corps in program year 1993 showing that over two-thirds of the program\u2019s participants faced multiple barriers to employment. Enrollments are voluntary, and training programs are open entry, open exit, and self-paced, allowing participants to enroll throughout the year and to progress at their own pace. On average, participants spend about 8 months in the program but can stay up to 2 years.", "In addition to basic education and vocational training courses, each of the centers provides participants with a range of services including counseling, health care (including dental), room and board, and recreational activities. Skills training is offered in a variety of vocational areas, including business occupations, automotive repair, construction trades, and health occupations. These courses are taught by center staff, private contractors, or instructors provided under contracts with national labor and business organizations. In addition, Job Corps offers, at a limited number of centers, advanced training in various occupations including food service, clerical, and construction trades. This training is designed to provide additional instruction to participants from centers across the nation who have demonstrated the ability to perform at a higher skill level.", "One feature that makes Job Corps different from other youth training programs is its residential component. About 90 percent of the participants enrolled each year live at the centers, allowing services to be provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The premise for boarding participants is that most come from a disruptive environment and, therefore, can benefit from receiving education and training in a new setting where a variety of support services are available around the clock.", "Participation in Job Corps can lead to placement in a job or enrollment in further training or education. It can also lead to educational achievements such as earning a high school diploma and gaining reading or math skills.

On the other hand, less than a quarter of the youths in 16 states were assigned to out-of-state Job Corps centers.

In 7 of Labor\u2019s 10 regions, over 90 percent of Job Corps program participants were residents of the regions in which they were assigned, and in the remaining 3 regions, over 80 percent were regional residents. A portion of the remaining 5 percent who were transferred outside their region were assigned under agreements between regional directors to send participants to centers in other regions. For example, the director in region II said that he has an agreement to send approximately 150 youths to region I and 250 youths to region IV.

In 92 percent of the cases where participants were assigned out of state, there was an in-state Job Corps center closer to the participant\u2019s home. On average, participants assigned to out-of-state centers traveled about 390 miles, whereas the closest in-state center was about 90 miles from their residence. For example, about 2,200 Florida residents were assigned to Job Corps centers in other states, traveling on average about 640 miles to attend those centers.

Because program capacity in Kentucky, Utah, and West Virginia exceeded in-state demand, large numbers of nonresidents attended centers in these states. California, on the other hand, had insufficient capacity.

The Job Corps program does not routinely collect the reasons for out-of-state assignments and, therefore, we were unable to document the specific factors behind these decisions. However, we contacted Labor officials, including each of its nine regional directors\u2014who are ultimately responsible for center assignments\u2014as well as contractors responsible for 15 outreach/screening contracts, to determine what factors contributed to out-of-state assignments. For the most part, these officials stated that one of the reasons for not assigning participants to the center closest to their residence and, instead, to out-of-state centers was to ensure that centers were fully utilized. For example, they pointed out that many residents from Florida were assigned to centers in Kentucky; otherwise, centers in Kentucky would remain underutilized. A similar situation was cited with respect to participants from California assigned to a center in Utah that would otherwise be underutilized. In addition, Labor officials noted that participants were assigned to out-of-state centers to fill openings that occurred throughout the year because participants continuously leave the program due to the program\u2019s open-entry, open-exit, self-paced format. Moreover, at any point, there may not be any state residents ready to enroll in the program.", "Maintaining full capacity in Job Corps centers is one measurement Labor uses in evaluating regional director performance; Labor data indicate that, except for a portion of program year 1994, the program has operated near full capacity during the previous 3 program years. Vacancies can frequently occur at Job Corps centers because of the uneven distribution of program capacity in relation to demand for services, the continuous turnover of participants at individual centers, and the irregular flow of participants into the program. Labor officials said that in program year 1994, Job Corps had an average occupancy rate of about 91 percent programwide. Average occupancy rates at the regional level, in program year 1994, ranged from about 83 percent to 97 percent.", "We found less evidence to support the other principal reason cited for assigning participants to distant centers\u2014the need to satisfy participant preferences, either to attend a particular center or to receive training in a particular occupation. While the Job Corps data system does not provide information on the extent to which such preferences are considered when making assignments, we were able to gain some insight into the degree to which specific vocational offerings might explain out-of-state assignments. We analyzed the occupational training courses in which out-of-state participants were enrolled. We found that over two-thirds of these individuals were either enrolled in occupational courses commonly offered throughout the national network of Job Corps centers or were never enrolled in an occupational course at all. For example, about 13 percent of the participants sent to out-of-state centers were being trained in clerical positions (available at 91 centers), about 8 percent in food service (available at 94 centers), and 8 percent in health occupations (available at 72 centers). In addition, about 11 percent received no specific vocational offering after being assigned to an out-of-state center (see table 1). Thus, specialized training or uncommon occupational offerings do not appear to explain these out-of-state assignments.

Some of the contractors were no longer under contract, and others could not be reached. As a result, we interviewed contractors responsible for 13 contracts that had a large proportion of participants recruited for out-of-state centers and 2 contracts that had relatively fewer participants going out of state. While our questions were based on the analysis of program year 1993 assignment information, we also asked each recruiting contractor to comment on his or her current student assignment patterns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "paragraphs": ["We selected recruiting contractors to interview on the basis of their assignment of participants to centers outside participants\u2019 states of residence.

Actual travel distances may vary. The average length of stay of participants at Job Corps centers can show some variation from year to year, as would the estimated center capacity when calculated from this number. To illustrate these variations, we have presented program year 1993 data alongside data for program year 1994 (see app. II). While we did not verify the accuracy of the SPAMIS data provided by Labor, we did check the consistency of participants\u2019 zip code and state of residence data and eliminated those files with inconsistent information.

The legislative language relating to the assignment of enrollees to Job Corps centers is included in the Background section of the report. 2. We have modified our report to note that the Job Corps regional operations are carried out under the direction of nine regional managers. 3. We agree that participants transferring into advanced training may be required to travel additional miles to attend this training. To respond to Labor\u2019s comments, we attempted to identify all the participants included in our analysis who transferred into advanced training courses. We were able to identify all participants who transferred from the original center to which they were assigned, regardless of the reason for transfer, but the information was not available to identify those specifically transferring to advanced training programs. Nonetheless, eliminating from our analysis the over 1,800 participants who transferred between centers did not change our findings. The average distance traveled by participants assigned to out-of-state centers was 375 miles, compared with about 390 miles when including the over 1,800; the distance to the nearest in-state center remained the same\u201493 miles. Thus, our finding\u2014that participants assigned to centers outside their state of residence were sent to centers that were, on average, over 4 times as far as the closest in-state center\u2014is unchanged. 4. We have modified our report, where appropriate, to indicate that our use of the term \u201cdemand\u201d is limited to only those enrolling in Job Corps and that it does not include those who are eligible and interested in the program but have not yet enrolled. 5. Our report provides a separate section with a caption that highlights that program participants are employed in their state of residence. 6. We have clarified our report to recognize that the high number of nonresidents in the California center cited may have been due to the nature of the training offered, that is, the center provided advanced training to participants from across the nation. 7. The reasons for assigning participants to out-of-state centers cited in our report are based on comments by those involved in deciding where enrollees are actually assigned\u2014the nine regional directors and several outreach/screening contractors. The principal reasons cited were to fully use available space at the centers and to satisfy participants\u2019 preferences either to attend a specific center or to enroll in a specific occupational training course. 8. As suggested, we have included a statement in the Results in Brief section that recognizes our inability to determine whether specific vocational training slots were available at the closest center when participants were enrolled. 9.
