The Act made this provision effective 3 years after enactment for children under tribal responsibility.

GAO was asked to explore tribes' views on these matters.", "This report examines: (1) data comparing Indian and non-Indian children in foster care; (2) challenges selected tribal child welfare agencies may face in addressing changes to APPLA and establishing permanent homes for children in tribal foster care; and (3) HHS assistance to tribes in implementing the APPLA change and addressing any challenges to establishing permanent homes. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and HHS guidance; analyzed HHS's fiscal year 2014 data on child welfare agencies' foster care case plans; and interviewed officials from 36 tribes that receive federal child welfare funding from six states with high numbers of tribes receiving this funding. GAO also interviewed HHS officials and officials at six state child welfare agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To receive federal child welfare funding, state and tribal child welfare agencies must comply with certain requirements, including developing a permanency plan for the child that identifies how the child will exit the foster care system to a permanent home (\u201ccase goal\u201d). If other case goals, such as reunifying with parents, adoption, or guardianship are not possible or appropriate, a child may be assigned \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d (APPLA) as a case goal. Unlike other case goals, children assigned an APPLA case goal are normally expected to remain in foster care until they reach adulthood, which could result in young children remaining in foster care for many years. Because available foster care data do not include a measure for the APPLA case goal, GAO used long-term foster care and emancipation as proxy measures for this case goal. These data show that in 2014 about 6.1 percent of Indian children had APPLA as a case goal, compared to 8.3 percent of non-Indian children. Of the approximately 1,200 Indian children who were assigned an APPLA case goal, 41 percent were younger than 16, while of the approximately 33,000 non-Indian children with this case goal, 23 percent were younger than 16. These data also show, on average, that Indian and non-Indian children with APPLA as a case goal moved among foster homes about the same number of times.", "Most tribal officials GAO interviewed reported that they did not anticipate challenges in implementing the limitation on the use of APPLA to children age 16 and older, but many reported other challenges to establishing permanent homes for children in tribal foster care. Some organizations expressed the view that the APPLA age restriction would compel tribes to pursue other arrangements with non-Indian homes if they could not allow a child to remain in foster care with an Indian family. However, tribal officials GAO interviewed said that they rarely use APPLA and instead pursue reunification with family members or other case goals, such as guardianship. At the same time, tribal officials reported challenges with licensing foster family homes and resource constraints that may make establishing permanent homes\u2014including guardianships\u2014difficult.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided information on APPLA through a listserv and information memoranda and some assistance to tribes in establishing permanent homes for children in foster care. However, many tribes GAO interviewed indicated that they were not receiving Guardianship Assistance Program funds under title IV-E of the Social Security Act which provide support for children exiting foster care to relative guardianships. Guardianship can be a useful alternative to APPLA when reunification and adoption are not viable options. Of the 36 tribes that GAO contacted, 14 reported that they did not participate in the program because it was not included in their title IV-E tribal-state agreements or the tribe faced challenges at the state level, among other reasons. One of HHS's strategic goals is to work with tribes to increase their capacity to promote child safety, permanent homes, and well-being. By taking actions to support tribes' participation in the Guardianship Assistance Program, HHS could help them receive funds to help establish permanent homes for children in tribal foster care, including those who might be affected by the APPLA change."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS explore the reasons for low tribal participation in the federal guardianship program and identify actions to increase tribal participation.

The Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) is responsible for overseeing states\u2019 and tribes\u2019  implementation of these and other federal requirements related to child  welfare services. One requirement is that each child in foster care must  have a case plan including, among other components, (1) a description of  the type of home or institution in which the child is to be placed while in  foster care\u2014referred to in this report as their \u201cplacement setting\u201d\u2014and (2)  a permanency plan for how the child will exit the foster care system,  either by returning to their home or to an alternative permanent  placement\u2014referred to in this report as the child\u2019s \u201ccase goal.\u201d Since  1997, if other case goals (reunification with the child\u2019s parents, adoption,  legal guardianship, or placement with a fit and willing relative) are  determined not to be in the best interests of a child, the court may  designate \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d (APPLA) as  the child\u2019s case goal. Frequently this occurs when these other case  goals have been deemed to not be possible or appropriate. Child welfare  experts expressed the view that APPLA is being used too frequently and  children are remaining in foster care, particularly in group care  arrangements, rather than exiting to a permanent, family-like setting.  Unlike other case goals that involve a child exiting the foster care system,  in practice, children assigned an APPLA case goal are normally expected  to remain in foster care until they reach adulthood and are no longer  eligible for services, known as aging out of foster care.", "The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, enacted  in 2014, restricted the use of APPLA as a case goal to children aged 16  and older. According to some organizations that work on tribal child  welfare issues, the APPLA age restriction might lead tribes to place some  younger tribal children in settings with no tribal connections. These  organizations noted that some tribes might be using the APPLA case goal  to place younger children with serious special needs in family-based  homes within the tribe when reunification or adoption is not available or  appropriate, ensuring that the child retains their connection to their tribe  and extended family. These organizations also said that without the  option of an APPLA case goal for younger children, tribes might need to  pursue case goals of adoption or guardianship\u2014possibly with non-Indian  homes\u2014rather than allowing a child to be assigned APPLA and remain in  foster care with an Indian family until aging out of foster care. The Act  made the APPLA provision effective 3 years after enactment for children  in foster care who are under the responsibility of an Indian tribe, allowing  tribes to continue to use the APPLA case goal for children under age 16  until September 2017.

HHS officials told  us that they support customary adoption as a culturally-appropriate  method of achieving permanency for children. According to HHS officials,  families that adopt a child through customary adoption are eligible for title  IV-E adoption subsidies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Definition of a Relative", "paragraphs": ["Several tribal officials we contacted told us that another challenge facing  their foster care programs were state definitions of who is considered a  \u201crelative\u201d for purposes of foster care; these definitions can contradict  tribes\u2019 cultural traditions. Specifically, officials from 9 tribes we spoke with  in individual and group interviews said their tribes broadly defined the  term relative and that the tribe\u2019s definition was not always compatible with  state definitions. For tribes administering title IV-E on behalf of the state  pursuant to a tribal-state agreement, this difference could affect tribes\u2019  use of the case goal of \u201cplacement with a fit and willing relative\u201d or  whether tribal guardianships with relatives would qualify for GAP  payments under a state\u2019s definition of \u201crelative.\u201d For example, officials  from one tribe told us that tribal children are born into an extensive clan  system and that a tribal member\u2019s \u201cextended family\u201d is very large, and  their clan affiliation is a permanent and necessary component to their  identity. Another tribe reported that nearly all of their children in foster  care are placed with individuals who are considered to be relatives under  the tribe\u2019s broad definition, which encompasses not only blood relatives  but also fictive kin\u2014tribal members who may not be blood related but who  have a close relationship with the child. Tribal officials told us that they  believed federal title IV-E requirements did not provide for such a broader  definition of \u201crelative\u201d and that some tribal members who would be  considered relatives under the tribe\u2019s definition may not qualify for certain  services, such as GAP. According to HHS policy, there is no federal  definition of \u201crelative\u201d for the purpose of the title IV-E GAP. Tribes that  administer title IV-E on behalf of the state pursuant to a tribal-state  agreement generally follow the state title IV-E plan. HHS officials  acknowledged that tribes frequently define \u201crelative\u201d differently than  states. However, in some cases, a state\u2019s definition of a relative could be  more restrictive than a tribe\u2019s, and this narrower definition could be  included in the tribe\u2019s title IV-E agreement with the state. According to  HHS, tribes approved to directly operate a title IV-E program have  discretion to define the term relative for the purposes of the title IV-E  GAP. HHS officials told us that HHS will accept a title IV-E plan or  amendment that contains a reasonable interpretation of a relative,  including a plan that limits the term to include biological and legal  familial ties or a plan that more broadly includes tribal kin, extended  family and friends, or other \u201cfictive kin\u201d.", "More than one-third of tribes we contacted\u201415 of 36 tribes\u2014told us that  satisfying federal and state licensing requirements often made it more  difficult to license potential foster care homes and in some cases also  prevented tribes from establishing potential permanent placements for  their children. For example, in order to be eligible for GAP payments, a  child must have resided with a licensed relative foster caretaker for at  least 6 continuous months. Several tribal officials we interviewed said that  licensing requirements regarding the number of family members living in  a home, the size of the home, or the availability of separate bedrooms  presented challenges when attempting to license potential foster homes,  given the prevalence of multi-generational homes in tribal communities.  An official from one tribe also told us that background checks conducted  as part of the licensing process will sometimes disqualify otherwise  suitable relatives from becoming licensed and therefore a possible  permanent caregiver. For example, some tribal officials noted that an  otherwise qualified relative may not pass a background check because of  a past drug offense. Participants in a 2011 survey by the National Child  Welfare Resource Center for Tribes reported that substance abuse not  only contributed to difficulties some families had when they tried to reunify  with their children but also created challenges in finding suitable foster  homes.", "However, other tribes we interviewed reported that they have been able  to incorporate some flexibility into their tribal licensing requirements to  address licensing challenges or account for other circumstances unique  to tribal communities. For example, some tribes we interviewed said that  their tribe\u2019s licensing requirements provide more flexibility with regard to  the size of a home or the number of bedrooms available. The Fostering  Connections Act authorized states to waive, on a case-by-case basis,  non-safety licensing standards for relative foster family homes and gave  states discretion to determine what constitutes a non-safety standard.  According to HHS officials, tribes approved to directly operate title IV-E  programs are allowed to define and waive non-safety standards for  relative foster family homes, as are states. However, some officials we  spoke with from tribes approved to directly operate title IV-E programs  were not aware that they were able to waive non-safety licensing  standards. In addition, two of the six states we reviewed for our study\u2014 Michigan and New Mexico\u2014were not among those that reported in 2014  allowing waivers of non-safety licensing standards for relative foster  family homes and defining such standards in state law, regulations, or  agency policy, while four states\u2014Arizona, Montana, Oklahoma, and  Washington\u2014reported in 2014 that they did allow such waivers.  According to HHS, tribes operating programs under title IV-E tribal-state  agreements are bound by the terms in those agreements, which could  include licensing requirements.

Officials from 7 tribes reported that a significant challenge  for their programs is a shortage of licensed foster care homes, particularly  those that are willing and capable of caring for children with special  needs. Similarly, officials from 4 tribes told us that they had limited access  to therapeutic foster homes or inpatient care facilities because their tribes  were located in rural areas far from these homes and facilities or because  these resources were already being used by state foster care programs.  Tribal officials also reported that the financial assistance available to  foster care providers or permanent caregivers for children in foster care is  often insufficient to fully cover all of the associated costs. Officials from  one tribe reported that the majority of tribal members struggle to make  ends meet and feed members of their current households. While the tribe  offers financial assistance to foster families, tribal officials said that  amount is insufficient to fully cover the costs of fostering a child. In  addition, several tribes told us that tribal foster care programs generally  do not have access to the range of services available to states, such as  independent living services that can help children in foster care transition  to permanency or resources and services for children with special needs.  HHS officials we spoke with acknowledged that there is great demand  among tribes for resources for these high-needs children.

Of the 27 tribes that  reported using guardianship as a case goal, 20 tribes reported that they  do not participate in GAP and do not receive federal funding to support  those guardianships. Of these 20 tribes, 6 do not participate because  they are located in states that do not offer the program. According to HHS  officials, tribes in states that do not offer GAP would need to directly  operate a title IV-E program in order to receive federal guardianship  assistance. As of March 2016, 33 states and 6 tribes had been approved  to operate GAP, according to HHS (see fig. 5).", "However, 14 tribes who use guardianship as a case goal are in states  that offer GAP, but tribal officials told us they did not participate in GAP  for several reasons. Officials from 5 tribes reported that because GAP  was not included as an option in their title IV-E tribal-state agreements,  families with guardianship arrangements do not receive GAP payments.  Officials from 3 other tribes said they did not receive title IV-E funding so  their tribes were not eligible for GAP payments. Officials from an  additional 5 tribes told us that they did not participate due to access  challenges at the state level, such as age restrictions or difficulty meeting  state requirements. For example, in one state, according to tribal officials,  a child must be 12 years old before a guardianship would be approved.  Finally, officials from 1 tribe said that they were unaware of title IV-E GAP  (see fig. 6). Given that tribes cited different reasons for not participating in  GAP, HHS, states, and tribes may need to take different actions to  address those reasons. In addition, there may be other reasons why  tribes that we did not interview may not be participating in GAP.", "HHS officials said that because the program provides additional support  for foster children\u2019s transition to permanency, participating in title IV-E  GAP and providing tribes GAP payments is in a state\u2019s interest. However,  we previously reported that some states opted not to participate in GAP  because of limited funding for the state\u2019s portion of the GAP payment to  relative guardians. HHS officials told us that they were not aware of any  instances in which a state participated in GAP but did not provide access  to tribes through title IV-E agreements. However, officials also noted that  HHS generally does not have information on the contents of title IV-E  tribal-state agreements, as these agreements are not required to be  submitted as part of a state\u2019s title IV-E plan. Officials said that it is the  responsibility of tribes and states to discuss GAP and whether to include  the program in their IV-E agreements. They noted that Title IV-E calls on  states to negotiate in good faith with tribes to develop a tribal-state  agreement to administer the IV-E program, including GAP assistance  payments. They also told us that the lack of guardianship funding to  tribes means that tribes may be forced to rely on long-term foster care to  fund permanent placements.", "ACF\u2019s strategic plan provides a basis for the Children\u2019s Bureau to support  tribes\u2019 participation in GAP. As part of its overarching goal to support  underserved and underrepresented populations, ACF\u2019s 2015-2016  strategic plan includes a goal for working with tribes to increase their  capacity to promote child safety, permanency, and well-being. It also  includes a goal to promote and facilitate improved tribal-state relations  and policy at the regional and state levels to improve outcomes for Indian  children. In addition, federal standards for internal control state that an  agency\u2019s management system should assure that monitoring is  performed continually as part of agency operations. Without more  awareness by HHS on why tribes may not be participating in GAP,  including why some tribal-state agreements do not include GAP as an  option for tribes, some tribes that could benefit from GAP may not  participate in the program. The limited participation in GAP among the  tribes selected for our study suggests that tribes may not be making use  of available financial support for guardianships that could assist them in  establishing permanency for their children and preventing them from  remaining in long-term foster care. In 2012, a collaborative project of six  child welfare organizations identified title IV-E GAP as one method of  helping child welfare agencies establish permanency for children in foster  care, particularly for older or other children for whom finding permanent  placements may be difficult. Several states surveyed by the project  mentioned that they were targeting, although not exclusively, special  groups of children through GAP, including children with the APPLA case  goal. The project report noted that financial assistance for guardians  raising children who were in foster care is an essential component of the  supports relatives need to offer these children permanent families. By  taking steps that might increase tribal participation in GAP, HHS could  better support tribes\u2019 efforts to find secure and stable homes for their  children in foster care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Changes made by the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening  Families Act to the use of the APPLA case goal were expected by child  welfare advocates to help ensure permanent adult connections for older  children. While most tribal officials we spoke with did not consider the  restriction on the use of APPLA to older children as a challenge, more  than half noted that they faced resource constraints\u2014including limited  financial resources\u2014which affect their ability to find permanent  placements for children under their care. In 2008, title IV-E GAP was  established to provide federal dollars to assist states and tribes with  payments to relatives who are willing to provide permanent homes for  children. However, most tribes we interviewed were not participating in  the program. Some reported that their tribal-state title IV-E agreements  did not include access to GAP while other tribes faced access challenges  at the state level. Others did not receive any title IV-E funding or were  unaware of the program, and tribes may have additional reasons for not  participating. Guardianship arrangements can be a useful case goal to  pursue in situations where reunification is not possible and adoption  conflicts with tribal cultural values. GAP could help tribes by providing the  financial assistance that tribal relatives need in order to provide a home  for a child in their care. When the APPLA restriction takes effect, it can  also provide an alternative to APPLA for those tribes trying to place a  younger child who has special needs and requires more resources for  care and for whom other permanency goals are not viable. As our  analysis of the fiscal year 2014 AFCARS data indicated, some of these  younger children may now be in institutional care and may need  placement in a family setting if they are assigned a new case goal instead  of APPLA. In addition, the program can provide needed resources for  relatives willing to provide a stable home for children over the age of 16  who might otherwise be assigned APPLA. Without greater tribal  participation in title IV-E GAP, some tribes may not have critical financial  support to help children exit foster care to homes with relatives.

HHS  also said that regional office staff participate annually in joint planning for  the title IV-B and IV-E programs with their respective states and tribes  and that participation in GAP is a topic covered in joint planning activities.   In addition, HHS said that regional office staff are available to assist  states and tribes with discussions about GAP participation when tribal- state agreements are renegotiated and that technical assistance is  available to tribes, if needed.

We believe  that the additional actions HHS plans to take\u2014providing information on  the Children\u2019s Bureau website about direct funding and distributing issue  briefs on GAP and best practices for tribal-state partnerships and  agreements\u2014could support tribes\u2019 participation in GAP either by helping  tribes to directly operate a title IV-E program or to negotiate a tribal-state  agreement that includes a provision for GAP participation. Because some  tribes reported challenges at the state level to participating in GAP and  several tribes reported that the state where they are located does not  participate in the program, we encourage HHS to engage title IV-E state  agency officials in discussions about tribal participation in GAP during the  annual review of the their title IV-E state plan. As HHS noted in its  response, regional office staff are a resource to states and tribes as they  renegotiate agreements to help them explore participation in GAP.  Through such discussions, HHS could identify ways that regional office  staff might help state agencies resolve any challenges to GAP  participation that tribes experience at the state level. HHS has taken  several steps over the past few years to help tribes with their title IV-E  programs, including hiring a tribal coordinator to facilitate communication  between regional offices and tribal title IV-E agencies.

Through AFCARS, state  title IV-E agencies are required to report to HHS semi-annually data on  (1) all children in foster care for whom the agency has responsibility for  placement, care, or supervision, and (2) all adopted children who were  placed by the agency or for whom the agency is providing adoption  assistance, care, or services.

For the purposes of our data  analysis discussion, we used the term Indian for children identified as  American Indian/Alaska Native in AFCARS. Because the fiscal year 2014  AFCARS dataset does not have a measure for the APPLA case goal, we  used long-term foster care and emancipation as proxy measures for  APPLA.
