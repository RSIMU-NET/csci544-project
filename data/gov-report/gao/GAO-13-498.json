At the same time, constraints on public funds may limit assistance to the growing population of older adults in need. GAO was asked to review elder justice program issues. This report addresses: (1) the extent to which there is fragmentation, overlap, or duplication across the federal grant programs that support elder justice; (2) the extent to which federal programs coordinate their efforts and monitor elder justice outcomes; and (3) how state aging agencies, area agencies on aging, and service providers deliver federal elder justice services and what challenges, if any, they face in doing so. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, identified federal elder justice programs, surveyed federal officials about program elements, reviewed program documentation, and visited agencies responsible for elder justice in Illinois, Virginia and Arizona. GAO selected states based on the percentage of the elderly in the state population, geographic dispersion, and percentage of the state's Older American Act funds devoted to elder care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, two agencies--the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Justice (Justice) --separately administered 12 fragmented but minimally overlapping programs that directed funds toward elder justice, with low risk of duplication. Specifically, because more than one federal agency administers these programs, GAO found that these grant programs are fragmented. Further, GAO found that overlap across the 12 programs was minimal because the programs varied with respect to (1) funding mechanisms and recipients, (2) elder abuse victims targeted, (3) service providers, and (4) activities conducted. For example, a few of these programs provided formula grants to all states and most dispersed discretionary grants to a limited number of recipients. Programs that supported victims of elder abuse generally assisted all types of victims, but some also focused on certain subgroups, such as older women. Some programs that assisted service providers also targeted specific subgroups, such as judges and court personnel. In addition, elder justice programs supported a wide range of activities. For example, one HHS program provided public education to help identify and prevent elder abuse, while a Justice program trained law enforcement officers to investigate instances of elder abuse. Considering the variation across funding mechanisms and recipients, the elder abuse victims and service providers targeted by the grants, and the types of activities conducted, overlap across the 12 programs is minimal and the risk of duplication--when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same activities or provide the same services to the same beneficiaries--is low.", "We have previously reported that coordination is key to ensuring the efficient use of limited resources to address issues that cut across more than one agency. While federal coordination is in development--for example, HHS, Justice, and other agencies recently formed the Elder Justice Coordinating Council--federal agencies have yet to articulate common objectives and outcomes as precursors to future measures for elder justice programs, which would provide a rationale for coordination. Further, few federal programs tracked elder justice outcomes in 2011 or conducted program evaluations to assess effectiveness, making it difficult to determine what impact, if any, many programs have on victims of elder abuse.", "Officials representing state aging agencies, area agencies on aging and service providers in the three states GAO visited identified the increased demand for elder justice services in a constrained fiscal environment as a major challenge in meeting the needs of the growing older adult population. Officials also cited the need for greater awareness of elder abuse by the public and training of direct service providers who interact with older adults on a regular basis, to help prevent elder abuse or recognize its symptoms. Five of the nine regional agency officials GAO spoke with said elder justice issues need to be elevated to national attention for the general public by a national public awareness campaign. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council is considering a recommendation to sponsor a national campaign but has not yet done so."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS take the lead in identifying common objectives and outcomes for the federal elder justice effort and that HHS and Justice develop a national elder justice public awareness campaign.

Because elder justice was an allowable  activity in these 34 programs, grant recipients determined whether elder  justice activities would be conducted in a given fiscal year.22 As a result,  federal program managers could not tell us which elder justice activities to  compare for that year, to determine if overlap or duplication occurred, for  those 34 grant programs.", "GAO, Results-Oriented Government: Practices that Can Help Enhance and Sustain  Collaboration among Federal Agencies, GAO-06-15 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 21, 2005),  and GAO-12-342SP.", "See appendix II for more information on 34 programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overlap and Duplication are Minimal in Federal Elder Justice Effort", "paragraphs": ["The 12 programs supported elder justice activities through a variety of  federal funding mechanisms.

Because few of these programs provided  formula grants to all states and most dispersed discretionary grants to  limited number of recipients of several types, there is minimal overlap in  this area.", "Specifically, 3 of the 10 grant programs provided a guaranteed base of  funding through formula grants to all states; however, each of these  programs awarded grants to state agencies for different purposes and the  state agency recipients of the HHS grants differed from the recipients of  the Justice grant.23 One HHS program awarded formula grants to state  aging agencies to fund elder justice prevention and awareness activities  and the other program funded assistance to residents of long term care  facilities. The Justice program awarded formula grants to state criminal  justice agencies to fund elder justice activities as well as other law  enforcement and prosecution strategies. Moreover, 7 of the 10 elder  justice grant programs required recipients to compete for funding by  awarding discretionary grants to a limited number of grant recipients.  Three of these discretionary grants provided funding to direct service  providers, such as local organizations serving domestic and sexual  assault victims, local governments, or courts. The remaining four  discretionary grants provided funding to a nonprofit organization and a  limited number of postsecondary institutions to operate resource centers  for state and local governments or to conduct research related to elder  mistreatment.", "Federal elder justice programs also provided support for a variety of types  of victims and potential victims of elder abuse.  Nine of the 12 programs  provided services to victims and potential victims of elder abuse: 5  provided assistance to all types of victims and 4 focused on key  subgroups of victims, further reducing the potential for overlap. For  example, 1 of the 4 programs served older female victims, another  targeted victims in long-term care facilities, and still another served  victims in tribal communities. Table 2 displays the types of victims  targeted by the federal elder justice programs we identified.", "The three formula grant programs were HHS\u2019 Prevention of Elder Abuse, Neglect, and  Exploitation program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3058), HHS\u2019 Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman  Program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3058g), and Justice\u2019s Services, Training, Officer, and Prosecutors  (STOP) Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796gg-1).", "These programs did not directly serve victims or potential victims directly, rather they engaged in  research on elder abuse in general.", "Moreover, a variety of service providers\u2014organizations that deliver  services at the state and local level\u2014were supported by the 12 elder  justice programs. In 2011, 8 programs targeted specific subgroups of  service providers while 4 programs did not target subgroups of service  providers. Even some of the 4 programs that provided support to all types  of service providers specialized to some degree. For example, one  program supported outreach focused on tribal elders while another  focused on elder mistreatment research (see table 3).", "In addition to serving a range of elder abuse victims and service  providers, the 12 programs we identified varied with respect to the  activities they supported, with minimal overlap in some activities (see  table 4). For example, 4 programs provided victim assistance services.  Two programs provided support for conducting investigations of  complaints concerning different members of the older adult community,  including residents of long-term care facilities and female victims in the  community.", "Three broad categories of activity\u2014education, outreach, and information  dissemination; training and technical assistance to service providers; and  promoting state and local coordination\u2014were supported by most of the  12 programs we identified. While some of these activities\u2014education and  outreach training for service providers, and state and local coordination\u2014 appear to overlap, these activities were not necessarily providing similar  services to similar populations. For example, one program supported  public education and outreach to potential victims to promote financial  literacy among older adults and prevent financial exploitation. Another  program trained law enforcement officers to recognize and investigate  instances of abuse and trained staff in victim services organizations and  governmental agencies to understand the role each plays in addressing  elder abuse in the community. A third program promoted local  coordination among human services organizations, law enforcement, and  community development programs just within tribal communities. Further,  some of the grant programs identify several allowable activities grantees  may conduct using program funds, only a few of which may be elder  justice-related, but do not require grantees to conduct all of them.  In one  case, the sponsoring agency does not track which elder justice projects  are funded. For example, in describing the department\u2019s grant  administration practices for the STOP Violence program, a Justice official  explained that state agencies maintain records of the elder justice  projects they fund but Justice does not. Thus, the number of grantees that  conduct elder justice activities is not known by Justice.", "When considering, collectively, the variation in the types of funding  mechanisms and grant recipients, the elder abuse victims and service  providers targeted by the grants, and the types of activities conducted, we  found overlap across the 12 programs was minimal.  In addition, the  potentially overlapping activities have been cited as being in need of  greater federal emphasis, as we will discuss later in this report. For  example, public awareness and training for professionals working with  elder abuse victims were two of the areas identified by some of the state  and local officials we interviewed as those in which increased federal  support would be beneficial. Also, previously discussed, we have  recommended that coordination among state and local organizations has  helped mitigate the effects of increasingly limited resources.", "Moreover, the key differences noted above, in conjunction with low levels  of funding, reduce the risk that two or more area agencies on aging or  local service providers would be providing the same services to the same  beneficiaries\u2014that is, that they are providing duplicative services.  With  respect to low funding levels, by the time federal elder justice funds are  obligated to grantees nationwide, the amount of funds available to any  individual service provider is likely to be low. State officials in all three  states we visited said that HHS is the primary federal funding source for  their elder justice activities. Under two HHS programs, the Prevention of  Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation program and the Long-Term Care  (LTC) Ombudsman Program, the federal government distributes funds to  state aging agencies, which then allocate funds to area agencies on  aging or local service providers. For example, in fiscal year 2011, of the  $5,033,000 total obligations for the Prevention of Elder Abuse, Neglect  and Exploitation program, which directs all funds toward elder justice,  HHS provided $197,380 to Illinois\u2019 state aging agency. The allocation to  one of the state\u2019s 13 area agencies on aging was $14,488, which it then  distributed to numerous other local service providers working directly with  older adults, such as county human service agencies. In Virginia, HHS  provided $118,040 to the state aging agency from the Prevention of Elder  Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation program fiscal year 2011 obligations.  According to officials at one of Virginia\u2019s 25 area agencies on aging, the  allocation to that agency was $3,027 for that fiscal year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Coordination of Elder Justice Activities Is in Development, but Monitoring Is Limited", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Coordination of Elder Justice Activities Is in Development", "paragraphs": ["GAO, Results-Oriented Government: Practices that Can Help Enhance and Sustain  Collaboration among Federal Agencies, GAO-06-15 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 21, 2005).", "GAO-06-15. identified practices that can enhance coordination efforts, such as  defining and articulating a common federal outcome or purpose agencies  are seeking to achieve, consistent with their respective goals and  missions.

Similarly,  the National Center on Elder Abuse,35 also funded by HHS, has identified  outcomes such as elder abuse awareness and the extent to which  research findings are integrated into training and practice.", "Similarly, formal evaluation of federal elder justice programs is limited.  As  we have previously reported, researchers designing formal evaluations  for other programs, including one welfare program, have found that they  had to fit the evaluation design to available time and resources, even  when an evaluation is planned for the state rather than the federal level.36   For example, in some cases, conducting an evaluation for an entire state  may be determined to be so expensive that data collection has to be  limited to a portion of the state. Thus, individual program efforts may not  always be feasible within the resources of many elder justice programs.   Nevertheless, one program, HHS\u2019 NIA research program, held a  conference to evaluate the progress of research supported by grants  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10603(c)(1).", "42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012(d).", "GAO, Designing Evaluations: 2012 Revision, GAO-12-208G (Washington, D.C.: Jan.  31, 2012); and Welfare Reform: Data Available to Assess TANF\u2019s Progress, GAO-01-298  (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 28, 2001). awarded to research elder justice issues in 2010. Three of the 11  remaining programs also indicated they plan to conduct evaluations in the  future once more work has been completed or if funding becomes  available.  Officials from the other 8 programs reported they have not  recently conducted nor do they plan to conduct a formal evaluation that  includes an assessment of elder justice activities. Program officials cited  several factors that limit their ability to formally evaluate their programs,  including variability of program activities and scope year by year,  insufficient data due to a short period of implementation for newer  programs, and limited resources, including funding devoted to and  expertise in program evaluation.", "Given the costs associated with evaluating individual programs,  developing common objectives and outcomes for HHS and Justice elder  justice programs could be a first step in assessing the federal effort. As  noted, coordination of these programs is just under way and HHS and  Justice have not developed common objectives for the elder justice effort  nor have they defined a set of common outcomes, which are necessary  precursors to future performance measures, that could be used to  evaluate the federal effort as a whole. Without progress on these fronts,  the federal government cannot assess the effectiveness of its effort nor  the efficient use of resources devoted to elder justice activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges Persist in Serving Older Adults and Stakeholders Identified a Need for Additional Training and Awareness", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the state aging agencies, area agencies on aging, and  service providers we interviewed identified the increased demand for  services in a constrained fiscal environment as a major challenge in  meeting the needs of the growing older adult population. State aging  agency, area agency on aging, and service provider officials also cited  the need for greater awareness of elder abuse, by both the public and  individuals who interact with older adults, to help prevent elder abuse or  recognize its symptoms. Further, officials in all of the state aging agencies  we contacted told us that elder abuse cases are increasing, especially  financial exploitation cases. For example, one state official we spoke with  said that, as they gave greater emphasis to such cases, they found that  elder justice cases involving financial exploitation, in particular, take  longer to investigate, use financial records that are difficult to obtain, and  are often harder to prove than physical or emotional abuse.", "Elder justice activities are a small but important component of the broad  range of services area agencies on aging (AAA) provided in the states we  visited. Among these elder justice services were basic legal services to  older adults, such as assisting with setting up wills, power of attorney, or  advance directives, which can help deter financial exploitation. AAAs we  visited also coordinated a number of other types of elder justice services.  For example, an Arizona AAA administers a program funded through a  Justice Victims of Crime Act grant to provide emergency housing for  abused older adults. The same AAA uses HHS Title VII of the OAA  funding for a Boys and Girls Club program to teach young people about  respecting older adults. In Illinois, a Justice STOP grant helped create the  Elder Law and Miscellaneous Remedies Division of the Circuit Court of  Cook County which handles elder abuse cases and other instances  where the victim is an older adult.", "Officials representing all of the nine AAAs and nine of the local providers  we interviewed also helped raise awareness of elder abuse through  education and training programs both for the public in general and for  those members of the community who regularly interact directly with older  adults. For example, in Virginia, a local service provider received a  Justice grant to train criminal justice professional service providers,  victims, witnesses, and anyone likely to come in contact with elders. Such  individuals may not be aware of the different ways abuse can present  itself in the older adult population, and other AAA officials said that  education and training for these direct service providers could help them  identify it and respond appropriately. The Virginia provider saw its  program as helpful in determining how to address an abused older adult\u2019s  problems. In our view, in the absence of this awareness, incidents of  elder abuse may go unreported or unaddressed.", "For the most part, APS agencies in Arizona and Virginia worked with  AAAs to identify and respond to incidents of elder abuse. Although the  administrative structure of the AAAs and APS agencies can vary from  state to state, the basic AAA services can help bolster an older adult\u2019s  independence after an elder abuse incident. Depending on the division of  responsibility for elder justice services in the state, AAAs may refer  reports of elder abuse to the state\u2019s APS program in their area. For  example, in Arizona and Virginia, the AAAs turn any allegations of elder  abuse over to the state APS program upon learning about it. However, in  Illinois, the state contracts with service providers to conduct the entire  investigation and disposition of the elder abuse cases. Once an  investigation has been conducted and service needs identified, AAAs  may be involved in connecting elder abuse victims to services.", "Despite their efforts to raise awareness of elder abuse in their  communities, officials at five AAAs and four local service providers told us  that more public awareness and training was needed. Moreover, officials  from state aging agencies in two of the three states we visited said that  the federal government should further emphasize the need for training  law enforcement officers and other officials in identifying elder abuse for  when they come in contact with older adults in need. An AAA official in  one of these states said that training resources should also be directed to  healthcare officials, because they are in a position to identify signs of  elder abuse.", "In prior work on elder financial exploitation, experts and federal, state,  and local officials focusing on this form of elder abuse told us that older  adults need more information about what constitutes financial exploitation  to know how to avoid it. That prior study found that each of the seven  federal agencies reviewed independently produces and disseminates  public information on elder financial exploitation that is tailored to its own  mission, and  worked together at times to increase public awareness. For  example, each year, the FTC and the Postal Inspection Service  collaborate on community presentations during National Consumer  Protection Week. However, although the Older Americans Act calls for a  coordinated federal elder justice system, which includes educating the  public, the seven agencies reviewed in that prior study did not undertake  these activities as part of a broader coordinated approach.37 In other work  on public program effectiveness, we have concluded that agencies can  use limited funding more efficiently by coordinating their activities and can  strengthen their collaboration by establishing joint strategies.38  Of the nine AAA officials we spoke with for this review, five said that there  is a need for a strategic, national public awareness campaign on elder  justice, not limited to financial exploitation. Officials at three of these  AAAs suggested that the federal government sponsor a national  campaign to raise awareness that would include broadly dispersed public  education announcements on the prevalence and types of elder abuse  and helpful resources for those in need. The campaign would help service  providers and care givers who interact with older adults or observe their  behavior recognize the signs of elder abuse and report it.", "GAO, Elder Justice: National Strategy Needed to Effectively Combat Financial  Exploitation, GAO-13-110 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 15, 2012).", "GAO-06-15.", "During its meeting in May 2013 to consider next steps, the Elder Justice  Coordinating Council moved closer to developing a coordinated federal  effort to prevent and respond to elder abuse.

Further, while  federal agencies have taken some initial steps toward coordinating their  elder justice activities, such as forming the Elder Justice Coordinating  Council, their efforts to develop a coordinated response to elder abuse  would be further supported by an assessment of the effectiveness of  federal elder justice programs. Until common objectives and outcomes for  federal elder justice programs are defined, agencies may be working at  cross purposes.

Concerning  the first recommendation, HHS identified the formation of the Elder  Justice Coordinating Council as an effort to develop common objectives  and plans for action to address elder justice issues.  Further, HHS said  that each of nine proposals for action that the Council now is considering  has specified outcomes and that steps and strategies are being  developed to implement the proposals.  We agree that the Council\u2019s  activity is indicative of progress toward a coordinated federal elder justice  effort and development of common objectives.  We encourage the  Council to think broadly in developing common objectives and outcomes  that will encompass the elder justice programs of all federal agencies  represented on the Council, both now and in the future.  HHS said that  our recommendations correctly point out a need for greater public  awareness and, with regard to the second recommendation, that one of  the proposals for Council action is development of a broad-based public  awareness campaign.", "HHS also asked us to consider that improved public surveillance could  help better describe the extent and patterns of abuse among older adults.   In our previous report on elder abuse, we noted that, although the CDC  considers elder abuse a growing public health problem, there is no  ongoing surveillance of its extent similar to periodic national incidence  studies of child abuse and neglect. Without periodically measuring the  extent of elder abuse nationwide, it will be difficult to develop an effective  national policy for its prevention as required under the OAA. In that  report, we suggest that Congress consider mandating the Secretary of  HHS to conduct, in coordination with the Attorney General, a periodic  national study of the extent of elder abuse over time.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human  Services and Justice, and other interested parties.

The  survey, modeled after GAO surveys regarding potential overlap and  duplication, collected information on key program elements pertaining to  overlap and duplication, including objectives, activities, target populations,  outcome measures, and obligations during fiscal year 2011. The survey  was administered between July and September 2012. To maximize  response, we sent periodic follow-up emails to all agency officials that  had not responded to the survey by our deadline.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce several  types of errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling errors.

We included steps in the survey design, data collection, and data  analysis to minimize such non-sampling errors. In designing the survey,  we took steps to clarify the survey questions to ensure that questions  would be correctly interpreted by respondents. For example, during its  development, we pretested our Web-based survey with five selected  programs administered by HHS, Justice, and the SEC. We conducted  these pretests to ensure that the respondents understood the questions  and could provide the answers to them and the questions could be  completed in a reasonable amount of time. Following each pretest, the  survey underwent additional, mostly minor, revisions, based on feedback  from pretest participants. An additional source of non-sampling error can  be errors in computer processing of the data and statistical analysis. All  computer programs relied on for analysis of this survey data were  independently verified by a second analyst for accuracy.", "The survey response rate was 100 percent. In addition to collecting  program information, the survey allowed us to confirm, exclude, and add  programs based on consultations with agency officials.
