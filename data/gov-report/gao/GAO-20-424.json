Because of the remote, steep terrain, initial Forest Service attempts to fight the fire at close range were unsuccessful. The fire grew slowly over the next month. Firefighters, directed by the Forest Service, responded in various ways, such as by constructing \u201cfirelines\u201d\u2014clearing vegetation\u2014in an effort to stop the fire's spread. In mid-August, strong, hot winds caused the fire to expand rapidly, from 8,500 acres to more than 90,000 acres over several days, threatening thousands of homes. Firefighters continued constructing firelines and dropped water and retardant on the fire to try to contain it. In September, the weather changed and cooler days and rain moderated the fire. Firefighers fully contained the fire in November (see figure).", "Forest Service officials and stakeholders raised a number of key concerns about the Forest Service's response to the Chetco Bar Fire. For example, some said that if the Forest Service's response had been more aggressive, it might have kept the fire from growing and threatening homes. Forest Service officials said that in making firefighting decisions, they prioritized firefighter safety and considered the likelihood that a particular response would be successful. The agency has taken steps to improve decision-making for future wildfires, such as developing a tradeoff analysis tool to help decision makers assess firefighting options.", "Forest Service officials, stakeholders, and documents identifed various effects of the fire. Some of these sources cited negative effects including destruction of six homes, damage to roads and trails, and damage to habitat for the northern spotted owl. However, the fire likely improved habitat for some species, such as woodpeckers that eat beetles that feed on burned trees, according to officials."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A wildfire known as the Chetco Bar Fire began in the summer of 2017 in  southwest Oregon and burned for several months before it was declared  contained in November of that year. The fire, which started in the Rogue  River-Siskiyou National Forest, was first reported on July 12, at which  point it was estimated to be between one quarter and one half acre in  size. The Chetco Bar Fire grew slowly in its initial weeks and then spread  quickly the next month, threatening communities such as Brookings,  Oregon. The fire burned over 190,000 acres and, according to the  Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service and Department of the  Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), cost an estimated  $58 million in federal funds to suppress.", "Since the Chetco Bar Fire began in a national forest, the Forest Service  played a key role in managing the firefighting response. Because the fire  also threatened and burned BLM and private lands, other firefighting  entities entered into \u201cunified command\u201d with the Forest Service and  therefore were involved in deciding how to respond to the fire. In  particular, the Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal and Coos Forest  Protective Association were in unified command with the Forest Service  for about a month over the course of the fire.", "During and after the Chetco Bar Fire, local officials, community members,  and other stakeholders raised concerns about whether the Forest Service  could have done more to suppress the fire. Questions have also been  raised about effects the fire may have had on local communities and  resources.", "You asked us to review the Forest Service\u2019s response to and the effects  of the Chetco Bar Fire. This report describes (1) key events in the Chetco  Bar Fire and the Forest Service\u2019s firefighting response, (2) key concerns  raised by Forest Service officials and stakeholders about the Forest  Service\u2019s response to the Chetco Bar Fire, and (3) effects of the Chetco  Bar Fire on local communities and resources.", "To describe key events in the Chetco Bar Fire and the Forest Service\u2019s  firefighting response, we reviewed documents from federal agencies,  including executive summaries and transition plans from the various  incident management teams, long-term assessments of the fire, daily  incident status summaries, incident action plans, and transcripts of radio  transmissions. We reviewed information on firefighting assets (for  example, personnel, aircraft, and equipment) from daily incident status  summaries, dispatch records, and documents on orders placed for  firefighting assets. This information was generated by the Resource  Ordering and Status System, an interagency computer software system  that automates the asset ordering and dispatching process. To determine  the reliability of the information from this system and other sources, we  reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency officials and  determined that the information was sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  describing assets used to fight the Chetco Bar Fire. We also reviewed  federal policies and guidance related to firefighting, including 2017  interagency standards for fire (known as the Red Book) and the Forest  Service Chief\u2019s letter of intent for wildland fire, which provided direction to  the agency for the 2017 fire season.", "In addition, we interviewed federal, state, and local officials who were  directly involved in the firefighting response. Specifically, we interviewed  members of incident management teams and other Forest Service staff  assigned to the Chetco Bar Fire, and senior officials from BLM and  nonfederal agencies that entered into unified command with the Forest  Service, including the Oregon Office of the State Fire Marshal and Coos  Forest Protective Association. We refer to all entities involved in  responding to the fire as cooperators. We also interviewed Forest Service  officials from headquarters, the Pacific Northwest Region, and the Rogue  River-Siskiyou National Forest. To gain a better understanding of the  Chetco Bar Fire\u2019s location and the geographic features of the area, in  April 2019 we flew over the ignition point of the fire and key areas to  which the fire spread, and in June 2019 we visited burned areas on the  ground. We were accompanied by officials from the Rogue River-Siskiyou  National Forest during our visits. In describing the Chetco Bar Fire, we  divided the fire into phases to reflect changes in fire size and behavior,  the risk to structures and resources, and the nature of the response.", "To describe key concerns raised by Forest Service officials and  stakeholders about the Forest Service\u2019s response to the Chetco Bar Fire,  we reviewed agency documents and other documents on aspects of the  response. We also interviewed Forest Service officials and  stakeholders\u2014including cooperators, other state and local officials,  representatives of nongovernmental organizations, and community  members affected by the Chetco Bar Fire\u2014to discuss key concerns that  arose from the response. We identified stakeholders through a review of  agency documents and interviews with agency officials, and we asked  those stakeholders to suggest others. We held a combination of 34  individual interviews and group discussions with 60 Forest Service  officials and a combination of 24 individual interviews and group  discussions with 65 stakeholders. We analyzed the concerns raised and  grouped them into categories. One GAO analyst conducted the initial  categorization, and a team of analysts reviewed the categories and came  to agreement on the categorization. Because this was a nonprobability  sample, the views of agency officials and stakeholders are not  representative of all views but provide illustrative examples of the types of  concerns raised about the response to the Chetco Bar Fire. We did not  assess the compliance of individual firefighters or agency officials with  applicable firefighting guidance, in part because responding to wildfire  requires considerable professional judgment.", "To describe the effects of the Chetco Bar Fire on local communities and  resources, we reviewed reports and other documents related to the  effects of the fire. In particular, we reviewed one report prepared for the  city of Brookings on the effects of the Chetco Bar Fire on the city and two  reports on the effects of the 2017 fire season in Oregon in general. We  interviewed the authors of these reports to discuss their methodologies,  their sources of data, and any limitations on their methodologies and  reported data, and we determined the reports to be reasonable for our  purposes. Other information we reviewed included post-fire damage  assessments and documents regarding air quality during the fire. In  addition, we discussed the effects of the Chetco Bar Fire during our  interviews with agency officials and stakeholders. To gain a better  understanding of the fire\u2019s effects on the ground, in June 2019 we visited  several locations affected by the fire. We grouped the effects identified  into categories. One analyst conducted the initial categorization, and a  team of analysts, including an economist, reviewed the categories and  came to agreement on them. To help determine whether we captured the  main effects of the Chetco Bar Fire in these categories, we compared our  categories of effects identified with two reports on the general effects of  wildfire. We did not include some identified effects because they were of  relatively small magnitude or we lacked sufficient data to reliably report on  them. Examples of effects we excluded were local government costs for  fire suppression and emergency response, and possible effects on local  tax revenue and insurance premiums.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The west side of the forest lies  within the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion, which is known for its ecological  diversity, with 28 coniferous tree species and numerous rare and endemic  plants. The forest also contains diverse topography, with steep terrain  and rugged geological features across several mountain ranges, including  the Klamath Mountains, Siskiyou Mountains, Cascade Range, and Coast  Range. Access to the forest is limited, due to many roadless areas and  over 340,000 acres of wilderness, including the 180,000-acre Kalmiopsis  Wilderness, where the Chetco Bar Fire began. Cities and communities in  Oregon near the fire include Brookings and Gold Beach\u2014along the coast  of the Pacific Ocean\u2014as well as Agness, Cave Junction, and Selma in  Curry and Josephine counties. Figure 1 shows the final perimeter of the  fire in southwest Oregon.", "The part of southwestern Oregon where the Rogue River-Siskiyou  National Forest is located is a fire-adapted ecosystem, meaning that most  native species and plant communities have evolved with fire, and many  are adapted to or dependent on periodic wildfires. The historic fire interval  in the area where the Chetco Bar Fire occurred varied, as did the historic  severity of fires, according to a Forest Service ecologist. The forest  experienced a number of fires over the 30 years before the Chetco Bar  Fire occurred. In 1987, the Silver Fire burned nearly 100,000 acres.  Fifteen years later, in 2002, the Biscuit Fire burned nearly 500,000 acres,  including areas previously burned by the Silver Fire. The Chetco Bar  Fire started in the areas burned by both the Silver and Biscuit Fires. In  2018, the year after the Chetco Bar Fire, the forest experienced another  large fire, the Klondike Fire, which burned about 175,000 acres, abutting  the burn scar of the Chetco Bar Fire in some places."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frequency and Risk of Wildfires in the Western United States", "paragraphs": ["The occurrence of large fires in the western United States has been  increasing, while, at the same time, fire seasons have been increasing in  length, according to recent assessments. Some of these assessments  have found that these increases are due in part to climate change, which  has contributed to increasing temperatures and droughts in the West, as  well as a later onset of fire-season-ending rains. We have previously  found that the cost of disasters, including wildfires, is projected to  increase as extreme weather events such as droughts become more  frequent and intense due to climate change.", "Moreover, land use practices have increased the risk that severe and  intense wildfires will affect people and communities. As we have  previously described, land use practices over the past century have  reduced forest and rangeland ecosystems\u2019 resilience to fire. In  particular, fire suppression\u2014with 95 percent or more of fires suppressed  for nearly a century\u2014and timber harvesting and reforestation have  contributed to abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation, and these  accumulations can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe fires. In some  parts of southwestern Oregon, significant vegetation has built up, according to Forest Service and other documents. As a result,  southwestern Oregon, as well as other parts of the country, is under high  to very high risk from fire, according to a risk assessment and Forest  Service presentation. At the same time, development in and around  wildland areas continues to increase, placing more people, businesses,  and infrastructure at risk of being affected by fires."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fighting Wildfires in the United States", "paragraphs": ["Because a single firefighting entity may not be able to handle all wildfires  in its jurisdiction, agencies in the United States use an interagency  incident management system that depends on the close cooperation and  coordination of federal, state, tribal, and local fire protection agencies.  The Forest Service is the predominant federal firefighting agency in terms  of funding. Other federal firefighting agencies include the Bureau of  Indian Affairs, BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service.  Federal and nonfederal firefighting entities generally share their  firefighting personnel, equipment, and supplies and work together to fight  fires, regardless of who has jurisdiction over the burning lands.  Agreements between cooperating entities govern these firefighting efforts  and contain general provisions for sharing firefighting assets and costs.", "On a large wildfire, firefighting efforts generally fall into two phases\u2014initial  attack and extended attack. The initial attack phase consists of the efforts  to control a fire during the first \u201coperational period\u201d after the fire is  reported, generally 24 hours. While the majority of fires on Forest  Service land are controlled and suppressed during initial attack, some  fires require further firefighting efforts. Such additional efforts are referred  to as extended attack.", "The Forest Service and its interagency cooperators use an incident  management system designed to provide appropriate leadership of  firefighting efforts. There are five types of incidents, ranging in complexity  from type 5 (least complex) to type 1 (most complex). The fire\u2019s  complexity determines the type of incident commander and management  team assigned. For example, for a type-5 incident, the incident  commander may be a local employee qualified to direct initial attack  efforts on a small fire with two to six local firefighters. In contrast, for a  type-1 incident, the incident commander is one member of a highly  qualified incident management team, often with more than 500 firefighters  and other personnel. There are sixteen interagency type-1 incident  management teams that operate nationwide and are typically deployed to  fires for 14-day assignments. In addition, the Forest Service has four  type-1 incident management teams under its National Incident  Management Organization (NIMO). The Forest Service calls these \u201cshort\u201d  teams; each team has seven full-time members, but they can add  additional members as needed. NIMO teams generally handle complex  fires, including long-duration fires, so as not to tie up critical firefighting  personnel over a long time.", "A single incident management team, under the direction of the agency  administrator (the line officer, such as the forest supervisor or district  ranger, responsible for management of the incident), is typically in charge  of a fire, but the incident management system may be expanded into a  unified command structure when multiple jurisdictions are involved. This  structure brings together incident commanders from the relevant  jurisdictions to facilitate a coordinated and integrated interagency  response. In such cases, members of the unified command work together  to develop a common set of incident objectives and strategies, maximize  the use of firefighting assets, and enhance the individual jurisdictions\u2019  efficiency.", "Once assigned to a fire, an incident management team works with local  line officers and fire management staff to determine the strategy and  tactics to use in managing the fire. The strategy is the overall plan  designed to control the fire; for example, to protect structures and contain  the fire within a certain geographic area. Tactics are actions taken to  accomplish the objectives set out in the strategy. For example, the fire  may be attacked directly, with firefighters working at the fire\u2019s edge to  extinguish it. If direct attack is not possible, practical, or safe\u2014because  the fire is burning too intensely or on very steep slopes, for example\u2014 firefighters may choose to attack it indirectly. In such cases, firefighters  typically select an area away from the fire and construct a \u201cfireline,\u201d where  vegetation is cleared in an effort to stop the fire\u2019s spread at that point or  slow it sufficiently to allow firefighters to attack directly. Firefighters often  incorporate geographic features such as roads, rocky areas, ridgelines,  and rivers into firelines to increase their effectiveness. In some cases  firefighters conduct burnout operations, in which they intentionally set fire  to fuels between a fireline and the main fire perimeter to slow or contain a  rapidly spreading fire by depriving it of fuel.", "In carrying out strategies and tactics, firefighters use a variety of  firefighting assets, both on the ground and in the air. Ground-based  assets include firefighting crews, wildland fire engines, and machinery  such as bulldozers, which firefighters use to help construct firelines.  When providing personnel to fight fires, the Forest Service and other  federal agencies generally rely on a \u201cmilitia\u201d strategy whereby personnel  within each agency are trained to serve in firefighting roles when needed,  in addition to performing their day-to-day work responsibilities. Air-based  assets include helicopters and fixed-wing air tankers. Helicopters  generally drop water directly on a fire, whereas air tankers generally drop  fire retardant ahead of the fire, often near a fireline that has been  constructed, to slow a fire\u2019s spread. Air tankers range in size from small  single-engine air tankers, which are maneuverable but carry only small  amounts of retardant, to large aircraft such as converted DC-10s or  Boeing 747s\u2014referred to as \u201cvery large air tankers\u201d\u2014which can carry  substantial amounts of retardant but whose use can be limited in  mountainous terrain because of their size.", "The level of risk that decision makers and firefighters are willing to accept  in any given situation depends on the experience and training of those  involved. Overall, agency firefighting doctrine emphasizes safety above  all other concerns; Forest Service policy, for example, states, \u201cIn  conducting wildland fire suppression, responsible officials shall give first  priority to the safety of firefighters, other personnel, and the public.\u201d  Firefighters and other personnel who respond to wildland fire incidents  are required to complete training to help them identify risks as well as  develop appropriate strategies and tactics to respond to different  situations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Events of the Chetco Bar Fire and Forest Service\u2019s Response Included an Unsuccessful Initial Firefighting Attack and Rapid Spread of the Fire by Strong Winds", "paragraphs": ["The Chetco Bar Fire grew slowly in the summer of 2017 before  undergoing a period of rapid growth driven by strong, hot winds.

The fire\u2019s initial location was several miles  from the closest road access point. No properties or other \u201cvalues at risk\u201d  (such as structures, other property, and natural and cultural resources  that could be damaged by a wildfire) were in the immediate vicinity of the  fire, according to Forest Service documents and officials.", "The Forest Service was notified of the Chetco Bar Fire at 2:43 p.m. on  July 12 and, at 4:14 p.m., four Forest Service firefighters rappelled from a  helicopter to assess the fire. The rappellers landed on a ridge above the  fire to create a helispot (a temporary helicopter landing area) so that  additional firefighters and equipment could more easily be brought to the  fire. The rappellers requested and received permission from the district  ranger for chainsaw use in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness to prepare the  helispot, and they worked on cutting trees and clearing brush until late  that evening, according to Forest Service documents and national forest  officials. The rappellers estimated that the helispot was 60 percent  cleared by the end of the first day, according to national forest officials.", "While the rappellers were working, the Forest Service helicopter returned  to its base near Grants Pass, Oregon, to attach a bucket to drop water  onto the fire. In the meantime, two helicopters from the Oregon  Department of Forestry headed to the fire. The three helicopters dropped  about 17,000 gallons of water the first day, according to Forest Service  documents. Forest Service officials said these water drops were intended  to slow the spread of the fire while the rappellers worked to clear the  helispot.", "Anticipating that the helispot would be completed shortly, the Forest  Service ordered two 20-person crews to assist in firefighting efforts the  next day. As the rappellers set up camp for the night, incident command  radioed them to say that the fire appeared to be holding at about three  quarters of an acre.", "The next morning, July 13, the Forest Service brought in four additional  rappellers to continue working on the helispot throughout the morning and  into the afternoon (see fig. 3). One of the rappellers walked the perimeter  of the fire and determined that the fire had grown to about 10 acres  overnight. While the rappellers were working, two helicopters dropped  about 18,000 gallons of water that day and a single engine air tanker  dropped 1,200 gallons, according to a Forest Service document.", "The crew bosses for the two crews that had been ordered the previous  day flew over the fire early afternoon of July 13, according to Forest  Service documents. They estimated the fire had grown to about 15 acres  and observed a number of spot fires (smaller fires separate from the main  fire) caused by burning material rolling down the hill. They expressed  safety concerns about bringing crews into that area and also determined  the helispot needed more work before a helicopter could land safely.", "Since the crews would need to be shuttled in by helicopter, the crew  bosses decided not to bring in the requested crews, according to officials.", "Later that day, the incident commander requested a helicopter to remove  the eight rappellers from the fire because of safety concerns and a low  probability of success at containing the fire, according to the incident  commander and Forest Service documents. The rappellers said that it  was taking much longer to complete the helispot than initially anticipated  and they did not have a good safety zone or escape route. They also  noted that there was unburned vegetation on the slope between the fire  and the helispot they were constructing\u2014a dangerous situation if the fire  started to spread quickly.

Forest Service documents indicated that fire behavior was moderate over  the next several weeks, averaging around 150 acres of growth per day.  The Chetco Bar Fire was a relatively low-priority fire during this phase,  since it was far from values at risk and it remained within the Kalmiopsis  Wilderness, while other fires in the region were threatening communities  and resources, according to Forest Service documents and incident  management team officials.", "Because firefighters had been unable to suppress the fire during initial  attack, national forest officials said they anticipated, based on knowledge  of previous fires in the area, that the Chetco Bar Fire would become a  long-term incident. The type-3 incident management team completed a  long-term assessment and began working to contain the fire using long- term, indirect strategies. Under the type-3 team, crews scouted potential  locations to fight the fire and started building firelines some distance  away, approximately 6 miles from the fire and outside of the wilderness  boundary, according to a Forest Service document and an incident  management team official. Several additional fire crews were assigned to  work on the fire during this time, with staffing fluctuating between  approximately 40 and 140 people per day.", "As the type-3 team\u2019s 2-week rotation was ending, national forest officials  decided to bring in a NIMO team to assume command of the fire. Officials  said they brought in a NIMO team because it consisted of type-1-qualified  staff who could be staffed on the fire for longer than 2 weeks, and the  team could expand or contract as needed. The NIMO team took  command of the fire on July 29, with the fire estimated at 2,181 acres in  size, and started updating the type-3 team\u2019s long-term assessment and  developing a long-term implementation plan. The plan identified  13 trigger points, referred to as \u201cmanagement action points,\u201d to help guide  decision-making on protecting high values at risk if certain conditions  were met. For example, the plan laid out actions to prevent the fire from  crossing the Chetco River\u2014the first trigger point identified\u2014and actions  to be taken if the fire crossed the river.", "The NIMO team continued the type-3 team\u2019s efforts to construct a series  of firelines away from the main fire and, according to a team summary  document, completed all of the firelines by August 17. Forest Service  officials told us that for these firelines to be effective, firefighters would  have needed to burn the vegetation between the lines and the fire itself  (known as a burnout). National forest and NIMO team officials said that  the teams had not yet taken this step because they considered it an  unnecessary risk as long as the fire remained north of the Chetco River.  These officials said that burnout operations pose risks if the fire set by  firefighters burns in a different direction than intended, and such  operations can unnecessarily burn a larger area of the forest if the fire  does not reach the burnout. Therefore, one national forest official said  firefighters will prepare firelines but not conduct burnout operations until  the incident management team determines they are needed\u2014particularly  since safety risks can be associated with conducting burnout operations.

Chetco Effect winds developed in mid-August 2017, causing the Chetco  Bar Fire to rapidly expand and intensify (see sidebar). The Forest Service  was aware of the potential for such winds, as fire behavior modeling and  the July 2017 long-term assessment showed the potential for these winds  to increase fire behavior dramatically by mid-August. The winds,  combined with dry fuels and heavy vegetation, created conditions that led  to extreme fire behavior.", "Chetco Effect Winds  Chetco Effect winds, also known as Brookings  Effect winds, are warm, dry, and strong winds  flowing down the Chetco River Basin toward  Brookings, Oregon (see figure below). Such  winds are more broadly referred to as Foehn  or downslope winds, other examples being the  Santa Ana winds in southern California and  the Diablo winds in northern California. Chetco  Effect winds can happen any time and  generally occur two to four times a year,  according to the National Weather Service.", "The Chetco Effect winds first occurred the evening of August 15 and  morning of August 16, but the fire remained north of the Chetco River.  When the winds returned the evening of August 16 and morning of  August 17, the fire crossed the river and began expanding rapidly, in part  because heavy vegetation on the south side of the river fueled the fire  under the winds. Many officials and stakeholders said nothing could be  done to moderate the fire\u2019s behavior when the Chetco Effect winds were  in effect. The fire increased in size from 8,500 acres on August 17 to  91,551 acres on August 21 (see fig. 6). As a result, the Chetco Bar Fire  became a much higher priority fire, according to Forest Service  documents.", "The NIMO team ordered additional crews on August 17, in anticipation of  conducting burnout operations along 10 miles of fireline in an attempt to  slow the fire, according to Forest Service documents. However, the  Chetco Effect winds caused the fire to move rapidly toward and past the  fireline before the Forest Service could conduct the planned burnouts.  Even though the fireline was completed prior to being overrun by the fire,  national forest officials told us that the weather conditions were not  favorable for burnout operations, as the winds would have blown the  burnout fires back toward private timberlands and populated areas. The  winds also caused embers to fly far ahead of the fire during this time,  creating spot fires 1 to 2 miles or more ahead of the main flame front.", "On August 18, the Chetco Bar Fire began spreading from national forest  onto private timberlands and unincorporated areas containing homes.  As the fire began to threaten homes and other structures, the NIMO team  directed firefighters to take appropriate action to try to protect those  structures, if fire behavior allowed. For example, between August 18  and 21, Forest Service documents indicated that firefighters cleared  brush around several structures and homes in a small community known  as Wilderness Retreat and along two Forest Service roads. On August  19, the fire burned rapidly toward Wilderness Retreat and firefighters  conducted an emergency burnout, which successfully protected the  community, according to a NIMO team document and national forest  officials. Around this time in another area, the Chetco Bar Fire burned  six primary residences and more than 20 other structures, according to  state and Forest Service documents. On August 20, the fire traveled  6 miles toward Brookings in a single day, and threatened more than  3,000 homes during this phase.", "As the Chetco Bar Fire burned toward Brookings, the NIMO team notified  the Curry County Sheriff that residents would need to be evacuated.  However, the rapid spread of the fire provided limited time to notify  residents and conduct evacuations, according to a NIMO team document  and national forest officials.

National forest officials said that when  deciding how to respond to the fire, they prioritized firefighter safety and  also considered the likelihood that a particular response would be  successful, in accordance with 2017 Forest Service guidance. As  previously discussed, in the early stages of the Chetco Bar Fire,  firefighters expressed concerns about their safety and the likelihood of  success of certain tactics. In addition, national forest officials noted that  after the rappellers asked to be pulled out of the fire and other firefighters  expressed safety concerns, line officers were hesitant to send in  additional firefighters.

Some officials and several stakeholders  raised concerns about the Forest Service not sending in more  firefighters at the beginning of the Chetco Bar Fire to try to contain it  before it threatened homes. In response, national forest officials said  that the four rappellers that were sent on the first day were part of an  18-person crew stationed near Grants Pass, Oregon. They were the  only crew members available to respond on July 12, as the remaining  crew members had just returned from another fire assignment, and  firefighters are generally required to take 2 days off after completing a  standard 14-day fire assignment. As previously noted, safety  concerns also factored into decisions to remove the rappellers and not  add crews on the second day of the fire.", "Absence of smokejumpers. Some stakeholders raised concerns  that the Forest Service did not send smokejumpers into the Chetco  Bar Fire in its early stages, saying that smokejumpers may have been  more effective at suppressing the fire when it was small. In  response, national forest officials said that the rappellers who were  sent to the fire were located much closer to the ignition point than the  closest smokejumpers and were able to respond more quickly. These  officials also said that rappellers can be more effective in rough terrain  with heavy timber, since they do not need an open space to land with  parachutes and can be dropped closer to the fire.", "Use of helicopters. Several stakeholders raised concerns about the  Forest Service stopping the use of helicopters to drop water on the  fire after the rappellers were removed. According to interagency  guidance and Forest Service officials, water drops are not as effective  at containing a fire without crews on the ground (to build firelines, for  example), and they did not want to expose helicopter crews to  unnecessary risk for actions that were unlikely to be effective. In  addition, officials said that the water drops were causing burning logs  and other debris to roll down the hill and create spot fires. Interagency  guidance discusses the importance of coordinating air and ground  firefighting tactics, noting that the effectiveness of aircraft is  dependent on the deployment of ground assets.", "Use of indirect strategies. Several stakeholders raised concerns  about incident management teams not engaging the fire more directly  in the first several weeks rather than constructing fireline miles away.  Some of these stakeholders described this indirect approach as a  \u201cwatch and wait\u201d or \u201clet it burn\u201d approach. In response, officials said  that they looked for locations and opportunities to fight the fire directly,  but the fire\u2019s remote location and rugged terrain made this difficult.  One official estimated it would have taken firefighters 2 days to hike to  the fire because of the distance and trail conditions.", "Number of burnout operations.

They noted that some of these tools were not widely available  at the time of the Chetco Bar Fire but are becoming more common. In  particular, the Forest Service has an evolving risk management  assistance program aimed at improving decision-making on fires by  developing a strategic evaluation process. This program includes risk- management assistance teams that can be deployed to fires to assist with  key decisions and exercises to help incident management teams and line  officers analyze different firefighting options, according to program  documents. For example, the Forest Service developed a tradeoff  analysis tool through which decision makers assess different firefighting  options and rate them according to how well they address firefighter  safety, public safety, and values at risk. During the 2018 Klondike Fire,  national forest officials said they brought in a risk-management team to  facilitate analysis of firefighting options and included cooperators in the  discussions.

For example, an incident management team that was heading to  the Chetco Bar Fire was diverted to the Eagle Creek Fire, which was  threatening homes and other structures near Portland, Oregon. Further,  some officials said limited availability of certain firefighting assets with  specific capabilities, such as infrared drones that can \u201csee\u201d through  smoke or cloud cover, hindered their ability to fight the fire when visibility  was limited. Some officials also emphasized the importance of having  more long-term fire analysts assigned to national forests and incident  management teams to help develop and interpret fire behavior models  and long-term assessments that, in turn, could help protect people and  values at risk.

Several said  that if there had been more timber harvest, the forest might have been  replanted in ways that could have made the fire worse. Specifically, when  replanting is done following timber harvest, trees may be planted more  densely and uniformly than would occur if vegetation were allowed to  grow back naturally, according to a Forest Service ecologist and some  stakeholders.

Sediment in the water makes it harder for  fish to breathe and can smother their eggs. In addition, over time,  increased sediment in streams and rivers can disrupt salmon migration  because salmon use their sense of smell to navigate to their native  stream to spawn, and sediment can mask that smell. Some stakeholders  said they were concerned that the loss of shade from trees might lead to  warmer river water, thereby harming salmon. However, a Forest Service  biologist said that vegetation near the river has regrown since the fire and  there is no indication that the temperature of the river water has  increased.", "The fire may provide some long-term benefits for salmon and other fish  species. Specifically, erosion following the fire is likely to increase the  supply of downed trees and coarse gravel in streams and rivers, which  provide places for fish to lay their eggs and hide, according to a study and  a Forest Service biologist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cultural Resources", "paragraphs": ["Some cultural resources\u2014including archaeological sites, historic  structures, and areas significant to contemporary Native American tribes\u2014were negatively affected by the Chetco Bar Fire. The Forest  Service reported that 130 known and recorded Native American  archaeological sites were located within the perimeter of the Chetco Bar  Fire, 49 of which the agency characterized as isolated sites containing  one to three stone artifacts. The effect of the Chetco Bar Fire on known  and recorded sites\u2014and on any cultural sites not previously identified\u2014is  not fully known. Following the fire, as part of its BAER report, the Forest  Service assessed some of these sites, including a prehistoric Native  American village site and an area culturally important to Native American  tribes. This report noted a number of cultural artifacts, such as  arrowheads and tools, that were discolored by the fire or were displaced  or moved during or after the fire by, for example, soil disruption caused by  trees falling or roots burning and collapsing. The report also stated  additional damage could occur in the future; for example, increased  erosion could further damage some cultural sites, and vegetation loss  could make artifacts more visible, increasing the potential for looting and  vandalism. To help mitigate some of the effects, the Forest Service  planted some of the burned area with native grass seed to reestablish  ground cover and reduce erosion.", "In addition to the fire damaging cultural resources, a Forest Service  archaeologist said fire suppression activities caused some damage. For  example, Native American arrowheads and tools were unearthed when a  bulldozer constructed a fireline. The archeologist said that they took  precautions to minimize suppression impacts on cultural resources, for  instance by avoiding using heavy equipment in areas where cultural  resources were known to be located."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Agriculture and  the Interior for review and comment.
