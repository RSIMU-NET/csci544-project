This report examines, among other objectives, (1) Puget Sound restoration efforts and related expenditures for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, (2) how federal and nonfederal entities coordinate their restoration efforts, and (3) the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound restoration. GAO reviewed restoration plans and other documentation, conducted a two-phase survey of the more than 25 federal and state entities that GAO determined had participated in restoration efforts, conducted discussion groups with tribal and local representatives, and interviewed representatives from these federal and nonfederal entities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Through its survey of federal and Washington State entities, GAO identified numerous federal and state efforts that, in whole or in part, supported Puget Sound restoration from fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The efforts involved a variety of activities, including habitat protection, water quality improvement, and monitoring. Some of these efforts focused exclusively on Puget Sound restoration, while others had a broader geographic or programmatic scope. Funding for these efforts came from a variety of sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which reported expending about $142 million for activities in Puget Sound through the National Estuary Program and the Puget Sound Geographic Program during this time frame. However, total expenditures for all efforts are unknown, in part because of difficulties isolating expenditures specific to Puget Sound. A 2017 state audit recommended that two state agencies develop a plan to create a more complete inventory of restoration efforts and related funding. The state agencies concurred and have plans to develop this inventory by August 2019.", "Federal and nonfederal entities coordinate restoration efforts through two primary interagency groups. First, the state-led Puget Sound Management Conference has developed a comprehensive conservation and management plan (CCMP), approved by EPA under the National Estuary Program, that serves as the primary planning document for Puget Sound restoration. Second, the Puget Sound Federal Task Force complements the work of the management conference by coordinating the efforts of federal agencies to support the CCMP, including by developing a draft Federal Action Plan that identifies priority federal actions to protect and restore Puget Sound.", "The CCMP lays out a framework for assessing restoration progress, including 6 goals, 47 indicators, and recovery targets for 31 of the indicators. In 2017, the Puget Sound Partnership, a state agency, reported that progress had been made in some areas, but many key indicators had not shown improvement. For example:", "One indicator that showed improvement was acres of harvestable shellfish beds, which the Partnership reported increased from 2007 to 2016.", "One indicator that showed no improvement was the abundance of Puget Sound Chinook salmon populations, which the Partnership reported remained below desired levels.", "The Partnership also reported that most of the 31 recovery targets that the management conference has adopted for 2020 are not likely to be attained. However, the Partnership's ability to assess progress has been limited in some instances, in part because the management conference has not developed targets for 16 of the 47 indicators. GAO has identified measurable targets as a key attribute of successful performance measures. By working with the management conference to help ensure that measurable targets are developed where possible for the highest priority indicators currently lacking such targets, EPA would better position the Partnership to assess progress toward restoration goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, including that EPA work with the management conference to help ensure that measurable targets are developed where possible for the highest priority indicators currently lacking such targets.

The Puget  Sound basin extends north into Canada, encompassing a complex  landscape featuring mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, urban  development, and about 2,500 miles of shoreline. More than 4.5 million  people live in the Puget Sound basin, and the region is home to large  ports, industries, and critical military installations. The Sound and the  surrounding region serve as an important economic engine and include  metropolitan areas that accounted for more than $365 billion in gross  domestic product in 2016.", "However, human use and development have contributed to the  degradation of habitats and water quality in Puget Sound. For example,  an estimated 70 percent of important habitats\u2014including estuaries, salt  marshes, and eelgrass beds\u2014have been damaged or lost over the past  125 years. In addition, stormwater runoff contaminated with toxic  chemicals and other pollutants threatens wildlife in Puget Sound, and  several species in the Sound are listed as endangered or threatened  under the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) has designated Puget Sound as one of the 28 estuaries of  national significance under the National Estuary Program.", "A large number of federal, state, local, tribal, and nongovernmental  entities play important roles in Puget Sound restoration efforts.  Washington State has provided much of the high-level leadership for the  restoration efforts, and in 2007 the state legislature created a state  agency, the Puget Sound Partnership, to oversee the restoration of the  Sound\u2019s environmental health. Other state agencies, such as the  Washington State Conservation Commission and the Departments of  Ecology, Fish and Wildlife, and Natural Resources, help fund and carry  out restoration-related work in the Puget Sound basin. At the federal  level, numerous agencies directly and indirectly support restoration efforts  by, for example, funding restoration projects, conducting research,  providing technical expertise to other entities, enforcing applicable laws  and regulations, and managing lands, such as national forests, that  provide habitat for salmon and other species. Local governments, tribal  entities, and nongovernmental organizations also support Puget Sound  restoration in various ways, such as by funding and implementing  restoration projects. In addition, Canadian agencies have been involved  in efforts to restore the broader Salish Sea\u2014of which Puget Sound is a  part\u2014including some joint efforts with federal and state agencies in the  United States.", "You asked us to review federal and nonfederal efforts to restore Puget  Sound.

We selected this period to allow us to  obtain information on a range of restoration efforts carried out in recent  years. In addition, we used the first phase of the survey to obtain  information on the availability of expenditure data for the federal and state  efforts and to help determine whether any limitations existed that would  affect the reliability of such data. In June 2017, we sent the first phase of  the survey to the 15 federal and 11 state entities that we determined had  participated in restoration efforts, and all of them responded. We used  the survey results in part to develop catalogs of federal and state efforts  that supported Puget Sound restoration from fiscal years 2012 through  2016. To obtain additional information about these efforts, we reviewed  documentation, such as agency websites and reports, and interviewed  agency officials.", "Based on the results of the first phase of the survey and additional follow- up interviews with agency officials, we determined that we would be  unable to collect sufficiently reliable data encompassing all federal and  state efforts to enable us to report on the total amount of expenditures  that have supported Puget Sound restoration. In particular, we  determined that data limitations, such as difficulties isolating expenditures  within the geographic boundaries of Puget Sound for some efforts, would  have made it difficult for us to collect consistent, reliable, and comparable  expenditure data across all of the federal and state entities. As a result of  the data limitations we identified, we limited our collection of expenditure  data to a nongeneralizable sample of three federal programs and one  state program to provide examples of the diversity in funding approaches  used to support Puget Sound restoration. We considered the following  factors in selecting these efforts: 1) the programs\u2019 prominence in Puget  Sound restoration, 2) variations in the federal and state entities involved  in carrying out these programs, 3) variations in their size, and 4) evidence  of reliable expenditure data. In addition, to help illustrate how funds are  used at the project level, we obtained expenditure data for two recently  completed restoration projects and conducted two site visits to observe  the outcomes of these projects. We assessed the reliability of the  expenditure data for the selected programs and projects by comparing  the data we obtained with data from other sources where possible,  reviewing agency documentation, and interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To examine how federal and nonfederal entities coordinate their  restoration efforts and their views on this coordination, we reviewed  agency documentation, interviewed agency officials, and used the second  phase of our survey of federal and state entities to obtain their views on  steps taken to coordinate restoration efforts. To obtain additional views,  we interviewed representatives from conservation, agricultural, and  fishing industry organizations and obtained written responses from two  Canadian agencies. We also held six moderated telephone discussion  groups with representatives from 15 tribal entities and 20 local entities.  We selected these tribal and local entities because of their involvement in  implementing restoration projects. We compared the information we  obtained on the coordination of Puget Sound restoration efforts with  selected leading collaboration practices that we have previously identified  and that were most relevant based on our initial audit work, such as  leadership, bridging organizational cultures, and the inclusion of relevant  participants.", "To examine the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound  restoration, we reviewed laws, regulations, and key restoration planning  documents. We obtained additional views on this topic from federal and  nonfederal entities through the second phase of our survey and  interviews described above. We compared this information with agency  guidance and leading practices for performance measurement and  reporting to determine whether efforts to assess Puget Sound restoration  progress have followed leading practices.", "To determine key factors, if any, federal and nonfederal entities identified  that may limit the success of Puget Sound restoration, we used the  second phase of our survey of federal and state entities and our  discussion groups to obtain views on factors that may pose a risk to the  success of restoration efforts. We also reviewed agency documentation  and used our interviews with the federal and nonfederal entities described  above to obtain additional views on limiting factors.

The basin covers more than  10,000 square miles, including about 2,800 square miles of inland marine  waters and thousands of rivers and streams. The Puget Sound basin  features a wide variety of land uses, including highly urbanized areas,  agricultural lands, large swaths of commercial forests, and areas that are  largely protected from development, such as national parks and wildlife  refuges.", "The Puget Sound Partnership has identified numerous environmental  stressors that threaten Puget Sound and that have impaired water quality.  In particular, the Partnership has reported that nonpoint sources of  pollution, such as polluted stormwater runoff from roads and agricultural  fields, are the biggest threats to Puget Sound water quality. Polluted  stormwater runoff can also threaten sources of drinking water and carries  toxic chemicals, nutrients, sediment, and bacteria into Puget Sound,  where these pollutants can harm aquatic life. For instance, a 2017 study  found that toxic stormwater runoff is linked to the high rates of adult coho  salmon mortality that have been observed in some urban streams in  central Puget Sound. Moreover, fish, shellfish, and other species that  are contaminated by toxic chemicals and other pollutants in Puget Sound  may subsequently pose a threat to other marine wildlife and to humans  that consume them. For example, in 2017 the Partnership reported that  approximately 16 percent of the roughly 225,000 acres managed for  commercial shellfish harvesting in Puget Sound were closed because of  water pollution caused by fecal bacteria from sources such as failing  septic systems and agricultural runoff. Such closures have economic  impacts, as Washington State is the country\u2019s leading producer of farmed  oysters, clams, and mussels, and much of this production comes from the  Puget Sound region. In addition, contaminated shellfish may pose  potential health threats to people who consume it, including tribes that  rely on shellfish for subsistence and ceremonial uses.", "Human activities have also degraded habitats that salmon and other  marine species depend on for survival. The Partnership has reported that  some of the primary threats to Puget Sound habitats include hardened  shorelines (such as shorelines that have been armored with seawalls),  filled estuaries, channelized rivers, and altered floodplains. These  threats affect habitats in various ways. For example, according to a 2018  Washington State report, seawalls interfere with natural coastal  processes and cause beaches to erode, which in turn can decrease and  degrade habitat for fish, birds, and wildlife. The report states that about  27 percent of the shoreline in Puget Sound has been armored by  structures such as seawalls. Figure 2 illustrates the sources of water  quality impairment and habitat degradation in the Puget Sound basin.", "Federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species  Act, play a role in addressing water quality issues and habitat degradation  in Puget Sound. The Clean Water Act\u2019s objective is to restore and  maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation\u2019s  waters. A 1987 amendment to the act created the National Estuary  Program to, among other things, identify nationally significant estuaries  that are threatened by pollution, development, or overuse, and promote  comprehensive planning for, and conservation and management of, such  estuaries. The National Estuary Program calls for management  conferences to be convened for designated estuaries of national  significance to, among other things, develop a comprehensive  conservation and management plan (CCMP). The current CCMP for  Puget Sound is The 2016 Action Agenda for Puget Sound, a document  developed to meet both federal and state requirements. By federal  statute, when selecting estuaries and convening management  conferences, EPA is to give priority consideration to certain named  estuaries, including Puget Sound. Under the act, EPA also works with  Washington State to regulate water quality.", "The Endangered Species Act was enacted to, among other things,  provide a means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered  and threatened species depend and to provide a program for the  conservation of such species. Several species in the Puget Sound basin  are listed as endangered or threatened, including bull trout, Chinook  salmon, Southern Resident Killer Whales (a population that spends  spring, summer, and fall months in the Salish Sea, including Puget  Sound), northern spotted owl, and steelhead trout.", "In addition to environmental laws that relate to Puget Sound waters and  species, tribal treaty rights play an important role in restoration efforts  within the basin\u2019s watersheds. In particular, 19 federally recognized tribes  are within the Puget Sound basin, and many of them have explicit treaty  rights to the fish in Puget Sound waters. In 1974, a federal court held that  the treaty tribes had the right to take up to 50 percent of the harvestable  fish in areas where fishing rights had been reserved, an allocation upheld  by the Supreme Court in 1979. In 1994, a federal court stated that tribes  were also entitled to take half of the harvestable shellfish on most  Washington beaches. According to several federal officials we  interviewed, considerations relating to tribal treaty fishing rights have  served as an important catalyst for some federal agencies\u2019 restoration  activities, particularly with regard to restoring and protecting habitat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Entities Carried Out Numerous Efforts that Supported Puget Sound Restoration Using a Variety of Funding Sources, but Total Expenditures Are Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state entities we surveyed identified numerous federal and  state efforts that, in whole or in part, supported Puget Sound restoration  from fiscal years 2012 through 2016.

Appendix II  lists the restoration efforts identified by federal entities, and appendix III  lists the restoration efforts identified by state entities. According to the  survey responses, the federal and state entities often worked with local  governments, tribal entities, and nongovernmental organizations to carry  out these efforts. These efforts primarily involved six types of restoration  activities (see table 1).", "The federal and state restoration efforts carried out during this time period  varied in geographic scope. Some of the efforts survey respondents  reported focused exclusively on the Puget Sound basin, such as  Washington State\u2019s Puget Sound Acquisition and Restoration Fund.  According to agency fact sheets, this fund has helped state agencies,  local governments, and others carry out projects that address high-priority  salmon habitat protection and restoration needs in Puget Sound. Other  efforts that supported restoration activities in Puget Sound during the time  frame we reviewed have a broader national, regional, or statewide focus.  For example, EPA\u2019s section 319 nonpoint source management program  is a nationwide program that supports state and tribal efforts to address  nonpoint sources of pollution. Within Puget Sound, EPA\u2019s data show  that the section 319 program has supported activities such as carrying out  projects that target nonpoint source pollution from urban areas,  agricultural lands, and marinas.", "The federal and state restoration efforts survey respondents identified  also varied in programmatic scope, with some efforts focusing exclusively  on restoration-related activities and other efforts supporting such activities  within a broader scope of work. Through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service\u2019s National Coastal Wetland Conservation Grant Program,  Washington State carried out activities specifically aimed at restoring  wetlands, estuaries, and marshes in Puget Sound. In contrast, some  efforts survey respondents cited had a broader scope of work that did not  center directly on restoration but included some activities that also  benefited Puget Sound restoration. One such effort was the Natural  Resources Conservation Service\u2019s Environmental Quality Incentives  Program, which helps farmers carry out conservation practices on  agricultural land.

According to EPA\u2019s website, this  program aims to protect and restore the water quality and ecological  integrity of designated estuaries of national significance, such as  Puget Sound. EPA Region 10 officials stated that the agency uses  funds from this program in conjunction with funds from EPA\u2019s Puget  Sound Geographic Program to support restoration efforts. According  to data provided by EPA, these programs together expended about  $142 million for activities in Puget Sound from fiscal years 2012  through 2016. EPA provided most of these funds through grants to  state and tribal entities. According to EPA Region 10 officials we  interviewed, EPA requires an overall dollar-for-dollar nonfederal  match for these grants, and the officials stated that the National  Estuary Program funds have been leveraged to obtain significant  nonfederal funding support for Puget Sound restoration efforts. For  example, the Floodplains by Design program, a joint effort led by The  Nature Conservancy and state agencies to restore natural floodplain  functions, has used National Estuary Program funds to help leverage  nonfederal funding support, according to the EPA officials.", "NOAA\u2019s Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. Under this  program, NOAA awards funds through grants to state and tribal  entities to carry out salmon recovery activities in five western states.  In Washington State, NOAA provided funds to the Washington State  Recreation and Conservation Office and the Northwest Indian  Fisheries Commission for use in Puget Sound and other areas.  According to data and estimates provided by NOAA, as of November  2017 these entities had expended or allocated about $59 million from  this program for activities in the Puget Sound basin from fiscal years  2012 through 2016. This program requires a 33 percent match from  state agencies, such as the Washington State Recreation and  Conservation Office, that receive funds, and NOAA officials we  interviewed said that Washington State usually exceeds this matching  requirement. For example, a 2015 NOAA report cites a habitat  restoration project in Puget Sound that received about $117,000 from  the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund and secured an additional  $1.75 million in matching and other funds.", "Corps\u2019 Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters Restoration Program.  Under this program, the Corps carries out habitat restoration projects  in Puget Sound in conjunction with nonfederal entities, such as cities.

As of November 2017, the  Corps had expended approximately $12 million over the life of the  program on five restoration projects, according to data provided by the  Corps. This program includes a cost-sharing requirement for the  participating nonfederal entity to contribute at least 35 percent of the  total project costs.", "Survey respondents cited nonfederal funds as the exclusive source of  funding for about one-third of the state efforts presented in appendix III.  For example, Washington State\u2019s Puget Sound Acquisition and  Restoration Fund, which the Partnership and the Washington State  Recreation and Conservation Office jointly manage, has been a  significant source of nonfederal funding for habitat restoration projects.  According to expenditure data provided by the Partnership, the Puget  Sound Acquisition and Restoration Fund expended approximately $100  million on restoration projects throughout Puget Sound from state fiscal  years 2012 through 2016. In its response to our survey, the Recreation  and Conservation Office stated that these projects included culvert  replacements, levee setbacks, and acquisition of important habitat,  among other things.", "When carrying out specific restoration projects in Puget Sound, federal  and nonfederal officials we interviewed said that project managers may  need to secure funds from multiple federal and nonfederal sources, such  as the federal and state programs discussed above. According to tribal  and local participants in our discussion groups, their experiences carrying  out restoration projects has similarly shown a need to piece together  multiple sources of funding for some projects. The discussion group  participants said that this need commonly arises with expensive and  complex projects that take a long time to complete, as reflected in the  project examples below that involved tribal and local entities.", "Qwuloolt Estuary Restoration Project. According to a project fact  sheet and officials, this project restored more than 350 acres of  estuary habitat in the Snohomish River Delta that had previously been  converted into farmland. By breaching existing levees and taking  other actions to reestablish natural stream channels and allow for tidal  inundation of the historic floodplain, this project aimed to restore  salmon habitat and improve water quality in the estuary (see fig. 3). In  2016, NOAA reported that this project had led to improvements in  salmon abundance, productivity, and diversity. The Tulalip Tribes of  Washington served as the overall project manager and worked with  numerous federal, state, and local partners to complete this project,  which took more than 20 years and ended in 2015. According to tribal  data, this project cost about $21 million and received funding from  more than 20 federal, state, tribal, and local sources.

However, we found that the total amount of  expenditures incurred for Puget Sound restoration across all federal and  nonfederal efforts for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is unknown. We  identified two primary barriers to determining the total amount of  expenditures. First, data limitations present challenges to obtaining  accurate and consistent expenditure data across entities. For example,  federal and state agency officials said that for some national and  statewide programs, it is difficult to isolate expenditures specific to the  Puget Sound basin or to quantify expenditures related to staff time that  supported restoration-related activities. Second, no comprehensive  database of Puget Sound restoration activities and expenditures exists.  This issue was identified by the Washington State Joint Legislative Audit  and Review Committee in its 2017 audit of the Puget Sound Partnership,  which recommended that the Partnership and the Washington State  Office of Financial Management develop a plan to create a more  complete inventory of restoration efforts and related funding. Both  agencies concurred with the recommendation, and the Partnership  reported in December 2017 that a more complete inventory of efforts and  funding would significantly enhance the agency\u2019s ability to prioritize  actions and recommend strategic investments.

For example, the Qwuloolt Estuary  Restoration Project we previously discussed was largely led by a local  tribe that coordinated the involvement of numerous federal, state, local,  and nongovernmental entities throughout project planning, permitting, and  implementation.", "The management conference recognizes nine local integrating  organizations\u2014local groups made up of various local, tribal, and other  nonfederal participants\u2014to, among other things, guide the  implementation of the CCMP\u2019s priorities at a local scale in specific  geographic areas of Puget Sound. In addition, 15 salmon recovery lead  entities, which are local watershed-based organizations that develop local  salmon habitat recovery strategies and manage projects to implement the  strategies, are active in the Puget Sound region. Representatives from  these local integrating organizations, salmon recovery lead entities, and  tribal entities participated in our moderated discussion groups and  identified several factors that have helped to facilitate effective  collaboration among entities on restoration projects. Some of the factors  discussion group participants commonly cited were consistent with key  features that we have previously identified as benefiting interagency  collaboration, including:  Involving all relevant participants. Discussion group participants  highlighted the importance of ensuring that the appropriate entities are  involved to bring together a broad range of knowledge, skills, and  expertise in support of restoration projects. For example, one  discussion group participant commented that his local organization\u2019s  ability to partner with both government and nongovernmental entities  and harness their talents has enhanced its efficiency in carrying out  restoration projects. Other participants stated that an important part of  successfully involving all relevant participants has been early  engagement with members of the local community to identify priorities  and vet projects. In addition, several participants described projects  that could not have been carried out without the financial, technical,  and political support of diverse partners. Ensuring that the appropriate  entities are involved is consistent with our previous work on  interagency collaboration, which found that it is important to ensure  that all relevant participants have been included in collaborative  efforts, including federal agencies, state and local entities, and  organizations from the private and nonprofit sectors.", "Bridging organizational cultures to build trust. Discussion group  participants cited the long-standing relationships that have been built  over time among different restoration partners as critical to developing  the level of trust needed for project-level collaboration to succeed  across organizational boundaries. For example, one participant said  that having long-standing collaborative relationships with other  partners has helped her local organization identify, secure funding for,  and carry out good restoration projects. Another participant described  a separate example of a local watershed council that has met monthly  for 30 years, explaining that these meetings have developed a level of  trust among the key partners that helps them work toward common  goals and deal with difficult issues. We have previously reported that  different agencies participating in any collaborative mechanism bring  diverse organizational cultures to it. Accordingly, it is important to  address these differences to enable a cohesive working relationship  and to create the mutual trust required to enhance and sustain the  collaborative effort. We have also reported that positive working  relationships among participants from different agencies help to  bridge organizational cultures, build trust, and foster communication,  which then facilitates collaboration.", "Having written plans and agreements. Discussion group  participants also described the benefits that have resulted from having  local plans and agreements in place to help entities work together  across their normal jurisdictions on restoration projects. For example,  according to one local discussion group participant, the decades-old  formal agreement among the local governments within his watershed  was a fundamental reason for the restoration successes they  achieved. The participant explained that this agreement has helped  the local governments look beyond their immediate jurisdictions and  think more broadly about priorities for the entire watershed. We have  previously reported that agencies that articulate their agreements in  formal documents can strengthen their commitment to working  collaboratively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Federal and Nonfederal Entities, the Steps Taken to Coordinate Restoration Efforts Have Yielded Benefits, but Challenges Remain that May Limit Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Federal and nonfederal entities we surveyed and interviewed identified  benefits produced by the steps taken to coordinate restoration efforts,  including the development of the management conference, the federal  task force, and their respective planning documents. Federal and  nonfederal officials generally described the management conference as  having provided an effective forum for different entities to share their  diverse views and work collaboratively to address priority restoration  issues in Puget Sound. Moreover, officials said that the management  conference has helped Puget Sound restoration by enabling federal and  nonfederal entities to identify common goals and develop strategies to  achieve the goals, among other things.", "These benefits are consistent with our previous work on interagency  collaboration, which found that defining and articulating common  outcomes and establishing strategies to achieve them are practices that  can enhance and sustain collaboration. Federal officials credited the  federal task force, and in particular the task force regional teams, with  having helped to improve communication and coordination of efforts  among federal agencies by bringing together a broad group of agencies  to focus on issues surrounding Puget Sound restoration and tribal treaty  rights. Other benefits of the task force that survey respondents identified  include providing national-level awareness of restoration activities and  providing a forum for nonfederal entities to engage with federal agencies  on restoration or species-related issues.", "Federal and nonfederal entities also identified strengths of the key  planning documents that the management conference and federal task  force developed to help coordinate Puget Sound restoration efforts,  based on our interviews and our analysis of survey responses. For example, 8 of the 27 federal and state entities that responded to our  survey said the 2016 CCMP provides a clear blueprint or road map for the  restoration of Puget Sound that helps guide restoration efforts in a  common direction. In the case of the draft Federal Action Plan, survey  respondents from 7 of the 27 federal and state entities said that one of  the plan\u2019s primary strengths is that it clearly defines a list of priority  federal actions and identifies roles and responsibilities for implementing  them. This is consistent with our previous work on interagency  collaboration, which found that agreeing on roles and responsibilities is a  leading practice that can help enhance and sustain collaborative efforts.  In addition, one federal survey respondent credited the development of  the draft Federal Action Plan with helping to raise awareness among  federal agencies of each other\u2019s efforts, which the respondent said has  led to improved coordination.", "Federal and nonfederal entities also identified challenges the  management conference faces that could limit its effectiveness as an  interagency coordinating group. For example, according to Partnership  officials we interviewed, within the management conference there are  differing views and disagreements about how to balance local versus  regional perspectives and decision-making authorities. In addition, some  federal and nonfederal entities described the planning process to produce  the CCMP as overly burdensome and frustrating. The Joint Legislative  Audit and Review Committee\u2019s 2017 audit of the Partnership similarly  reported on frustration and planning fatigue among the entities they  interviewed that stemmed from the frequency of plan updates, which state  law had required take place every 2 years. In 2017, Washington State  amended the law to extend the required planning cycle to every 4 years,  which the Partnership said should result in a more effective use of time  for the agency and its partners.", "We also found, through our analysis of agency documents and interviews  with federal officials, that the federal task force faced an additional  challenge that it has since addressed. Specifically, the federal task force  did not have continuous leadership at the national level because the task  force\u2019s national leadership group was inactive for more than a year  beginning in January 2017. During this time, CEQ, the permanent co- chair of the national-level task force leadership group, did not convene  the group for meetings, and there was uncertainty about who would  represent some agencies after the change in administration and  subsequent changes in agency personnel, according to officials from the  task force agencies. EPA Region 10 officials said that the federal task  force\u2019s regional implementation team remained active during this period  and facilitated continued engagement among federal agencies and  nonfederal partners at the regional level. Nevertheless, without an active  national-level leadership group in place, the federal agencies did not have  a fully functioning task force and were not in a position to fulfill some of  the task force\u2019s responsibilities under the memorandum of understanding,  such as approving a federal action plan.", "In April 2018, a senior CEQ official informed us that CEQ had taken  action in response to our discussions with CEQ staff about this challenge  and convened a meeting of the national-level task force group on April 4,  2018. In addition, according to the CEQ official, the task force agencies  have committed to working together going forward and plan to continue  meeting. By working with the other federal agencies to hold this meeting  and secure this commitment, CEQ has taken an important step toward  addressing the challenge we identified and ensuring that national-level  leadership is in place for the federal task force."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The CCMP Lays Out a Framework for Assessing Progress toward Puget Sound Restoration, but Assessment of Progress Has Been Limited in Some Instances", "paragraphs": ["The CCMP lays out the primary framework for assessing progress toward  Puget Sound restoration, including six high-level goals created by state  law and a variety of associated indicators and targets.

EPA also stated that progress has been made to evaluate the  current set of indicators and vital signs as a result of a 2017 project led by  the Partnership and that recommendations from that project will inform  both adjustments to the current set of indicators and future target setting.", "In addition, EPA agreed with our recommendation to work with the  appropriate members of the federal task force regional implementation  team to clearly link the Federal Action Plan\u2019s priority federal actions to the  CCMP\u2019s framework for assessing progress, and the agency highlighted  steps it will take to do so. EPA stated that it has already met with the  federal task force\u2019s regional leadership and implementation teams and  reached agreement to review the Federal Action Plan and specify how  each action connects to the vital signs and other elements of the CCMP.  EPA stated this this crosswalk process will begin in January 2019 after  the updated CCMP is approved.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Chair of CEQ; the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce,  Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Transportation; the  Administrator of EPA; the Executive Director of the Puget Sound  Partnership; and other interested parties.

To help us understand the legal framework supporting restoration efforts  across these four objectives, we reviewed selected relevant federal and  state laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act,  and Washington State law governing Puget Sound water quality  protection and establishing the Puget Sound Partnership.", "To examine Puget Sound restoration efforts and related expenditures for  fiscal years 2012 through 2016, we used the first phase of a two-phase  survey to identify federal and state efforts that supported Puget Sound  restoration during this time frame. We selected this period to allow us to  obtain information on a range of restoration efforts carried out in recent  years. In addition, we used the first phase of the survey to obtain  information on the availability of expenditure data for the federal and state  efforts and to help determine whether any limitations existed that would  affect the reliability of such data. As part of developing the first phase of  the survey, we conducted a pretest with the Partnership to check that the  questions were clear and used terminology correctly and to ensure that  we could obtain the requested information without placing an undue  burden on agency officials. We sent the first phase of the survey to 15  federal and 11 state entities in June 2017, and all of them responded. We  identified the 15 federal entities based on their participation in the Puget  Sound Federal Caucus, a group formed of regional federal entities in  2007 to help coordinate federal restoration efforts in Puget Sound. The  federal entities were the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Federal Emergency  Management Agency, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit  Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  National Park Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army Joint Base Lewis-McChord, U.S.  Coast Guard, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and  the U.S. Navy. We identified the 11 Washington State entities based on  our review of the comprehensive conservation and management plan  (CCMP)\u2014called The 2016 Action Agenda for Puget Sound\u2014and our  discussions with federal and state officials. The state entities were the  Office of Financial Management, Puget Sound Partnership, Recreation  and Conservation Office, Washington State Conservation Commission,  and the Washington Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Ecology,  Fish and Wildlife, Health, Natural Resources, and Transportation.", "In the first phase of our survey, we requested specific information on  federal and state efforts to support Puget Sound restoration. Table 2  summarizes the questions we are reporting on from the first phase of the  survey. We also asked other questions that we do not specifically report  on to provide additional context for the survey responses. For example,  we asked the respondents whether their agency managed each effort on  its own or jointly with other entities, and we asked whether their agency  had provided funding from each effort to other entities.", "We used the first-phase survey results in part to develop catalogs of  federal and state efforts that supported Puget Sound restoration from  fiscal years 2012 through 2016. To obtain additional information about the  federal and state efforts identified in the survey responses, we reviewed  documentation, such as agency websites and reports, and interviewed  agency officials. We incorporated this additional information as  appropriate in the catalogs, and we then asked each entity to verify the  accuracy of the information presented in the catalogs. Appendix II  presents the catalog of federal efforts, and appendix III presents the  catalog of state efforts.", "Based on the results of the first phase of the survey and additional follow- up interviews with agency officials, we determined that we would be  unable to collect sufficiently reliable data to report on the total amount of  expenditures that have supported Puget Sound restoration. In particular,  we identified data limitations that would make it difficult for us to collect  consistent, reliable, and comparable expenditure data across all of the  federal and state entities\u2019 efforts. These limitations included difficulties  isolating expenditures within the geographic boundaries of Puget Sound  for some efforts, difficulties isolating expenditures that supported  restoration activities as opposed to other purposes, and difficulties  quantifying administrative expenses, such as staff salaries and travel  expenses, associated with specific efforts.", "As a result of these limitations, we limited our collection of expenditure  data to a nongeneralizable sample of three federal programs and one  state program to provide examples of the diversity in funding approaches  used to support Puget Sound restoration. We considered the following  factors in selecting these efforts: 1) their prominence in Puget Sound  restoration, 2) variations in the federal and state entities involved in  carrying them out, 3) variations in their size, and 4) evidence of reliable  expenditure data. In addition, to help illustrate how federal and nonfederal  funds are used together at the project level, we interviewed agency  officials and obtained expenditure data for two recently completed  restoration projects. We selected these projects because they had  received funding from a variety of federal and nonfederal sources and  illustrated how federal and nonfederal entities work together to carry out  restoration projects. We also conducted two site visits to observe the  outcomes of these projects. We assessed the reliability of the expenditure  data for these program and project examples by comparing the data we  obtained with data from other sources where possible, reviewing agency  documentation, and interviewing knowledgeable agency officials. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine how federal and nonfederal entities coordinate their  restoration efforts in Puget Sound and their views on this coordination, we  identified two key groups that coordinate among federal, state, local,  tribal, and nongovernmental entities: the state-led Puget Sound  Management Conference and the Puget Sound Federal Task Force,  which replaced the Puget Sound Federal Caucus in 2016. We analyzed  key restoration-related documentation, including the CCMP developed by  the management conference and the federal task force\u2019s draft The Puget  Sound Federal Task Force Action Plan (Fiscal Years 2017-2021) (Federal  Action Plan). We also interviewed officials from EPA and the Council on  Environmental Quality about the implementation of the federal task force.  In August 2017, we sent the second phase of our survey to the 15 federal  and 11 state entities that had received the first phase, as well as to the  Washington State Governor\u2019s Office, to obtain their views on the  coordination of restoration efforts and we received responses from all of  the entities. The second phase of the survey featured, among other  things, a series of open-ended and closed-ended questions about the role  of the management conference and the federal task force in helping to  coordinate restoration efforts and about the strengths and shortcomings  of the CCMP and the draft Federal Action Plan. We refined the second  phase of the survey based on pretests we conducted with two federal  agencies and two state agencies to ensure that the questions were clear  and used terminology correctly and that we could obtain the requested  information without placing an undue burden on agency officials.", "Table 3 summarizes the questions we are reporting on from the second  phase of the survey. We also asked other questions that we do not  specifically report on to provide additional context for the survey  responses. For example, we asked the respondents to identify what  steps, if any, could be taken to improve the management conference and  the federal task force, and we asked whether any entities were missing  from these groups that should be included.", "We also held six moderated discussion groups, three with tribal  representatives and three with local representatives, to obtain their views  on factors that have helped and hindered their ability to implement  restoration projects, including factors related to coordination. We selected  the tribal and local entities to participate in the discussion groups because  of their involvement in implementing restoration projects. We invited all 19  federally recognized tribes in the Puget Sound basin to participate in our  discussion groups, as well as two tribal consortia that support restoration  efforts. Representatives from 15 of these tribal entities participated in the  tribal discussion groups. For the three local discussion groups, we  invited all 9 local integrating organizations and all 15 salmon recovery  lead entities within the Puget Sound basin to participate.  Representatives from 7 of the local integrating organizations and 13 of  the salmon recovery lead entities participated in the three local discussion  groups.", "We conducted the six moderated discussion groups over the telephone in  May and June 2017. During each discussion group, the GAO moderator  asked participants to list factors that, in their experience, had helped their  tribal or local entity implement restoration projects in Puget Sound, as well as factors that hindered their ability to do so. The moderator then  asked participants to elaborate on how the factors had helped or hindered  the implementation of restoration projects. When necessary, the  moderator asked probing questions to further clarify participants\u2019  comments. Two or three analysts transcribed each session and combined  and reconciled notes to develop transcripts for each of the discussion  groups. We analyzed the transcripts from the six discussion groups using  qualitative analysis software to categorize the factors that helped and  hindered the implementation of restoration projects. Prominent factors  identified in the discussion groups that we discuss in the body of the  report include factors related to administration and management,  coordination, and resources. Other factors, such as laws and regulations,  public awareness, and science were also raised to a lesser extent, and  we do not discuss these in the body of the report.", "To obtain additional views on the coordination of Puget Sound restoration  efforts, we interviewed federal and state agency officials as well as  representatives from conservation, agricultural, and fishing industry  organizations. We also obtained written responses from two Canadian  agencies about their coordination of restoration activities with entities in  the United States. We compared the information we obtained on the  coordination of Puget Sound restoration efforts with selected leading  collaboration practices that we previously identified and that were most  relevant based on our initial audit work, such as leadership, bridging  organizational cultures, and the inclusion of relevant participants. We  also assessed federal entities\u2019 implementation of the memorandum of  understanding that established the federal task force.", "To examine the framework for assessing progress toward Puget Sound  restoration, we reviewed laws, regulations, and key documents, such as  the CCMP and the draft Federal Action Plan. We also reviewed the  Partnership\u2019s documentation on the results of its assessments of  restoration progress. We identified some limitations associated with these  results and noted those in our report where appropriate. We obtained  additional views on efforts to assess progress from federal and  nonfederal entities through the second phase of our survey and  interviews described previously. For example, in the second phase of the  survey, we asked the federal and state entities about their views on  efforts to assess progress under the CCMP and the draft Federal Action  Plan and about their views on the sufficiency of monitoring efforts in  Puget Sound. We compared the information obtained through these steps  with EPA\u2019s National Estuary Program guidance and with leading practices  for performance measurement and reporting to determine whether efforts  to assess Puget Sound restoration progress have followed leading  practices.", "To determine key factors, if any, federal and nonfederal entities identified  that may limit the success of Puget Sound restoration, we used the  second phase of our survey, which we described above, and our  discussion groups to obtain views on factors that may pose a risk to the  success of restoration efforts. We also reviewed the CCMP and other  documentation and used our interviews with the federal and nonfederal  entities described above to obtain views on limiting factors. In addition,  we reviewed our prior work on large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts in  other parts of the country, such as in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake  Bay, to compare the key factors we identified in Puget Sound with factors  that may limit restoration efforts that we identified in our past reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
