It is also the first in a series of annual steps that will determine whether IRS meets its new long-term goals of increasing tax compliance and reducing taxpayers' acceptance of cheating on their taxes. Tax law enforcement remains on GAO's list of high-risk federal programs, in part, because of the persistence of a large tax gap. IRS recently estimated the gross tax gap, the difference between what taxpayers owe and what they voluntarily pay, to be $345 billion for 2001.

More refunds were directly deposited, which is faster and more convenient. Electronic filing continued to grow, but at a slower rate than in previous years. IRS's two most commonly used services--telephone and Web site assistance--continued to improve. IRS estimates that the accuracy rate for its telephone answers is now 90 percent or more. Taxpayers continued the recent pattern of using IRS's walk-in sites less and community based volunteer sites more. The 2007 budget request of $11 billion, a small decrease after adjusting for inflation, sets performance goals for service and enforcement that are all equal to or higher than the 2006 goals. The budget reduces funding by 15 percent for Business Systems Modernization, the ongoing effort to replace IRS's aging information systems. The reduction could impede progress delivering improvements to taxpayers. The budget request identifies over $121 million in savings; however, opportunities exist for further savings. For example, IRS officials told us that IRS's 25 call centers have underutilized space. Those centers could be consolidated without affecting service to taxpayers. Achieving IRS's long-term compliance goals will be challenging because the tax gap has persisted for many years at about its current level. In addition, because the effect of taxpayer service and enforcement on compliance has never been quantified, IRS does not have a data-based plan demonstrating how it will achieve its goals. Nor does IRS have a plan for measuring compliance by 2009, the date for achieving the goals.

Increased funding financed some of the  improvements, but a significant portion has been financed internally  through efficiencies from increased electronic filing of tax returns and  other operational improvements.", "IRS has also increased revenue collected through its enforcement  programs; however, tax law enforcement continues to be included on our  list of high-risk federal programs. This is due, in part, to the persistence of  a large tax gap.  IRS estimated the gross tax gap to be $345 billion for tax  year 2001. After late payments by taxpayers and revenue brought in by  IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts, the resulting net tax gap is estimated to be $290  billion. Even modest progress in reducing the tax gap would yield  significant revenue; each 1 percent reduction would likely yield nearly $3  billion annually.", "If its 2007 budget request is a harbinger of longer term funding, IRS faces  an era of tight budgets. Consequently, continued performance  improvements will depend on the extent to which IRS can make more  efficient use of limited resources to provide internal funding for the  improvements. By indicating how resources are allocated to specific  programs and activities within the agency, the budget request is a key  planning tool showing where the agency intends to achieve additional  efficiencies.", "The 2007 budget request is also an indication of how IRS intends to  achieve longer term goals. For the first time, IRS lists two agencywide  long-term goals: to increase the compliance rate and reduce the proportion  of taxpayers who think it is acceptable to cheat on their taxes. This  budget can be viewed as a first step in a series of annual steps that will  determine whether IRS achieves these long-term goals.", "Our statement discusses IRS\u2019s 2006 filing season performance to date and  fiscal year 2007 budget request. To address your request, we assessed (1)  the interim results of IRS\u2019s 2006 filing season performance compared to  prior years; (2) IRS\u2019s budget request compared to prior years; and (3) how  the budget helps IRS achieve its long-term goals aimed at reducing the tax  gap.", "Our assessment of the interim results of IRS\u2019s filing season is based on  comparing IRS\u2019s performance this year to prior filing seasons, monitoring  various production meetings and production statistics, reviewing other  IRS documents and reports, interviewing IRS and Treasury Inspector  General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) officials and paid tax  practitioners and other external stakeholders, reviewing TIGTA and other  external reports, and reviewing IRS\u2019s Web site. Our assessment of the  budget request is based on a comparative analysis of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2002  (in most cases) through 2007 budget requests, funding, expenditures, and  other documentation and interviews with IRS officials. We used historical  budget and performance data from reports and budget requests used by  the IRS, Department of the Treasury, and Office of Management and  Budget. In past work, we assessed IRS\u2019s budget and performance data.  Since the data sources and procedures for producing this year\u2019s budget  and performance data have not significantly changed from prior years, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  statement. The budget and performance data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007  are subject to change as IRS revises its estimates. We did not verify IRS\u2019s  estimates for enforcement revenue and the tax gap. IRS presents tax gap  information as supplemental information in its financial statements; that  information is not required to be audited. However, we have been involved  in tax gap methodology briefings, and the TIGTA has an ongoing review of  the accuracy of IRS\u2019s tax gap estimates. Additionally, our analysis of IRS\u2019s  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) program was based primarily  upon the results of our detailed review of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 BSM  expenditure plan in a recent report. We performed our work in  Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, Georgia, from January 2006 through April  2006, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "Our statement makes these key points:  IRS has improved its 2006 filing season performance to date in  important areas compared to last year, continuing a recent trend. IRS\u2019s  returns processing has gone smoothly and over 70 percent of refunds  are now directly deposited to taxpayers\u2019 bank accounts, which is faster,  more convenient and less costly than issuing paper checks. Electronic  filing continues to grow, but at a slower rate. So far this filing season,  electronic filing has grown 2.4 percent compared to 4.3 percent  annually for the previous two years. According to IRS officials, the  slower rate of growth is due, in part, to new income limits in the Free  File program, which reduced the number of taxpayers eligible to file  electronically for free via IRS\u2019s Web site, and the termination of the  TeleFile program, which eliminated electronic filing by phone.  Telephone assistance has improved this year, in part, due to lower call  volume. The percentage of taxpayers attempting to reach an IRS  telephone assistor and who actually received service increased 1  percentage point to 84 percent this filing season and the length of time  taxpayers waited to get their calls answered decreased from 235  seconds to 182 seconds. The accuracy of IRS\u2019s responses to tax law  and account questions improved\u2014both are now at 90 percent or more.  IRS\u2019s Web site is being used more, is performing well based on third- party evaluations, and has been reconfigured with the goal of  improving taxpayer service. Taxpayers continued the recent pattern of  using IRS\u2019s walk-in sites less, and using sites run by community-based  organizations and staffed by volunteers more.", "IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2007 proposed budget is $11 billion, which is a small  decrease compared to the 2006 enacted level after adjusting for  expected inflation.  For service, the budget proposes to cut staffing by  4 percent. For enforcing tax laws, the budget proposes to cut staffing  by 2 percent. However, for service and enforcement, the budget sets  performance goals for 2007 that are higher than or equal to those for  2006. For maintaining and operating IRS\u2019s existing information systems  (IS), the 2007 budget request shows an increase in resources when  compared to the 2006 enacted budget. However, when compared to the  level currently assumed for 2006, the 2007 budget request leaves Full- time Equivalents (FTE) for IS virtually constant. For the BSM program,  which is the ongoing effort to replace the agency\u2019s aging information  systems, the budget proposes to reduce spending by about 15 percent.  This reduction could delay delivery of improved services for taxpayers.  As it has in prior years, IRS\u2019s budget request identifies savings\u2014the  2007 budget proposes to save over $121 million and 1,424 FTEs.  However, additional opportunities exist for savings. One is to increase  electronic filing by additional use of mandates. IRS currently mandates  electronic filing by large corporations and 12 states currently mandate  electronic filing of individual income tax returns by certain tax  preparers. Another opportunity is to consolidate IRS\u2019s 25 telephone call  sites. IRS officials told us that the call sites have space that is not used  for 850 staff. Call sites could be consolidated without affecting service  to taxpayers. Finally, IRS has long been hampered by a lack of current  and accurate cost information for making resource allocation  decisions. IRS recently implemented components of a cost accounting  system, but needs to continue gathering the cost data needed to make  it an effective planning tool.", "IRS\u2019s budget request sets two long-term goals: increasing the rate of  voluntary compliance from 83 percent to 85 percent by 2009 and  reducing the percentage of taxpayers who think it is acceptable to  cheat on their taxes from 10 percent to 9 percent in 2008. These goals  will be challenging to meet because the tax gap has persisted at a  relatively stable level of 81 to 84 percent for many years. However,  because the effect of taxpayer service and enforcement on compliance  has never been quantified, IRS does not have a data-based plan  demonstrating how it will use its programs to achieve its goals and  reduce the tax gap. Nor does IRS have a plan for measuring compliance  by 2009. Reducing the tax gap will likely require new and innovative  solutions such as simplifying the tax code, increasing income subject to  withholding, and increasing information reporting about income. IRS\u2019s  budget request includes several proposals for increasing compliance  that would not require additional resources for IRS. For example, the  Department of the Treasury plans to study, and we have long  supported, clarifying the definition of independent contractors and  requiring additional information reporting on their income, steps that  could increase tax revenue by billions of dollars."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Filing Season Performance to Date Has Improved in Important Areas, Continuing a Recent Trend", "paragraphs": ["IRS improved its 2006 filing season performance in important areas that  affect large numbers of taxpayers.

Of those returns, 47 million returns were filed electronically (up  2.2 percent) and 16 million returns were filed on paper (down 9.8 percent).", "According to IRS data and officials, returns processing has gone smoothly  so far this filing season. IRS issued 56 million refunds, 40 million, or 71  percent, of which were directly deposited, up 3 percentage points over the  same period as last year. Direct deposit is faster, more convenient for  taxpayers, and less expensive for IRS than mailing paper checks.", "Because of the volume of tax returns, it is normal for IRS to experience  some processing disruptions, although this year, disruptions have not been  significant. For example, 13 different tax forms were unavailable for  electronic filing until February 1 due to the late hurricane relief legislation,  which caused a minor processing delay for some returns.", "Furthermore, IRS officials said that the new Customer Account Data  Engine (CADE), which is intended eventually to replace IRS\u2019s antiquated  Master File system containing taxpayer records, processed 4.3 million   returns and dispersed 3.8 million refunds, so far during the 2006 filing  season without disruptions. IRS is reporting that direct deposit refunds  and paper check refunds are being issued within 4 and 6 business days,  respectively, after tax returns are posted to CADE, which is faster than for  returns processed by the Master File system. CADE\u2019s growth in future  years will directly benefit taxpayers. Not only can it speed up refunds, but  it also updates taxpayer account information quicker than the Master File  system.", "Representatives of the taxpayer industry corroborated IRS\u2019s view that the  filing season is going smoothly. Groups and organizations that we talked  to included the National Association of Enrolled Agents, the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and others. In addition, the  TIGTA recently testified that thus far it has seen no significant problems  during the filing season.", "The growth of electronic filing is important, because it generates savings  by reducing staff years needed for labor intensive paper processing.  Between fiscal years 1999 and 2006, IRS reduced the number of staff years  devoted to paper and electronic processing by 1,586, or 34 percent as  shown in figure 1.", "Electronic filing continues to grow but at a slower rate than previous  years. This year\u2019s 2.4 percent rate of growth is less than the average annual  rate of growth of 4.3 percent for each of the preceding 2 years. According  to IRS officials, the slower growth in electronic filing this year is due, in  part, to changes in the Free File program, which reduced the number of  taxpayers eligible to file electronically for free this year and to reduced  advertising by companies involved in that program, and the termination of  the TeleFile program, which eliminated the way for taxpayers to file their  returns electronically via telephone.", "The Free File program enables taxpayers to file their returns electronically  via IRS\u2019s Web site. Through IRS\u2019s Web site, taxpayers can access the Web  sites of 20 companies comprising the Free File Alliance. The alliance is a  consortium of tax preparation companies that agreed to offer free return  preparation and electronic filing for taxpayers that meet certain criteria  (see app. 1 for further detail). In an amended agreement with IRS that took  effect this year, the Free File Alliance set a $50,000 income limitation on  taxpayer participation. This limit was absent last year and reduced the  number of taxpayers eligible to participate in the program. As of March 19,  2006, IRS processed about 2.9 million free file returns, which is a decrease  of 23 percent from the same period last year. This decline is inconsistent  with IRS\u2019s projection that it would receive 6 million tax returns filed  through the Free File program, almost a million more compared to last  year.", "For 2006, IRS terminated the TeleFile program. IRS expected that  eliminating TeleFile would reduce electronic filing, but justified the  decision because of declining usage and relatively high costs. The number  of taxpayers using the program had been decreasing\u2014from approximately  5.7 million in 1999 to 3.8 million in 2004. IRS estimated the cost per tax  return submitted through TeleFile, typically Form 1040EZ, to have been  $2.63 versus $1.51 for a return filed on paper, largely due to contractor,  telecommunications, and other costs. Given the limitations of IRS\u2019s cost  accounting system, the validity of these figures is unknown. IRS officials  stated that the reason for this year\u2019s increase in the number of 1040EZ  returns filed on paper is due, in part, to the elimination of TeleFile.  Through March 17, 2006, the number of 1040EZ returns has increased 18  percent from last year.", "Options for increasing electronic filing, in particular mandated electronic  filing, will be discussed in the budget section of this statement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Telephone Access and Accuracy Improved, in Part Due to Lower Call Volume", "paragraphs": ["Taxpayers\u2019 ability to access IRS\u2019s telephone assistors and the accuracy of  answers provided improved compared to previous years.

The call volume has been less than projected by IRS and less than  was assumed when IRS set staffing levels for telephone assistors for the  filing season. IRS officials offered several explanations for the unexpected  decline in call volume. One explanation is that more taxpayers are using  improved tax preparation software, which reduces their need to call IRS.  Another explanation is that more taxpayers are getting through to a  telephone assistor the first time they call, thus reducing the need for  taxpayers to call again.", "As shown in table 1, the percentage of taxpayers who attempted to reach  an assistor and actually got through and received service\u2014referred to as  the level of service\u2014was 84 percent so far this filing season compared to  83 percent over the same period last year\u2014and greater than its 2006 fiscal  year goal of 82 percent. According to IRS officials, one possible  explanation for the improvement in access is the decline in overall call  volume. When call volume decreases, taxpayers are likely to wait less time  to speak with an IRS telephone assistor. As a result, fewer taxpayers  would likely hang up, increasing the percentage of taxpayers who get  through to an assistor.", "IRS also reported that, so far this filing season, the average speed of  answer (length of time taxpayers wait to get their calls answered) is down  53 seconds from the same time last year to 182 seconds, a decrease of  about 23 percent, and significantly better than IRS\u2019s 2006 fiscal year goal  of 300 seconds. IRS also reported that the rate at which taxpayers  abandoned their calls to IRS decreased from 11.5 percent to 8.9 percent  compared to the same period last year.", "Using a statistical sampling process, IRS estimates that the accuracy of  telephone assistors\u2019 responses to taxpayers\u2019 tax law and account questions  improved compared to last year.

According to IRS  officials, the goal for reconfiguring the Web site was to improve overall  customer service through easier navigation and a more effective search  function. As a result, the number of Web site searches has decreased by 53  percent, from 76 million during the same period last year to 36 million this  year. Typically, search functions are used when users fail to find  information through links.

Walk-in site staffs also provide need-based tax return  preparation assistance, limited to taxpayers meeting certain  requirements. As of March 11, 2006, the total number of contacts at IRS\u2019s  walk-in sites declined by approximately 12 percent compared to last year.

The declines  in the number of taxpayers using IRS\u2019s walk-in sites, including for tax  return preparation, are also consistent with IRS\u2019s strategy to reduce its  costly face-to-face assistance by providing taxpayers with additional  options, such as IRS\u2019s toll-free telephone service, Web site, and numerous  volunteer sites. It is unclear, however, whether the declining volume is an  indicator of how well IRS is meeting taxpayers\u2019 demand for face-to-face  assistance. For example, IRS does keep track of the number of taxpayers  entering a walk-in site, taking a number to queue for service, but then  leaving the site without receiving service.

For example, IRS eliminated income limits for taxpayers seeking  return preparation assistance.", "In contrast to IRS walk-in sites, the number of taxpayers seeking return  preparation assistance at approximately 14,000 volunteer sites has  increased this year by 5.6 percent, continuing the trend since 2001 (see fig.  2). These sites, often run by community-based organizations and staffed by  volunteers who are trained and certified by IRS, do not offer the range of  services IRS provides at walk-in sites, but instead focus on preparing tax  returns primarily for low-income and elderly taxpayers and operate chiefly  during the filing season. As we have previously reported, the shift of  taxpayers from walk-in to volunteer sites is important because it has  allowed IRS to transfer time-consuming services, such as return  preparation, from IRS to other less costly alternatives that can be more  convenient for taxpayers.", "IRS has used both walk-in and volunteer sites to provide relief efforts for  federally-designated disaster zones such as in hurricane-affected areas.  IRS developed a Disaster Referral Services Guide and new training  materials for employees to better equip them to address disaster-related  issues. Also, IRS adjusted the type of tax law questions that it would  answer at walk-in sites to include casualty loss and removed income  limitations for disaster victims seeking return preparation assistance at  walk-in sites. Volunteer sites performed outreach within their network of  partners by creating training material for tax practitioners, and agreeing  with two organizations to accept referrals from IRS of disaster victims  needing tax return preparation assistance.", "Concerning the quality of services provided at walk-in and volunteer sites,  IRS continues to lack reliable and comprehensive data on the quality of  the services provided.

To address our recommendation, IRS agreed to  take a variety of actions, which it has made progress in implementing. For  example, IRS planned to develop a capital planning guide to implement  processes for capital planning and investment control, budget formulation  and execution, business case development, and project prioritization. In  August 2005, IRS issued the initial version of its IT Capital Planning and  Investment Control (CPIC) Process Guide, which (1) provides executives  with the framework within which to select, control, evaluate, and maintain  the portfolio of IT investments to best meet IRS business goals and (2)  defines the governance process that integrates the agency\u2019s IT investments  with the strategic planning, budgeting, and procurement processes.

For  example, BSM includes projects to allow taxpayers to file and retrieve  information electronically and to provide technology solutions to help  reduce the backlog of collections cases. It also helps IRS considerably in  providing the reliable and timely financial management information  needed to account for the nation\u2019s largest revenue stream and better  enable the agency to both determine and justify its resource allocation  decisions and budget requests.", "IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2007 budget request of $167.3 million for the BSM  program reflects a reduction of about 15 percent (and even greater when  adjusted for expected inflation), or about $30 million, from the enacted  fiscal year 2006 budget of $197 million.", "Since our testimony before this subcommittee on last year\u2019s budget  request, IRS has made further progress in implementing BSM, although  some key projects did not meet short-term cost and schedule  commitments. During 2005 and the beginning of 2006, IRS deployed  additional releases of several modernized systems that have delivered  benefits to taxpayers and the agency, including CADE, e-Services (a new  Web portal and electronic services for tax practitioners), and Modernized  e-File (a new electronic filing system). While three BSM project releases  were delivered within the cost and/or schedule commitments presented in  the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan, others experienced cost increases or  schedule delays. For example, two IFS and Modernized e-File project  releases experienced cost increases of 93 percent and 29 percent,  respectively. As we have previously reported, the BSM program has had a  history of cost increases and schedule delays that have been due, at least  in part, to deficiencies in various management controls and capabilities  that have not yet been fully corrected. IRS is in the process of  implementing our prior recommendations to correct these deficiencies.", "IRS has identified significant risks and issues that confront future planned  system deliveries. For example, according to IRS, schedule delays and  contention for key resources between multiple releases of CADE  necessitated the deferral of some functionality. The deferral of these  requirements may negatively impact the cost and schedule for two  important releases, which are planned to be deployed later this year. The  agency, however, recognizes the potential impact of these project risks on  its ability to deliver planned functionality within cost and schedule  estimates, and to its credit, has developed mitigation strategies to address  them. IRS has also made additional progress in addressing high-priority  BSM program improvement initiatives during the past year, including  initiatives related to shifting the role of systems integrator from the prime  contractor to IRS. IRS\u2019s program improvement process appears to be an  effective means of assessing, prioritizing, and addressing BSM issues and  challenges. However, much more work remains for the agency to fully  address these issues and challenges.", "In addition, in response to our prior recommendation, IRS is developing a  new Modernization Vision and Strategy to address BSM program changes  and provide a modernization roadmap. According to the Associate Chief  Information Officer for BSM, the agency\u2019s new strategy focuses on  promoting investments that provide value in smaller, incremental releases  that are delivered more frequently, with the goal of increasing business  value. IRS is currently finalizing a high-level vision and strategy as well as  a more detailed 5-year plan for the BSM program. We believe these actions  represent sound steps toward addressing our prior recommendation to  fully revisit the vision and strategy and develop a new set of long-term  goals, strategies, and plans consistent with the budgetary outlook and with  IRS\u2019s management capabilities.", "While the requested fiscal year 2007 BSM budget will allow IRS to  continue the development and deployment of the CADE, Modernized e- File, and Filing and Payment Compliance (F&PC) projects, the proposed  reduced funding level would likely affect the agency\u2019s ability to deliver the  functionality planned for the fiscal year and could result in project delays  and/or scope reductions. This could, in turn, impact the long-term pace  and cost of modernizing tax systems and of ultimately improving taxpayer  service and strengthening enforcement. For example, according to IRS  documents, the agency had planned to spend $85 million in fiscal year  2007 to develop and deploy additional CADE releases that would enable  the system to process up to 50 million individual tax returns by the 2008  filing season and issue associated refunds faster. However, with a  proposed budget of $58.5 million\u2014over 30 percent less than anticipated\u2014 IRS would likely have to scale back its planned near-term work on this  project. In addition, the reductions to the planned budgets for the  Modernized e-File and F&PC projects may also result in IRS having to  redefine the scope and/or reassess schedule commitments for future  project releases.", "The proposed BSM budget reduction would also significantly reduce the  amount allotted to program management reserve by about 82 percent  (from $13 million in fiscal year 2006 to $2.3 million in fiscal year 2007). If  BSM projects have future cost overruns that cannot be covered by the  depleted reserve, this reduction could result in increased budget requests  in future years or delays in planned future activities.", "While the BSM program still faces challenges, IRS has recently made  progress in delivering benefits and addressing project and program-level  risks and issues. Reducing BSM funds at a time when benefits to taxpayers  and the agency are being delivered could adversely impact the momentum  gained from recent progress and result in delays in the delivery of future  benefits.

As constraints on available resources  increase, these decisions become correspondingly more challenging and  important. In order to rise to this challenge, management needs to have  current and accurate information upon which to base its decisions, and to  enable it to monitor the effectiveness of actions taken over time so that  appropriate adjustments can be made as conditions change.", "In its ongoing effort to make such increasingly difficult resource allocation  decisions and defend those decisions before the Congress, IRS has long  been hampered by a lack of current and accurate information concerning  the costs of the various options being considered. Instead, management  often has relied on a combination of the limited existing cost information;  the results of special analysis initiated to establish the full cost of a  specific, narrowly defined task or item; and estimates based on the best  judgment of experienced staff. This has impaired IRS\u2019s ability to properly  decide which, if any, of the options at hand are worth the cost relative to  the expected benefits. For example, accurate and timely cost information  may help IRS consider changes in the menu of taxpayer services that it  provides by identifying and assessing the relative costs, benefits, and risks  of specific projects. Without reliable cost information, IRS\u2019s ability to  make such difficult choices in an informed manner is seriously impaired.  The lack of reliable cost information also means that IRS cannot prepare  cost-based performance measures to assist in measuring the effectiveness  of its programs over time.", "Further, IRS does not have the capability to develop reliable information  on the return on investment for each category of taxpayer service and  enforcement. IRS lacks reliable information on both the return from  services (the additional revenue collected by helping taxpayers  understand their tax obligations) and the investment or cost of the  services. While developing return on investment information is difficult,  the cost component of that equation may be the least complex to develop.  Having such cost information is a building block for developing return on  investment estimates. For its enforcement programs, IRS has developed a  rough measure of return on investment in terms of tax revenue that is  directly assessed from uncovering noncompliance. Continuing to develop  return on investment measures could help officials make more informed  decisions about allocating resources. The new NRP data, for example, are  to be used to better identify which tax returns to examine so that fewer  compliant taxpayers are burdened by unnecessary audits and IRS can  increase the amount of noncompliance that is addressed through its  enforcement activities. Even without return on investment information,  cost information can help IRS determine if, for example, IRS should  change the menu of services provided.", "As discussed in the BSM section, in fiscal year 2005, IRS implemented a  cost accounting module as part of IFS.

Also, IRS does not have an integrated workload management system  which would provide the cost module with detailed allocation of  personnel cost information. In addition, as noted in developing its IS  budget, because it generally takes several years of historical cost  information to support meaningful estimates and projections, IRS cannot  yet rely on IFS as a significant planning tool. It will likely require several  years, implementation of additional components of IFS, and integration of  IFS with IRS\u2019s tax administration activities before the full potential of  IFS\u2019s cost accounting module will be realized.

We recently reported that IRS has  taken a number of steps that may improve its ability to reduce the tax  gap. Favorable trends in staffing of IRS enforcement personnel;  examinations performed through correspondence, as opposed to more  complex face-to-face examinations; and the use of some enforcement  sanctions such as liens and levies are encouraging. Also, IRS has made  progress with respect to abusive tax shelters through a number of  initiatives and recent settlement offers that have resulted in billions of  dollars in collected taxes, interest, and penalties. Finally, IRS has  continually improved taxpayer service by increasing, for example, the  accuracy of responses to tax law questions.", "The effect of this overall approach and the 2007 budget proposal will have  on voluntary compliance has not been quantified by IRS. Therefore, the  Congress will have to rely on the IRS Commissioner for qualitative  explanations, of why, in his judgment, IRS\u2019s mix of taxpayer service and  enforcement and overall approach for reducing the tax gap, including the  2007 budget proposal, will be sufficient to start IRS on a path towards  achieving its long-term goals. More specifically, such explanations could  include a clear statement of which service and enforcement programs  have priorities for expansion because they are expected to contribute the  most to increasing the compliance rate and the evidence that supports that  judgment.", "In addition, IRS lacks a plan for measuring progress towards one goal\u2014 improving voluntary compliance.

Furthermore, doing compliance studies  once every few years does not give IRS or others information about what  is happening in the intervening years. Annual estimating of the compliance  rate could provide information that would enable IRS management to  adjust plans as necessary to help achieve the goal in 2009. One option that  would not increase the cost of estimating compliance would be to use a  rolling sample.

This brings IRS\u2019s proposed fiscal  year 2007 budget to approximately $11 billion (a 1.6 percent increase over  fiscal year 2006). After adjusting for expected inflation, IRS\u2019s $11 billion  budget request reflects a slight decrease from last year\u2019s enacted budget.", "IRS\u2019s enacted budgets for its appropriation accounts from fiscal years 2002  through 2007 are shown in table 4. IRS\u2019s enacted budget has increased  almost 8 percent since fiscal year 2002. By far, the biggest percentage  increase has been TLE\u2014almost 21 percent\u2014and is reflective the shift in  resources devoted to TLE from PAM during this period. The biggest  percentage decrease was in the Business Systems Modernization (BSM)  program, down almost 58 percent.", "Tables 5 and 6 show IRS\u2019s enacted and actual Full-time Equivalents (FTEs)  for fiscal years 2002 through 2007. Overall, actual FTEs tend to be lower  than enacted FTEs due in part to the way IRS funds its unbudgeted  requirements. When both enacted and actual FTEs are considered, FTEs  for PAM have steadily decreased and, for the most part, FTEs for TLE  have increased since fiscal year 2002. However, steady trends are not  apparent when comparing enacted and actual FTEs in IRS\u2019s IS account.  For example, when enacted FTEs are considered, IS staffing appears to  fluctuate up and down between fiscal years 2002 through 2007; yet, when  actual FTEs are considered, IS staffing decreased from fiscal year 2002  through 2005 and increased from fiscal years 2005 to 2006. IRS officials  attribute these fluctuations in FTEs to reorganizations and other factors.", "Tables 5 and 6 also show significant differences in percentage changes  between enacted and actual FTEs in some of IRS\u2019s appropriations  accounts from fiscal years 2006 to 2007. The enacted level of FTEs is the  number IRS projected it could support given the level of funding the  Congress enacted. According to IRS officials, enacted levels tend to be  overstated compared to actual FTEs for several reasons. First, IRS, like  most federal agencies, does not receive its budgets when expected and  cannot fill all positions. Also, as the costs of maintaining current FTE  levels increase annually, IRS is not able to realize all of the FTEs it  projects to fund with the appropriations the Congress enacts.", "In its fiscal year 2006 budget request, IRS showed its budget distributed by  taxpayer services and enforcement, including IS funding for those areas,  because the agency\u2019s current appropriation accounts are not divided  clearly between taxpayer service and enforcement. As table 7 shows,  funding for enforcement increased 15 percent between fiscal years 2004  and 2007 to $6.96 billion, while funding for taxpayer service declined over  3 percent to almost $3.6 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: IRS\u2019s Estimated and Actual Savings and Reinvestments", "paragraphs": ["In its 2007 budget request, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is proposing  to save over $121 million and 1,424 Full-time Equivalents (FTEs) and  reinvest over $12 million and 11 FTEs. Based on IRS\u2019s ability to achieve  prior year savings and reinvestments as shown in table 8, we have a basis  to believe that IRS will achieve most, if not all, of these savings. For  example, IRS reported it realized 88 percent of its anticipated budget  savings and 86 percent of its anticipated staff savings for savings identified  in its fiscal year 2004 budget request, and IRS reported exceeding savings  targets in fiscal year 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: State Mandates", "paragraphs": ["Of the 50 states, 12 have electronic filing mandates for tax practitioners in  effect for the 2006 filing season (see fig. 4). The mandates differ in their  implementation dates and schedules, thresholds for filing, and penalties.  The differences between mandates may affect the magnitude of electronic  filing increases in each state.", "We recently reported that state mandates encourage electronic filing of  federal tax returns and recommended that IRS develop better information  about the costs to tax practitioners and taxpayers of mandatory electronic  filing of tax returns for certain categories of tax practitioners. These  mandates require tax practitioners who meet certain criteria, such as filing  100 individual state tax returns or more, to file individual state returns  electronically.", "Between tax years 2001 and 2004, electronic filing had grown in the 9  states with mandates from an average of 36.7 percent to 56.8 percent, or an  increase of over 20 percentage points, compared to an increase of 14  percentage points for the 41 non mandated states over the same time  period. We expect this trend to continue as 3 additional states\u2014New York,  Utah and Connecticut\u2014implemented mandates in time for the 2006 filing  season. Of these 3 states, New York may have the most to gain because it  currently has the lowest rate of electronic filing rate, with fewer than 38  percent of its nearly 9 million federal individual income tax returns  electronically filed last year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Bibliography of GAO Resources", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Filing Season
