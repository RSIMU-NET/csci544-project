These include interagency contracts--where one agency uses another's contract for its own needs--such as the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs multiple award schedule (MAS) contracts, multiagency contracts (MAC) for a wide range of goods and services, and governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) for information technology. Agencies spent at least $60 billion in fiscal year 2008 through these contracts and similar single-agency enterprisewide contracts. However, concerns exist about duplication, oversight, and a lack of information on these contracts, and pricing and management of the MAS program. GAO was asked to assess the reasons for establishing and the policies to manage these contracts; the effectiveness of GSA tools for obtaining best MAS contract prices; and GSA's management of the MAS program. To do this, GAO reviewed statutes, regulations, policies, contract documentation and data, and interviewed officials from OMB and six agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GWACs, MACs--two types of interagency contracts--and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to the government in buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services. However, data are lacking and there is limited governmentwide policy to effectively leverage, manage, and oversee these contracts. The total number of MACs and enterprisewide contracts is unknown, and existing data are not sufficiently reliable to identify them. In addition, GWACs are the only interagency contracts requiring OMB approval. Agencies GAO reviewed followed statutes, acquisition regulations, and internal policies to establish and use MACs and enterprisewide contracts. Avoiding fees associated with using other agencies' contracts and more control over procurements are some of the reasons agencies cited for establishing MACs and enterprisewide contracts. However, many of the same contractors provided similar products and services on multiple contracts--a condition that increases costs to both the vendor and the government and misses opportunities to leverage the government's buying power. Recent legislation and OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy initiatives are expected to strengthen management of MACs, but no such initiatives exist for enterprisewide contracts. GSA's MAS program--the largest interagency contracting program--uses several tools and controls to obtain best prices, but the limited application of certain tools hinders its ability to determine whether it achieves this goal. GSA has established two regulatory pricing controls for MAS contracts: seek the best prices vendors provide to their most favored customers; and a price reduction clause that provides the government a lower price if a vendor lowers the price for similarly situated commercial customers. GSA uses other pricing tools--e.g., pre-award contract audits by its Inspector General and Procurement Management Reviews--on a limited basis. For example, the Inspector General performs pre-award audits on a small sample of MAS contracts annually, but has identified contract cost avoidance of almost $4 billion in recent years. In 2008, GSA established a MAS advisory panel that recommended changes to the pricing controls noted above; concerns remain that such changes could adversely affect GSA's ability to negotiate best prices. A lack of data, decentralized management, and limitations in assessment tools create challenges for GSA in managing the MAS program. The agency lacks data about customer agencies' use of the program, limiting its ability to determine how well the program meets customers' needs. The MAS program office lacks direct program oversight, as GSA has dispersed authority for managing MAS among nine acquisition centers under three business portfolios. Program stakeholders have identified concerns that this structure has impaired consistent policy implementation. Shortcomings in assessment tools also result in management challenges. For example, performance measures are inconsistent, including inconsistent emphasis on pricing. GSA's customer satisfaction survey has such a low response rate that its utility for evaluating program performance is limited."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, spending on federal contracts has more than doubled, with  approximately $530 billion obligated in fiscal year 2008.  As this spending  has increased, there has been renewed focus on maximizing efficiencies in  the procurement process to achieve cost savings.  One way to accomplish  this is by increasing the use of contracts designed to leverage the  government\u2019s buying power when acquiring commercial goods and  services.  These include the multiple award schedule (MAS) program  contracts (also known as the Federal Supply Schedule), multiagency  contracts (MAC), and governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC).   The General Services Administration (GSA) directs and manages the MAS  program.  It has delegated authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) to operate schedules for medical supplies. Other agencies have  established and operate MACs and GWACs.  MAS contracts, MACs, and  GWACs are all interagency contracts.", "When managed properly, interagency contracting\u2014a process by which  one agency either uses another agency\u2019s contract directly or obtains  contracting support services from another agency\u2014can leverage the  government\u2019s aggregate buying power and provide a simplified and  expedited method for procuring commonly used goods and services.  Enterprisewide contracts, which, according to procurement officials,  appear to have become more popular in recent years, are internal  purchasing programs established within a federal department or agency to  acquire goods and services.  They are similar to interagency contracts in  that they can leverage the purchasing power of the federal agency but  generally do not allow purchases from the contract by federal activities  other than the original acquiring activity.  In fact, the Office of  Management of Budget (OMB) recently reported that 20 of the 24 largest  procuring activities are planning to achieve contracting savings by  implementing strategic sourcing initiatives by using enterprisewide  contracting to leverage their buying power.  These initiatives are part of  OMB\u2019s goal, announced in December 2009, of reducing contract cost by 7  percent by September 30, 2011.", "Though precise numbers are unavailable, in fiscal year 2008, government  buyers used the MAS program, MACs, and GWACs to acquire at least $60  billion of commercial goods and services, including billions spent through  enterprisewide contracts.  Some in the procurement community have  raised concerns about a proliferation of some of these contracts, noting  that without coordinated governmentwide oversight of MACs and  enterprisewide contracts it is unclear whether the use of these contracts  helps government buyers leverage their buying power.  The perceived  growth in the number of these contracts and duplication that has occurred  with their growth may also adversely affect the overall administrative  efficiencies and cost savings expected with their use.  Furthermore, in  recent years, we and others have highlighted challenges with MAS  program pricing and compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) to obtain the best possible value.  In this context, you requested  that we address management issues associated with the growth in use of  interagency contracting vehicles and enterprisewide contracts, and  especially the management of the GSA\u2019s MAS program contracts.   Specifically, this report addresses:  1.  the data that exist to describe MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide  contracts use governmentwide; the extent to which policies and  guidance exist to establish and manage these contracts; and the  reasons agencies use these contracts;  2.  the effectiveness of tools and controls GSA uses to obtain the best  possible prices for customers of its MAS program; and   3.  the extent to which GSA has performance information and an  oversight structure in place to manage the MAS program.", "We conducted this work at the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  (OFPP) within OMB, which has governmentwide procurement policy  responsibility. We also conducted work at six federal agencies including  GSA, the Department of Defense (DOD), including the three military  departments, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), VA, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) because these agencies established and or used  the MAS, GWAC, MAC, or enterprisewide contract programs and were  responsible for almost 87 percent of total federal procurement obligations  in fiscal year 2008.  To assess the oversight of and benefits provided these  programs, we reviewed policies, agency directives, relevant studies, audit  reports, the FAR, and other regulations relevant to our review objectives.   We interviewed OFPP representatives responsible for overseeing  interagency contracting, the Senior Procurement Executives or their  representatives for the agencies where we conducted work, and other  agency officials responsible for multiagency and enterprisewide contracts.   To determine the magnitude of multiagency and enterprisewide contracts,  we attempted to use the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) but found that the data were not sufficiently  reliable to determine the universe and use of MACs or enterprisewide  contracts.  Despite its critical role, we have consistently reported on  FPDS-NG data quality issues over a number of years.  This lack of  reliability made it impossible to determine the universe and use of these  types of contracts.  Hence, we conducted literature searches and reviewed  agencies\u2019 and government contractors\u2019 Web pages to identify examples of  MACs and enterprisewide contracts. After identifying examples of these  contracts, we judgmentally selected for review 14 contracting programs  from 5 of the 6 agencies and 2 of the 3 military departments that had at  least one of the three contract types (MAC, GWAC, and enterprisewide  contracts), and met with agency officials and vendors to confirm our  identification of examples and to obtain their perspectives on the  proliferation of these vehicles.  Because the MAS program represents the  single largest federal program providing multiagency contracts, we  concentrated our work on the MAS program.  Furthermore, because GSA  rather than VA sets the policy for the MAS program, we focused on GSA\u2019s  management of the program.  We reviewed GSA\u2019s management structure  for overseeing the program and the tools and controls GSA established for  obtaining fair and reasonable pricing for MAS contracts.  We reviewed  GSA memorandums, regulations, manuals, and other relevant  documentation; interviewed agency officials; and analyzed GSA processes  and practices related to program oversight and contract negotiations.  We  also conducted structured interviews with 16 vendors with high sales on  the GSA MAS program and had also been awarded GWACs, MACs, or  enterprisewide contracts. The 16 vendors represented both large and small  businesses. We also judgmentally selected 17 contracting officers from 4  of the 6 agencies selected for review and the 3 military departments who  had placed orders through one of the reviewed contract vehicles to obtain  their perspectives on the management and pricing of the MAS contracts,  MACs, GWACs and enterprisewide contracts.  We also met with  representatives of several private sector organizations\u2014the Coalition for  Government Procurement, Jefferson Solutions, LLC, the Professional  Services Council, and the Washington Management Group\u2014that represent  vendors and contractors to obtain their views on issues related to our  review objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through April  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

These interagency contracts can be established under several  statutory authorities, including: (1) the Economy Act, which authorizes  agencies to place orders for goods and services with another government  agency; (2) the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which authorizes GWACs; and  (3) the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as  amended, which provides authority for GSA\u2019s MAS program.", "The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, also has a bearing on  interagency contracting, since its enactment, along with that of the  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, authorized fundamental changes in the  management of government acquisition programs.  These statutes (1)  made it easier for federal agencies to purchase commercial items; (2)  streamlined the processes for making small purchases; (3) eliminated GSA  as the sole authority for all federal information technology acquisitions;  and (4) allowed for establishment of GWACs and other contracting  vehicles including enterprisewide contracts.  Since then, some agencies  have established and operated MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide  contracts, while GSA operates the MAS program.  Agencies, including GSA  and VA for the MAS program, usually charge their customer agencies fees  for using their GWACs, MACs, and schedule contracts.  These fees are  usually a percentage of the value of the procurement to cover the costs of  administering the contract.  Table 1 describes the various contract types  we examined, including the number in existence and fees charged when  known, and their fiscal year 2008 sales.", "In fiscal year 2008, as shown in table 1, federal agencies used GWACs,  MACs, and the MAS program to buy at least $60 billion of goods and  services to support their operations including some agencies spending  billions using enterprisewide contracts.  GWACs, MACs, the  enterprisewide contracts we examined, and contracts under the MAS  program are all indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts-- contracts that are established to buy goods and services when the exact  times and exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of  award. Once known, an agency places individual delivery orders for  goods and task orders for services against these contracts.", "MACs and GWACs provide advantages to both agencies and vendors.  For  agencies, they provide a means of procuring goods and services without  the time and expense of a full and open solicitation for each order.  For  vendors, the FAR requires agencies to provide a fair opportunity to be  considered for orders exceeding $3,000.  The Economy Act, along with  other authorities, allows an agency to enter into a MAC and then make it  available for other government agencies to place task or delivery orders to  obtain a variety of goods and services.  The Economy Act is applicable to  orders placed under MACs, with the exception of MACs for information  technology that are established pursuant to the Clinger-Cohen Act.  Per  the FAR guidance for the Economy Act, an agency planning to place an  order against another agency\u2019s MAC must document that the servicing  agency has an appropriate pre-existing contract available for use or that it  has the capabilities or expertise to enter into a contract for the required  goods or services, which is not available within the requesting agency.  MACs are established within their respective agencies and no external  reporting on their use is required.  As a result, governmentwide  comprehensive data on the number of MACs and dollars involved with  their use are not readily available.", "GWACs provide a broad range of information technology goods and  services and resources for agency activities.  Each GWAC is operated by  an executive agent designated by OMB.  The Economy Act does not  apply when placing orders under GWACs.  As of March 30, 2010, four  agencies\u2014GSA, NASA, the Department of Health and Human Services,  and the Environmental Protection Agency\u2014had OMB authorization to  operate GWACs.  As shown in table 2 below, these agencies were  responsible from 1 to 11 GWAC programs having obligations in fiscal year  2008 totaling almost $5.3 billion.", "Obligations placed against GWACs have ranged from about $5 to $6 billion  annually, but have declined slightly in recent years from $5.8 billion in  fiscal year 2004 to $5.3 billion in fiscal year 2008."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enterprisewide Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Along with using interagency contracts to leverage their buying power, a  number of large departments\u2014DOD and DHS in particular\u2014are turning to  enterprisewide contracts as well to acquire goods and services.  Enterprisewide contracting programs are IDIQ contracts established  solely for the use of the establishing agency and can be used to reduce  contracting administrative overhead, provide information on agency  spending, meet various requirements across the agency, and avoid the fees  charged for using interagency contracts, such as a GWAC.  Creating  enterprisewide contracts can also be a method to support strategic  sourcing within the agency and a means of tailoring requirements for  agency-unique purposes.  They can also be used to specify and enforce  specific contract terms and conditions and bring more consistency into  the agency contracting processes.  Three significant enterprisewide  contracting programs are DHS\u2019s Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for  Leading-Edge Solutions (EAGLE) and FirstSource programs and the  Department of the Navy\u2019s SeaPort Enhanced program.  EAGLE and  FirstSource provide contracts with 64 vendors for information technology  services and commodities, respectively, for the 16 components that make  up DHS and obligated over $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2008.

As the largest interagency  contracting program, the MAS program provides advantages to both  federal agencies and vendors.  Agencies, using the simplified methods of  procurement of the schedules, avoid the time expenditures and  administrative costs of other methods.  Vendors receive wider exposure  for their commercial products and expend less effort to selling these  products.  Moreover, the MAS program is the primary governmentwide  buying program aimed at helping the federal government leverage its  significant buying power when buying commercial goods and services.", "Together, GSA and VA operate 58 schedules.  GSA operates 49 schedules,  which offer a wide range of goods and services such as office furniture  and supplies, personal computers, scientific equipment, library services,  network support, laboratory testing services, and management and  advisory services.  GSA delegated to the VA the authority to solicit,  negotiate, award, and administer contracts for selected schedules.  VA has  seven schedules for various categories of medical/surgical supplies and  equipment and pharmaceuticals, and two schedules for various health care  services including professional health care and staffing services and  laboratory testing and analysis services.", "In August 1997, after passage of FASA and the Clinger-Cohen Act, GSA  revised its acquisition regulations to promote greater use of commercial  buying practices, and streamline the purchasing process for its  customers.  GSA expected these changes to lead to more participation by  both large and small businesses, and to increased competition, thereby  providing federal agencies a wider range of goods and services at  competitive prices.  As of December 2009, there were almost 19,000  available contracts providing goods and services on the GSA and VA  schedules.  While MAS sales by both GSA and VA have grown significantly  since 1998, sales have leveled off in recent years, as shown in figure 1.", "Over the last several years, GSA initiated several changes within the MAS  program.  In late 2006, the agency reorganized and created the Federal  Acquisition Service (FAS), which combined the duties of the Federal  Technology Service and the Federal Supply Service.  As part of this  reorganization, GSA established three primary FAS business portfolios\u2014 General Supplies and Services; Integrated Technology Services; and  Travel, Motor Vehicle, and Card Services\u2014and gave them management  and operational control over the MAS schedules.  Within these portfolios,  nine acquisition centers located throughout the United States award and  manage MAS contracts.  GSA also established within FAS the Office of  Acquisition Management, which is responsible for ensuring that GSA  activities comply with federal laws, regulations, and policies, and that  operating practices are consistent across business lines and acquisition  centers.  In July 2008, within the Office of Acquisition Management, GSA  created the MAS Program Office to develop and implement acquisition  policy and guidance, define systems requirements, and coordinate  program-wide improvements.  VA manages its portion of the MAS program  from its National Acquisition Center, located in Hines, Illinois.  The MAS  Governance Council, established in 2008 as part of the creation of the MAS  Program Office, includes representatives from both GSA and VA, and is  responsible for addressing and coordinating MAS program issues that  affect both GSA and VA.", "In 2008, GSA also established a MAS Advisory Panel to provide  independent advice and recommendations on MAS program pricing  policies and provisions in the context of commercial pricing practices.   The panel is made up of representatives from GSA and other federal  agencies as well as industry associations.

In 2006, OFPP  started the Interagency Contracting Data Collection Initiative to identify  and list the available GWACs, MACs, and enterprisewide contracts.  OFPP  requested that all federal agencies with interagency contracts report the  number of contracts available with a description of what was available on  each contract, which agencies could use it, the reason for creating it, and  whether or not there was a completed business case analysis on the  contract.

A Department of the  Navy procurement official told us that by awarding fewer larger contracts,  the Department of the Navy and DOD have created efficiencies resulting in  lower prices.  The SARA panel report previously noted some of these  concerns, stating that too many choices without information related to the  performance and management of these contracts make the cost-benefit  analysis and market research needed to select an appropriate acquisition  vehicle impossible.  This is particularly important given OMB\u2019s June 2008  guidance on interagency contracting that requires agencies to make a  determination that using an interagency contracting vehicle is in their best  interest; taking into account factors such as whether the vehicle is suitable  to meet their needs and provides the best value."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Governmentwide Policy on MACs and Enterprisewide Contracts Is Limited; Agencies Use Various Procedures to Establish and Manage These Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies operate with limited governmentwide policy that  addresses the establishment and use of MACs and enterprisewide  contracts.

Program  officials stated there were problems with interagency contracting and  wanted to make sure they had more control over their procurements.   They stated further that GSA\u2019s fees made its schedules programs cost  prohibitive.  The Department of the Navy officials also stated they  wanted more insight into their procurements, which they could not  gain when using the GSA schedules.  Finally, the Department of the  Navy also wanted to be able to use cost-reimbursable contracts, which  are not allowed by the GSA\u2019s MAS program.  The Department of the  Navy felt this prohibition hindered their efforts to make their  acquisitions efficient.  In 2005, DHS established EAGLE and FirstSource contracting programs  that both involve enterprisewide contracts used for information  technology products and services.  Officials stated the main reason  these programs were established was to avoid the fees associated with  using other contract vehicles and save money through volume pricing.   In addition, the programs centralized procurements for a wide array of  mission needs among its many agencies.  EAGLE was approved around  the time of Hurricane Katrina and DHS determined it would be easier  to coordinate assistance if the department had contractors together  under one program, which would allow DHS to better manage them.

Because vendors do not compete against  each other to receive MAS contracts, GSA uses two regulatory controls to  obtain the best prices for its customers throughout the existence of the  MAS contracts they use.  The first is the goal that GSA obtain the best  prices for MAS contracts that vendors offer their most favored customers.   The second is a price reduction clause in each MAS contract that generally  operates to reduce the MAS contract price after contract award whenever  the vendor lowers its prices for its similarly situated commercial  customers.  GSA also uses tools such as pre-award audits and clearance  panel reviews to negotiate best prices and ensure the quality of contract  negotiations, respectively, but the use of these tools is limited to a  relatively small number of MAS contracts, thus hindering their  effectiveness.  We also found several instances where GSA acquisition  centers did not hold clearance panel reviews as required.

Vendors do not compete against each other to  receive MAS contracts.  Instead, GSA evaluates a vendor\u2019s offer under a  multiple award schedule solicitation by comparing the terms and  conditions of the MAS contract solicitation to the terms and conditions of  the vendor\u2019s agreements with its commercial customers, taking into  account factors such as prices and discounts offered to the vendor\u2019s  commercial customers, sales volume, and contract length, in order to  establish price negotiation objectives.  Additional information on the  MAS contract award process is available in appendix II.", "The negotiation objective described above, which calls for comparing  prices and discounts that a vendor offers the government with the prices  and discounts that a vendor offers its similarly situated commercial  customers, is done as part of GSA\u2019s goal to receive \u201cmost favored  customer\u201d pricing for MAS contracts.  When trying to achieve this  negotiation objective, GSA seeks to obtain the best price a vendor  provides its most favored customer while recognizing that there may be  legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved given that terms and  conditions of commercial sales vary.  For example, a vendor may incur  more expenses selling to the government than to a customer who receives  the vendor\u2019s best prices, which could justify a smaller price discount for  the government.  Most favored customer pricing is one of the two key  regulatory provisions that GSA has established in its acquisition  regulations that work together to obtain the best prices throughout the life  of MAS contracts.  The second pricing provision is the inclusion of a price  reduction clause in MAS contracts.  This provision provides price  protection for the government following contract award if a vendor lowers  its prices to commercial customers during the contract period.  However,  GSA officials we spoke with said that they do not collect data to show how  often the price reduction clause is invoked to reduce schedule prices, as  the data they track on price adjustments for MAS contracts does not  specify whether the price is increased or reduced.  Consequently, it is  difficult to assess whether the clause accomplishes its objective over the  life of the various schedule contracts.  Despite this lack of data, several  vendors and MAS acquisition center officials we met with expressed  concerns about the resources and administrative burden required for  vendors to comply with the current pricing provisions.  For example,  representatives of one vendor we met with noted the difficulty in defining  and tracking labor categories across a large company in order to comply  with the most favored customer pricing provision.  On the other hand,  GSA Inspector General Officials we spoke with said that the pricing  provisions are essential tools to ensuring that GSA can negotiate best  prices for its customers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Use of Certain MAS Pricing Tools Hinders Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its regulatory pricing controls, GSA also uses pre-award  audits, prenegotiation clearance panels and procurement management  reviews (PMR) as tools to negotiate favorable pricing outcomes and  ensure the quality of MAS contract negotiations.  These tools also provide  information on MAS contracts\u2019 compliance with the regulatory pricing  controls discussed above.  However, GSA uses these tools primarily for a  small number of larger dollar value contracts, thus limiting its ability to  evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory pricing controls and obtain the  best prices under MAS contracts.", "One of these tools is the pre-award audit, conducted by the GSA Inspector  General.  These audits enable contract negotiators to verify that vendor- supplied pricing information is accurate, complete, and current before  contract award.  Ultimately, the pre-award audits can result in lower  prices for the users of MAS contracts by identifying opportunities for GSA  to negotiate more favorable price discounts when awarding contracts  based on an analysis of the prices, terms, and conditions offered to the  vendor\u2019s most favored customer.  For example, a pre-award audit of an  office furniture vendor\u2019s MAS contract with an estimated value of  approximately $700 million identified the potential for greater discounts  that could result in savings of approximately $20 million over the contract  period given that the government was the vendor\u2019s largest customer.  For  contract extensions, these audits can also review compliance with the  price reduction clause in the prior contract period.", "Following a decline in the number of pre-award audits--and associated  cost avoidance--in the early 2000s compared to earlier years, GSA  increased the number of pre-award audits in recent years by providing  additional funding to the GSA Inspector General to perform the reviews,  allocating $5 million annually for pre-award audits.  As a result, the GSA  Inspector General has identified almost $4 billion in potential cost  avoidance through pre-award audits from fiscal years 2004 through 2008.   Figure 2 below shows the increase in identified MAS contract cost  avoidance as the number of pre-award audits has increased in recent  years:  While the number of pre-award audits and identification of potential cost  avoidance has increased in recent years, GSA could be missing additional  opportunities for cost savings on MAS contracts by not targeting for  review more contracts that are eligible for audit.  GSA guidance instructs  contract negotiators to request audit assistance for new contract offers  and extensions as appropriate when a contract\u2019s estimated sales exceed  $25 million for the 5-year contract period.  However, not all contracts  that meet this threshold receive an audit, and the current number of aud its  represents a very small number of contracts relative to the size of the MAS  program.  For example, 69 pre-award audits were completed in fiscal year  2008.  In addition, for the GSA Inspector General\u2019s audit planning effort for  the two year period of 2009 through 2011, more than 250 contracts that  exceeded the $25 million threshold were not selected for audit due to  resource constraints, compared to 145 contracts that were.  These 145  contracts, with an award value of approximately $4.7 billion, represent  only 2 percent of the total award dollars for all MAS contracts.", "GSA uses other tools designed to improve the quality of MAS contract  negotiations, but their effectiveness is limited by incomplete  implementation and a narrow scope.  In 2003, GSA established an  Acquisition Quality Measurement and Improvement Program, which was  designed to create management controls to assess and improve the quality  of MAS contract negotiations.  This program included a prenegotiation  clearance panel process to help MAS acquisition center management  ensure the quality of its most significant contract negotiations.  Under this  initiative, MAS acquisition centers hold meetings on contracts that meet a  defined dollar threshold to review the contract\u2019s negotiation objectives  with an emphasis on pricing.", "MAS acquisition center officials we spoke with said the panel reviews  were a valuable tool to ensure that contract negotiators have done a  proper market analysis to support the contract\u2019s pricing and that the  processes used within an acquisition center to negotiate and award  contracts are consistent.  Nevertheless, we found that acquisition centers  had not fully implemented the panel reviews, thus limiting their  effectiveness.  We identified several instances of contracts that met their  acquisition center\u2019s dollar threshold where there was no indication that a  panel review was held.  These ranged from one contract for consulting  services with an estimated value of $12.5 million to another for  information technology equipment and services with an estimated value of  approximately $276 million. GSA officials we spoke with regarding the  panel reviews said that they do not check whether contracts that met the  appropriate threshold received a panel review, even though this is  supposed to be done as part of the panel reporting process.  In addition,  the GSA Inspector General recently reported that GSA had not clearly  defined management reporting responsibilities for the panel reviews  following the reorganization of the FAS, further limiting the intended  benefits of the initiative.  In response to these issues, GSA has begun the  process of updating its prenegotiation clearance panel guidance to reflect  the current FAS management structure and review whether panel reviews  were completed for contracts that met or exceeded the panel thresholds,  which it plans to finalize in 2010.", "GSA also conducts PMRs through its Office of the Chief Acquisition  Officer to assess the quality of contract negotiations through a review of  selected contract files\u2019 compliance with statutes, regulations, and internal  policy and guidance.  The reviews replaced a similar effort that was part of  the Acquisition Quality Measurement and Improvement Program, and  cover a number of acquisition organizations within GSA, including MAS  acquisition centers.  In terms of MAS contract pricing, the PMRs review  whether a contract\u2019s discounts, terms and conditions are equal to or better  than those for the vendor\u2019s most favored customer, and whether the  contract negotiator properly documented how the contract\u2019s price was  determined to be fair and reasonable, among other things.  Following the  review, the acquisition center receives a report that includes the review\u2019s  findings, as well as recommendations for improvement that require  corrective action plans.  In PMR reports we reviewed from fiscal years  2008 and 2009, we found several examples of PMR findings relating to  deficiencies in MAS contract pricing including: insufficient file  documentation to support price reasonableness; files that did not clearly  establish the price/discount relationship with vendors\u2019 categories of  customers; and contract files that did not address which of the vendor\u2019s  customers would serve as the basis for the price reduction clause.", "While the PMRs can be a valuable tool for identifying areas for  improvement in MAS contract negotiations and pricing, the scope of the  reviews has been limited to a small number of MAS contracts, thus  minimizing their usefulness for assessing trends in MAS contracts\u2019  compliance with GSA policy and guidance.  In the PMR reports we  reviewed, GSA\u2019s PMR team selected samples of between 12 and 16  contracts for review at each MAS acquisition center, a small amount  relative to the universe of approximately 17,000 MAS program contracts,  and at the time of our fieldwork, the selection methodology did not focus  on risk or yield a statistical sample of contracts for review.  GSA officials  that manage the PMR process said that the number of contracts in each  sample they review makes it difficult to derive trends from the PMR  review findings, although a subsequent update to GSA\u2019s PMR methodology  to focus on attempting to select a statistical sample of contracts for review  could address this issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advisory Panel Recommendations on Pricing Provisions Raise Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Recently, GSA has attempted to examine the relevance of GSA\u2019s pricing  controls established to obtain the best available pricing for MAS contracts  in the current marketplace.  In 2008, GSA established an advisory panel to  examine the MAS program\u2019s most favored customer and price reduction  regulatory provisions in the context of current commercial pricing  practices.  The panel, comprised of both government and industry  representatives, met 16 times, receiving testimony from 30 program  stakeholders.  The panel issued its report in February 2010, which  contained 20 recommendations regarding the MAS program, several of  which address GSA\u2019s MAS pricing provisions.  Specifically, the panel  recommended that GSA eliminate the price reduction clause for MAS  services and product contracts on the basis that new statutory competition  requirements (known as \u201cfair opportunity\u201d requirements) and additional  data collection on MAS orders should ensure that the government receives  competitive prices.  Regarding the price objective for MAS contracts, the  panel recommended that GSA issue clear guidance to implement the price  objective for MAS contracts to obtain fair and reasonable prices at the  time of contract award.  MAS Advisory Panel members and program  stakeholders we spoke with stated that this could mean that the \u201cmost  favored customer\u201d price would no longer be the objective for the MAS  program.  Senior Procurement Executives from GSA and VA, with whom  we spoke, both members of the panel, had differing opinions on the  panel\u2019s draft recommendations.  The GSA Senior Procurement Executive  noted that the pricing provisions had not served their intended purpose,  and that competition for orders would make the provisions irrelevant.  The  VA Senior Procurement Executive, however, was in favor of retaining the  price reduction clause for products, and said that the most favored  customer price objective provides some assurance of market pricing for  goods and services.  He also said that the elimination of the price  reduction clause would have a negative impact on cost recoveries from  VA\u2019s pre- and post-award audits for its schedule contracts.", "GSA will need to consider several issues as it evaluates the panel\u2019s  recommendations.  First, while the panel made efforts to collect data to  assist it in its deliberations, there is minimal quantitative data in the  panel\u2019s report to support its conclusions.  For example, although the panel  reported that those who testified before it said that the price reduction  clause is rarely triggered, GSA (as noted earlier) does not track data on the  number of contract modifications due to price reductions.", "Second, while the panel reported that competition for MAS orders is the  best way to ensure that the government receives competitive prices, there  may be risks in relying solely on competition as a substitute for these  pricing provisions.  For example, DOD, the largest MAS customer, has  been subject to fair opportunity competition requirements since 2002, but  DOD\u2019s analysis of competition data for fiscal year 2008 shows that fair  opportunity was not given on more than one-third of DOD\u2019s MAS orders,  which totaled approximately $3.6 billion.  Our prior work and numerous  DOD Inspector General reviews have also identified problems with the  implementation of this requirement, such as issues with excessive waivers  of the requirement and repeated instances of orders that did not provide  for sufficient competition.", "Third, changes to the MAS program pricing objective could also have an  adverse impact on the program\u2019s pricing tools.  For example, elimination  of most favored customer as the pricing objective could impair the ability  of the GSA Inspector General to identify potential cost avoidance in its  pre-award audits of MAS contracts.  GSA Inspector General  representatives told us that the most favored customer pricing objective is  critical to their evaluation of vendors\u2019 price proposals.  Moreover, they  said that if GSA adopts the panel\u2019s proposals, their ability to continue  identifying potential cost avoidance for MAS contracts would depend on  whether GSA establishes another negotiation objective as a replacement  for \u201cmost favored customer.\u201d  Our prior work has also highlighted the  importance of having a price objective that leverages the government\u2019s  buying power, as agencies may not pursue additional discounts when  placing MAS contract orders.  In our recent review of 336 blanket  purchase agreements based on MAS contracts, agencies did not seek  price discounts when they established blanket purchase agreements in  almost half of the instances reviewed, despite the fact that they are  required to do so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Effective MAS Program Management Is Hindered by a Lack of Data, a Decentralized Management Structure, and Shortcomings in Assessment Tools", "paragraphs": ["GSA lacks data about the use of the MAS program by customer agencies  that it could use to determine how well the MAS program meets its  customers\u2019 needs and to help its customers obtain the best value in using  MAS contracts.  In addition, the decentralized management structure for  the MAS program hinders consistent implementation of the MAS program  within GSA, as well as program wide oversight.  The MAS Program Office,  established in 2008 to manage strategic and policy issues, lacks direct  oversight authority for the MAS program, as GSA has dispersed  responsibility for the management of individual contract schedules among  nine different acquisition centers under three business portfolios.   According to some MAS program officials, this has impaired the consistent  implementation of policies across the MAS program and the sharing of  best practices, and the GSA Inspector General has identified issues with  oversight of the MAS program.  Finally, there are shortcomings in  assessment tools that also result in management challenges.  For example,  MAS performance measures are inconsistent across the GSA organizations  that manage MAS contracts, including inconsistent emphasis on pricing,  which limits GSA\u2019s ability to have a program wide perspective on its  operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GSA Lacks Important Data to Strategically Manage MAS Contracts and Pricing", "paragraphs": ["GSA lacks important data that would facilitate more strategic management  of the MAS program.

GSA does offer two electronic procurement tools, GSA Advantage  and e-Buy, which permit agencies to place MAS contract orders with  vendors and post requests for quotes with vendors.  GSA Advantage also  has a spend analysis reporting tool that provides agencies with sales and  statistical data on their orders through the system.  However, these tools  account for a very small percentage of overall MAS program sales and  have other limitations in their use, thus restricting the amount of data  available.  In fiscal year 2008, customer sales through GSA Advantage  totaled approximately $559 million, representing only 1.5 percent of total  program sales, and GSA officials we spoke with said that its use is limited  to procuring goods as opposed to services.  GSA officials also said that  while customers can use e-Buy to post requests for quotes of any size and  fulfill fair opportunity competition requirements, they do not generally use  e-Buy to place orders due to its inability to process orders greater than the  micro-purchase threshold of $3,000.", "There are several drawbacks to the lack of available transactional data on  the goods and services ordered under the MAS program and the prices  paid.  First, it hinders GSA\u2019s ability to evaluate program performance and  manage the program strategically.  Our prior work has highlighted the  importance of having comprehensive spend data as part of a successful  approach to procurement, noting that the use of procurement data to  determine how much is being spent for goods and services and to identify  buyers and suppliers can identify opportunities to leverage buying, save  money, and improve performance.  Several GSA officials acknowledged  that it is difficult for GSA to know whether the MAS program meets their  customers\u2019 needs without data on who uses MAS contracts and what they  are buying.  Furthermore, the GSA Inspector General has recommended  that GSA take steps to collect this data to use in evaluating customer  buying patterns and competition at the order level in order to adopt a  more strategic management approach.  We have made similar  observations in prior reports going back several decades.", "Secondly, the lack of data could limit the ability of GSA and its customers  to achieve the best value in terms of MAS prices.  Some GSA officials  informed us that they could possibly use transactional data to negotiate  better prices on MAS contracts.  For example, one MAS acquisition center  official said that if they saw large percentage discounts off the contract  price on orders, they would question the price during the next contract  option period.  Program stakeholders also expressed concerns regarding  the lack of MAS program data.  Several of the agency contracting officers  we spoke with cited benefits of having additional transactional data on  MAS orders.  For example, one contracting officer said additional data  could improve their negotiating position when buying goods and services,  while two others said it would increase visibility over their purchases.  Similarly, the MAS Advisory Panel has recommended that GSA make  order-level pricing information available to MAS contract negotiators and  agency contracting officers to conduct market research and assist in price  reasonableness determinations.  In addition, a number of the senior  acquisition officials at agencies in our review said that they considered the  prices on MAS contracts to be too high, and without additional data from  GSA, it was difficult to see the value in the MAS program and the prices  that GSA negotiates.  As noted earlier in this report, agencies we met with  cited similar concerns over GSA\u2019s prices as a reason they created new  MAC and enterprisewide contracts.  A number of these officials also said  that GSA should play a role in providing this data to its customers to assist  in their strategic procurement efforts.", "MAS vendors, GSA officials and agency contracting officers we met with  had mixed opinions on the best way to collect this data, which might  include collecting data from MAS vendors, customer agencies, or through  greater use of electronic ordering portals like GSA Advantage.

Furthermore, some GSA officials and industry  representatives we spoke with said that the program office\u2019s governance  council provided the acquisition centers with input on policy and strategy  issues, and that the program office was making progress with the strategic  management of the MAS program.  However, other MAS program officials  stated that the program is still not managed in a coordinated way and that  there is a lack of communication and consistency among MAS acquisition  centers which impairs the consistent implementation of policies across the  program and the sharing of information between business portfolios.  For  example, one MAS acquisition center official we spoke with said that the  lack of communication among portfolios has hindered their ability to  respond to vendor questions relating to schedules under other portfolios.   The GSA Inspector General has expressed similar concerns, noting in a  recent report that inconsistent pricing policy among MAS acquisition  centers had contributed to instances in which the government did not have  assurance of the reasonableness of MAS contract pricing, and that there  were opportunities for a more consistent approach in pursuing volume  discounts for MAS contracts.  The report also found that a lack of clearly  defined responsibilities within the new FAS organization has harmed  national oversight of the MAS program and may have affected the sharing  of best practices between acquisition centers.  While at the time of our  work the MAS Program Office was a relatively new organization within  FAS, the issues identified with consistency of program implementation  and the use of pricing tools identified earlier in this report highlight the  challenges the office will face in providing coherent program oversight in  the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in Assessment Tools That Focus on Internal Operations and MAS Customers Also Hinder Effective Program Management", "paragraphs": ["In addition to a lack of data and a decentralized management structure,  shortcomings in assessment tools also create MAS program management  challenges.  Our prior work on performance measurement in the federal  government noted that when complex program goals are broken down  into a set of performance measures, it is important to ensure that the  measures sufficiently cover the key aspects of an agency\u2019s performance,  and that the overall measurement of performance does not become biased  by measures that assess some priorities while neglecting others. GSA has  developed performance measures for the organizations that manage the  MAS program to establish accountability for program performance and  drive continual improvement.  They include measures for sales volume,  program costs, and time to complete contracting actions such as  processing contract offers and modifications.  While these may be valid  measures of program performance, the measures are inconsistent among  the organizations and do not place as much emphasis on pricing, a key  aspect of the program, making it difficult to have a program wide  perspective of MAS program performance.  For example, the fiscal year  2009 performance scorecard for the Information Technology Schedule has  a performance measure to track state and local government sales, while  the General Supplies and Services business portfolio, which also manages  a schedule that state and local governments can use, does not.   Furthermore, the Travel, Motor Vehicle, and Card Services business  portfolio has a draft performance measure for fiscal year 2010 related to  the quality of documentation in contract files, but the Information  Technology Schedule and the General Supplies and Services business  portfolio do not.", "There are also inconsistencies in the extent to which the organizations  measure performance as it relates to MAS contract pricing.  The  Information Technology Schedule has tracked price competitiveness for  its products by comparing prices for MAS vendors on GSA Advantage to  prices for the same products in the private sector, with a goal for GSA\u2019s  prices to be at least 10 percent less.  Similarly, the Travel, Motor Vehicle,  and Card Services business portfolio has established a performance  measure that will track how its prices compare against a baseline of prices  paid for similar products in the private sector.  However, the General  Supplies and Services business portfolio does not track any measures  related to pricing.  A GSA official in the FAS Office of Strategic Business  Planning and Process Improvement, which oversees performance  management, noted that they are in the early stages of internal discussions  regarding the development of performance measures related to quality,  which would address pricing, as well as developing a separate scorecard  for the MAS program.", "GSA also uses an annual MAS customer satisfaction survey to assess MAS  customers\u2019 perspectives on MAS prices, information available on the MAS  program, and training efforts, among other things.  The results of such  surveys can be used to monitor trends in customer satisfaction over time  and identify areas for improvement.  OMB guidance for federal agencies  on statistical surveys advises that agencies should aim to achieve the  highest practical response rate, and conduct a nonresponse analysis when  response rates do not reach 80 percent, as lower response rates increase  the risk of bias in the survey results.  However, the MAS customer  satisfaction survey reports we reviewed for fiscal years 2007 through 2009  had a response rate of 1 percent or less, and did not include a nonresponse  analysis, raising concerns over the use of the surveys\u2019 results to measure  MAS program performance.  A GSA official who oversees the survey  acknowledged that the low response rate is an indicator that GSA should  improve its survey methodology."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Billions of taxpayer dollars flow through MACs, GWACs, the MAS  program, and enterprisewide contracts; however, the federal government  does not have a clear comprehensive view of who is using these contracts  and if they are being used in an efficient and effective manner\u2014one that  minimizes duplication and advantages the government\u2019s buying power by  taking a more strategic approach to buying goods and services.   Longstanding problems with the quality of FPDS-NG data on these  contracts and the lack of consistent governmentwide policy on the  creation, use, and costs of awarding and administering of some of these  contracts are hampering the government\u2019s ability to realize the strategic  value of using these contracts.  Furthermore, departments and agencies  may be contracting for the same goods and services across a myriad of  contracts\u2014MACs, GWACs, the MAS program, and enterprisewide  contracts.  A more comprehensive business case analysis for MACs and  enterprisewide contracts could help ensure that these contracts are being  established and used in an efficient and effective manner.", "Agencies are sometimes reluctant to turn to the GSA MAS program  because they are not confident that GSA prices are as low as they could be  and, as a result, create their own contracts.  While GSA has established  pricing provisions and tools to use to ensure that it obtains the best prices  that vendors offer to their commercial customers and takes advantage of  price decreases after it awards its MAS contracts, some of these tools are  not applied effectively.  Consequently, it is difficult for both GSA and  federal agencies to know whether MAS prices truly achieve the program\u2019s  goal of providing best prices.  Furthermore, the proposal to eliminate the  most favored customer price objective and price reduction clause could  further weaken GSA\u2019s ability to negotiate best prices.  In addition, GSA\u2019s  decentralized program management structure and shortcomings in  program assessment tools and data create oversight challenges that  prevent GSA from obtaining reliable feedback from its customers and  managing the MAS program more strategically.  Furthermore, given that  the MAS program is the government\u2019s leading interagency contracting  program, it is important that OFPP stay informed of GSA\u2019s plans to  address these issues, in order to identify potential lessons learned that  could be relevant for other interagency contracting programs.", "Until these issues with interagency and enterprisewide contracts and the  MAS program are addressed, we believe the government will continue to  miss opportunities to minimize duplication and take advantage of the  government\u2019s buying power through more efficient and more strategic  contracting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide better transparency and a coordinated approach in awarding  MACs and enterprisewide contracts, we recommend that the Director of  the Office of Management and Budget direct the Administrator of the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy to take the following five actions in  conjunction with the agencies\u2019 senior procurement executives:     Survey departments and agencies to update the 2006 Office of Federal  Procurement Policy Interagency Contracting Data Collection Initiative  to identify the universe of MACs and enterprisewide contracts in use  throughout federal departments and agencies and assess their utility  for maximizing procurement resources across agencies;     Ensure that departments and agencies use the survey data to  accurately record these contracts in FPDS-NG;    Establish a policy and procedural framework in conjunction with  agencies for establishing, approving, and reporting on new MACs and  enterprisewide contracts on an ongoing basis; the framework should  stress the need for a consistent approach to leveraging the  government\u2019s buying power across departments and agencies while  continuing to use their statutory authorities for buying goods and  services;    Assess the feasibility of establishing and maintaining a centralized  database, which could provide sufficient information on GWACs,  MACs, and enterprisewide contracts, for contracting officers to  conduct market research and make informed decisions on the  availability of existing contracts to meet the agencies\u2019 requirements;  and    As part of developing the pending FAR rule to implement the 2009  National Defense Authorization Act, ensure that departments and  agencies complete a comprehensive business case analysis as  described by the SARA panel, and include a requirement to address  potential duplication with existing contracts, before new MACs and  enterprisewide contracts are established.", "To strengthen GSA MAS program pricing and management, we  recommend that the Administrator of the General Services Administration  take the following eight actions:  In coordination with the GSA Inspector General, target the use of pre- award audits to cover more contracts that meet the audit threshold;     Fully implement the process that has been initiated to ensure that  vendors that meet the pre-negotiation clearance panel threshold  receive a panel review;    When considering the MAS Advisory Panel recommendations to clarify  the price objective and eliminate the price reduction clause, ensure  that any alternative means to negotiate and determine best prices are  validated and in place before eliminating these pricing provisions,    Collect transactional data on MAS orders and prices paid, possibly  through the expanded use of existing electronic tools or through a pilot  data collection initiative for selected MAS schedules and make the  information available to MAS contract negotiators and customer  agencies,     Establish more consistent performance measures across the MAS  program, including measures for pricing;     Take steps to increase the MAS customer survey response rate by using  a methodologically sound means to identify bona fide program users  and employing survey techniques that produce meaningful and  actionable information that can lead to program improvements;    Clarify and strengthen the MAS program office\u2019s charter and authority  so that it has clear roles and responsibilities to consistently implement  guidance, policies, and best practices across GSA\u2019s acquisition centers  including policies and practices related to the above recommendations;  and    Report GSA\u2019s plans to address these recommendations to the  Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB, DOD, Department of Health  and Human Services, DHS, VA, GSA, and NASA.

GSA also stated that it plans to brief the Administrator of  the OFPP on its plans to implement the recommendations.  In addition,  GSA noted the key role that competition plays in helping agencies achieve  the best value through the MAS program.  Specifically, GSA stated that the  pre-award audit cost avoidance amounts identified by the GSA IG do not  account for additional price reductions that might be realized from other  regulatory procedures in the FAR that call for users of the MAS program to  seek competition and additional price reductions on MAS orders.  As  noted in our report, the pre-award amounts reflect cost avoidance in the  negotiated contract-level prices for MAS contracts as opposed to order- level prices, which GSA acknowledges are challenging to collect  information on.  In addition, GSA stated in its written comments that the  requirement for ordering activities to seek price discounts at the order  level is an additional key regulatory pricing control for the MAS program.   While competition and requirements to seek additional price discounts are  key aspects of ensuring that agencies can achieve the best value through  the MAS program, we note that our objective was to evaluate the  effectiveness of the tools and controls GSA uses to obtain the best  possible prices for its customers in negotiating MAS contract prices, as  opposed to tools used at the ordering level by agencies.  Finally, as noted  in our report, our recent review of 336 MAS blanket purchase agreements  found that agencies did not seek additional price discounts as required by  the FAR in almost half of the instances reviewed.

To conduct this review we selected agencies that established or  used the MAS, governmentwide acquisition contract (GWAC), multiagency  contract (MAC) or enterprisewide contract programs.  The six agencies  and three military departments selected in our review were responsible for  almost 87 percent of total federal procurement obligations in fiscal year  2008. We met with representatives from the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), selected agencies\u2019  Senior Procurement Executives or representatives, and selected Heads of  Contracting Activities and contracting officers at the departments and  agencies included in our review.  We also met with vendors and several  private sector organizations that represent the vendor community.  See  table 6 below for a list of agencies, reason for selection, and contracting  activities included in our review.", "In addition, we used a structured interview process to discuss our review  objectives with a mix of 16 large and small vendors with high sales on the  GSA MAS program and also awarded GWACs, MACs, or enterprisewide  contracts.  Table 7 identifies the vendors included in our review.", "To determine the magnitude of interagency contracting and the extent to  which policies and guidance exist to establish, oversee, and manage  MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide contracts, we tried to identify the  universe of these contract vehicles.  We found that an official central list of  these vehicles did not exist.  We also tried to use the Federal Procurement  Data System-New Generation (FPDS-NG) to identify these vehicles but  found this system did not adequately identify these vehicles.  To determine  if the data on interagency contracts were reliable we tried to verify some  of the data generated from FPDS-NG.  For instance, FPDS-NG includes a  data field that is intended to identify GWACs but we found a number of  instances where known GWACs were coded incorrectly.  For example, the  Environmental Protection Agency has a number of GWACs but when we  searched on the contract numbers in FPDS-NG, none of the GWAC  contracts were correctly coded as a GWAC.  Similarly, some of the  National Institutes of Health GWAC contracts were not correctly coded.   We also searched the system by contract number for MACs that we were  aware of and found similar issues, with some contracts coded properly as  MACs and some not.  This lack of reliability with FPDS-NG data made it  impossible to determine the universe of these types of contracts.  Despite  its critical role, we have consistently reported on FPDS-NG data quality  issues over a number of years. Accordingly, we conducted literature  searches, reviewed 13 agencies\u2019 and departments\u2019 Web pages and also  selected the ten largest government contractors\u2019 which received the most  GWACs procurement obligations in fiscal year 2008 and reviewed their  Web pages to identify examples of MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide  contracts.  This produced a list of 14 MAC programs, 9 GWAC programs,  and 7 enterprisewide contracting programs, but we acknowledge that it  likely understates the total number of these programs.  Based on this list,  we judgmentally selected to review 14 contracting programs in 5 agencies  and the 2 military departments to provide a broad perspective on agencies  use.  Table 8 lists the MAC, GWAC, enterprisewide contract programs, and  agencies responsible for the vehicles that we selected to obtain additional  information.", "We met with OFPP officials to assess their role in agencies awarding  MACs, GWACs, and enterprisewide contracts.  We also met with agency  officials responsible for these types of contracts and discussed their  reasons and the rational for not using other existing contracts.  We also  obtained and reviewed the program\u2019s acquisition plans and business cases  if they were available.  Since GWACs are the only type of interagency  contract receiving governmentwide oversight from OFPP, we obtained and  reviewed the agencies\u2019 annual reports to OFPP discussing how they are  achieving their goals as prescribed by the Office of Management and  Budget and the direct/indirect costs associated with management of these  contracts.  We met with selected agencies\u2019 Heads of Contracting Activities  as well as the agencies\u2019 Senior Procurement Executives or their  representatives to obtain their assessment on the use and awarding of  these vehicles.
