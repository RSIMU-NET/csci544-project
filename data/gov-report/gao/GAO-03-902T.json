Over the years  Customs has recognized that it needed to identify what is high risk\u2014and  to do so as early in the process as possible\u2014and target its limited  resources accordingly. To select, or \u201ctarget,\u201d and inspect the highest-risk  cargoes and travelers, BCBP relies on the use of threat assessments and  actionable intelligence, the ability of inspectors to quickly discover or  sense an unlawful cargo, and the use of nonintrusive inspection  technology to detect potentially harmful contraband. Each of these poses  challenges to BCBP.", "Information is key to identifying high-risk cargo. Such information can  come from manifests for air and sea shipments, from importers, or from  intelligence units within or outside DHS. Accurate information can help  BCBP make reliable risk determinations, particularly when it is used in  DHS computerized models that help assess cargo risk. Obviously, when  information or intelligence is incomplete or unreliable, it can adversely  impact on BCBP\u2019s ability to identify potentially risky cargo for inspection.", "We are currently reviewing how BCBP is targeting cargo for further  inspection and how such cargo is inspected at ports. In this regard, we are  reviewing how BCBP developed the model used in targeting, how BCBP is  handling the targets generated by the model at sea ports, and whether and  how BCBP intends to evaluate targeting. Since this work is ongoing, and  involves information that BCBP also considers to be law enforcement  sensitive, we are precluded from discussing specific aspects of this matter  in this unclassified statement. However, in the broadest terms, our work to  date shows that BCBP\u2019s targeting efforts face a range of challenges  relating to threat assessments, actionable intelligence, and nonintrusive  inspection technology.", "Having sufficient numbers of well-trained and motivated staff is also key  to identifying high-risk cargo. Inspectors and canine officers are trained to  detect unusual or abnormal behaviors or circumstances that suggest a  potential threat or unlawful activity.

Nevertheless, these inspectors are challenged by the tight timeframes and  pressures they work under to move legitimate cargo through the ports.", "Our recent work on the inspection of international mail showed that  relying on inspectors alone can increase the risk that contraband enters  the country. The inspection of incoming foreign mail remains largely a  manual process that relies primarily on physical examination. We found  several challenges relating to this process, but BCBP\u2019s determination that  our results were law enforcement sensitive precludes our discussing them  here. However, at the time our work was completed, one courier was  working with the former Customs Service to pilot test an advance manifest  system\u2014a computerized database that receives cargo manifest  information.

For example, we reviewed  Customs\u2019 acquisition and deployment of radiation detection equipment.  We found that some of the radiation detection equipment being used\u2014 radiation pagers\u2014have a limited range and are not designed to detect  weapons-usable nuclear material.

For example, one initiative, the Company  Enforced Compliance Process (CECP), was to address large importers\u2019  noncompliance that had a significant negative impact on the overall  national compliance rates. According to the study, Customs was to punish  noncomplying companies by imposing \u201cconfirmed risk\u201d designations,  increasing examinations, removing privileges, and referring for penalties.  However, the confirmed risk status was only used six times, and loss of  privileges and referral for penalties were never used.

While nearly a 3-fold increase from the 3,400 agents the  Border Patrol had along the southwest border in 1994, it is still about 2,200  agents short of the minimum number, 11,700, the Border Patrol said it  needed to fully implement the southwest border strategy. Currently, the  Border Patrol has 567 agents deployed along the northern border.", "We also reported on various factors that had impeded the Border Patrol\u2019s  ability to implement its strategy, some of which still appear to be  problematic. For example, it had taken the Border Patrol longer to  implement the strategy than originally planned because, among other  things, the Border Patrol experienced difficulties hiring agents and delays  in obtaining approvals needed to deploy technology and build fences.", "The Border Patrol also recognized the need to make outreach efforts to  communities because its initial failure to warn some communities about  anticipated increases in illegal alien traffic caught community officials by  surprise and angered some residents due to the negative effects the  increased traffic had on the community. When apprehensions surged in  communities into which the illegal alien traffic was reportedly pushed,  officials and residents in one community reported experiencing loss of  business, destruction of private property, and environmental degradation.  Concerns have been raised over the environmental impact of current plans  to build additional fencing along the border in Arizona. A recent news  article described how some local residents in the border area southwest of  Tucson, Arizona, are patrolling the border to report illegal crossings  raising the concern of law enforcement officials. The Border Patrol has  realized its goal of shifting illegal alien traffic away from urban areas into  more remote areas. However, rather than being deterred from attempting  illegal entry, many aliens have instead risked injury and death by trying to  cross mountains, deserts, and rivers. This prompted the Border Patrol to  implement a Border Safety Initiative consisting of, among other things, a  media campaign to warn aliens about the dangers of crossing illegally, as  well as establishing search-and-rescue units.", "We further reported in August 2001 that although alien apprehensions had  shifted along the border as expected, overall apprehensions along the  southwest border had continued to increase to over 1.6 million in fiscal  year 2000\u2014raising questions about the strategy\u2019s effect on overall illegal  entry along the southwest border.

U.S. and certain Canadian citizens are exempt from having to  present any document upon entry. Instead, they can make an oral claim of  citizenship, if this satisfies the inspector.

For  instance, one DHS directorate\u2019s responsibility includes the protection of  critical information systems that we already consider a high risk. In fact,  many of the major components merging into the new department,  including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA and  the U.S. Coast Guard, face at least one major problem, such as strategic  human capital risks, critical information technology challenges, or  financial management vulnerabilities; they also confront an array of  challenges and risks to program operations. For example, TSA has had  considerable challenges in meeting deadlines for screening baggage, and  the agency has focused most of its initial security efforts on aviation  security, with less attention to other modes of transportation. The Coast  Guard faces the challenges inherent in a massive fleet modernization.", "DHS\u2019s national security mission is of such importance that the failure to  address its management challenges and programs risks could have serious  consequences on our intergovernmental system, our citizens\u2019 health and  safety, and our economy. Overall, our designation of the implementation  and transformation of DHS as a high-risk area stems from the importance  of its mission and the nation\u2019s reliance on the department\u2019s effectiveness  in meeting its challenges for protecting the country against terrorism.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
