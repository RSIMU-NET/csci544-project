Responsibility for program monitoring and evaluation is linked to the method used by USAID to transfer the funds.", "When USAID transfers funds under 632 (a), the transfer agreements are brief documents that do not obligate funds. Instead, these agreements are simply an allocation of funds from USAID to the Treasury for use in activities under the Treasury\u2019s funding obligation process. USAID has minimal responsibility for approving these activities, and program monitoring and evaluation are the responsibility of the Treasury.", "When USAID transfers funds to the Treasury under 632 (b), USAID essentially retains control over how the funds are used and accounted for. Under a 632 (b) transfer, USAID and the Treasury negotiate and agree upon how the funds will be used, and the transfer agreement includes a requirement that the Treasury follow USAID\u2019s procurement and reporting rules.

During fiscal years 1993-96, the transfers took place primarily under 632 (b) authority. In 1996, the State Department Coordinator of assistance to the former Soviet Union directed USAID to switch most funding authority from 632 (b) to 632 (a). The decision was made, according to the Coordinator, because disputes about money and policies between USAID and the Treasury were delaying program implementation. The Coordinator of assistance to Central Europe said he directed USAID to switch funding authority from 632 (b) to 632 (a) in 1997 after USAID said it could no longer provide adequate monitoring of 632 (b) programs, given USAID\u2019s downsizing over the past several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Location and Cost of Advisors in Paris and London", "paragraphs": ["From July 1991 to September 1997, the Treasury\u2019s senior advisors for the tax team were based in Paris, and from November 1994 to September 1997, the senior advisor for the financial institutions team was based in London. This appendix discusses the basis and costs of placing these advisors in those locations.", "In 1991, the Treasury identified Paris as the best location for its senior advisor for tax since it offered good communications and transportation links. It also provided the advantage of on-site coordination with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which was active in providing tax training for government officials from Central Europe. In 1994, the Treasury decided to post a senior advisor for the financial institutions program in London because it also provided for better transportation links and an opportunity for on-site coordination with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that planned to work on bank privatization. Also, in 1994, the Treasury based its newly assigned senior advisor for the government debt issuance area in Budapest, Hungary. The senior advisor for the budget area was likewise placed in Budapest in 1995. In 1997, the senior advisors for tax and financial institutions closed their Paris and London offices, and all senior Treasury advisors were consolidated in Budapest.", "Expenditure data provided by the Treasury showed the average annual support costs of basing the senior advisor in Paris from fiscal year 1992 to 1997 were $103,796 in 1997 dollars. These costs included housing, travel, and office support. They did not include compensation and benefits nor overall program management costs, since these costs are the same regardless of location. Comparable costs for the advisor in London from fiscal year 1995 to 1997 were $137,675.

We included the short-term advisor costs because they represent a key component of the Treasury program. We discussed our methodology with OTA management and staff on several occasions and have clarified our presentation of the methodology in the body of the report. 2. Our review focused on the annual OTA requirement to review the financial disclosure statements of its advisors. We have clarified the report to include additional information on the other financial disclosure requirements that apply when advisors are hired. 3. Our report is not intended to imply that the Terms of Reference should be considered a principal measure of an advisor\u2019s utility in a particular country. Department of the Treasury officials told us the Terms of Reference are intended to ensure that the United States and a recipient country have a formal understanding on the advisor\u2019s role and that the recipient government is committed to working with the advisor. As we point out in the report, the Terms of Reference were not available for 15 of the 19 advisors assigned to Russia and Romania since 1992.

In addition, we provided information on advisor qualifications, program cost, fund transfers between USAID and the Treasury, and the location of the Treasury\u2019s senior advisors to its program.", "To identify OTA activities, we reviewed the Department of the Treasury\u2019s and the Department of State\u2019s current strategic planning documents; analyzed program planning and reporting documents; interviewed Treasury, State, and USAID officials in Washington, D.C.; and attended the annual Treasury advisors\u2019 conference in Budapest in November 1997, where we interviewed senior, regional, and resident advisors on their background experience, work in host countries, and interaction and coordination with other bilateral and multilateral advisors.", "In completing our review, we examined in detail advisor activities in Russia and Romania and visited OTA\u2019s advisors working in these countries. At the time of our fieldwork, programs in Russia and Romania together represented about one quarter of the Treasury\u2019s resident advisors. In Moscow, and Bucharest, Romania, we reviewed program documents such as reports written by the current advisors for the host-government officials and interviewed all OTA resident advisors, the International Monetary Fund advisor and/or representative, USAID contractors, private sector groups such as the Soros Foundation, and host-government officials at the deputy and vice minister levels and below at the ministries of finance and tax, the central banks, the Ministry of Interior and the General Prosecutor\u2019s office in Bucharest, and the Chamber of Accounts in Moscow.

To determine the average cost per advisor, we obtained the Treasury\u2019s financial reports and advisor cost data for fiscal years 1995-97 and reviewed average cost analyses prepared by the Treasury, the State Department\u2019s Inspector General, and USAID. Further, we interviewed Treasury officials and reviewed Treasury budget estimates to understand the elements of the program budget. We did not independently verify the validity of the Treasury\u2019s data.", "We analyzed USAID contractor cost data to calculate average costs. We also discussed our analysis with USAID contractor officials, who agreed that our analysis accurately depicted USAID costs. Primarily because of different contractual arrangements with advisors and different financial reporting systems, USAID and the Treasury do not present cost data in the same way or with the same cost categories. To present comparable costs in this report, we gathered the various costs into three broad categories\u2014compensation paid to resident advisors and contractors overseas, including housing allowances; support costs for the advisors and contractors; and the cost of employing short-term advisors to assist the resident advisors and contractors.", "To address the location of the Treasury\u2019s senior advisors to its program in Paris and London, we interviewed Treasury and State officials and reviewed cost data and documents justifying the placement of advisors in those capital cities. To determine the cost of basing senior advisors in Paris and London, we obtained support costs for these locations since 1991, including housing, travel, and transportation by senior advisors, and office support. As agreed to with our requesters, we did not include compensation and benefits or program management costs because these costs are constant regardless of country. To compare an overall average support cost per advisor and location, we calculated an average advisor cost for each fiscal year and in total. Furthermore, to determine overall average support costs for each location, we summarized the costs for all years, divided by the number of years that senior advisors were based at each location. Our analysis of costs for Paris was limited to fiscal  years 1992-97 because the initial posting of an advisor was at the end of fiscal year 1991.", "To address the issue of fund transfers from USAID, we interviewed Treasury, State, and USAID officials and reviewed prior GAO reports on fund transfers from USAID to other agencies.", "As part of our work, we initially reviewed aspects of OTA\u2019s logistical support contracts.
