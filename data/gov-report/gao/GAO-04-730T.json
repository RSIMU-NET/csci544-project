The program allowed the Iraqi government to use the proceeds of its oil sales to pay for food, medicine, and infrastructure maintenance. The program appears to have helped the Iraqi people. From 1996 through 2001, the average daily food intake increased from 1,300 to 2,300 calories. From 1997 to 2002, Iraq sold more than $67 billion of oil through the program and issued $38 billion in letters of credit to purchase commodities.

This estimate includes oil revenue and contract amounts for 2002, updated letters of credit from prior years, and newer estimates of illicit commissions from commodity suppliers. The U.N. Secretary General, through the Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) and the Security Council, through its Iraq sanctions committee, were both responsible for overseeing the Oil for Food Program. However, the Security Council allowed the Iraq government, as a sovereign entity, to negotiate contracts directly with purchasers of Iraqi oil and suppliers of commodities. This structure was an important factor in allowing Iraq to levy illegal surcharges and commissions. OIP was responsible for examining Iraqi contracts for price and value, but it is unclear how it performed this function. The sanctions committee was responsible for monitoring oil smuggling, screening contracts for items that could have military uses, and approving oil and commodity contracts. The sanctions committee took action to stop illegal oil surcharges, but it is unclear what actions it took on contract commissions. U.N. external audit reports contained no findings of program fraud. Summaries of internal audit reports pointed to some concerns regarding procurement, coordination, monitoring, and oversight and concluded that OIP had generally responded to audit recommendations. OIP transferred responsibility for 3,059 Oil for Food contracts--with pending shipments valued at $6.2 billion--to the CPA on November 22, 2003. Poor communication and coordination on contracting documents and inadequate staffing hampered efforts by the CPA's Oil for Food coordination center in Baghdad to ensure that commodities continued to be delivered. The execution of food contracts was also affected by evolving decisions about food distribution, inadequate coordination, and security issues. Challenges face the interim Iraqi government as it balances the need to reform a costly food subsidy program with the need to maintain food stability and protect the poorest populations. Also, inadequate oversight and alleged corruption in the program raise concerns about the Iraqi government's ability to manage the remaining Oil for Food commodities, continue the food distribution system, and absorb $32 billion in expected donor funds for reconstruction. The CPA has taken steps to build internal controls and accountability measures in Iraq's ministries. Several investigations of the Oil for Food program will soon be under way. These efforts may wish to consider several areas for further analysis to better determine the extent of corruption in the program, the adequacy of internal controls, and the lessons learned in implementing a large-scale humanitarian aid program within a sanctions framework."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s review of the United  Nations (U.N.)

We met with U.N. officials immediately  following the transfer of the program to the CPA in November 2003 and  with numerous U.S. officials representing the CPA, the Departments of  Defense and State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development to  discuss the program\u2019s transfer and its ongoing management by the CPA.  We also reviewed 12 external audits to determine the use of Oil for Food  funds prior to the transfer to the CPA. We assessed the reliability of the  data on the number of contracts reviewed for priority by the United  Nations, the CPA, and Iraqi ministries, and those transferred to the CPA in  November 2003 by corroborating OIP information with CPA data. We were  unable to assess the reliability of the dollar amounts of contracts reviewed  and pending shipment because we did not have access to information that  would have allowed us to confirm the dollar amounts reviewed and  transferred.

Security Council resolution 661 of 1990 prohibited  all nations from buying and selling Iraqi commodities, except for food and  medicine. Security Council resolution 661 also prohibited all nations from  exporting weapons or military equipment to Iraq and established a  sanctions committee to monitor compliance and progress in implementing  the sanctions. The members of the sanctions committee were members of  the Security Council. Subsequent Security Council resolutions specifically  prohibited nations from exporting to Iraq items that could be used to build  chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. In 1991, the Security Council  offered to let Iraq sell oil under a U.N. program to meet its peoples\u2019 basic  needs. The Iraqi government rejected the offer, and over the next 5 years,  the United Nations reported food shortages and a general deterioration in  social services.", "In December 1996, the United Nations and Iraq agreed on the Oil for Food  program, which permitted Iraq to sell up to $1 billion worth of oil every 90  days to pay for food, medicine, and humanitarian goods. Subsequent U.N.  resolutions increased the amount of oil that could be sold and expanded  the humanitarian goods that could be imported. In 1999, the Security  Council removed all restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could sell to  purchase civilian goods. The United Nations and the Security Council  monitored and screened contracts that the Iraqi government signed with  commodity suppliers and oil purchasers, and Iraq\u2019s oil revenue was placed  in a U.N.-controlled escrow account. In May 2003, U.N. resolution 1483  requested the U.N. Secretary General to transfer the Oil for Food program  to the CPA by November 2003. (Appendix I contains a detailed chronology  of Oil for Food program and sanctions events.) The United Nations  allocated 59 percent of the oil revenue for the 15 central and southern  governates, which were controlled by the central government; 13 percent  for the 3 northern Kurdish governates; 25 percent for a war reparations  fund for victims of the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1990; and 3 percent for  U.N. administrative costs, including the costs of weapons inspectors.", "From 1997 to 2002, the Oil for Food program was responsible for more  than $67 billion of Iraq's oil revenue. Through a large portion of this  revenue, the United Nations provided food, medicine, and services to 24  million people and helped the Iraqi government supply goods to 24  economic sectors. Despite concerns that sanctions may have worsened the  humanitarian situation, the Oil for Food program appears to have helped  the Iraqi people. The Oil for Food program facilitated the operation of the  Public Distribution System run by Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Trade. The system  distributes a monthly \u201cfood basket\u201d that normally consists of a dozen  items to all Iraqis. About 60 percent of Iraqis rely on this basket as their  main source of food. According to the United Nations, the average daily  food intake increased from around 1,275 calories per person per day in  1996 to about 2,229 calories at the end of 2001. Malnutrition rates for  children under 5 fell by more than half. In February 2002, the United  Nations reported that the Oil for Food program had considerable success  in several sectors such as agriculture, food, health, and nutrition by  arresting the decline in living conditions and improving the nutritional  status of the average Iraqi citizen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Former Iraqi Regime Acquired an Estimated $10.1 Billion in Illicit Revenue", "paragraphs": ["We estimate that, from 1997 through 2002, the former Iraqi regime  acquired $10.1 billion in illegal revenues\u2014$5.7 billion through oil smuggled  out of Iraq and $4.4 billion through surcharges against oil sales and illicit  commissions from commodity suppliers.

Appendix II describes our  methodology for determining illegal revenues gained by the former Iraqi  regime.", "Oil was smuggled out through several routes, according to U.S.  government officials and oil industry experts. Oil entered Syria by  pipeline, crossed the borders of Jordan and Turkey by truck, and was  smuggled through the Persian Gulf by ship. In addition to revenues from  oil smuggling, the Iraqi government levied surcharges against oil  purchasers and commissions against commodity suppliers participating in  the Oil for Food program. According to some Security Council members,  the surcharge was up to 50 cents per barrel of oil and the commission was  5 to 15 percent of the commodity contract.", "In our 2002 report, we estimated that the Iraqi regime received a 5-percent  illicit commission on commodity contracts. However, a September 2003  Department of Defense review found that at least 48 percent of 759 Oil for  Food contracts that it reviewed were potentially overpriced by an average  of 21 percent. Defense officials found 5 contracts that included \u201cafter- sales service charges\u201d of between 10 and 20 percent. In addition,  interviews by U.S. investigators with high-ranking Iraqi regime officials,  including the former oil and finance ministers, confirmed that the former  regime received a 10-percent commission from commodity suppliers.  According to the former oil minister, the regime instituted a fixed 10- percent commission in early 2001 to address a prior \u201ccompliance\u201d problem  with junior officials.

However, the  monitoring measures contained weaknesses. According to U.N. reports  and a statement from the monitoring firm, the major offshore terminal at  Mina al-Bakar did not have a meter to measure the oil pumped nor could  onshore storage capacity be measured. Therefore, the U.N. monitors could  not confirm the volume of oil loaded onto vessels.

In December  2003, as the security environment worsened, the CPA administrator  reversed his decision to reform the food ration system and left the  decision to a provisional Iraqi government.", "In January 2004, CPA negotiated a memorandum of understanding (MOU)  with WFP and the Ministry of Trade that committed WFP to procuring a 3- month, $900 million emergency food stock by March 31, 2004, and  assuming the delivery of remaining food basket items to hub warehouses  inside Iraq through June 2004. Delays in signing the MOU were due to  disagreements about the procurement of emergency food stocks, contract  delivery terms, and the terms of WFP\u2019s involvement. No additional food  was procured during the negotiations, and food stocks diminished and  localized shortages occurred in February and March 2004. The CPA and  WFP addressed these problems with emergency procurements from  nearby countries.", "An April WFP report projected a continued supply of food items through  May 2004 except for a 12-percent shortage in milk. Only 55 percent of  required domestic wheat has been procured for July 2004 and no domestic  wheat has been procured for August. In accordance with the MOU, WFP  completed its procurement of emergency food stocks by March 31, 2004.  The Ministry of Trade assumed responsibility for food procurement on  April 1, 2004.", "A U.S. official stated in early March 2004 that coordination between WFP  and the Ministry of Trade had been deteriorating. The Ministry had not  provided WFP with complete and timely information on monthly food  allocation plans, weekly stock reports, or information on cargo arrivals, as  the MOU required. WFP staff reported that the Ministry\u2019s data were  subject to sudden, large, and unexplained stock adjustments, thereby  making it difficult to plan deliveries. However, a State Department official  noted in April 2004 that coordination between WFP and the Ministry was  improving.", "The security environment in Iraq also affected planning for the transfer  and the movement of Oil for Food goods in the fall of 2003. The transfer  occurred during a period of deteriorating security conditions and growing  violence in Iraq. A September 2003 U.N. report found that the evacuation  of U.N. personnel from Baghdad, following the bombing of the U.N. office  in August 2003, affected the timetable and procedures for the transfer of  the Oil for Food program to the CPA and contributed to delays in  prioritizing and renegotiating contracts. Most WFP staff remained in  Amman and other regional offices and continued to manage the Oil for  Food program from those locations. The August bombing of the U.N.  Baghdad office also resulted in the temporary suspension of the border  inspection process and shipments of humanitarian supplies and  equipment. A March 2004 CPA report also noted that stability of the food  supply would be affected if security conditions worsened. According to a  coordination center official in Baghdad, the worsening security situation  during April 2004 has affected the food supply due to (1) the withdrawal of  insurance by a major Arab insurance company, which is making it more  difficult to find shippers to carry goods into Iraq; (2) a shortage of truck  drivers willing to drive in Iraq; and (3) continuing and shifting route  closures and generally high-risk conditions.", "After the CPA transfers responsibility for the food distribution system to  the Iraqi provisional government in July 2004, the government will have to  decide whether to continue, reform, or eliminate the current system.  Documents from the Ministries of Finance and Planning indicate that the  annual cost of maintaining the system is as high as $5 billion, or about 25  percent of total government expenditures. In 2005 and 2006, expenditures  for food will be almost as much as all expenditures for capital projects.  According to a September 2003 joint U.N. and World Bank needs  assessment of Iraq, the food subsidy, given out as a monthly ration to the  entire population, staved off mass starvation during the time of the  sanctions, but disrupted the market for food grains produced locally. The  agricultural sector had little incentive to produce crops in the absence of a  promising market. However, the Iraqi government may find it politically  difficult to scale back the food distribution system with 60 percent of the  population relying on monthly rations as their primary source of nutrition.
