To counter this threat, the Department of Defense's (DOD's) Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is developing a system to defeat ballistic missiles. MDA expects to spend $50 billion over the next 5 years to develop and field this system. A significant portion of these funds will be invested in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element. To field elements as soon as practicable, MDA has adopted an acquisition strategy whereby capabilities are upgraded as new technologies become available and is implementing it in 2-year blocks. Given the risks inherent to this strategy, GAO was asked to determine when MDA plans to demonstrate the maturity of technologies critical to the performance of GMD's Block 2004 capability and to identify the estimated costs to develop and field the GMD element and any significant risks with the estimate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GMD is a sophisticated weapon system being developed to protect the United States against limited attacks by long-range ballistic missiles. It consists of a collection of radars and a weapon component--a three-stage booster and exoatmospheric kill vehicle--integrated by a centralized control system that formulates battle plans and directs the operation of GMD components. Successful performance of these components is dependent on 10 critical technologies. MDA expects to demonstrate the maturity of most of these technologies before fielding the GMD element, which is scheduled to begin in September 2004. However, the agency has accepted higher cost and schedule risks by beginning integration of the element's components before these technologies have matured. So far, MDA has matured two critical GMD technologies. If development and testing progress as planned, MDA expects to demonstrate the maturity of five other technologies by the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. The radar technologies are the least mature. MDA intends to demonstrate the maturity of an upgraded early warning radar in California in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 and a sea-based radar in the Pacific Ocean in the fourth quarter of that year. Although MDA does not plan to demonstrate the maturity of the technology of the early warning radar in Alaska, which will serve as the primary fire control radar, through its own integrated flight tests, it may be able to do so through the anticipated launch of foreign test missiles. MDA estimates that it will spend about $21.8 billion between 1997 and 2009 to develop the GMD element. This estimate includes $7.8 billion to develop and field the GMD Block 2004 capability. For example, the funds will be used to install interceptors at two sites, upgrade existing radars and testing infrastructure, and develop the sea-based X-band radar. We found that MDA has incurred a greater risk of cost growth because for more than a year the agency was not able to rely fully on data from its primary tool for monitoring whether the GMD contractor has been performing work within cost and on schedule. In February 2002, MDA modified the prime contract to reflect an increased scope of work for developing GMD. It was not until July 2003 that the agency completed a review to ensure that the data was fully reliable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hostile states, including those that sponsor terrorism, are investing  significant resources to develop and deploy ballistic missiles of increasing  range and sophistication that could be used against the United States, our  deployed forces, and our allies.

In  1997, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) established the  National Missile Defense (NMD) Joint Program Office. The program office  was directed to demonstrate by 1999 a system that could protect the  United States from attacks of intercontinental ballistic missiles and to  be in a position to deploy the system if the threat warranted by 2003. The  initial system consisted of space- and ground-based sensors, early warning  radars, interceptors, and battle management functions.", "The program underwent additional changes as the new decade began.  In September 2000, the President decided to defer deployment of the  NMD system, but development of the system continued with the goal of  being ready to deploy the system when directed.

The  Secretary of Defense, in January 2002, renamed BMDO as MDA and  consolidated all ballistic missile defense programs under the new agency.  Former missile defense acquisition programs became elements of a single  ballistic missile defense system. These changes were followed in  December 2002, by the President\u2019s directive to begin fielding in 2004 a  ballistic missile defense system, which included components of the GMD  element already under development.", "The GMD element is intended to protect the United States against long- range ballistic missiles in the midcourse phase of their flight. This is the  point outside the atmosphere where the motors that boost an enemy  missile into space have stopped burning and the deployed warhead  follows a predictable path toward its target. Compared to the boost and  terminal phases, this stage of flight offers the largest window of  opportunity for interception and allows the GMD element a longer time to  track and engage a target.", "As illustrated in figure 1, GMD will rely on a broad array of components  to track and intercept missiles.

Principally, although major contract modifications were made in  February 2002, it took until July 2003 for MDA to complete a review to  confirm the reliability of data from the EVM system. An earlier review of a  similar nature revealed significant deficiencies in the contractor\u2019s  formulation and collection of EVM data. Until a new review was  completed, MDA could not be sure about its ability to rely fully upon this  data to identify potential problems in time to prevent significant cost  growth and schedule delays."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Baseline Revised over 13-Month Period", "paragraphs": ["An accurate, valid, and current performance management baseline is  needed to perform useful analyses using EVM. The baseline identifies and  defines work tasks, designates and assigns organizational responsibility  for each task, schedules the work task in accordance with established  targets, and allocates budget to the scheduled work. According to DOD  guidance, a performance management baseline should be in place as  early as possible after the contractor is authorized to proceed. Although  the guidance does not define how quickly the contractor should establish  a baseline, experts generally agree that it should be in place, on average,  within 3 months after a contract is awarded or modified.", "About a year before the Secretary of Defense directed MDA to adopt an  evolutionary acquisition strategy, the agency awarded a new contract for  the development of a National Missile Defense system. In February 2002,  MDA modified this contract to redirect the contractor\u2019s efforts. Instead of  developing a missile defense system that met all of the requirements of the  war fighter, as the initial contract required, the modification directed the  contractor to develop the first GMD increment, or block, which was to be  a ballistic missile test bed with GMD as its centerpiece.", "Following the contract\u2019s modification, the contractor in June 2002  established an interim baseline. This baseline was developed by adding  budgets for near-term new work to the original baseline. Because the cost  of the work being added to the baseline had not yet been negotiated, the  contractor based the budgets on the cost proposed to MDA, as directed by  DOD guidelines. The contractor implemented the baseline almost within  the 3-month time frame recommended by experts. In the time between the  modification and the development of the interim baseline, MDA authorized  the contractor to begin work and spend a specified amount of money, and  MDA paid the contractor about $390 million during this period.", "An option that MDA could have used to help validate the interim baseline  was to have the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) verify  contractor work packages and track the movement of funds between the  unpriced work account and the baseline. However, neither MDA nor  DCMA initiated these actions. In its technical comments on a draft of this  report, DOD pointed out that during the negotiation process, MDA reviews  prime and subcontractor proposal data that include engineering labor  hours, material, and cost estimates. DOD further noted that these  estimates eventually form a basis for the work packages that make up the  data for the performance management baseline. We agree that these costs  will eventually be associated with the work packages that make up the  baseline. However, a joint contractor and MDA review of the initial GMD  baseline concluded that even though these costs were otherwise fair and  reasonable, some work packages that the contractor developed for the  original contract\u2019s baseline did not correctly reflect the work directed by  MDA. An independent review of work packages included in the interim  baseline would have increased the likelihood that the work packages were  being properly developed and that their budget and schedule were  appropriate.", "The contractor completed all revisions to the baseline for the prime  contractor and all five subcontractors by March 2003, 3 months  after negotiating the cost of the modification and 13 months after  authorizing the work to begin. The contracting officer explained that it  took until December 2002 to negotiate the 2002 contract change because  the additional work was extremely complex, and, as a result, the  modification needed to be vetted through many subcontractors that  support the prime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Baseline Review Completed in July 2003", "paragraphs": ["The DOD guidance states that an integrated baseline review (IBR) is to be  conducted within 6 months of award of a new contract or major change  to an existing contract.

Completing this IBR took  until July 2003 because of the complexity of the program and the many  subcontractors that were involved. Although the review team found fewer  problems with the contractor\u2019s formulation and execution of the new  baseline, problems were identified. For example, the IBR showed that in  some cases the baseline did not reflect the new statement of work. Also,  both the prime contractor and subcontractors improperly allocated budget  to activities that indirectly affect a work product (known as level of effort  activities) when they could have associated these activities with a discrete  end product.

We  also recognize that the most cost efficient means of testing the Cobra Dane  radar is through launches involving foreign test missiles.

If it is used as intended, the EVM system can be an effective means of  monitoring one of GMD\u2019s largest costs, the cost of having a contractor  develop the GMD system. It is understandable that the dynamic changes in  MDA\u2019s acquisition strategy led to major contract modifications, which  made it more difficult for the contractor to establish a stable baseline.

DOD also stated that a selected portion of this  work is already being accomplished by DCMA. We continue to believe in  the feasibility of our recommendation. DCMA officials told us that they  could monitor the movement of budget into the baseline and verify the  work packages associated with the budget. In addition, the guidelines  state that surveillance may be accomplished through sampling of internal  and external data.

However, DOD\u2019s Earned Value  Management Implementation Guide states that such a review is  conducted within 6 months. Similar language is found in the applicable  clause from the GMD contract, which states that such reviews shall be  scheduled as early as practicable and should be conducted within 180  calendar days after the incorporation of major modifications. While we  understand the difficulty of conducting reviews within 180 days when the  contract is complex and many subcontractors are involved, we believe  that it is important for the government to complete an IBR as soon as  possible to ensure accurate measurement of progress toward the  program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "DOD also provided technical comments to this report, which we  considered and implemented as appropriate.

Without this information, management of the program will be fragmented,  presenting a distorted view of program status. For several decades, DOD  has compared the value of work performed to the work\u2019s actual cost. This  measurement is referred to as Earned Value Management (EVM). Earned  value goes beyond the two-dimensional approach of comparing budgeted  costs to actuals. It attempts to compare the value of work accomplished  during a given period with the work scheduled for that period. By using  the value of completed work as a basis for estimating the cost and time  needed to complete the program, the earned value concept should alert  program managers to potential problems early in the program.", "In 1996, in response to acquisition reform initiatives, DOD reemphasized  the importance of earned value in program management and adopted  32 criteria for evaluating the quality of management systems. These  32 criteria are organized into 5 basic categories: organization, planning and  budgeting, accounting considerations, analysis and management reports,  and revisions and data maintenance. The 32 criteria are listed in table 1. In  general terms, the criteria require contractors to (1) define the contractual  scope of work using a work breakdown structure; (2) identify  organizational responsibility for the work; (3) integrate internal  management subsystems; (4) schedule and budget authorized work;  (5) measure the progress of work based on objective indicators; (6) collect  the cost of labor and materials associated with the work performed;  (7) analyze any variances from planned cost and schedules; (8) forecast  costs at contract completion; and (9) control changes.", "The criteria have become the standard for EVM and have also been  adopted by major US government agencies, industry, and the governments  of Canada and Australia. The full application of EVM system criteria is  appropriate for large cost reimbursable contracts where the government  bears the cost risk. For such contracts, the management discipline  described by the criteria is essential. In addition, data from an EVM system  have been proven to provide objective reports of contract status, allowing  numerous indices and performance measures to be calculated. These can  then be used to develop accurate estimates of anticipated costs at  completion, providing early warning of impending schedule delays and  cost overruns.", "The standard format for tracking earned value is through a Cost  Performance Report (CPR). The CPR is a monthly compilation of cost,  schedule and technical data which displays the performance measurement  baseline, any cost and schedule variances from that baseline, the amount  of management reserve used to date, the portion of the contract that is  authorized unpriced work, and the contractor\u2019s latest revised estimate to  complete the program.", "As a result, the CPR can be used as an effective management tool because  it provides the program manager with early warning of potential cost and  schedule overruns. Using data from the CPR, a program manager can  assess trends in cost and schedule performance. This information is useful  because trends tend to continue and can be difficult to reverse. Studies  have shown that once programs are 15 percent complete the performance  indicators are indicative of the final outcome. For example, a CPR  showing a negative trend for schedule status would indicate that the  program is behind schedule. By analyzing the CPR, one could determine  the cause of the schedule problem such as delayed flight tests, changes in  requirements, or test problems because the CPR contains a section that  describes the reasons for the negative status. A negative schedule  condition is a cause for concern, because it can be a predictor of later cost  problems since additional spending is often necessary to resolve  problems. For instance, if a program finishes 6 months later than planned,  additional costs will be expended to cover the salaries of personnel and  their overhead beyond what was originally expected. CPR data provides  the basis for independent assessments of a program\u2019s cost and schedule  status and can be used to project final costs at completion in addition to  determining when a program should be completed.", "Examining a program\u2019s management reserve is another way that a  program can use a CPR to determine potential issues early on.", "Management reserves, which are funds that may be used as needed,  provide flexibility to cope with problems or unexpected events. EVM  experts agree that transfers of management reserve should be tracked and  reported because they are often problem indicators. An alarming situation  arises if the CPR shows that the management reserve is being used at a  faster pace than the program is progressing toward completion. For  example, a problem would be indicated if a program has used 80 percent  of its management reserve but only completed 40 percent of its work. A  program\u2019s management reserve should contain at least 10 percent of the  cost to complete a program so that funds will always be available to cover  future unexpected problems that are more likely to surface as the program  moves into the testing and evaluation phase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above Yvette Banks, Myra Watts  Butler, Cristina Chaplain, Roger Corrado, Jennifer Echard, Dayna Foster,  Matt Lea, Karen Richey, and Randy Zounes made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
