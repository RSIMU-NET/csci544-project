GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 16 of the 69 grant files accounting for about $3.7 million of the $8 million awarded in fiscal year 2014; and interviewed VA officials, as well as grantee officials and adaptive sports participants during site visits to adaptive sports events in three states, selected in part to ensure regional diversity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From December 2013 through September 2014, VA developed implementing regulations, announced availability of funding, and selected grantees\u2014ultimately awarding 69 grants from a pool of 161 applications to receive funding under its adaptive sports grant program. VA selected grantees in three steps, including (1) eliminating non-qualifying applications, (2) scoring and ranking qualifying applications using nine criteria, such as strength of the proposed program concept, and (3) a final step that included, among other things, eliminating unnecessary costs from proposed budgets. VA officials said limited available time necessitated the use of a standard federal grant application form rather than one tailored for the program. Because the form did not include some information needed to assess applications\u2014such as the roles of partner organizations\u2014VA asked for narrative attachments. These attachments varied greatly in length and detail which VA officials said made their review quite labor intensive. In addition, some applications did not contain needed information. For example, 3 of the 16 grant files reviewed by GAO did not contain documentation of the grantee's financial management capabilities. VA customized its application form for fiscal year 2015, and VA officials said this led to a substantial improvement in the application process.", "VA developed a grant monitoring approach for fiscal year 2014 grants that relied on quarterly and annual reports from grantees (containing information on financial and sports activities), site visits, and remote auditing of selected grantees. In the sample of 16 grant files reviewed, GAO found grantees generally complied with VA's quarterly reporting requirements. VA has improved the quarterly report template so that it requests information on time spent on direct personal interaction with participants. Through June 2015, VA provided GAO with reports of 8 visits covering 9 of its 69 grants. However, VA did not initiate a remote audit until August 2015. The agency developed a draft grant monitoring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, but the plan does not specify the number or frequency of site visits and remote audits. This omission risks the possibility that none will be performed in some years, or performed very late in the year, thus missing an opportunity for prompt detection of the misuse of funds.", "The grants supported a variety of sports activities and afforded participant benefits such as socialization and improved personal independence, according to the participants, coaches, and grantee officials GAO interviewed. The 69 grantees in fiscal year 2014 planned activities that encompassed many different adaptive sports, with cycling, boating, and snow skiing among the most common. Overall, the allotment for administrative costs in grantees' budgets was about 5.7 percent of the total $8 million awarded in fiscal year 2014\u2014below the statutory maximum of 7.5 percent. However, some grantee officials expressed concern about a significant no-show rate. VA officials confirmed that no-shows are a problem, and stated that they had shared information with some grantees about ways to reduce no-shows. However, they have not systematically gathered and disseminated such techniques to all grantees, which could promote higher attendance rates and maximum benefit of federal dollars."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA (1) specify the number and frequency of annual site visits and remote audits, and (2) systematically identify and disseminate techniques for reducing no-shows.

Due to advances in battlefield medicine a  larger proportion of military personnel are surviving their injuries, though  often with serious medical challenges including amputations, traumatic  brain injuries, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In part to promote the  lifelong health of veterans and service members with disabilities through  regular participation in physical activity and sports, federal law authorized  an adaptive sports grant program in 2008. As reauthorized in 2013, the  law tasks the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with making grants to  eligible entities for planning, developing, managing, and implementing  programs to provide adaptive sports opportunities for veterans and  members of the armed services with disabilities. Initially authorized  through fiscal year 2013, the program was reauthorized and amended in  December 2013, with the reauthorization stating that VA can provide  funding for adaptive sports opportunities occurring though fiscal year  2016. The reauthorization also included a provision that GAO submit a  report on the use of grants under the program.", "Our objectives in this review were to determine (1) how the VA adaptive  sports grant program selected grantees to provide adaptive sports  activities for veterans and service members with disabilities; (2) how the  program monitors grantees\u2019 use of grant funds; and (3) what programs  and activities have been supported with fiscal year 2014 grant funds, and  what is known about how veterans and service members with disabilities  may have benefited from these programs and activities.", "To address the objectives outlined above, we limited our review to  program grants made using fiscal year 2014 funds, which supported  grantee activities that were to take place in fiscal year 2015.

We  reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, government-wide and VA  grants management policies and other grants management criteria, VA\u2019s  July 2014 Notice of Funding Availability, quarterly status reports  submitted by selected grantees for the first half of fiscal year 2015, and  VA site visit reports of the grantees completed through June 2015. We  also obtained VA data on grantee budgets and proposed activities. We  interviewed VA officials about this data and determined that it was  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also reviewed  relevant grants management criteria, such as VA\u2019s agency-wide grants  management policies. Further, we obtained VA data on grantee budgets  and proposed activities. To better understand VA\u2019s approach to grantee  selection and oversight, we also reviewed a sample of VA\u2019s grant files\u2014 16 of the 69 grants awarded in fiscal year 2014.

In addition, we ensured that selected  grantees included representation of different geographic regions. While  this sample is not generalizable to all 69 grants, it accounts for about $3.7  million, or 46 percent, of the $8 million in the grant funds awarded in fiscal  year 2014. We also conducted interviews with officials of VA and the U.S.  Olympic Committee (USOC), the latter of which had previously been  responsible for administering the program. Finally, we conducted site  visits to three events sponsored by selected grantees in Indiana, Illinois,  and North Carolina. We selected events that occurred during our review  while also considering regional diversity and travel considerations.

First operated using fiscal year 2010 funds, the program is  authorized to support activities that will facilitate, encourage, and sustain  participation in adaptive sports activities. Under the program, grants are  made to qualifying organizations, referred to in the law as eligible entities,  that will plan, develop, manage and implement programs to provide  adaptive sports opportunities. To be eligible for a grant, an organization  must be a non-federal entity with significant experience in managing a  large-scale adaptive sports program. Such experience must be with  programs that are either (1) affiliated with a National Paralympic  Committee or a National Governing Body authorized to provide  Paralympic sports, (2) an adaptive sports program of a National  Governing Body that meets certain other requirements, or (3) an adaptive  sports program in which at least 50 persons with disabilities participate or  in which the participants with disabilities reside in at least five different  congressional districts.

In 2012, we reported on the  program\u2019s actual or planned activities in fiscal years 2010 to 2012, when  USOC was involved. At that time, we found several shortcomings in  program reporting and oversight practices. For example, we found that  expenditure reporting practices for grantees were not consistent with  federal internal control standards, and that VA was not performing on-site  or remote monitoring to verify how funds were being used. In addition, we  reported that in fiscal year 2011 $3.1 million of the $7.5 million annually  provided by VA\u2014about 40 percent\u2014was absorbed by USOC for its  operations, personnel, and administrative costs. We made several  recommendations aimed at improving grantee reporting and encouraged  VA to review implementation of USOC\u2019s monitoring plan. VA\u2019s  implementation of the program substantially addresses these  recommendations. As appropriate, we refer to these recommendations  and related VA actions to address them later in this report.", "In December 2013, the program was reauthorized with a number of  changes. The reauthorization eliminated USOC\u2019s role and instead  provides that VA can award grants to eligible entities. In addition, the law  placed specific limits on grantees\u2019 use of grant funds for administrative  and personnel costs. For grants supporting adaptive sports opportunities  taking place during fiscal year 2015, grantees can allocate no more than  7.5 percent to such costs; in fiscal year 2016 and thereafter, grantees will  be limited to 5 percent. Law and regulation include other requirements for  VA and grantees. For example, the adaptive sports program\u2019s authorizing  statute and regulations outline a number of criteria that guide grant  application review and selection, including requirements that applicants  clearly state the sports activities to be provided, clearly define program  objectives, and describe the adequacy of their program management  structure. In addition, applications must include detailed descriptions of  any partnerships and the grant funds that will be provided to any partners;  the anticipated personnel, travel, and administrative costs paid for with  grant funding; and the performance metrics to be used to evaluate the  effectiveness of the activities carried out with grant funds.

However, VA officials explained that the alternative  would have been that no program activities would have been funded with  fiscal year 2014 dollars. Officials told us that developing and publishing  the interim final rule to govern the program within about 6 months  required considerable effort.

In addition, VA officials said that,  despite repeated VA communication, some applicants did not understand  the limitation on administrative expenses. Under this limitation, for  activities taking place during fiscal year 2015, grantees could allocate no  more than 7.5 percent of the grant amount to administrative expenses,  including any costs associated with employees other than those who  directly provided coaching and training for participants. This  misunderstanding may have been unintentionally reinforced by the  budget categories used in the standard federal application form, which do  not distinguish between these two types of personnel costs.

Despite VA\u2019s efforts to ensure  completeness of grant applications, our review of 16 fiscal year 2014  grant files and other VA documentation found that in some cases aspects  of grant applications were not well documented. For example, VA  developed a standard checklist\u2014the VA Administrative and Financial  Review Questionnaire for Grantees\u2014 for applicants to attest to various  aspects of their administrative and financial policies and procedures.  While this checklist was not required, VA officials told us that they treated  the satisfactory completion of this form as sufficient evidence that the  grantee could adequately safeguard and account for grant funds.", "However, 3 of 16 grant files we reviewed contained neither this form nor  any other documentation of the administrative and financial capabilities of  the grantee. The forms of 3 others indicated that these grantees lacked  certain administrative and financial policies and procedures.

It is also intended to help ensure that VA  grant funds are being managed according to federal requirements, as  reflected in the grant agreements. In addition, grantee monitoring can  provide VA with useful information to measure the grant program\u2019s  performance and for reporting to the Congress and the public.", "VA requires that all grantees submit quarterly and annual reports. VA  reviews these reports to ensure that grantees are operating according to  the terms of their grant agreements. While only annual reports are  required under the program\u2019s statute, VA requires grantees to report on  performance quarterly because, according to VA officials, this helps to  provide for more frequent monitoring of grantees.", "To ensure that grantees\u2019 quarterly reports include consistent information  in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, VA created a  standard quarterly report template, adapted from a USOC template. As  summarized in table 2, VA\u2019s quarterly report template contains data  required from grantees under VA\u2019s program regulations. For each grant,  VA customized the template to show the activities the grantee agreed to  provide; and a budget showing the amount awarded, broken out into  several categories. According to VA officials, they identified the activities  and budget amounts by reviewing each grantee\u2019s application. Grantees  are expected to submit an updated report each quarter to VA. The  quarterly report format is consistent with GAO\u2019s 2012 recommendations,  in that it (1) requires reporting of the expenditure of VA grant program  funds, excluding funds from other sources; and (2) is formatted to provide  consistent and non-duplicative reporting of activities and numbers of  participants. Table 2 summarizes how VA translated the information  required of grantees into the quarterly report format.", "As indicated in table 2, VA\u2019s quarterly report template did not require  grantees to provide all of the information required by program regulations.  For example, VA program regulations require grantees to include in their  reports detailed records of the time involved in providing adaptive sports  activities through direct personal interaction with adaptive sports  participants, such as coaching or instruction, versus time spent on other  adaptive sports activities. However, during fiscal year 2015, VA did not  require grantees to add this information to the quarterly reports. We  pointed out this omission to VA staff, and in August 2015, they provided a  draft revised quarterly report format, where grantees are to provide  information on time spent providing direct instruction to participants. A VA  official indicated that they intended to further revise the template so that it  also required grantees to report staff time spent on matters other than  direct personal interaction with participants, as required by regulations.  They expected to complete the template revision before the start of fiscal  year 2016.", "VA\u2019s program regulations also require grantees to identify the locations of  their adaptive sports activities. However, VA did not provide a specific  place for grantees to report the locations of their activities. VA has  revised its quarterly report format to have grantees identify locations of  their activities. Improved information from grantees could help VA assess  the extent of geographic coverage of adaptive sports opportunities.", "In addition to quarterly reporting by all grantees, VA\u2019s grantee monitoring  approach calls for monitoring of selected grantees through conducting  site visits and desk audits, although the reporting format for the latter has  not been established. A site visit involves a visit to a grantee\u2019s offices to  review financial and other records, a visit to a grantee\u2019s adaptive sports  event, or both. The reviewing official is to assess the extent to which the  grantee is providing activities according to the grant agreement. Also, the  reviewer is to assess the soundness of the grantee\u2019s financial  management of VA grant funds, as well as the grantee\u2019s financial  controls. To record the results of the assessments for use by VA program  officials, the reviewer prepares a site visit report using a standard VA  format. A desk audit (also known as a remote audit), according to VA  officials, involves asking the grantee to provide documentation to support  an assessment of grantee financial management issues that might be of  concern. VA may, for example, ask to see receipts for equipment or  transportation ticket purchases or ask for documentation of how the  calculation of staff days spent on providing services is made. A VA official  stated that desk audits will likely be tailored to the circumstances as  appropriate.", "For both site visits and desk audits, VA employs a selective monitoring  approach\u2014based on risk\u2014to help focus its limited resources on grantees  at highest risk of failing to perform or mismanaging funds. Such an  approach is consistent with our prior work, which found that risk-based  monitoring can help agencies identify grantees that need additional  attention; for example, using limited resources to visit higher-risk  grantees.", "According to VA officials, one criterion for assessing risk is the awarded  amount. Officials said that they tend to select grantees receiving less  funding for desk audits, and grantees receiving more funding for site  visits, because those receiving larger grants are at risk of losing more  dollars in case of financial mismanagement. VA also said that they use  information from application reviews, such as assessments of financial  controls, and grantees\u2019 previous experience providing adaptive sports  programs, in deciding whether a desk audit or site visit is warranted.  Another consideration is the scope of a grantee\u2019s event. A VA official said  that a site visit may be scheduled to a multi-sport event, such as one of  the regional Valor Games, where a grantee may be collaborating with  other adaptive sports providers, including other VA grantees. To  economize on monitoring costs, VA uses geographic considerations as  well. For example, VA officials said that a site visit may be planned if it  would cover several grantees headquartered in the same area.", "Although VA officials provided us their policy on monitoring of grant  funded activities, for most of fiscal year 2015 they did not have a written  monitoring plan. Best practices in grants management suggest that risk- based monitoring helps agencies ensure adequate grantee financial  management and performance. Also, planning is part of an agency\u2019s  internal control system, which helps program managers achieve desired  results through effective stewardship of public resources, such as grant  funds. For example, by documenting and using written criteria for  determining which grantees need closer monitoring, VA could be better  positioned to help prevent mismanagement of funds and poor program  performance. We discussed this issue with VA staff earlier in our review,  and in August 2015, they provided us with their draft monitoring plan.  According to a VA official, VA expects to complete this plan early in fiscal  year 2016. VA\u2019s draft plan describes a monitoring approach consistent  with VA grants management policy. However, the draft plan lacks certain  elements, such as information on the number and frequency of site visits  and desk audits. Promising practices in ensuring adequate grantee  financial systems and proper use of grant funds include an agency  reviewing a target number of grantees each year. For example, one  agency requires reviews of 10 percent of all of its grantees each year as a  mechanism to enhance grantee accountability. A grantee monitoring  plan that addresses the number and frequency of reviews throughout the  year can help VA ensure that it is monitoring grantees on an ongoing  basis, to prevent, and promptly detect, misuse of grant funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Implementation of VA\u2019s Monitoring Strategy Has Identified a Number of Issues", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, VA was implementing two main methods of its  monitoring approach\u2014quarterly grantee reporting and VA site visits.

A sport or an adaptation may be aimed  at participants with a specific type of disability, or may be suitable for  participants with a range of disabilities.", "To support these activities, grantees planned to spend grant funds in  various budget categories. The largest categories for the 69 fiscal year  2014 grants were travel, including transportation, lodging, and  subsistence for athletes, coaches, and other officials involved in meeting  program objectives; operations, including such expenses as facility  rentals and ski lift tickets; and supplies, including purchase of adaptive  bicycles, watercraft, and bows and arrows (see fig. 3). Importantly, a total  of about $459,000\u2014about 5.7 percent of the total $8 million awarded\u2014 was budgeted as administrative costs. This included both normal  administrative costs as well as personnel costs associated with grant  activities but not attributable to time spent coaching or training  participants. The amount was below the 7.5 percent statutory limit for  activities carried out in fiscal year 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participants and Others Report Enhanced Physical, Emotional, and Social Well-Being from Adaptive Sports Activities", "paragraphs": ["Participants, grantee officials, and coaches we interviewed generally said  that adaptive sports activities are beneficial to veterans and service  members in multiple ways (see table 6.) These benefits include  improved family and social relationships, emotional health, levels of  independence and life skills, and physical well-being. Several  interviewees\u2014including participants and grantee officials\u2014said adaptive  sports can have a transformative effect on a veteran with disabilities. One  official said he sees disabled veterans who have been inactive for many  years participate in adaptive sports, resulting in a significant life change.  Another official said some veterans with disabilities get accustomed to  being taken care of, which can amplify their disabilities. He recalled that  at one sports clinic funded by the grant program, a blind veteran asked to  be guided to another part of the sports facility and, after some good- natured ribbing by his teammates, was convinced he could navigate on  his own.", "Several experts we spoke with stressed the importance of sustained  involvement in adaptive sports as the key to long-term benefits. According  to one adaptive sports expert familiar with the grant program, the  important thing is whether or not the event helps fuel a persistent  participation in the sport and thereby contributes to a balanced and active  life. One of the grantees we visited considered the opportunity that  applicants would have to continue their participation in a sport when  selecting participants. A grantee official said that in reviewing  applications from veterans and service members wishing to join an event,  they consider the proximity of the applicant to ongoing programs offering  the same adaptive sport. The aim is to ensure that veterans participating  in the grant-funded event also stay involved in the sport for their ongoing  well-being and health. VA officials agreed with this aim and said in the  future they may consider grant applications, for example, that propose  purchasing adaptive sports supplies and equipment to help benefit  veterans over a number of years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Grantees Said that No-Shows by Veterans Registered for an Activity Is Problematic", "paragraphs": ["Some grantee officials who we interviewed spoke of a high incidence of  veteran no-shows at adaptive sports activities and events as an  impediment to program success. At one of our site visits\u2014a sports clinic  in which 7 of 10 registered participants attended\u2014an official said some  veterans may cancel on short notice, which deprives other interested  veterans from participating. In addition, the official was concerned that  excessive no-shows may mean there are not enough athletes to form  teams or hold an effective practice session. Another official said  considerable time and money has been lost when veterans register but  do not participate. The official said some no-shows are understandable,  such as when a veteran\u2019s plans are affected by a medical condition.  Nonetheless, adaptive sports are about more than athletics and are  aimed at strengthening \u201cmind and heart\u201d of participants as well, the official  said. Some veterans can be victims of learned helplessness after they  return from service, the official said, and goal-setting and an insistence on  accountability can counter this. Another official said that while non- attendance of registered athletes at their high-profile summer sports  camp is not a problem, it can be an issue at less prominent events, such  as weeknight archery training sessions.", "Some grantees noted that asking participants to have a financial stake in  an event could encourage attendance. For example, one official  suggested that registrants pay a refundable deposit of perhaps $250 so  that they have some \u201cskin in the game\u201d and event sponsors have greater  assurance of their attendance. Another grantee official explained that in  her organization\u2019s experience, requiring an up-front financial commitment  is effective. At a 2013 multi-sport event, about 35 of the registered  athletes did not attend, resulting in a huge waste of federal funds and  missed opportunities for other veterans, she said. To combat this, the  organization required a credit card number from registrants for the 2014  event, and informed them they would be charged the cost of one-night\u2019s  lodging if they failed to attend without prior notice. Under this policy, she  said, 82 of the 84 registrants\u201498 percent\u2014took part. Another grantee  official said that while requesting a deposit of some kind might have merit,  it could also cause cash flow difficulties for some veterans. He said some  participants in weeknight training sessions have a hard time paying public  transit fare, so the additional cost of a refundable deposit might be a  barrier to participation.", "VA officials confirmed that no-shows are a problem. They explained that  while its regulations require that adaptive sports events supported by the  grants be free of charge for eligible veterans, having strategies to  incentivize attendance for those who register\u2014such as charging for a first  night\u2019s hotel expenses\u2014are permissible. They also said that they have  provided informal guidance to some fiscal year 2014 grant recipients on  ways to reduce no-show rates\u2014typically this information has been shared  with grantees sponsoring large scale events that involve travel.  However, VA has not systematically gathered and disseminated  permissible techniques for reducing no-show rates to all of its grantees.  According to federal internal control standards, program management is  responsible for identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks it faces in  achieving program objectives. A systematic effort to gather and  disseminate techniques to address the no-show issue would be  consistent with this requirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2014, VA assumed responsibility for selecting and  overseeing grantees under the adaptive sports grant program and,  despite challenges, awarded 69 grants supporting a wide variety of  adaptive sports opportunities for veterans and members of the armed  services with disabilities. Our review indicates that through the first half of  fiscal year 2015, grantees were substantially complying with reporting  requirements and that site visits to selected grantees have identified  opportunities for improvement. Further, VA is amending its quarterly  reporting template so that it will require a report of staff time spent on  direct personal interaction with participants, and time spent on other  matters, as required by program regulations. However, VA\u2019s draft  monitoring plan does not include a regular schedule for site visits or desk  audits, which risks the possibility that none will be performed in some  years, or that they will be performed very late in the year. Promising  practices in ensuring adequate grantee financial systems and proper use  of grant funds include review of a certain number of grantees each year,  and irregular scheduling risks the possibility that mismanagement or  misuse of grant funds will not be promptly detected.", "Finally, a significant no-show factor means that program dollars may not  be used to their fullest potential. VA officials are aware of this issue, and  have taken some steps to address it. However, they have not  systematically gathered or disseminated techniques to reduce the no- show rate.

Our work  was limited to program grants using fiscal year 2014 funds, which  supported grantee activities that were to take place in fiscal year 2015.  Because our audit work began and ended during VA\u2019s first year of  monitoring grantees, our work on VA\u2019s grantee monitoring generally  covered the first two quarters of fiscal year 2015\u2014October 2014 through  March 2015.", "We addressed the first objective in several steps. To determine how VA  reviewed and selected fiscal year 2014 adaptive sports grant applications,  we reviewed key VA documents\u2014including relevant federal laws,  program regulations, VA\u2019s fiscal year 2014 Notice of Funding Availability,  and application instructions\u2014and interviewed VA officials. We also  reviewed relevant grants management criteria, including VA\u2019s agency- wide grants management policies, and best grants management  practices that had been identified by members of the Domestic Working  Group. Second, to determine how VA staff followed program policies and  key criteria, we reviewed the files of 16 fiscal year 2014 grants and  examined available documents such as the grant applications and  proposals, proposed budgets, evidence of grantees\u2019 financial and  administrative capability, VA\u2019s scoring of grantee proposals, and the grant  agreement. We selected grants based on type of organization, amount of  grant funding and geography. We selected grants to ensure that we  obtained eight from national, four from regional and four from community- based organizations. We selected all grants valued at $250,000 or  more\u2014seven from national organizations, three from regional  organizations. We then selected the remaining six sample grants  randomly\u2014one from a national organization, one from a regional  organization, and all four from community-based organizations. Also, we  ensured that selected grantees included representation of different  geographic regions. Although this sample size does not allow us to  project to the universe of the 69 fiscal year 2014 grants, it is nonetheless  a substantial sample, representing $3.7 million, or 46 percent, of the $8  million granted in fiscal year 2014. In addition to our review of the 2014  application process, we reviewed relevant documents and interviewed VA  officials regarding changes to the grant application and review process in  fiscal year 2015.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed VA officials, reviewed  relevant VA policy documents and relevant grant oversight criteria, and  reviewed selected VA oversight documentation. Specifically, we reviewed  VA\u2019s standard quarterly report template to ensure it conformed to the  reporting requirements contained in program regulations. We also  reviewed the quarterly reports for the 16 grants selected as described in  the preceding paragraph for the first two quarters of fiscal year 2015\u2014the  3-month periods ending December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015. We  also identified issues that VA had raised with the quarterly reports and, in  selected instances, followed up with VA on how its review comments  were addressed. We also obtained and reviewed reports of 8 VA site  visits that had been conducted by the end of June 2015.", "To address the third objective, we obtained data from VA on the types of  sports events to be provided by each fiscal year 2014 grantee and  interviewed VA program officials; USOC officials who had been involved  in administering sub-grants prior to December 2013; and representatives  of three veterans service organizations\u2014Disabled American Veterans,  The American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. We also obtained  VA data on grantee budgets and proposed activities. We interviewed VA  officials about this data and determined that it was sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. To obtain further perspectives on the value of adaptive  sports for veterans and service members, we attended three adaptive  sports events funded through VA grants. We selected them in  consultation with VA program officials. Specifically, we selected events  that were occurring during our review and also considered regional  diversity and travel considerations. The events selected, listed below, did  not provide a representative sample of all VA-funded adaptive sports  activities.", "February 2015 goalball camp conducted by the U.S. Association of  Blind Athletes in Fort Wayne, Indiana;", "March 2015 archery camp conducted by the Rehabilitation Institute of  Chicago, in Chicago, Illinois; and", "May 2015 multi-sport event conducted by Bridge II Sports in Chapel  Hill and Durham, North Carolina.", "At each event, we interviewed event organizers, coaches and trainers  and event participants; and observed the events.
