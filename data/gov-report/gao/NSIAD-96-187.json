However, over the last several years, NASA has been directed by the Administration to reduce its future years\u2019 budget levels. In the fiscal year 1994 budget request, NASA\u2019s total funding for fiscal years 1994 through 2000 was reduced by 18 percent, or $22 billion. In the fiscal year 1995 budget request, total funding was reduced again by almost $13 billion, or an additional 13 percent. To absorb these major reductions, NASA focused on adjusting programs. For example, the Space Station program was restructured and given an annual budget ceiling of $2.1 billion. Similarly, the scope of the Earth Observing System program was reduced, and the program is being restructured once again. Also, funding was terminated for the Space Exploration Initiative, the National Launch System, and the National Aerospace Plane, and the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby project was canceled.", "As part of the executive branch\u2019s development of NASA\u2019s $14.2-billion budget request for fiscal year 1996, NASA was directed once again to lower its projected budget through fiscal year 2000, this time by an additional  5 percent, or $4.6 billion. Rather than terminating or delaying core science, aeronautics, or exploration programs, NASA announced it would absorb this funding decrease by reducing infrastructure, including closing and consolidating facilities. NASA also said it would reduce its use of support contractors and decrease the size of its workforce to about 17,500 by the turn of the century\u2014the lowest level since the early 1960s.", "While NASA\u2019s actual and planned budgets and staffing levels have decreased sharply, the value of its facilities infrastructure has actually increased. From fiscal years 1990 through 1995, the current replacement value of NASA\u2019s facilities increased by about 14 percent, not including inflation. At the end of fiscal year 1995, the agency\u2019s facilities had an estimated current replacement value of $17 billion. The agency owned or leased about 3,000 buildings on nearly 130,000 acres of land at 71 locations. NASA\u2019s facilities range in size from small buildings to large industrial plants. Appendix I provides information about facilities at NASA\u2019s 10 field centers.", "As part of its infrastructure reduction efforts, NASA is also looking at ways to cut the cost of its field center support activities. Each NASA field center operates a wide range of such activities, with some support-unique missions at particular centers. Common activities include building maintenance, fire protection, security, printing, and medical services. NASA provides these services primarily through a combination of civil service employees, contractor labor, and arrangements with the Department of Defense (DOD) where facilities are collocated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planned Facilities Reductions Will Not Achieve Large Cost Reductions", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s current facility closure and consolidation plans will not fully achieve the agency\u2019s goal of decreasing the current replacement value of its facilities by about 25 percent (about $4 billion in 1994 dollars) by the end of fiscal year 2000. More importantly, these plans will not result in substantial cost reductions by that date.", "By the end of fiscal year 1997, NASA plans to have closed or converted facilities to cost-reimbursable status that have a current replacement value of $1.9 billion. Also, as of March 1996, planned reductions through fiscal year 2000 were $2.8 billion, or about 30 percent below NASA\u2019s goal of reducing the current replacement value of its facilities by about $4 billion in 1994 dollars. Agency officials noted that the $4-billion reduction goal was a \u201cstretch,\u201d or aggressive goal, which they were never certain could be achieved.", "Additional reductions are unlikely in research and development facilities, but there may be opportunities for further reductions in office space, according to NASA officials. NASA classifies building space based on its primary use, such as office space. NASA was providing general purpose office space for about 53,000 civil service and contractor personnel at the end of fiscal year 1995. Agencywide, the average square feet of office space available per person, including substandard space, exceeded NASA\u2019s standard by nearly 43 percent and the ceiling by over 25 percent. When substandard space is not included, this average exceeded the standard by over 27 percent and the ceiling by 12 percent. Future reductions in the number of on-site contractor personnel and NASA employees (almost 4,000) by fiscal year 2000 will make even more office space available.", "NASA estimates that the planned $2.8-billion reduction in the current replacement value of facilities will yield only about $250 million in cost reductions through fiscal year 2000. Although some of these cost reductions are from lowering facilities\u2019 operations and maintenance costs, most result from four centers bringing contractor personnel from off-site leased space onto the centers to fill space left vacant because of reductions in NASA personnel and support contractors. Moreover, some cost reductions may be offset by increased costs in future years. For example, according to a NASA official, about three-quarters of NASA facilities are 30 or more years old and keeping these facilities operational may lead to higher operations and modernization costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems in Evaluating Cost-Reduction Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["NASA has had problems in identifying, assessing, or implementing some cost-reduction opportunities. NASA personnel (1) did not thoroughly evaluate potential larger cost-reduction options, (2) limited the scope of consideration for consolidation, (3) performed questionable initial cost-reduction studies, (4) made inappropriate closure recommendations, and (5) substantially overstated cost-reduction estimates. Some of these problems resulted when NASA acted quickly in an attempt to achieve near-term cost reductions. NASA officials said that some cost-reduction estimates were \u201cinterim\u201d estimates because NASA was pressured into prematurely providing what turned out to be imprecise savings estimates to Congress. Also, some NASA staff lacked experience in developing estimates, according to NASA officials.", "Although there were problems with some evaluations, which are discussed below, others appear to have been done better. For example, the Office of Space Flight reviewed in detail a proposed consolidation of automated data processing functions at a single location before developing a plan that offered several options.", "Concerns about closing facilities, relocating activities, and consolidating operations have sometimes been exacerbated by perceptions of the lack of fairness and impartiality in the decision-making process. In the past, we have expressed concerns about NASA\u2019s ability to accurately and independently develop cost estimates to support its decisions on new and ongoing programs and projects. Just recently, the NASA Inspector Generaland NASA management have been discussing the structure required to meet NASA\u2019s continuing need for independent, impartial, and technically credible systems analysis and program evaluation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost-Reduction Options for Telecommunications Networks Not Thoroughly Evaluated", "paragraphs": ["NASA did not thoroughly evaluate potential larger cost-reduction options for consolidating wide area telecommunications networks. NASA has five such networks operating or being developed, and they provide a variety of communications services among headquarters, field centers, major contractors, affiliated academic institutions, and international partners. Due to advances in technology, NASA no longer needs to operate multiple telecommunications networks, and consolidating network operations at a single site offers economies of scale, as well as reduced administrative overhead.", "Last year, NASA\u2019s Zero Base Review team recommended that the field centers compete to determine which one could consolidate the five wide area networks most cost-effectively. Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center prepared consolidation proposals. NASA\u2019s Office of Space Communications, which oversees the two largest networks, decided against a competition and did not formally consider the proposals offered by Goddard and Ames. Instead, with the objective of obtaining some budget cost reductions in 1997, it endorsed the Marshall proposal without determining which of the three proposals was the most cost-effective. However, Marshall\u2019s proposal did not project cost reductions in the near term as aggressively as the others. For example, Goddard\u2019s proposal estimated potential cost reductions over the next 6 years totaling $94.5 million more than the reductions in the Marshall proposal.", "Earlier this year, we recommended that NASA conduct an objective review of network consolidation to determine whether its chosen approach should be modified to achieve greater cost reductions. NASA agreed with this recommendation and arranged for an independent group to conduct the review. It indicated the agency\u2019s telecommunications experts were not participating in the review because they would have a \u201cbiased\u201d perspective. The independent review is scheduled to be completed this month.", "NASA\u2019s initial network consolidation efforts were hampered by the lack of clear direction within NASA to include all five wide area networks in the consolidation effort. The Office of Space Communications, which directed the consolidation effort at Marshall, does not have authority over three of the five networks. The agencywide telecommunications network consolidation or streamlining efforts did not have a strong central advocate. NASA\u2019s Chief Information Officer, who would be a logical choice to fill this role, was not directly involved in this effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Limitations in Scope of Consideration for Supercomputer Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["NASA initially excluded almost 40 percent of its supercomputer systems, which were used mostly for research and development, from the scope of a supercomputer consolidation study. The agency uses supercomputers to support some space mission operations and a variety of research projects, including developing new supercomputer technologies.", "In March 1995, NASA began studying ways to cut its supercomputer costs by consolidating their management and operation. However, its initial studies considered only some of the agency\u2019s supercomputers and focused on nonresearch and development supercomputing systems. Although NASA\u2019s consolidation study team had identified 29 supercomputers, NASA management excluded 12 existing machines and some planned for future procurement from consideration because (1) some are being managed under existing contracts that could be affected by a consolidation decision and (2) others were used in research programs primarily to develop new supercomputer technologies.", "We spoke with NASA program, field center, and supercomputer consolidation study officials about the reasons for, and appropriateness of, limiting the scope of NASA\u2019s consolidation study. During a series of discussions, NASA officials acknowledged our concerns about the study\u2019s limitations and expanded its scope to a phased approach that will eventually consider all of the agency\u2019s supercomputers.

Last year, the transfer of research and operational support aircraft from five NASA centers to the Dryden Flight Research Center was proposed. NASA headquarters tasked Dryden, the center that would gain from the consolidation, with planning and performing an aircraft consolidation study. In a recent report, the NASA Inspector General noted the Dryden study had estimated NASA could save $12.6 million annually by consolidating aircraft at Dryden. However, internal and external questions about the scope and quality of this study have slowed the decision-making process. Subsequent reviews of the costs and benefits of aircraft consolidation by both NASA management and the NASA Inspector General staff have resulted in much lower annual savings estimates.", "In light of the controversy that potentially accompanies any significant decision to consolidate, relocate, or close facilities, NASA would benefit from ensuring an adequate balance of expertise and interests for study teams, developing initial analyses that are objective and well-supported, and fairly and thoroughly considering reasonable alternatives before making decisions. In this way, NASA can develop defensible decisions that will withstand external scrutiny and can be implemented in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inappropriate Recommendations to Close Plum Brook Station", "paragraphs": ["Plum Brook Station was inappropriately recommended for possible closure twice. In February 1995, the NASA Federal Laboratory Review recommended reviewing the station for possible closure because it was being operated primarily for non-NASA users. At about the same time, NASA\u2019s White Paper, formally titled A Budget Reduction Strategy, suggested that Plum Brook should be closed. NASA officials could not provide the rationale for the proposed action. The Laboratory Review report did acknowledge a problem concerning the existence of an inactive nuclear reactor at the station, and the Zero Base Review subsequently recommended retaining Plum Brook on a fully reimbursable basis because of the reactor.", "Plum Brook operates on a cost-reimbursable basis, with most of its operating cost covered by revenue from users of four test facilities at the station. Even if all four of the test facilities were closed, the operating cost would still be about $2 million, primarily because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that the reactor be maintained in its current state. The only way to close the location and dispose of the property would be to dismantle the reactor. However, the cost for doing this would be prohibitively expensive\u2014about $100 million in 1997 dollars, according to a 1990 estimate. In addition, there are no disposal sites to accommodate the radioactive waste that would be generated by the dismantling process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overstated Cost Reductions for Some Options", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, NASA\u2019s initial estimates of cost reductions were overstated. For example, the Zero Base Review estimated that $500 million or more could be saved through 2000 by commercializing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. However, NASA later determined this approach could not be implemented and that none of the projected savings would materialize in the time frame targeted by the Zero Base Review. Also, the Zero Base Review claimed that consolidation of telecommunications networks would save between $350 million and $375 million. Subsequently, NASA officials acknowledged these cost reductions would not only be significantly lower, but the lower savings estimates had already been considered in the preparation of the networks\u2019 future budget estimates.", "The estimated savings noted above were part of the total savings estimate that provided the basis for NASA\u2019s claim that the fiscal year 1996 out-year budget reductions could be covered by infrastructure decreases. To the extent the estimates were overstated, additional pressure was placed on NASA program and field center officials to find efficiencies to supplant the overstated savings. For example, after NASA determined that commercializing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System would not reduce costs, it began aggressively negotiating a fixed-price contract for the purchase of three additional satellites needed for the system. However, NASA estimates that the fixed-price contract produced considerably less savings than the commercializing of the system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Environmental Cleanup Costs Could Affect Facility Disposition Efforts", "paragraphs": ["NASA\u2019s future facility disposition decisions could be affected by environmental cleanup costs. Therefore, information about the extent and type of contamination, the cost of its cleanup, and the party who is financially responsible are relevant to such decisions. However, NASA officials do not yet fully know what the cleanup requirements will be and lack a policy for identifying other responsible parties and sharing cleanup costs.", "Currently, NASA officials are still working to identify all the challenges they face as a result of environmental contamination. NASA\u2019s 1996 site inventory identified over 900 potentially contaminated sites, about half of which may require cleanup. At this time, according to NASA records, only 72 sites are classified as closed and, of these, only 15 required cleanup. Most sites are still in the early stages of the cleanup process, with almost 400 still being studied to determine the type and extent of contamination.", "NASA headquarters used selected portions of a DOD model to develop a preliminary cost estimate of $1.5 billion for cleaning up potentially contaminated sites over a 20-year period. Subsequently, NASA\u2019s field centers, in response to our request, developed cost estimates totaling $636 million. This estimate excludes some sites that have not been studied and is a projection of cleanup cost for only the next 8 years or less. Although NASA field centers have not developed cleanup cost estimates for disposing of property in the future, officials at several centers believed the cost could be as much as two to five times higher than if NASA were to retain the property. The higher cost would occur if NASA cleaned up facilities to meet more stringent standards that might be required for disposal.", "Sharing cleanup costs with others could help NASA reduce its environmental cleanup costs. Environmental law holds owners, operators, and other responsible parties liable for correcting past environmental contamination. However, NASA has no policy on pursuing other responsible parties. It currently pays the cleanup costs for virtually all of its centers and other field locations, regardless of who was responsible for causing or contributing to the contamination. Although NASA has identified other responsible federal agencies, it has not generally tried to identify potentially responsible contractors or previous owners and pursue cost-sharing agreements with them.", "An ongoing facility reduction effort where cost sharing may be an issue involves land at NASA\u2019s Industrial Plant in Downey, California. The city wants to acquire 166 acres of this property: 68 acres NASA has identified as excess to its needs and 98 acres it has identified as potentially excess. The city plans to use the land for economic development projects. An assessment of environmental contamination determined that 16 of the excess acres were free of contamination. Studies of the remaining excess acreage are underway. The eventual disposition of the remaining 98 acres of NASA-owned land is still unclear, and studies of their contamination status are still in the early stages.", "Before NASA took over the Downey facility, it was a DOD facility operated by the predecessor organization of the contractor currently operating the facility for NASA. NASA will have to decide which potentially responsible parties it will pursue in supporting any corrective actions that may be needed to meet applicable cleanup standards. However, NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center, which manages the Downey facility, has not yet begun to deal with the potential cost-sharing issue and, as noted above, there is no NASA-wide policy providing guidance on this issue. In commenting on a draft of this report, NASA stated it intends to complete a policy statement by the end of 1996 to address the issue of potential responsible parties at NASA facilities requiring environmental remediation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Lower Support Costs Underway, but Little Progress Made in Sharing Facilities With DOD", "paragraphs": ["Among NASA\u2019s initiatives to reduce its infrastructure are efforts to lower the field centers\u2019 operations support costs. NASA spends over $1 billion annually to support maintenance and operations at field centers. Among the actions NASA is taking to reduce this cost is consolidating its payroll functions at one center to cut payroll-related civil service and contractor staffing by about 50 percent. It is also implementing a variety of initiatives to share resources and standardize processes at its principal aeronautics centers\u2014Ames, Langley, Lewis, and Dryden. NASA estimates that this effort\u2014known as Project Reliance\u2014will reduce agency costs by about $36 million by fiscal year 2000.", "In June 1995, NASA expanded the scope of its cost-reduction search outside the agency; it teamed with DOD to study how the two agencies could significantly reduce their operations costs and increase mission effectiveness and efficiency through increased cooperation and sharing. Study teams, referred to as integrated product teams, began work in September 1995 in seven areas. We monitored three teams: major facilities, space launch activities, and base/center support and services.", "The objectives of the major facilities and space launch activities teams included assessing facilities\u2019 utilization and recommending potential consolidations and closures. The major facilities team was responsible for (1) developing recommendations on test and evaluation and research facilities with unnecessary overlap or redundancy and (2) identifying and providing the rationale for consolidations, realignments, and reductions for specific facilities. The space launch activities team focused on increasing cooperation in its area, including range and launch facilities and infrastructure. Neither team recommended specific consolidations or closures or identified cost reductions in their final briefings to the Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board. Both teams did, however, identify barriers to increased cooperation and coordination between NASA and DOD, including differences in cost accounting systems, practices, and standards.", "More importantly, NASA and DOD officials noted a more general limitation: the \u201cold paradigm\u201d\u2014that is, each NASA and DOD program protects its ability to maintain its own technical expertise and competence. The over- capacity situation in large rocket test facilities helps to illustrate this. Several years ago, the National Facilities Study concluded that there was excess large rocket test capacity and some facilities could be closed, but DOD and NASA officials involved in the study said no direction or funding was subsequently made available to pursue this recommendation. More recently, the major facilities team found that NASA and DOD each have excess large rocket test capacity based on both current and projected workloads. However, the team made no recommendation to consolidate facilities because comparable facilities\u2019 cost data was not available. The team did recommend that a facility agreement in the area of rocket propulsion testing be established to identify areas where capability reductions and greater reliance between NASA and DOD would be possible in the future.", "While the issue of large rocket test capacity remains unresolved, some rocket test facilities are currently undergoing or being considered for modification. A rocket test complex at Edwards Air Force Base is being upgraded by DOD at an estimated cost of $15 million to $17 million. In addition, NASA plans to upgrade one of its rocket engine test facilities at Stennis Space Center for about $45 million. DOD and NASA officials believe that their respective upgrades are cost-effective, although they agreed that the agencies need to improve coordination to prevent further excess capacity. NASA believes that the rocket test facilities at Stennis and Edwards Air Force Base are not comparable. However, the National Facilities Study and the major facilities integrated product team raised the overall excess capacity issue, and it has not yet been resolved. Independent actions by DOD and NASA to upgrade their individual facilities potentially exacerbate the problem of overall excess capacity.", "NASA and DOD officials acknowledged that recommending sharing and increasing reliance on each other, including consolidating or closing facilities, was difficult. These officials pointed out that, in many cases, such actions are \u201ctoo politically sensitive\u201d or could result in near-term costs increases, rather than cost reductions. They noted that an external, independent process, similar to the one used by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, may be needed to overcome the sensitivity and cost issues.", "The base/center support and services team, which was responsible for recommending ways to increase cooperation in base/center support and services, examined existing and potential cooperative arrangements at eight NASA centers and one test facility collocated with or geographically near DOD installations. The team reported finding over 500 existing support arrangements and identified additional cooperative opportunities. The team identified changes to activities at several NASA locations, including having NASA\u2019s Dryden Flight Research Center and the Air Force Flight Test Center jointly use space and combine certain operations; constructing one fuel facility for joint use by NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center and Langley Air Force Base; and sharing use of contracts and services.", "Although the team expects such changes to lower the agencies\u2019 costs by millions of dollars, it cited specific barriers to accomplishing more. For example, different negotiated wage rates for support service contractors could be a barrier, since consolidations would likely require paying the higher rate, thereby substantially or totally offsetting consolidation cost reductions. In other cases, merging certain activities could complicate existing procurements in small and disadvantaged business set-aside programs. However, the team said that many more sharing arrangements are possible and should be included in follow-on studies. In developing the follow-on process, this team recommended and then provided guidance on designating lead offices, establishing and updating metrics and milestones, and sharing information.", "NASA and DOD officials indicated that the work started by the integrated product teams would continue. A joint DOD-NASA report, which could be released later this month, will recommend that six alliances be established to continue the work initiated by the major facilities team, according to a NASA official. Only two of the alliances have been organized. The official also stated that four panels of the Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board are to be established to oversee the follow-on activities. However, three of the panels have been delayed due to personnel reorganizations affecting both DOD and NASA, and it is uncertain when they will be initiated, according to the NASA official. The only panel to be established to date is the Aeronautics Panel, which met in July 1996.", "The details of the follow-on processes for continuing the work of the integrated product teams have not yet been fully developed. One measure of the relevance and success of these processes will be how they handle an issue such as overcapacity in large rocket test facilities. In commenting on a draft of this report, NASA said that the NASA-DOD National Rocket Propulsion Test Alliance will strive for joint management of facilities so they can be brought on or offline and investments controlled for maximum benefit.

NASA provided information on activities and initiatives that occurred after the issuance of our report on Telecommunications Network: NASA Could Better Manage Its Planned Consolidation (GAO/AIMD-96-33, Apr. 9, 1996). 3. Our description of the current situation at Downey is in the context of a potential, not a known, cost-sharing issue. 4. NASA provided information on two rocket propulsion test facilities and stated that they are not comparable. However, we made no comparison of these facilities. We merely pointed out that, while the issue of potential excess in large rocket engine test capacity remains unresolved, efforts are underway or planned to upgrade such facilities. As noted in the report, such independent actions potentially worsen the problem. The overcapacity issue could benefit from a thorough, governmentwide assessment. 5. The report discusses the possible future need for a process similar to the one used by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Such a process could be applied to individual facilities, groups of facilities, or entire agencies.
