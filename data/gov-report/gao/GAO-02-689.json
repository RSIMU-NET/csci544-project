In 1989 the Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery, and Enforcement Act was enacted to reform, recapitalize, and  consolidate the federal deposit insurance system.  It created the Bank  Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which are  responsible for protecting insured bank and thrift depositors, respectively,  from loss due to institution failures.  The act also created the FSLIC  Resolution Fund to finalize the affairs of the former FSLIC and liquidate the  assets and liabilities transferred from the former Resolution Trust  Corporation.  It also designated FDIC as the administrator of these funds.   As part of this function FDIC has an examination and supervision program  to monitor the safety of deposits held in member institutions.", "FDIC insures deposits in excess of $3.2 trillion for about 10,000 institutions.   Together the three funds have about $49 billion in assets.  FDIC had a  budget of about $1.2 billion for calendar year 2001 to support its activities  in managing the three funds.  For that year, it processed more than 2.7  million financial transactions.", "FDIC relies extensively on computerized systems to support its financial  operations and store the sensitive information it collects.  These systems  are interconnected by FDIC\u2019s local and wide area networks.  To support its  financial management functions, it relies on several financial systems to  process and track financial transactions that include premiums paid by its  member institutions and disbursements made to support operations.  In  addition, FDIC supports other systems that maintain personnel information  on its employees, examination data on selected financial institutions, and  legal information on closed institutions.

In addition, we reviewed corrective actions taken by FDIC to  address vulnerabilities identified in our calendar year 2000 audit.  Our  evaluation was based on (1) our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual, which contains guidance for reviewing information systems  controls that affect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of  computerized data; and (2) our May 1998 report on security management  best practices at leading organizations, which identifies key elements of an  effective information security program.", "We performed our work at FDIC from October 2001 through April 2002.

For instance, in our 2000 financial statement audits, we determined that  FDIC had not adequately limited access of authorized users, restricted  physical access to computer facilities, performed comprehensive tests of  the disaster recovery plan, implemented a computer security incident  response process, established a security awareness program, developed  security plans, and performed independent security reviews.  These  weaknesses placed critical corporation operations, such as financial  management, personnel, and other operations, at greater risk of misuse and  disruption.", "Except for actions still needed to fully implement a computer security  management program, which are discussed later in this report, FDIC made  progress in addressing our previously reported computer security  weaknesses.  For example, in our 2001 audits, we found that FDIC has  limited access of its system programmers and security staff to certain   developed corporate access authorization procedures;   restricted modem connections and use of generic log on IDs to its   improved physical security to its computer center by limiting access  through the adjoining FDIC hotel;  developed and performed tests of its computer center disaster recovery  plans, including its network and designated remote facilities, to provide  backup support for the corporation\u2019s network and other operations;  established a computer security awareness program for its employees   developed security plans for its general support systems and   implemented a requirement and process for independent security  reviews to be performed at least every 3 years.", "In addition to correcting previously identified weaknesses, FDIC initiated  other steps to improve computer security.  These efforts included  (1) reviews of system software, (2) improvements in physical security,  including the use of guard service to provide security surveillance to its  computer rooms, (3) completed management authorizations for major  financial applications and general support systems, and (4) assessments of  the sensitivity of corporate data to determine the level of security needed  to protect it.", "However, we found additional control weaknesses in FDIC\u2019s information  systems in connection with our calendar year 2001 financial statement  audits.  Specifically, FDIC has not adequately limited access to data and  programs by controlling mainframe access authority, providing sufficient  network security, or establishing a comprehensive program to monitor  access activities.  Other information system control weaknesses were also  identified that could likewise hinder FDIC\u2019s ability to provide adequate  physical security for its computer facility, appropriate segregation of  computer functions, effective control of system software changes, or  ensure continuity of operations.

In addition, effective network security  controls should be established to authenticate local and remote users and  include a program to monitor the access activities of the network and  mainframe systems.", "Although progress was made in limiting access, FDIC\u2019s information  systems controls were not adequately protecting financial and sensitive  information.  Specifically, FDIC had not appropriately limited mainframe  access authority, sufficiently secured its network, or established a  comprehensive program to monitor access activities.

A key weakness in FDIC\u2019s controls was that its data center did not  sufficiently restrict user access, as described below.", "Hundreds of users had access privileges that allowed them to modify  financial software and read, modify, or copy financial data.  This risk  was further heightened because the corporation was not actively  monitoring the access activities of these users.", "Many users had unnecessary access to powerful commands.  About 55  users had access to a specific transaction command that could be used  to circumvent the security of sensitive FDIC information, including its  bank examination files.  These users included 26 help-desk employees  and 14 database staff, users who do not need this access to perform  their daily job functions.", "About 15 users outside of the system programming function had access  privileges to one sensitive system software library that is allowed to  perform system functions that can be used to circumvent all security  controls.  Such access increases the risk that users can bypass security  controls to alter or delete any computer data or programs on the system.   Typically such access privileges are limited to system programmers.", "About 30 users had access to powerful operator commands that could  be used to circumvent system security or compromise the operational  integrity of the system.  Prior to the completion of our work, the acting  CIO told us that this access privilege had been removed for these users.", "One reason for FDIC\u2019s user access vulnerabilities was that not all access  authority granted based on job responsibility was being collectively  reviewed.  Instead, individual access privileges were reviewed by data  owners but only to determine the appropriateness of each user\u2019s access to a  data owner\u2019s resource.  As a result, there was no comprehensive review to  determine the appropriateness of all access granted to any one user.  Such  reviews would have allowed FDIC to identify and correct inappropriate  access.", "FDIC said that it was reviewing staff access and would limit this access to  that required to carry out job responsibilities.

In addition, network controls provide safeguards to  ensure that the system software is adequately configured to prevent users  from bypassing network access controls or causing network failures.", "The risks introduced by the weaknesses we identified in access controls  were compounded by network security weaknesses.  While FDIC had taken  major steps to secure its network through the installation of a firewall and  other security measures, weaknesses in the way the corporation  configured its network servers, managed user IDs and passwords, provided  network services, and secured its network connectivity were nonetheless  still present.  As a result, financial information processed on the network is  at increased risk that unauthorized modification or disclosure could occur  without detection.  Because of FDIC\u2019s interconnected environment, these  network control weaknesses also increase the risk of unauthorized access  to financial and sensitive information (such as bank examination,  personnel, and financial management information) maintained on the FDIC  mainframe computer.  For example:  One system had default accounts that were not removed during  installation of remote access software.  Information on default settings  and passwords is available in vendor-supplied manuals, which are  available to hackers.  Other systems had dormant accounts that could be  used by hackers with a lower risk of detection.", "The network had system software configuration weaknesses that could  allow users to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to  FDIC\u2019s networks or cause network system failures.  For instance,  certain network system configuration settings allowed unauthorized  users to connect to the network without entering a valid user ID and  password combination.  This could allow unauthorized individuals to  obtain access to system information describing the network  environment, including user IDs and password information.", "Potentially dangerous services were available on several network  systems.  Because of the availability of these services, a greater risk  exists that an unauthorized user could exploit them to gain high-level  access to the system and applications, obtain information about the  system, or deny system services.", "Further, FDIC did not have a process in place to actively review the  network connections maintained by its contractors to ensure that only  authorized network access paths were being used.  Such network security  weaknesses increase the risk that those with malicious intent could  misuse, improperly disclose, or destroy financial and other sensitive  information.", "In response to our findings, FDIC\u2019s acting CIO said that the corporation had  developed and implemented policies and procedures to periodically review  (1) user accounts on all servers to ensure that they are required and  appropriately used, (2) system configuration settings for vulnerabilities,  and (3) services used on the network to ensure that only those that are  needed are maintained.

Such a program is critical to  ensuring that improper access to sensitive information is detected.", "To effectively monitor user access, it is critical that logs of user activity be  maintained for all critical system processing activities.  This includes  collecting and monitoring access activities on all critical systems, including  mainframes, network servers, and routers.  Because the volume of security  information is likely to be too large to review routinely, the most effective  monitoring techniques selectively target specific actions.  These efforts  should include provisions to identify unusual activities, such as changes to  sensitive system files that were not made by system programmers, or  updates to security files that were not made by security staff.  A  comprehensive monitoring program should, further, include an intrusion- detection system to automatically log unusual activity, provide necessary  alerts, and terminate sessions when necessary.", "While FDIC logged access activity for many of its systems and developed  programs to target unusual or suspicious activities, it did not take sufficient  steps to ensure that it was recording or monitoring the access activities of  all key systems, including the following:  Special system services on the FDIC mainframe were not being logged  because the audit trail that records the access activity was not enabled.   As a consequence, adverse access events may not be detected that could  potentially disrupt system operations or result in information system  being unavailable to the corporation.", "Logging was not enabled to monitor successful or unsuccessful  attempts to access sensitive router and switch configuration files on the  network.  Unauthorized access to these resources could enable an  intruder or unauthorized user to read or modify configuration files  containing security settings such as router passwords, user names, or  access control listings.  With the ability to read or write to these files, a  malicious user could seriously disable or disrupt network operations by  taking control of the routers and switches.", "While FDIC has installed and implemented a network-based intrusion- detection system to monitor for unusual or suspicious access activities, it  has not yet configured the host-based system parameters so that  notifications (such as e-mail and/or pager) are sent to the computer  security incident response team.  FDIC is in the process of testing the host- based system to determine the most appropriate parameter configuration.   Without full implementation of such a system and more effective logging  and monitoring of system access activities, FDIC reduces its ability to  identify and investigate unusual or suspicious access to its financial and  sensitive information.", "According to the acting CIO, the corporation has implemented security  reporting for its test environment.

For  example, there were instances in which records of access granted to staff  were not available.  Further, staff who no longer required access to the  computer center still retained such access.  This included personnel who  (1) had transferred out of computer operations, (2) no longer worked for  FDIC, or (3) never or rarely visited the computer room.

Incompatible  duties that should be separated include application and system  programming, production control, database administration, computer  operations, and data security.  Once policies and job descriptions  supporting the principles of segregation of duties have been developed, it is  important to ensure that adequate supervision is provided or mitigating  controls established to provide the necessary monitoring and oversight to  ensure that employees perform only those tasks that have been authorized  for their job functions.", "Although computer duties are generally properly segregated at FDIC, we  identified instances in which duties were not adequately segregated.  For  example, 24 application developers were authorized to make modifications  to financial programs and data that were in production.  Typically,  developer access is limited to program code in the development  environment.  While it may be appropriate at times to grant developers  access to both production programs and data, it should only be done when  mitigating controls have been established.  However, the corporation had  not established mitigating controls, such as logging and monitoring system  access activities of the developers to ensure that they were performing only  authorized actions.", "Similarly, FDIC assigned two staff members to monitor and review the  access activities on its production platforms; they were also authorized to  make changes to programs and data that they were responsible for  reviewing.  Yet, FDIC did not provide supervisory oversight or establish  other mitigating controls to ensure that these staff members performed  only authorized functions.  Because adequate mitigating controls had not  been established in either instance, the risk is increased that FDIC financial  or other sensitive information could be inadvertently or intentionally  modified, or unauthorized transactions processed.", "FDIC plans to enhance its system monitoring of developers by targeting  logging and monitoring activities to sensitive production data and  programs by December 31 of this year.

This process includes requirements for documenting the purpose of the  exit, performing a technical review of the software, and approving the  implementation of this software.  System software exits are used to provide  installations with additional processing capabilities.  These exits increase  the risk of integrity exposures, since the code is usually implemented with  authorized privileges that allow it to bypass security and gain access to  financial programs or data.", "However, we identified weaknesses in the system software development  and change control process at FDIC.  System software exits developed by  FDIC were not adequately controlled.  None of the nine locally developed  system software exits maintained by FDIC were documented to reflect  their purpose.  Further, there was no documented evidence of review by  technical management or formal approval for these exits.  FDIC did not  develop procedures for documenting, reviewing, or approving locally  developed system software exits.  Without a formally documented review  and approval process, an increased risk exists that the exit will not work as  intended, and could result in the loss of data or program integrity.", "In addition, although FDIC established a process for system software  change control and used an automated system to document changes, it did  not establish procedures for performing and approving tests of system  software changes or develop minimum documentation requirements for  tests performed.

Our May 1998 study of security management  best practices determined that a comprehensive computer security  management program is essential to ensuring that information system  controls work effectively on a continuing basis.  Specifically, an effective  computer security management program includes  establishing a central security management structure with clearly  delineated security roles and responsibilities;  performing periodic risk assessments;  establishing appropriate policies, procedures, and technical standards;  raising security awareness; and  establishing an ongoing program of tests and evaluations of the  effectiveness of policies and controls.", "FDIC has taken action related to each of the key elements described above,  including the implementation of a comprehensive security awareness  program for all its employees.  However, aside from security awareness,  the steps taken to address the other key elements of a comprehensive  computer security management program were not sufficient to ensure  continuing success.", "The first key element of effective computer security management is the  establishment of a central security group with clearly defined roles and  responsibilities.  This provides overall security policy and guidance, along  with the oversight to ensure compliance with established policies and  procedures; further, it reviews the effectiveness of the security  environment.  The central security group often is supplemented by  individual security staff designated to assist in the implementation and  management of the organizations security program.  To ensure the  effectiveness of the security program, clearly defined roles and  responsibilities for all security staff should be established, and  coordination responsibilities between individual security staff and central  security should be developed.", "While FDIC has established a central security function and is in the process  of designating information security managers for each of its divisions, it  has not clearly defined these managers\u2019 roles and responsibilities.  Further,  FDIC has not established guidance to ensure that these managers  coordinate and collaborate with the central security function in addressing  security related issues.  Without a formally defined and coordinated  program, FDIC\u2019s computer security program risks fragmentation and the  lack of a corporate focus, which is needed to adequately secure its highly  interconnected computer environment.", "The second key aspect of computer security management is periodic risk  assessment.  Regular risk assessments assist management in making  decisions on necessary controls by helping to ensure that security  resources are effectively distributed to minimize potential loss.  And, by  increasing awareness of risks, these assessments generate support for the  adopted policies and controls, which help ensure that the policies and  controls operate as intended.  Further, the Office of Management and  Budget Circular A-130, appendix III, prescribes that risk be assessed when  significant changes are made to the system or at least every 3 years.", "FDIC has not yet fully implemented a risk assessment process.  While it  requires a risk-based approach to security management, to date it has  focused on conducting independent security reviews of its key applications  and general support systems.  However, these reviews do not address  certain key elements for managing risk, such as identifying, analyzing, and  understanding the threats to the computer environment; determining  business impact when risks are exploited; and mitigating risks in a cost- effective manner.  Also, FDIC has not developed a complete framework for  assessing risk when significant changes are made to a facility or its  computer systems.  During the past year, FDIC replaced its mainframe  hardware and upgraded its mainframe operating system.  Either of the  changes could have introduced new vulnerabilities into FDIC\u2019s computer  system thus warranting a need for a risk assessment.", "A third key element of effective security management is having established  policies, procedures, and technical standards governing a complete  computer security program.  Such policies and procedures should integrate  all security aspects of an organization\u2019s interconnected environment,  including local area network, wide area network, and mainframe security.   In addition, technical security standards are needed to provide a consistent  control framework for each computer environment.  The integration of  network and mainframe security is particularly important as computer  systems become more interconnected.", "FDIC has completed security plans for its general support systems and  major financial applications.  It has also developed and implemented  overall security policies and procedures for its computer environment.   While it has established technical security standards for several of its  network platforms and its mainframe security software, it has not  developed technical security standards for implementing network routers  and maintaining operating system integrity on its mainframe system.  Such  standards would not only help ensure that appropriate computer controls  are established consistently for these systems, but would also facilitate  periodic reviews of the controls.", "A fourth key area of security management is promoting security awareness.   Computer attacks and security breakdowns often occur because computer  users fail to take appropriate security measures.  For this reason, it is vital  that employees who use computer systems in their day-to-day operations  be aware of the importance and sensitivity of the information they handle,  as well as the business and legal reasons for maintaining confidentiality  and integrity.  In accepting responsibility for security, employees should,  for example, devise effective passwords, change them frequently, and  protect them from disclosure.  In addition, employees should help maintain  physical security over their assigned areas.", "FDIC has established a comprehensive security awareness program for all  employees.  Specifically, it developed a computer-based security awareness  program that all employees were required to complete annually.  FDIC has  also established procedures to monitor compliance with this requirement.", "The final key area of an overall computer security management program is  an ongoing program of tests and evaluations of the effectiveness of policies  and controls.  Such a program includes processes for (1) monitoring  compliance with established information system control policies and  procedures, (2) testing the effectiveness of information system controls,  and (3) improving information system controls based on the results of  these activities.", "While FDIC established an independent security program to review  compliance with application and general support system security plans on  a 3-year cycle, it has not established a program to routinely monitor and  test the effectiveness of information systems controls.  Such a program  would allow FDIC to ensure that policies remain appropriate and that  controls accomplish their intended purpose.", "Monitoring is key. Weaknesses discussed in this report could have been  identified and corrected if the corporation had been monitoring  compliance with established procedures.  For example, if FDIC had a  process to review all access authority granted to each user to ensure that  the access was limited to that needed to complete job responsibilities, it  would have been able to discover and limit the inappropriate access  authority granted to hundreds of users, as discussed in this report.", "A program to regularly test information systems controls would also have  allowed FDIC to detect additional network security weaknesses.  For  example, using network analysis software designed to detect network  vulnerabilities, we identified user accounts and services that could provide  hackers with information to exploit the network and launch an attack on  FDIC systems.  Corporation staff could have identified this exposure using  similar network analysis software already available to them.", "In response, FDIC\u2019s acting CIO said that the corporation would develop  policies and procedures to define the roles and responsibilities of its  information security managers.  These procedures would include  requirements for coordinating security activities with the central security  function.  In addition, the corporation is updating its risk management  directive to address the need to perform periodic risk assessments and to  conduct these assessments when significant changes occur.  FDIC also  intends to develop and implement technical security standards for its  mainframe operating system and network routers.  In addition, it expects to  develop and implement an ongoing security oversight program to include  provisions for monitoring compliance with established procedures and  testing the effectiveness of the corporation\u2019s controls.  All of these  initiatives are expected to be completed no later than December 31 of this  year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While FDIC has made progress in correcting previously identified  computer security weaknesses, additional ones have been identified in its  information systems control environment.  Specifically, FDIC had not  appropriately limited user access authority, sufficiently secured its  network, or established a program to monitor access activity.  Also, FDIC  was not adequately providing physical security, segregating computer  duties, controlling system software, or ensuring that all aspects of its  service continuity needs were addressed.  Such weaknesses place sensitive  FDIC information at risk of disclosure, financial operations at risk of  disruption, and assets at risk of loss.", "A primary reason for FDIC\u2019s information systems control problems is that it  has not yet fully implemented a comprehensive program to manage  computer security.  While FDIC has clearly taken steps in many of these  areas, more remains to be done.  A comprehensive program for computer  security management is essential for achieving an effective information  system general control environment.  Effective implementation of such a  program provides for (1) periodically assessing risks; (2) implementing  effective controls for restricting access based on job requirements and  proactively reviewing access activities; (3) communicating the established  policies and controls to those who are responsible for their  implementation; and, perhaps most important, (4) evaluating the  effectiveness of policies and controls to ensure that they remain  appropriate and accomplish their intended purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To establish an effective information systems control environment, we  recommend that you instruct the acting CIO, as the corporation\u2019s key  official responsible for computer security, to ensure that the following  actions are completed.", "Correct the information systems control weaknesses related to access  authority, network security, access monitoring, physical access,  segregation of duties, system software, service continuity, and security  management.
