While much of the royalty data we examined from fiscal years 2006 and 2007 are reasonable, we found significant instances where data were missing or appeared erroneous. For example, we examined gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and found that, about 5.5 percent of the time, lease operators reported production, but royalty payors did not submit the corresponding royalty reports, potentially resulting in $117 million in uncollected royalties. We also found that a small percentage of royalty payors reported negative royalty values, which cannot happen, potentially costing $41 million in uncollected royalties. In addition, payors claimed processing allowances 2.3 percent of the time for unprocessed gas, potentially resulting in $2 million in uncollected royalties. Furthermore, we found significant instances where payor-provided data on royalties paid and the volume and/or the value of the oil and gas produced appeared erroneous because they were outside of expected ranges. Oil and gas company representatives reported that several factors affect their ability to accurately report royalties, including complex land ownership, administratively combining leases into units, ambiguity in federal regulations that establish gas prices, short time frames for filing royalty reports, and inaccuracies in MMS's internal databases."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Royalties for oil and natural gas produced from federal lands and waters  are one of the country\u2019s largest non-tax sources of revenue, accounting for  over $12 billion in collections during fiscal year 2008.

Each month, these oil and gas companies  self-report to MMS data on the amount of oil and gas they produced and  sold, the value of this production, and the amount of royalties owed the  federal government. Over the past 5 years, GAO has found problems with  these data. These problems include missing data, errors in the self- reported amounts of oil and gas produced, self-reported oil and gas sales  value data that, given the reported volumes of oil and gas sold, appear at  odds with prevailing market prices for oil and gas, and a lack of controls  over changes to the data that companies report. Although data accuracy  was not the focus of our previous work, we recommended that MMS  correct some of these data.", "Building on our prior work examining MMS\u2019s royalty data, we are  providing (1) a descriptive update of MMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the  accuracy of oil and gas royalty data, (2) our assessment of the  completeness and reasonableness of fiscal years 2006 and 2007 oil and gas  royalty data, and (3) factors identified by oil and gas companies that affect  the ability of these oil and gas companies to accurately report royalties  owed to the federal government.

We made no attempt to  evaluate the effectiveness of MMS\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the  accuracy of royalty data because these efforts are not fully implemented.", "To assess the completeness and reasonableness of fiscal years 2006 and  2007 oil and gas royalty data, we first analyzed MMS\u2019s existing edit checks  and plans for modifying or adding new edit checks. In our subsequent  analyses, we replicated several of MMS\u2019s edit checks but used a different  method. While MMS evaluates each royalty record individually, we  combined all royalty records submitted by a given payor for each month,  product type, and lease, thereby examining the cumulative effect of  changes to original royalty data. We then used our methodology to  evaluate 4.1 million royalty records for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 based on  extensive data reliability work conducted on two previous assignments. In  doing so, we developed a risk-based approach to identify and review key  aspects of data collection, processing, and reporting, and reviewed the  extent to which MMS\u2019s royalty collection system fills those needs. We also  reviewed reports and testimonies on oil and gas royalties to understand  the historical problems associated with the royalty collection process, and  we interviewed key MMS staff and state and tribal auditors that work on  federal oil and gas leases to identify any continuing concerns with MMS\u2019s  royalty reporting process.", "To examine factors that oil and gas companies identified as limiting their  ability to accurately report royalties owed to the federal government, we  interviewed a non-random sample of oil and gas company representatives  from the 15 companies that report to MMS the highest amount of royalty  data and from the two largest national oil and gas industry associations.  The 10 companies that responded to our request for information represent  the major companies, large independent companies, mid-size independent  companies, and small independent companies. We chose to interview a  non-random sample because we lack the authority to compel private  companies to participate in such interviews and because we deemed the  cost of trying to convince a large enough sample to participate to make the  results statistically relevant to be greater than the benefits of being able to  make inferences from the sample interviews. As a result, our results for  this objective should not be viewed as a comprehensive list of reporting  difficulties or an evaluative assessment of the validity of all the elements  of the list. A detailed description of our scope and methodology appears in  appendix I.", "We conducted this work from July 2008 to April 2009 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages onshore leases,  and Interior\u2019s MMS manages offshore leases. MMS is responsible for  collecting the royalties on all federal and many Indian oil and gas leases.  Royalties on producing leases are a percentage of the value of the  production sold less deductions known as allowances. Together, BLM and  MMS are responsible for ensuring that oil and gas companies comply with  applicable laws, regulations, and policies for more than 29,000 producing  federal and Indian leases, which account for about 23 percent of  domestically produced gas and 26 percent of domestically produced oil.", "In some cases, several companies form partnerships to explore and  develop oil and gas leases, thereby sharing the risk, the costs, and the  benefits. These companies often elect from among themselves a single  company, called the operator, to manage the physical drilling of wells and  the installation of production equipment. Operators report monthly to  MMS on the Oil and Gas Operations Report (OGOR) the amount of oil and  gas produced from each well on each lease. In addition, all the companies  that share the proceeds from the sale of oil and gas from federal lands and  waters are required each month to report to MMS on the Form MMS-2014  data about the oil and gas they sold. MMS refers to these companies,  including the operator, as royalty payors. The data on each Form MMS- 2014 are then stored in MMS\u2019s system as a number of records, each of  which consists of many variables, such as the name of the payor, the lease  number, the amount of oil and gas sold (sales volume), the value of this oil  and gas (sales value), allowable deductions for transportation and  processing, and the amount of royalties owed (royalty value). Payors can  legally adjust these data they report for up to 6 years if, for example, they  learn that the data they submitted were incorrect. Almost all payors  submit these data electronically.", "Within its 5-year business plan for fiscal years 2008 to 2012, MMS has set  an objective of ensuring timely and more accurate mineral revenue  reporting and payment. According to Interior\u2019s 2009 Budget Justification,  MMS set goals in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 of ensuring that companies  report 98 percent of their data accurately the first time, up from actual  percentages of 97.4 in fiscal year 2006 and 97.3 in fiscal year 2007, and  compared to an actual percentage of 98.3 as reported by MMS for fiscal  year 2008. While we could not find a business entity that performed  identical services to those of MMS for comparing its accuracy of electronic  transactions, we chose the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for comparison  because of the potential difficulty in interpreting complex tax regulations,  determining allowable deductions, and calculating taxes owed. To this  end, IRS reported in January 2008 that its electronic tax filers have a 99  percent accuracy rate\u2014only slightly higher than the rates reported by  MMS. To help improve data accuracy, MMS subjects payor-reported  royalty data to over 140 edit checks. Specifically, MMS has incorporated  certain up-front edit-checks in its data acceptance tools that help detect  and reject erroneous payor-reported royalty data before MMS\u2019s data  systems will accept them. MMS also incorporates a second level of edit  checks that review payor-reported data for additional errors after data are  accepted. Edit checks must comply with GAO standards for internal  controls in the federal government as required by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c) and  (d), commonly referred to as the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act  of 1982. These standards identify and address major performance  challenges and areas at greatest risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement. Furthermore, the standards state that automated edits  and checks should help control the accuracy and completion of  transaction processing.", "Given the large amount of royalty revenues at stake and problems with  royalty management identified by past GAO, Interior Inspector General,  and other reports, MMS\u2019s processes for ensuring the accurate collection of  royalties have been the subject of continuing scrutiny. For example, in  2003 while examining MMS\u2019s Royalty-in-Kind program, we found that from  1.9 percent to 3.3 percent of the data that we examined for oil leases in  Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico were erroneous or missing, and that 6  percent of the data that we examined for gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico  were anomalous, meaning that data values fell outside of expected  ranges. Similarly in 2004, we found that 40 percent of the royalty data that  we examined for 10 geothermal projects was either missing or erroneous. In 2006, we examined the relationship between the increases in oil and gas  prices from 2000 to 2005 and the amount of royalties collected during that  time and found that 8.5 percent of the data appeared anomalous. In 2008,  we reported that MMS\u2019s royalty management system lacked several  capabilities that would provide greater assurance that royalties are  collected accurately. These capabilities include readily identifying  changes that companies make to previously entered data, detecting the  absence of royalty reports, and implementing a process for collecting the  proper amount of royalties when MMS identifies that oil and gas volumes  have been incorrectly reported. Among other things, we recommended  MMS identify when royalty reports have not been filed as required and  when companies make changes to data provided to MMS after the  statutory limitation on such changes. We also reported that MMS was  taking steps to address these deficiencies.", "In addition to GAO\u2019s work, Interior\u2019s Inspector General (IG) analyzed  MMS\u2019s auditing and compliance process and made several  recommendations in 2007 to improve these functions and the systems that  track them. Also, the Royalty Policy Committee (RPC)\u2014a group  empanelled by the Secretary of the Interior and charged with providing  advice on managing federal and Indian leases and revenues\u2013\u2013has  identified numerous deficiencies. In December 2007, the RPC issued a  report that included more than 100 recommendations to strengthen  Interior\u2019s royalty collections by improving BLM\u2019s and MMS\u2019s verification of  production volumes, improving many areas of MMS\u2019s audit and  compliance efforts by establishing a compliance strategy counsel,  improving coordination between MMS and BLM, and improving MMS\u2019s  computer system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MMS Has Ongoing Efforts to Improve the Accuracy of Payor- Reported Royalty Data, but It Is Too Early to Assess the Effectiveness of These Efforts", "paragraphs": ["MMS has three major efforts underway to improve the accuracy of payor- reported royalty data used to collect and verify royalties, but it is too early  to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.

MMS  officials explained that 6 months is a reasonable timeframe, and that  companies make most corrections to missing or incorrect royalty data  within this time frame. Under the current royalty reporting system, cases  in which a company has not filed a royalty report may not be detected  until more than 2 years after the initial reporting date, when MMS  personnel in their compliance group begin to target leases for a review or  audit. According to MMS officials, personnel in the financial management  group are beginning to identify missing royalty reports by identifying  instances in which the royalty report\u2014the Form MMS-2014\u2014is absent  when a production report\u2014the OGOR\u2014was filed by the operator. With  few exceptions, MMS should receive corresponding royalty reports for  each production report it receives. MMS has additional checks in place  through its CPT for determining when both the OGOR and the Form MMS- 2014 are missing.", "Also in response to a GAO recommendation, MMS is developing an  automated process to identify changes that royalty payors make to their  previously entered royalty data that exceed the 6-year statutory limit on  such adjustments or that occur after compliance work, including audits,  has been completed. Although these adjustments may change payors\u2019  royalty payments, prior to this effort MMS\u2019s royalty reporting system could  not monitor them and payors could continue to adjust their previously  reported royalty data without prior MMS approval or review. In addition,  companies could change royalty data after an audit has been completed,  and MMS needs to be able to identify when this occurs, as we have  suggested in our previous work. While adjustments may occur for  legitimate reasons, and identifying them will not prevent them from  occurring, it could facilitate later scrutiny and follow up with company  officials.

The following actions directly relate to  four recommendations for improving the accuracy of the royalty reporting  process out of over 100 recommendations identified by the RPC. First,  MMS is in the process of using its existing edit checks and adding  additional edit checks to examine more data before the data are entered  into its database, instead of examining data that have already been  accepted and stored. Specifically, this change will affect royalty data that  payors submit through the electronic reporting interface\u2014a Web site- based portal through which MMS accepts almost 30 percent of its data.  According to MMS officials, the other 70 percent of royalty records are  accepted through the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)\u2014a standardized  method of transferring data electronically between computer systems,  such as a payor\u2019s system and MMS\u2019s system. Currently, there are some edit  checks built into the EDI software, but MMS\u2019s goal, as outlined in its  strategic business plan for 2008-2012, is to require EDI reporters to  implement most edits on their individual computer systems before they  submit the data through EDI. If they do not, then payors must use MMS\u2019s  other system for submitting data\u2014the electronic reporting interface\u2014 which accepts fewer royalty records at a time, but already has these up- front edit checks built into its system. As GAO has noted in prior reports,  edit checks that prevent potentially erroneous data from entering the  databases offer advantages over efforts to continually clean up erroneous  data allowed into the system. However, it is too early to tell how useful  these specific efforts will be. MMS\u2019s processes for checking data are  outlined in figure 1.", "Second, MMS is working on a problem identified by the RPC concerning  the accuracy of reporting natural gas royalties. The RPC recommended  that MMS add a data field on the Form MMS-2014 that identifies the heat  content per cubic foot of natural gas, which is important in determining  the amount of royalties owed. State and tribal royalty auditors with whom  we spoke also identified the need to check on the heat content of natural  gas. In response to the RPC recommendation, MMS officials said that they  developed and recently implemented an alternate plan for evaluating the  information identified by the RPC using data already collected on the  Form MMS-2014 and maintained in its databases. In particular, payors  report to MMS the quantity of natural gas sold (in thousands of cubic feet)  as well as the total heating value of all the gas sold (in millions of Btus, an  industry standard for selling natural gas). MMS officials told us they plan  to calculate the heating value per cubic foot from these existing data  fields, by dividing the total heating value by the quantity sold, and  implement an edit check on the reasonableness of the results of this  calculation. Moreover, MMS officials said that it was too costly to change  the structure of its database to accommodate a new data field and modify  how data are collected. We believe that MMS\u2019s alternative is a reasonable  approach and that it is likely to identify errors in reported gas volumes.", "Third, MMS is planning to publish proposed revisions to its gas valuation  regulations and guidelines that they believe will address several problems.  For example, MMS regulations provide a series of benchmarks for  companies to use in establishing the price of natural gas when they sell it  to their affiliates. However, according to the RPC and state auditors, these  benchmarks are difficult to apply and do not reflect how gas is currently  sold so they recommend that MMS should replace these benchmarks with  widely published market indexes. Another problem that MMS intends to  address with its new gas valuation regulations relates to how companies  can take deductions from gas revenues. According to MMS regulations, the  costs for transportation and processing must be properly allocated among  the individual products that result from the processing of gas. However,  gas purchasers can \u201cbundle\u201d all of these charges together, making it  difficult for the payor to determine how to allocate these deductions and  then to calculate what is actually owed in royalties. While MMS has plans  to address these and other issues with its new regulations, they were  unable to give us sufficient details about how this would be done for us to  evaluate the effectiveness of the new regulations. MMS has a target date  for completion of the new proposed regulations of December 2009.", "Fourth, in response to RPC recommendations that MMS improve its  interagency coordination with BLM, MMS has taken a first step to improve  coordination. Specifically, the RPC recommended that the Department of  the Interior establish a Production Coordination Committee (PCC) that is  charged with, among others things, defining and coordinating common  processes, defining common data standards, and addressing technical  issues for information sharing between the two agencies. To begin this  process, MMS, BLM, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs held a 3-day PCC  meeting in September 2008, during which a number of key issues  regarding the accuracy of royalty data were discussed, including (1)  placing more responsibility on industry to provide clean data to MMS; (2)  resolving invalid lease numbers; (3) sharing information on rents,  agreements, and Indian leases in a more timely manner; and (4) providing  notices to MMS when wells first start to produce. This meeting was a first  step in improving inter-agency coordination, but it is too early to judge the  effectiveness of the committee. MMS officials said that additional meetings  are planned on a recurring basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MMS Has Other Efforts Underway to Improve the Quality of Payor-Reported Royalty Data, but Their Preliminary Nature Precludes Assessing Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["MMS officials told us they are evaluating a process to incorporate more  detailed market prices into its system to compare sales prices that MMS  calculates from payor-reported royalty data to relevant market prices. MMS  does not require payors to report their sales prices but can calculate an  implicit sales price by dividing the total value of the oil or gas that payors  report (sales value) by the volume that payors report as having sold (sales  volume). Currently, MMS uses for comparison a few oil and gas prices with a  wide range of values for all leases regardless of where the lease is located or  the quality of oil that is produced. MMS officials told us that they intend to  incorporate a more detailed price table into its royalty reporting system by  2010 that will include more specific sales prices related to geographic areas  and specific sales months. We believe that this could be a significant  improvement, but it remains too early to assess MMS\u2019s efforts.", "In addition, during the course of our work, MMS officials told us they plan  to expand the implementation of two edit checks. First, MMS plans to  expand the use of an edit check that will calculate the royalty rate from  payor-reported data and compare this with the royalty rate specified in  each lease. As with sales prices, MMS does not require payors to report  royalty rates but can calculate implicit royalty rates from payor-reported  data. MMS can calculate implicit royalty rates by dividing the amount of  royalties that payors report (royalty value) by the total value of the oil or  gas that payors report (sales value). While MMS has checked royalty rates  on Indian leases and prevented erroneous data on these leases from  entering its system since prior to 2001, MMS\u2019s checking of royalty rates  has not prevented erroneous data on federal leases from entering its  system. However, MMS plans to resolve this issue on federal leases by the  end of fiscal year 2009. Second, MMS recently began using an edit check  that ensures payors take processing allowances only on gas that is  processed. MMS reported that in April 2009 it implemented such an edit  check in its electronic reporting interface. This action will affect about 30  percent of data entering MMS\u2019s system, but will not impact potentially  erroneous data that companies submit through the EDI. We believe that  expanding the use of both of these edit checks can improve MMS\u2019s ability  to evaluate self-reported royalty data, but we will be unable to evaluate the  effectiveness of these new processes until they are fully implemented.", "In 2008, MMS auditors in its compliance group began to use the CPT to  identify discrepancies\u2014based on certain thresholds\u2014between the  volumes of oil and gas produced that lease operators reported on the  OGOR and the total volumes sold that payors reported on the Form MMS- 2014. When conducting this process, MMS also is able to identify  instances when a royalty payor fails to submit the required Form MMS- 2014. However until recently, these comparisons are not done until over 2  years after royalty data have been submitted when MMS begins to select  leases for audit. While this volumetric comparison had been done much  sooner and routinely for all leases in the past, the process was dropped  when MMS implemented its current information system in 2001 because  the new module that was to perform this function was not yet ready for  implementation and because MMS wanted to expand the comparison to  include an examination of the amount of royalties paid and the value of  the oil and gas sold. MMS officials explained that under the old system,  potential mismatches between OGOR and 2014 volumes often involved  errors in the royalties paid and/or the value of the oil and gas sold, and it  was important to look at all three of these components at once. They  further explained that the new module was never implemented but instead  was replaced with an expanded use of the CPT, albeit at a much later date  than initially anticipated. MMS reported that in January 2009, it began  using the CPT to compare volumes and examine the amount of royalties  paid and the value of the oil and gas sold within 6 to 9 months after payors  submit data. Moreover, in 1992 when we last examined the comparison of  volumes on the OGOR with volumes on the Form MMS-2014, we  determined that it was cost effective to follow up on at least the largest of  the discrepancies and support MMS doing this within an earlier time  frame, such as 6 months after receiving royalty data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In Several Instances, Data Used to Collect and Verify Royalties Are Either Missing or Appear to Be Erroneous", "paragraphs": ["While much of the royalty data we examined from fiscal years 2006 and  2007 appears reasonable, we found several instances where key data were  missing or appear to be erroneous. For example, our close examination of  producing gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico indicated that up to 5.5 percent  of the time, royalty reports were missing for these leases. We also found  that from about 2 to 7.4 percent of the time, depending on the group of  leases we examined, either the amount of royalties that payors report due  (royalty value) and/or the total value of the oil and gas that payors report  (sales value) appeared erroneous. In addition, 3.9 percent of sales values  and/or the volume that payors report as having sold (sales volume) from  offshore oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico appeared erroneous while about  6.6 percent of one or both of these data elements appeared erroneous for  offshore gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Checks for Completeness of Payor-Reported Royalty Data Indicate That Certain Data Are Missing", "paragraphs": ["Our detailed examination of producing gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico  indicated that 5.5 percent of royalty reports were missing.

For each month in which operators reported gas production, we checked  MMS\u2019s monthly royalty reports to ensure that payors reported sales of  gas. We found that about 5.5 percent of the time that operators reported  monthly gas production from leases, payors did not submit the  corresponding monthly royalty report. The missing royalty reports for this  production represent potentially about $117 million in royalties that may  not have been collected. However, it is possible that instead of reporting  royalties on the appropriate reports, payors may have misreported these  royalties on reports for other leases, and as such, additional royalties  would not be due. We also observed instances in which the total gas  production on the royalty reports was substantially less than that on the  production reports, possibly indicating that one of multiple payors on that  lease may not have submitted a royalty report for that month. While a  significant number of the almost 1,500 leases in our sample had royalty  reports but no production reports, missing production reports were more  prevalent for the last 3 months of fiscal year 2007, possibly indicating that  these reports had not yet been received or accepted by MMS\u2019s system.  Missing royalty reports are illustrated in figure 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Checks for Reasonableness of Payor- Reported Royalty Data Indicate Errors in Transportation and Processing Allowances", "paragraphs": ["We evaluated all royalty data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007\u2014excluding  royalty-in-kind leases\u2014for obvious errors in key reported royalty  variables, including volumes of oil and gas sold, the value of this oil and  gas, and royalties paid, and found that the error rate for these variables  ranged from 0 percent to about 2.3 percent, with the highest levels of  errors being found in transportation and processing allowances. This  analysis is summarized in table 1, along with subsequent analyses  discussed below. We used a different method than MMS\u2019s edit checks to  evaluate the reasonableness of royalty data. For example, MMS\u2019s edit  checks generally evaluate each royalty record individually, and a royalty  payor may submit multiple records for a given lease each month, including  the original royalty report and often times multiple corrections to the  volumes sold or the royalties paid. However, we combined all royalty  records associated with a given payor for each month, product type, and  lease. Unlike MMS\u2019s edit checks of individual royalty records, our  methodology is able to detect if adjustments exceed the amount of the  original entries. For example, in checking the sum of the sales values, sum  of sales volumes, and sum of royalty values that payors submitted for a  given month, product type, and lease, we found that over 99.8 percent of  the time these sums were positive, as one would expect when payors owe  royalties. However, payors submit one payment per month for all their  federal leases; therefore a negative royalty value for an individual lease  may go undetected if it is small in comparison to the sum of the royalty  values for all their other leases. Although the 0.2 percent of royalty values  that we found to be negative is a small percentage, collectively this  represented about $41 million in royalties that may not be collected if  these instances are not detected in future compliance work or audits.  Further, a check for positive royalty values is not a precise measure of  accuracy. Rather, it is a gross check of reasonableness and some positive  royalty rates, which we did not evaluate, could have been lower than they  were supposed to be.", "We found that transportation allowances and processing allowances,  which should always be negative values in the database, were positive 1.73  percent and 0.77 percent of the time, respectively. We also found that  about 2.3 percent of claimed processing allowances were incorrect. These  processing allowances were associated with either unprocessed gas,  which by definition is not entitled to a processing allowance, or coalbed  methane, which is never processed, and therefore should not receive an  allowance. Claiming processing allowances for gas that was not processed  could result in MMS collecting about $2 million less in royalties than are  due for the fiscal year 2006 and 2007 leases that we examined. However,  the gas reported as unprocessed gas could be processed gas that was  improperly reported as unprocessed gas by the payors, and hence, no  additional royalties would be due. Either way, there are reporting errors  that raise questions about the accuracy of royalty collections. In addition,  we checked that transportation and processing allowances did not exceed  regulatory limits and found that they were within limits nearly 100 percent  of the time. Lastly, we checked and verified that payors did not report  sales volumes when reporting transportation and processing allowances  separately from royalty amounts.

We also compared leases for which  the calculated implicit royalty rates were other than 12.5 or 16.67 percent  to actual royalty rates as specified in the federal lease and adjusted our  analysis for those few times when these calculated, but apparently  erroneous royalty rates, were legitimate. As such, a royalty rate that is  different from general lease terms means that either the payor-reported  royalty value or the sales value is erroneous.

Our  analysis did not identify as erroneous those instances when the implicit  royalty rate matched standard royalty rates but was nevertheless  incorrect. In addition to misreporting royalty values or sales values, MMS  said that the higher percentage of apparently erroneous royalty data for  onshore oil leases may be due to royalty payors continuing to incorrectly  pay royalties under expired provisions for low volume or heavy oil.

MMS requires payors to report royalties for  each producing lease and, if a lease is assigned to a unit, to provide  information identifying the unit in the agreement data field. If a lease does  not belong to a unit, the agreement data field should be left blank.  However, companies can fail to complete the agreement data field when a  lease belongs to a unit, which raises questions about whether the royalties  paid were for production belonging to a unit or for production outside of a  unit.

However, payors are required to report royalties to MMS on or before the  last day of the month following the month the product was sold or  removed from the lease.

We removed records related to rental payments, gas storage  agreements, taxes, contract settlements, and geothermal operations by  using transaction codes, and removed sulfur, helium, nitrogen, and carbon  dioxide, using product codes. We also limited our analysis to cash royalty  payments, excluding royalty-in-kind (RIK) payments whenever possible or  appropriate. Our resulting analysis file consisted of about 4.1 million  royalty records.", "First, we assessed the completeness of MMS\u2019s data. We developed a  frequency distribution of the number of records per month and compared  these frequencies from month-to-month, looking for abnormal patterns.  We discovered that there were about half as many records for April 2007  as for other months on average. At our request, MMS investigated the  reason and discovered that the contractor who extracted the data  inadvertently excluded records accepted by MMS\u2019s system in June 2007\u2014 the month in which much of the data from April 2007 would have been  submitted and accepted. We then obtained from MMS a new file of records  accepted in June 2007 and combined the new data with the rest of the  royalty data, and rechecked the monthly totals. This procedure revealed a  fairly consistent number of records and leases on a month-to-month basis.  We determined that the data we received from MMS were a complete  representation of what was in their data system through our study date  and was therefore reliable enough to allow us to use the extract in our  more detailed review of royalty data. This monthly consistency is  illustrated in figure 9.", "To examine the completeness of records in more detail, we analyzed a  subset of MMS\u2019s royalty data\u2014leases that produced natural gas in the  offshore Gulf of Mexico. We chose this subset because of: (1) its relatively  manageable size\u2014about 2,100 leases out of a total of about 29,000  producing federal and Indian oil and gas leases and (2) its financial  significance\u2014the gas royalties from Gulf of Mexico leases in fiscal year  2008 account for almost 30 percent of total federal and Indian oil and gas  royalty revenues. For each lease, we compared gas volumes reportedly  sold by payors on Form MMS-2014 to gas volumes reportedly produced by  operators on MMS\u2019s OGOR. Specifically, for each lease we added together  all sales volumes on the Form MMS-2014 of processed and unprocessed  gas in thousands of cubic feet for each month from January 2006 to  September 2007 and compared these to gas volumes disposed of on the  OGOR-B for the same month. From the Form MMS-2014, we included  volumes for cash sales (transaction code 01), royalty-in-kind sales  (transaction codes 06 and 08), and non-royalty bearing sales under  provisions for deepwater royalty relief (transaction code 41). We excluded  from our analysis October through December 2005 because major  hurricanes disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in many  production facilities being shut down. We also used data from MMS\u2019s  Technical Information Management System (TIMS) to identify all leases  that belonged to unit agreements and excluded these leases in order to  simplify the analysis. This resulted in about 1,500 producing gas leases.  Also, a significant number of these leases had royalty reports but no  production reports, but missing production reports were more prevalent  for the last 3 months of fiscal year 2007, possibly indicating that these  reports had not yet been received or accepted by MMS\u2019s system.", "To investigate the completeness of individual royalty records, we  examined key royalty data fields to ensure that they were populated.  These data fields are necessary to match royalty payments to the proper  payor, lease, sales month, and product code. Fields included payor  number, lease number, sales date, and transaction code. We also checked  that product code and sales type were populated. Because nearly 100  percent of these critical data fields were populated, we discontinued  additional tests on assessing the completeness of individual data fields.  However, we examined certain data fields to ensure that they were not  populated when they should not be. These fields included sales value and  sales volume for certain transaction codes, including minimum royalty due  (transaction code 02), estimated royalty payment (transaction code 03),  transportation allowance (transaction code 11), processing allowance  (transaction code 15), and quality bank adjustment (transaction code 13).  Population of these data fields could result in counting sales values and  sales volumes twice.", "We then developed tests to investigate the gross reasonableness of certain  data fields that our past work highlighted as being problematic, including  royalty value, sales value, sales volume, transportation allowance, and  processing allowance. We identified royalty-in-kind transactions from  transaction codes (06 and 08) and excluded them from this analysis. We  employed a technique that is different from MMS\u2019s edit checks, which  generally examine only individual royalty lines. We summed the data fields  on all royalty records for each month on each lease for each royalty payor  and product code. This technique aggregated the original royalty record  with all subsequent adjustments, allowing us to examine the net effect and  easily identify negative sums for royalty values, sales values, or sales  volumes, which MMS\u2019s edit checks of individual lines cannot identify.  Since payors generally submit one electronic fund transfer for all the  leases upon which they owe royalties for a given month, a negative sum  can go undetected if submitted along with many other positive sums.  Although we found a relatively small percentage (less than or equal to 0.2  percent) of negative sums, we examined the corresponding royalty lines to  determine if their financial impact was significant.", "We used the same technique of summing royalty records to examine the  gross reasonableness of transportation and processing allowances. Being  deductions, these allowances should be negative. We found that  transportation allowances and processing allowances were positive 3.8  percent and 10.1 percent of the time, respectively. However when we  examined individual royalty records, we discovered that many of these  records were associated with royalty-in-kind transactions, and therefore  outside of the scope of our analysis. MMS, who creates the royalty-in-kind  data, did not properly identify these RIK leases with the designated  royalty-in-kind transaction codes (06 and 08), but instead used the codes  for transportation (11) and processing (15) allowances. An MMS official  with the RIK program explained that, due to constraints in their RIK  system, some transportation and processing allowances could be positive  due to their RIK system having populated the transportation and  processing data fields for the current month with changes to prior months  reported by pipelines and processing plants. This official also said that the  RIK system included all revenues and expenses associated with natural  gas liquids from the RIK leases in the processing allowances. These  processes for RIK leases are inconsistent with processes for leases on  which royalties are paid in cash. For cash royalties, adjustments to  previous periods are posted to the specific sales month, not the current  month. Also for cash royalties, revenue is identified as sales value, and  allowable expenses, such as transportation or processing allowances, are  individually identified as transportation or processing allowances for the  appropriate product code. The MMS official said that they corrected this  system problem in July 2007. We were then able to identify the RIK leases  through their payor codes, which are alphanumeric as opposed to the  numeric payor codes of cash royalty payments, and subsequently removed  them. We also checked for transportation and processing allowances  being taken in excess of the maximum amounts allowed by federal  regulations and checked to see if transportation and processing  allowances were taken for transaction codes for which they are not  permitted, such as minimum royalties (transaction code 2), estimated  royalty payments (transaction code 3), quality banks (transaction code  13), and offshore deep water royalty relief (transaction code 41). Lastly,  we examined royalty data to see if payors reported processing allowances  for products that are not processed, such as oil, condensate, unprocessed  gas, and coalbed methane.", "We then investigated the reasonableness and accuracy of royalty values,  sales values, and sales volumes in more detail because these royalty data  fields appeared to be problematic in our previous work. Using the same  method of summing these data fields each month for all royalty records for  each payor for each lease and each product, we calculated the royalty  rates by dividing royalty value prior to allowances by sales value. We then  compared our calculated royalty rates to expected royalty rates based on  general lease terms because we did not have access to individual lease  terms for the estimated 29,000 producing federal and Indian leases. For  offshore leases (product codes 01, 02, 03, 04, and 07), we used royalty  rates of 12.5 percent and 16.67 percent for comparison.  We identified the  lease numbers associated with royalty rates outside of expected values  and compared the calculated royalty rates of these 331 leases to royalty  rates for these leases in the TIMS database. Sixteen of these leases had  royalty rates other than 12.5 or 16.67 percent, and we adjusted our analysis  accordingly. For onshore federal gas production (product codes 03, 04,  and 07), we compared our calculated royalty rates to the same royalty  rates as for offshore leases. For onshore federal oil production, we  compared initially our calculated royalty rates to rates of 12.5 percent to  25 percent. According to MMS, this latter interval included a number of  prescribed royalty rates that were common for oil production from certain  leases issued before 1988. However because of the large number of  calculated onshore oil and gas royalty rates that fell outside of expected  values, we selected a sample of onshore leases for MMS to research. MMS  reported that several leases had royalty rates that were either 5 percent or  10 percent\u2014rates that they identified as common for certain older leases.  We adjusted our onshore comparison to include these two rates as  acceptable. Because few other leases had royalty rates that were  uncommon, we did not ask MMS to research additional onshore leases.  For Indian leases, we similarly calculated royalty rates and determined  that few leases had royalty rates of less than 12.5 percent, so we did not  pursue comparing these to actual lease terms.", "We further investigated the reasonableness and accuracy of royalty values,  sales values, and sales volumes by calculating unit oil and gas sales prices  with Gulf of Mexico monthly data submitted by royalty payors for each  lease. We limited our analysis to the offshore Gulf of Mexico because this  area has well developed transparent markets where regional prices are  readily available, unlike onshore markets. To compare oil prices, we used  a range of market prices each month for comparison, the low price being  the lowest daily spot price that month for Mars oil (rounded down to the  nearest dollar), and the high price being the highest daily spot price for  light Louisiana sweet (rounded up to the nearest dollar). We investigated  doing similar comparisons onshore but discovered that the price range  onshore, with West Texas Intermediate among the highest priced oil we  found, and Wyoming asphaltic being about the lowest priced oil we found,  created a range that was so wide that it made any comparison  meaningless. To compare gas prices, we examined the maximum mid-day  spot price, the minimum mid-day spot price, and the First of the Month  price at the Henry Hub and chose the highest and the lowest price from  among the three (we rounded the lowest price down to the nearest dollar  and rounded the highest price up to the nearest dollar). In calculating unit  gas prices from MMS royalty data, we used volumes expressed per MMBtu  to remove the effects of quality on price. As with oil prices, we  investigated doing gas price comparisons onshore but found that  exceptionally low gas prices at Opal, Wyoming created a range of prices  that was so wide as to make any comparisons meaningless.", "To examine factors that affect oil and gas companies\u2019 abilities to  accurately report royalties owed to the federal government, we  interviewed a limited number of oil and gas company representatives. To  solicit views on oil and gas companies\u2019 experiences with reporting royalty  data to MMS, we used a nonprobability sample. To draw our sample, we  identified the 20 oil and gas companies that submitted the highest number  of royalty lines on Form MMS-2014 in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and  contacted representatives from the top 15 to request information. The top  20 companies accounted for 63 percent of all the royalty lines reported,  and the top 15 accounted for more than 56 percent. In addition, we  contacted the two largest national oil and gas industry associations\u2014 American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Independent Petroleum  Association of the Mountain States (IPAMS)\u2014to request information.  IPAMS describes itself as a non-profit trade association representing more  than 400 independent oil and natural gas producers, service and supply  companies, banking and financial institutions, and industry consultants  committed to environmentally responsible oil and natural gas  development in the Intermountain West. API reports that it is the only  national trade association that represents all aspects of America\u2019s oil and  natural gas industry. API has 400 corporate members, from the largest  major oil company to the smallest of independents. They include  producers, refiners, suppliers, pipeline operators, and marine transporters,  as well as service and supply companies that support all segments of the  industry.", "For our semi-structured interview questions, we received a total of 10  responses from oil and gas companies. Specifically, of the 15 companies  with the most royalty lines, 2 responded to our request. From API  members we received two responses, and from IPAMS members we  received six responses. We personally met with two company  representatives at the IPAMS office and discussed their written responses  to our questions. Membership in these associations and being identified as  1 of the 15 companies is not mutually exclusive. Results from this  nonprobability sample cannot be used to make inferences about all oil and  gas companies, because the companies that were not included in our list  of the top royalty payors or members in the associations we contacted had  no chance of being selected as part of the sample."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jon Ludwigson, Assistant  Director; Ron Belak; Melinda Cordero; Alison O\u2019Neill; Kim Raheb; Barbara  Timmerman; and Mary Welch made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
