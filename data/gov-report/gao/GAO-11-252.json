The Department of the Interior (DOI) and DOJ provide support to federally recognized tribes to address tribal justice issues. Upon request, GAO analyzed (1) the challenges facing tribes in adjudicating Indian country crimes and what federal efforts exist to help address these challenges and (2) the extent to which DOI and DOJ have collaborated with each other to support tribal justice systems. To do so, GAO interviewed tribal justice officials at 12 tribes in four states and reviewed laws, including the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010, to identify federal efforts to assist tribes. GAO selected these tribes based on court structure, among other factors. Although the results cannot be generalized, they provided useful perspectives about the challenges various tribes face in adjudicating crime in Indian country. GAO also compared DOI and DOJ's efforts against practices that can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies and standards for internal control in the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 12 tribes GAO visited reported several challenges in adjudicating crimes in Indian country, but multiple federal efforts exist to help address some of these challenges. For example, tribes only have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by Indian offenders in Indian country. Also, until the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (the Act) was passed in July 2010, tribes could only sentence those found guilty to up to 1 year in jail per offense. Lacking further jurisdiction and sentencing authority, tribes rely on the U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAO) to prosecute crime in Indian country. Generally, the tribes GAO visited reported challenges in obtaining information on prosecutions from USAOs in a timely manner. For example, tribes reported they experienced delays in obtaining information when a USAO declines to prosecute a case; these delays may affect tribes' ability to pursue prosecution in tribal court before their statute of limitations expires. USAOs are working with tribes to improve timely notification about declinations. DOI and the tribes GAO visited also reported overcrowding at tribal detention facilities. In some instances, tribes may have to contract with other detention facilities, which can be costly. Multiple federal efforts exist to help address these challenges. For example, the Act authorizes tribes to sentence convicted offenders for up to 3 years imprisonment under certain circumstances, and encourages DOJ to appoint tribal prosecutors to assist in prosecuting Indian country criminal matters in federal court. Federal efforts also include developing a pilot program to house, in federal prison, up to 100 Indian offenders convicted in tribal courts, given the shortage of tribal detention space. DOI, through its Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and DOJ components have taken action to coordinate their efforts to support tribal court and tribal detention programs; however, the two agencies could enhance their coordination on tribal courts by strengthening their information sharing efforts. BIA and DOJ have begun to establish task forces designed to facilitate coordination on tribal court and tribal detention initiatives, but more focus has been given to coordination on tribal detention programs. For example, at the program level, BIA and DOJ have established procedures to share information when DOJ plans to construct tribal detention facilities. This helps ensure that BIA is prepared to assume responsibility to staff and operate tribal detention facilities that DOJ constructs and in turn minimizes potential waste. In contrast, BIA and DOJ have not implemented similar information sharing and coordination mechanisms for their shared activities to enhance the capacity of tribal courts to administer justice. For example, BIA has not shared information with DOJ about its assessments of tribal courts. Further, both agencies provide training and technical assistance to tribal courts; however, they are unaware as to whether there could be unnecessary duplication. Developing mechanisms to identify and share information related to tribal courts could yield potential benefits in terms of minimizing unnecessary duplication and leveraging the expertise and capacities that each agency brings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General direct the relevant DOI and DOJ programs to develop mechanisms to identify and share information related to tribal courts. DOI and DOJ concurred with our recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice (DOJ) has reported from the latest available  data that the crime rates experienced by American Indians nationwide are  two and a half times higher than those experienced by the general  population in the United States. Specifically, DOJ reported that from 1992  to 2001, American Indians, nationally, experienced violent crimes at an  estimated rate of 101 violent crimes per 1,000 Indians annually, which is  more than twice the estimated national rate of 41 per 1,000 persons. While  violent crime rate statistics specific to Indian country are not available, the  Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) recognizes that Indian tribes  have faced significant increases of burglary, assault, child abuse, and  domestic violence as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on  Indian reservations. Further, it is estimated that 39 percent of American  Indian and Alaska Native women will be subjected to domestic violence  during their lifetime. Such crime levels can have a devastating effect on  the quality of life for tribal communities and signal a public safety crisis in  Indian country.  Tribal, state, or federal governments may have  jurisdiction to prosecute Indian offenders who commit crimes of a more  serious nature in Indian country; however, tribal governments do not have  jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians, even if the victim is Indian. Rather,  non-Indian offenders who commit crimes against Indians may be  prosecuted by the federal government or, where jurisdiction has been  conferred, a state government. Although TLOA acknowledges that tribal  justice systems are often the most appropriate institutions for maintaining  law and order in Indian country, they face challenges in effectively  administering justice due to limited personnel and resources, increasing  volume and complexity of criminal caseload, and limited sentencing  authority. To that end and in light of the challenges that tribes face in  adjudicating crimes, tribal communities rely on the federal government to  investigate and prosecute a variety of crimes in Indian country.", "The Department of the Interior (DOI) and DOJ are the two primary federal  agencies that provide support to federally recognized tribes to ensure safe  communities in Indian country and help tribes administer justice. First,  DOI, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), provides funding to  entities of the tribal justice system including tribal courts, law  enforcement agencies, and detention facilities. Additionally, BIA  investigates crimes that occur in Indian country, and assists tribes in their  efforts to establish and maintain judicial systems, among other things.  Second, within DOJ, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducts  criminal investigations, while the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) may  exercise its jurisdiction to prosecute crime in Indian country. A number of  DOJ components provide grant funding, training, and technical assistance  to tribes for the purpose of enhancing tribal justice systems. In 2010, DOI  and DOJ announced that public safety in tribal communities is to be a  priority for their respective agencies and launched a number of initiatives  intended to help address tribal justice issues. Further, TLOA was signed  into law on July 29, 2010, to help address the wide-ranging challenges  facing tribes and improve the response to and prosecution of crime in  Indian country.", "You requested that we review the challenges facing selected tribal justice  systems in adjudicating crime in Indian country as well as federal  agencies\u2019 efforts to coordinate their activities to support tribal justice  systems. We prepared this report to answer the following questions:  1.  What challenges do tribes face in adjudicating crime in Indian country  and what federal efforts exist to help address those challenges?  2.  To what extent have DOI and DOJ components collaborated with each  other to support tribal justice systems?", "To identify the challenges facing tribes in adjudicating criminal matters in  Indian country and federal efforts that exist to help address those  challenges, we met with tribal justice officials such as judges, prosecutors,  law enforcement officers, and court administrators from a nonprobability  sample of 12 federally recognized tribes in Arizona, New Mexico, North  Dakota, and South Dakota. We selected the tribes based on several  considerations such as reservation and land size, types of tribal court  structures, and number of Indian country criminal matters referred to the  USAO. Given the breadth of public safety and justice issues underlying the  requests for this work as well as the recently enacted TLOA, we focused  on criminal rather than civil law matters within the tribes selected for  review. While the results of these interviews cannot be generalized to  reflect the views of all federally recognized tribes across the United States,  the information obtained provided us with useful information on the  perspectives of various tribes about the challenges they face in  adjudicating criminal matters. Additionally, we reviewed existing law,  including the recently enacted TLOA, to identify federal efforts to help  support tribes\u2019 efforts to adjudicate criminal matters in Indian country. We  also interviewed officials and obtained documents from the BIA and  various DOJ components such as the FBI, the Executive Office of U.S.  Attorneys, select district USAOs, and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to  obtain information about their efforts to implement TLOA provisions and  other initiatives that address the challenges facing tribes in administering  justice in Indian country.", "To assess the extent to which DOI and DOJ collaborate with each other to  support tribal justice systems, we identified practices that our previous  work indicated can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal  agencies. In this report, we primarily focused on tribal courts and, to  some extent, tribal detention programs. We compared the two agencies\u2019  efforts to share information on their tribal justice programs to select  criteria in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government as  well as select criteria on effective interagency collaboration. We also  analyzed DOI and DOJ documents\u2014such as tribal consultation and  coordination plans\u2014that describe the two agencies\u2019 efforts to consult and  coordinate with each other on public safety and justice issues. Further, we  interviewed officials from DOI and DOJ components including DOI\u2019s  Office of Justice Services and DOJ\u2019s Office of Tribal Justice and Office of  Justice Programs (OJP) to determine the extent to which they had (1)  implemented the practices we identified for effective interagency  collaboration, and (2) identified and shared information that could be  beneficial in addressing public safety and justice in Indian country.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through  February 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example, DOJ estimated that across the United States,  the annual average violent crime rate among American Indians was twice  as high as that of African Americans, and 2-\u00bd times as high as that of  whites, and 4-\u00bd times as high as that of Asians. Also, domestic and sexual  violence against American Indian women is among the most critical public  safety challenges in Indian country, where, in some tribal communities,  according to a study commissioned by DOJ, American Indian women face  murder rates that are more than 10 times the national average. Oftentimes,  alcohol and drug use play a significant role in violent crimes in Indian  country. According to DOJ, American Indian victims reported alcohol use  by 62 percent of offenders compared to 42 percent for all races.", "Tribal or BIA law enforcement officers are often among the first  responders to crimes on Indian reservations; however, law enforcement  resources are scarce. BIA estimates that there are less than 3,000 tribal  and BIA law enforcement officers to patrol more than 56 million acres of  Indian country. According to a DOJ study, the ratio of law enforcement  officers to residents in Indian country is far less than in non-tribal areas. In  the study, researchers estimated that there are fewer than 2 officers per  1,000 residents in Indian country compared to a range of 3.9 to 6.6 officers  per 1,000 residents in non-tribal areas such as Detroit, Michigan and  Washington, D.C. The challenge of limited law enforcement resources is  exacerbated by the geographic isolation or vast size of many reservations.  In some instances officers may need to travel hundreds of miles to reach a  crime scene. For example, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South  Dakota has about 88 sworn tribal officers to serve 47,000 residents across  3,466 square miles, which equates to a ratio of 1 officer per 39 square miles  of land, according to BIA.", "In total there are 565 federally recognized tribes; each has unique public  safety challenges based on different cultures, economic conditions, and  geographic location, among other factors. These factors make it  challenging to implement a uniform solution to address the public safety  challenges confronting Indian country. Nonetheless, tribal justice systems  are considered to be the most appropriate institutions for maintaining law  and order in Indian country. Generally, tribal courts have adopted federal  and state court models; however, tribal courts also strive to maintain  traditional systems of adjudication such as peacemaking or sentencing  circles.", "Law enforcement, courts, and detention/correction programs are key  components of the tribal justice system that is intended to protect tribal  communities; however, each part of the system faces varied challenges in  Indian country. Shortcomings and successes in one area may exacerbate  problems in another area. For example, a law enforcement initiative  designed to increase police presence on a reservation could result in  increased arrests, thereby overwhelming a tribal court\u2019s caseload or an  overcrowded detention facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal, State, and Tribal Jurisdiction over Crimes Committed in Indian Country", "paragraphs": ["The exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian country depends on several  factors, including the nature of the crime, the status of the alleged offender  and victim\u2014that is, whether they are Indian or not\u2014and whether  jurisdiction has been conferred on a particular entity by, for example,  federal treaty or statute. As a general principle, the federal government  recognizes Indian tribes as \u201cdistinct, independent political communities\u201d  that possess powers of self-government to regulate their \u201cinternal and  social relations,\u201d which includes enacting substantive law over internal  matters and enforcing that law in their own forums. The federal  government, however, has plenary and exclusive authority to regulate or  modify the powers of self-government that tribes otherwise possess, and  has exercised this authority to establish an intricate web of jurisdiction  over crime in Indian country. The General Crimes Act, the Major Crimes  Act, and Public Law 280, which are broadly summarized in table 1, are the  three federal laws central to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in Indian  country. These laws as well as provisions of the Indian Civil Rights Act  related to tribal prosecutions are discussed more fully in appendix II.", "The exercise of criminal jurisdiction by state governments in Indian  country is generally limited to two instances, both predicated on the  offense occurring within the borders of the state\u2014where both the alleged  offender and victim are non-Indian, or where a federal statute confers, or  authorizes, a state to assume criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian  country. Otherwise, only the federal and tribal governments have  jurisdiction. Where both parties to the crime are Indian, the tribe generally  has exclusive jurisdiction for misdemeanor-level offenses, but its  jurisdiction runs concurrent with the federal government for felony-level  offenses. Where the alleged offender is Indian but the victim is non-Indian,  tribal and federal jurisdiction is generally concurrent. Finally, federal  jurisdiction is exclusive where the alleged offender is non-Indian and the  victim is Indian.

To that end, BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services  manages law enforcement, detention, and tribal court programs.  Specifically, within BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services, the Division of Law  Enforcement supports 191 tribal law enforcement agencies and the  Division of Corrections supports 91 tribal detention programs. About 90  BIA special agents are responsible for investigating crimes that involve  violations of federal and tribal law that are committed in Indian country  including crimes such as murder, manslaughter, child sexual abuse,  burglary, and production, sale, or distribution of illegal drugs, among other  criminal offenses. Following completion of an investigation, BIA special  agents will refer the investigation to the USAO for prosecution.", "BIA reported that it distributed approximately $260 million of its fiscal  year 2010 appropriation among tribal law enforcement and detention  programs. Additionally, BIA reported that it funded maintenance and  repair projects at four tribal detention centers totaling $6.5 million from  amounts appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Within BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services, the  Division of Tribal Justice Support for Courts works with tribes to establish  and maintain tribal judicial systems.

Currently, the FBI  dedicates more than 100 FBI special agents from approximately 16  field offices to investigate cases on over 200 reservations, nationwide.  According to the FBI, its role varies from reservation to reservation,  but generally the agency investigates crimes such as murder, child  sexual abuse, violent assaults, and drug trafficking, among other  criminal offenses. FBI officials explained that approximately 75  percent of the crimes it investigates in Indian country include death  investigations, physical and sexual abuse of a child, and violent felony  assaults such as domestic violence and rape. Similar to BIA criminal  investigators, FBI special agents refer criminal investigations to the  USAO for prosecution; however, FBI officials explained that FBI  agents may elect not to refer investigations that, pursuant to  supervisory review, lack sufficient evidence of a federal crime or  sufficient evidence for prosecution.", "Under the direction of the Attorney General, the USAO may prosecute  crimes in Indian country where federal jurisdiction exists.

Various ongoing and planned  federal efforts exist to help tribes effectively adjudicate crimes within their  jurisdiction. For example, TLOA, which was enacted in July 2010, attempts  to clarify roles and responsibilities, increase coordination and  communication, and empower tribes with the authorities necessary to  reduce the prevalence of crime in Indian country."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tribes Often Rely on the Federal Government to Prosecute Crime in Indian Country because of Limited Sentencing Authority, Tribal Jurisdiction, and Resources", "paragraphs": ["Tribal courts only have jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by  Indian offenders in Indian country, and their ability to effectively promote  public safety and justice is curtailed by their limited sentencing authority  and jurisdiction. As a result, even where tribal jurisdiction exists, tribes  will often rely on the federal government to investigate and prosecute  more serious offenses, such as homicide and felony-level assault, because  a successful federal prosecution could result in a lengthier sentence and  better ensure justice for victims of crime in Indian country. First, federal  law limits the general sentencing authority of tribal courts to a maximum  term of imprisonment not to exceed 1 year per offense. Officials from 6  of the 12 tribes we visited told us that the 1-year limit on prison sentences  did not serve as an effective deterrent against criminal activity and may  have contributed to the high levels of crime and repeat offenders in Indian  country. Second, tribes do not have any jurisdiction to prosecute non- Indian criminal offenders in Indian country including those who commit  crimes of domestic violence, assault, and murder. Therefore, tribes must  rely on the USAO to prosecute non-Indian offenders. For example, in  instances where a non-Indian abuses an Indian spouse, the tribe does not  have the jurisdiction to prosecute the offender, and unless the USAO  prosecutes the case, the non-Indian offender will not be prosecuted for the  domestic violence offense.", "The rate at which non-Indians commit crime on the reservations we visited  is unclear as the tribes were not able to provide related crime data.  Officials from 6 of the tribes we visited noted that non-Indians may be  more likely to commit crimes in Indian country because they are aware  that tribes lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians and that their  criminal activity may not draw the attention of federal prosecutors. For  example, an official from a South Dakota tribe that we visited told us that  the tribe has experienced problems with MS-13 and Mexican Mafia gangs  who commit illegal activities such as distribution or sale of illegal drugs on  the reservation because, as the official explained, they presume that  federal prosecutors may be more inclined to focus their resources on  higher-volume drug cases. Further, in 2006, the U.S. Attorney for the  Wyoming district testified about a specific instance where a Mexican drug  trafficker devised a business plan to sell methamphetamine at several  Indian reservations in Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota that first  began with developing relationships with American Indian women on  these reservations who would then help to recruit customers. According to  a special agent involved in the case, the drug trafficker established drug  trafficking operations to exploit jurisdictional loopholes believing that he  could operate with impunity. According to a tribal justice official from a  New Mexico pueblo, small-scale drug trafficking operations in Indian  country can have an equally devastating effect on tribes as the effects of  large-scale operations in large cities; therefore, if the federal government  does not respond to small-scale operations in Indian country, the success  of such operations may contribute to the sense of lawlessness in Indian  country.", "When we asked tribes that we visited about how they decide to prosecute  serious crimes over which they do have jurisdiction, 9 of the 12 tribes we  visited noted that they may exercise concurrent jurisdiction and prosecute  those crimes in tribal court. Some officials reported they would rather  preserve their tribe\u2019s limited resources, recognizing that sentences  considered more commensurate with the crime may only result from  federal prosecution. Nonetheless, 5 of the 12 tribes we visited in Arizona,  New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota perceive that the district  USAOs decline to prosecute the majority of Indian country matters that  are referred to them. Officials from the tribes we visited expressed  concerns about the rate at which USAOs decline to prosecute Indian  country crimes and noted that a high number of declinations sends a  signal to crime victims and criminals that there is no justice or  accountability. In December 2010, we reported that approximately 10,000  Indian country criminal matters were referred to USAOs from fiscal year  2005 through 2009. During that period, USAOs declined to prosecute 50  percent of the approximately 9,000 matters that they resolved, while they  had not yet decided whether to prosecute or decline the remaining 1,000  matters. For criminal matters referred to USAOs, \u201cweak or insufficient  admissible evidence\u201d followed by \u201cno federal offense evident\u201d were among  the most frequently cited reasons associated with declinations based on  available data in DOJ\u2019s case management system, Legal Information Office  Network System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Receiving Timely Investigation and Declination Information Could Affect Tribes\u2019 Ability to Prosecute an Offender in Tribal Court", "paragraphs": ["Eight of the twelve tribes we visited stated that they rely on the federal  government to investigate and prosecute serious crimes; however, officials  from the tribes we visited reported that their tribe had experienced  difficulties in obtaining information from federal entities about the status  of criminal investigations.

We examined a declination letter  that was sent to one of the tribes we visited and found that the letter  stated that the matter was being referred back to the tribe for  prosecution in tribal court, but no additional information was provided  about the reason for the declination decision. The Chief Prosecutor  from one of the pueblos we visited noted that it can be difficult for the  USAO to share details about a criminal matter for fear that doing so  may violate confidentiality agreements or impair prosecutors\u2019 ability to  successfully prosecute should the investigation be reopened at a later  date. However, according to tribal officials, it is helpful to understand  the reason for declining to prosecute a criminal matter so that tribal  prosecutors can better determine whether to expend its resources to  prosecute the matter in tribal court.", "Officials from 6 of the 12 tribes we visited told us that when criminal  matters are declined, federal entities generally do not share evidence  and other pertinent information that will allow the tribe to build its  case for prosecution in tribal court.

In  some instances, tribal courts are forced to make difficult decisions such as  (1) foregoing sentencing a convicted offender to prison, (2) releasing  inmates to make room for another offender who is considered to be a  greater danger to the community, and (3) contracting with state or tribal  detention facilities to house convicted offenders, which can be costly.  According to an official from one of the New Mexico pueblos we visited, at  times, when the pueblo has reached its detention capacity\u2014up to three  inmates\u2014the pueblo has had to forego sentencing convicted juvenile or  adult offenders to prison because using a nearby tribal facility to house its  inmates would pose an economic hardship for the pueblo.

Various factors such as a tribe\u2019s approach to  removing judges and intervening on behalf of tribal members during an  ongoing criminal matter could affect internal and external perceptions of a  tribal court\u2019s independence. The manner in which some tribes remove  judges serves as an example of the tribe\u2019s efforts to foster and maintain  judicial independence. For example, at 11 of the 12 tribes we visited, a  tribal judge can only be removed from office for cause following a  majority vote by the Tribal Council. In another instance, the Chief Judge at  one of the tribes we visited explained that tribal members will often  approach the Tribal Council to intervene when members are not satisfied  with the tribal court\u2019s decision. The Tribal Council subsequently issued  several reminders to tribal members that unsatisfied parties to a criminal  matter can appeal the trial court\u2019s decisions in the tribe\u2019s appellate court.  Decisions of this tribe\u2019s appellate court; however, are final and not subject  to review by the Tribal Council, thereby upholding and preserving the  decisions and independence of the tribal court.

For example, according to officials at  one of the tribes we visited, the constitution was amended in 2008 to  articulate the independence of the tribal court from the legislative and  executive branches of the tribal government. However, according to the  officials from this tribe, Tribal Council members continue to approach  criminal court judges to inquire about the status of ongoing cases and  Tribal Council members have intervened on behalf of tribal members to  discuss reversing the court\u2019s decisions on certain criminal matters. Such  actions potentially add to the perception that the court is not autonomous  and is subject to the rule of the executive or legislative branch, which, in  turn can threaten the integrity of the tribal judiciary and create the  perception of unfairness. Figure 3 shows a sign at a tribal court designed  to serve as a measure to prevent people from engaging in ex parte  communications.", "Additionally, the manner in which tribal governments distribute federal  funding to tribal courts may limit courts\u2019 control of their budgets.  According to a BIA official and judges from one of the tribes we visited,  the placement of the tribal court within the tribe\u2019s overall budget  structure\u2014that is, not separate from other tribal programs that BIA  funds\u2014could contribute to the perception that the tribal court has little to  no autonomy and separation from other tribal programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Tribes Reported Various Resource Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the 12 tribes we visited told us they face various resource  limitations resulting in reliance on federal funding, staffing shortages, and  limited capacity to conduct jury trials.", "Tribes We Visited Reported They Rely on Federal Funding to  Operate Tribal Courts Regardless of Their Size or Economic  Condition. We found that all of the 12 tribes we visited rely fully or  partially on federal funding to operate their court systems regardless  of the size of the population the tribal court serves, its geographic  location, or economic conditions. For example, one of the tribes we  visited relies on federal funding for aspects of its court system even  though federal funding generally accounts for less than 10 percent of  the court system\u2019s total budget, according to a senior tribal court  official. This official explained that federal funding is barely sufficient  to pay salaries for positions such as court clerks. Generally, of the 12  tribes we visited, the tribal government provided partial funding to 10  of the tribal courts; the remaining 2 were solely funded by federal  funding. For further information about the funding levels for each of  the 12 tribes we visited, see appendix III.", "Further, officials at 11 of the 12 tribes we visited noted that their tribal  courts\u2019 budgets are inadequate to properly carry out the duties of the  court; therefore, the tribes often have to make tradeoffs, which may  include not hiring key staff such as probation officers or providing key  services such as alcohol treatment programs. According to BIA,  historically, federal funding for tribal courts has been less than what  tribes deemed necessary to meet the needs of their judicial systems.  While tribal courts we visited collect a range of fees and fines, which  can be an additional source of operating revenue, 6 of the 12 tribes  noted that the fees and fines the court collects are to be returned to  the tribal government\u2019s general fund rather than retained for use by the  tribal court. Where possible, to help fill the courts\u2019 budget shortfalls,  officials at 3 of the 12 tribes we visited told us that they have sought  funding from other sources such as state grants or partnered with  other tribal programs to provide treatment services for parties  appearing before their courts.", "According to Tribes We Visited, Lack of Funding Affects Tribal  Courts\u2019 Ability to Maintain Adequate Staffing Levels and  Provide Training to Court Personnel. Officials at 7 of the 12 tribes  we visited told us that their tribal courts are understaffed and that  funding is often insufficient to employ personnel in key positions such  as public defenders, prosecutors, and probation officers, among other  positions. Additionally, officials at three of the New Mexico pueblos  we visited told us that law enforcement officers also served as  prosecutors despite not being trained in the practice of law and not  having sufficient training to serve as prosecutors. The Chief Judges at  two of the New Mexico pueblos told us that the pueblos do not have  any other alternatives due to the lack of funding. For further  information about the staffing levels at each of the 12 tribes we visited,  see appendix III.", "Tribal justice officials also stated that their tribal courts face various  challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified judicial personnel  including: (1) inability to pay competitive salaries, (2) housing  shortages on the reservation, and (3) rural and remote geographic  location of the reservation, among other things. For example, a tribal  justice official from one of the South Dakota tribes we visited noted  that the tribe is often forced to go outside its member population to  hire judges and attorneys because tribal members often lack education  beyond the eighth grade; however, the tribe often faces difficulties in  paying competitive salaries to hire legally trained non-Indians who  often command salaries that are higher than the tribe can afford.  Additionally, tribal justice officials noted that while some tribal  members do pursue higher education, they do not often always return  to work in tribal communities, thereby creating a shortage in available  talent to draw from within the tribe\u2019s community. Further, officials  from two of the tribes we visited noted that they may not be able to  attract qualified applicants because of the rural location. Even if tribes  overcome recruitment challenges, tribal justice officials noted that  they may also face difficulties in retaining personnel\u2014particularly,  non-Indians\u2014because these candidates\u2019 marketability often increases  after gaining experience in Indian country and they are able to pursue  opportunities that meet their compensation and quality-of-life needs  such as higher salaries and improved housing.", "Four of the twelve tribes we visited noted that the courts often use  DOJ grant funds to pay salaries for various positions without the  benefit of a sustainable funding source once the grant funds expire.  For example, one of the South Dakota tribes we visited used grant  funds to hire a compliance officer, probation officer, and process  server to focus exclusively on domestic violence cases, which were  occurring at a high rate on the reservation. Officials explained that  they saw a decrease in reported cases of domestic violence during this  time; however, once the grant funds expired, they were no longer able  to maintain these positions and perceived an increase in domestic  violence cases.", "Additionally, lack of funding hinders tribes\u2019 abilities to provide  personnel with training opportunities to obtain new or enhance  existing skills. For example, at one of the North Dakota tribes we  visited, court personnel explained that court clerks needed training to  enhance their knowledge of scheduling court proceedings, developing  case and records management systems, and familiarizing themselves  with criminal procedures, among other things. Additionally, because of  the increases in the number of cases involving illegal drugs, one of the  judges we met with also expressed a need for training to effectively  manage criminal proceedings that involve the use of  methamphetamines. In particular, 8 of the 12 tribes we visited noted  that they face difficulties in acquiring funds to register personnel for  training as well as to pay for related expenses such as mileage  reimbursement or other transportation costs, lodging, and per diem.  The Chief Judge from one of the tribes we visited noted that the tribe  has been able to acquire scholarships from various training providers  to help absorb full or partial costs for certain training. Further, training  providers such as the National Judicial College have begun to provide  web-based training which, according to officials, is more cost-effective.", "Tribes We Visited Reported Having Limited Capacity to  Conduct Jury Trials. Upon request, any defendant in tribal court  accused of an offense punishable by imprisonment is entitled to a trial  by jury of not less than six persons. However, officials from 7 of the  12 tribes we visited reported that their tribal courts have limited  capacity to conduct jury trials due to limited courtroom space,  funding, and transportation. For example, the courtroom for one of the  New Mexico pueblos that we visited does not have adequate space to  seat a six-person jury and, according to officials, there is not another  facility that can be used to set up a jury box. Additionally, tribal  officials at 2 of the 12 tribes we visited stated that their courts lack  funding to pay tribal members a per diem for jury duty. Additionally,  potential jurors\u2019 lack of access to personal or public transportation can  hinder the courts\u2019 ability to seat a jury. For example, officials from two  of the Arizona tribes we visited explained that there is no public  transportation on the reservations, and consequently it is difficult for  tribal members without access to personal transportation to travel to  court."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Multiple Federal Efforts Exist to Help Address Some of the Challenges That Tribes Face in Adjudicating Criminal Matters", "paragraphs": ["Various federal efforts exist that could help to address some of the  challenges that tribes face in effectively adjudicating crime in Indian  country. For example, TLOA: (1) authorizes tribal courts to impose a term  of imprisonment on certain convicted defendant in excess of 1 year; (2)  authorizes and encourages USAOs to appoint Special Assistant U.S.  Attorneys (SAUSA), including the appointment of tribal prosecutors to  assist in prosecuting federal offenses committed in Indian country; (3)  requires that federal entities coordinate with appropriate tribal law  enforcement and justice officials on the status of criminal investigations  terminated without referral or declined prosecution; and (4) requires  BOP to establish a pilot program to house, in federal prison, Indian  offenders convicted of a violent crime in tribal court and sentenced to 2 or  more years imprisonment. Additionally, to help address issues regarding  judicial independence, BIA has ongoing and planned training to help  increase tribes\u2019 awareness about the significance of judicial independence.  Many of these initiatives directly resulted from the enactment of TLOA in  July 2010; and at this time, these initiatives are in the early stages of  implementation. As a result, it is too early to tell the extent to which these  initiatives are helping to address the challenges that tribes face in  effectively adjudicating crime in Indian country."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Efforts Are Underway to Assist Tribes in Prosecuting Crime in Indian Country and Afford Tribal Courts Enhanced Sentencing Authority", "paragraphs": ["Various federal efforts are underway that provide additional resources to  assist tribes in the investigation and prosecution of crime in Indian  country including (1) additional federal prosecutors, (2) authorizing tribal  courts to impose longer prison sentences on certain convicted defendants,  (3) mandating changes to the program that authorizes BIA to enter into  agreements to aid in law enforcement in Indian country, and (4) affording  tribal prosecutors opportunities to become Special Assistant U.S.  Attorneys to assist in prosecuting federal offenses committed in Indian  country. First, to help address the high levels of violent crime in Indian  country, in May 2010, DOJ announced the addition of 30 Assistant U.S.  Attorneys (AUSA) to serve as tribal liaisons in 21 USAO district offices  that contain Indian country including the four states that we visited as part  of our work\u2014Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  According to DOJ, these additional resources will help the department  work with its tribal law enforcement partners to improve public safety in  Indian country. DOJ also allocated 3 additional AUSAs to help support its  Community Prosecution Pilot Project which it launched at two of the  tribes we visited\u2014the portion of Navajo Nation within New Mexico and  the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Under this pilot project, the  AUSAs will be assigned to work at their designated reservation on a  regular basis and will work in collaboration with the tribe to develop  strategies that are tailored to meet the public safety challenges facing the  tribe.", "Second, TLOA authorizes tribal courts to imprison convicted offenders for  up to a maximum of 3 years if the defendant has been previously convicted  of the same or a comparable crime in any jurisdiction (including tribal)  within the United States or is being prosecuted for an offense comparable  to an offense that would be punishable by more than 1 year if prosecuted  in state or federal court. To impose an enhanced sentence, the defendant  must be afforded the right to effective assistance of counsel and, if  indigent, the assistance of a licensed attorney at the tribe\u2019s expense; a  licensed judge with sufficient legal training must preside over the  proceeding; prior to charging the defendant, the tribal government  criminal laws and rules of evidence and criminal procedure must be made  publicly available; and the tribal court must maintain a record of the  criminal proceedings. Generally, tribal justice officials from 9 of the 12  the tribes we visited stated that they welcome the new sentencing  authority, but officials from 2 of the tribes noted that they would likely use  the new authority on a case-by-case basis because they lacked the  infrastructure to fully meet the requisite conditions. For example, the  Chief Judge from one of the New Mexico pueblos we visited noted that  rather than hiring a full-time public defender, the pueblo is considering  hiring an attorney on contract to be used on a case-by-case basis when the  enhanced sentencing authority may be exercised.", "Third, TLOA mandates changes to the Special Law Enforcement  Commission (SLEC) program which authorizes BIA to enter into  agreements for the use of personnel or facilities of federal, tribal, state, or  other government agencies to aid in the enforcement of federal or, with  the tribe\u2019s consent, tribal law in Indian country. Specifically, within 180  days of enactment, the Secretary of the Interior shall develop a plan to  enhance the certification and provision of special law enforcement  commissions to tribal law enforcement officials, among others, that  includes regional training sessions held at least biannually in Indian  country to educate and certify candidates for the SLEC. The Secretary of  the Interior, in consultation with tribes and tribal law enforcement  agencies, must also develop minimum requirements to be included in  SLEC agreements. Under the SLEC program, administered by the BIA,  tribal police may be deputized as federal law enforcement officers, which  affords them the authorities and protections available to federal law  enforcement officers. According to BIA, given the potential difficulties  arresting officers face in determining whether a victim or offender is an  Indian or not or whether the alleged crime has occurred in Indian country  (for purposes of determining jurisdiction at the time of arrest) a tribal  officer deputized to enforce federal law is not charged with determining  the appropriate jurisdiction for filing charges; rather this is to be  determined by the prosecutor or court to which the arresting officer  delivers the offender.", "Lastly, among other provisions, TLOA explicitly authorizes and  encourages the appointment of qualified attorneys, including tribal  prosecutors, as Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys (SAUSA) to assist in the  prosecution of federal offenses and administration of justice in Indian  country. If appointed as a SAUSA, a tribal prosecutor may pursue in  federal court an Indian country criminal matter with federal jurisdiction  that, if successful, could result in the convicted defendant receiving a  sentence greater than if the matter had been prosecuted in tribal court.  According to the Associate Attorney General, many tribal prosecutors  have valuable experience and expertise that DOJ can draw on to prosecute  crime and enforce federal criminal law in Indian country. Further, tribal  prosecutors at 4 of the 12 tribes we visited are in varying stages of  obtaining SAUSA credentials. The Chief Prosecutor at a New Mexico  pueblo who is in the process of obtaining a SAUSA credential cited various  benefits arising from a SAUSA appointment including increased: (1)  prosecution of criminal cases that involve domestic violence and child  sexual abuse; (2) prosecution of misdemeanor-level offenses committed  by non-Indians against Indians that occur in Indian country; (3) ability to  directly present criminal investigations to the district USAO rather than  solely relying on BIA criminal investigators to do so; and (4) cooperation  from tribal crime victims and witnesses who may be more forthcoming  with someone closely affiliated with the pueblo rather than federal  investigators or prosecutors, thereby helping to facilitate a more  successful investigation and prosecution of a federal crime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investigative and Prosecutorial Coordination Requirements May Improve Timeliness and Adequacy of Information Shared by the Federal Government with Tribes", "paragraphs": ["TLOA provides that federal investigators and prosecutors must coordinate  with tribes to communicate the status of investigations and prosecutions  relating to alleged criminal offenses in Indian country crimes. More  specifically, if a federal entity terminates an investigation, or if a USAO  declines to prosecute or terminates a prosecution of an alleged violation of  federal criminal law in Indian country, they must coordinate with the  appropriate tribal officials regarding the status of the investigation and the  use of evidence relevant to the case in a tribal court with authority over  the crime alleged. Individually and collectively, these requirements could  better enable tribes to prosecute criminal matters in tribal court within  their statute of limitations. Although TLOA does not prescribe how  coordination is to occur between federal entities\u2014such as FBI and BIA  criminal investigators\u2014and tribes, DOJ directed relevant USAOs to work  with tribes to establish protocols for coordinating with tribes. For  example, the USAO for the District of Arizona, in consultation with  Arizona tribes, has established protocols to guide its coordination with  tribes. Specifically, within 30 days of a referral of a criminal investigation  for prosecution, the Arizona district USAO plans to notify the relevant  tribe in writing if the office is declining to prosecute the matter. Officials  from one of the New Mexico pueblos we visited explained that they would  like to have an entrance conference with the USAO for the District of New  Mexico on each criminal investigation that is referred to the USAO for  which the tribe has concurrent jurisdiction and an exit conference to  discuss the USAO reasons for declining to prosecute the crime. Tribal  officials explained that the exit conference could serve to educate the  tribe about what it can do to better prepare an investigation for referral to  the USAO.

DOJ  considers the pilot program to be an important step in addressing violent  offenders and underresourced correctional facilities in Indian country.  BOP\u2019s goal is to reduce future criminal activity of Indian offenders by  providing them with access to a range of programs such as vocational  training and substance abuse treatment programs that are designed to help  offenders successfully reenter their communities following release from  prison. It is unlikely that 5 of the 12 tribes we visited will immediately  begin participating in the pilot because they are not yet positioned to fully  meet the conditions that are required to imprison Indian offenders  convicted in tribal court for two or more years. Additionally tribal officials  expressed concern about placing convicted Indian offenders in federal  prison because tribal members would likely oppose having tribal members  sent to locations that are not in close proximity to the reservation, making  it difficult for family members to visit and ensure the convicted Indian  offender is able to maintain a connection with the tribal community\u2014a  key aspect of tribes\u2019 culture and values. While tribes expressed concern  about the placement of tribal members in federal prison, officials from 2 of  the tribes we visited stated that access to federal programs such as  substance abuse and mental health treatment programs and job training  would be a major benefit that offenders would likely not have access to  while imprisoned in tribal detention facilities. More broadly, TLOA  requires that BIA, in coordination with DOJ and in consultation with tribal  leaders, law enforcement and correctional officers, submit a long-term  plan to address incarceration in Indian country to Congress by July 29,  2011. The long-term plan should also describe proposed activities for  constructing, operating, and maintaining juvenile and adult detention  facilities in Indian country and construction of federal detention facilities  in Indian country, contracting with state and local detention centers upon  the tribe\u2019s approval, and alternatives to incarceration developed in  cooperation with tribal court systems.

For example, DOJ has begun to consult BIA about its future plans to fund  the construction of tribal correctional facilities, which has helped to  resolve past inefficiencies. BIA officials told us that they need to know  which tribes DOJ plans to award grants to construct correctional facilities  at least 2 years in advance so that they can plan their budget and  operational plans accordingly in order to fulfill their obligation to staff,  operate, and maintain detention facilities. According to BIA, there have  been instances where they were unaware of DOJ\u2019s plans to award grant  funds to tribes to construct tribal detention facilities, which could result in  new facilities remaining vacant until BIA is able to secure funding to  operate the facility.", "DOJ has implemented a process whereby when tribes apply for DOJ grants  to construct correctional facilities, DOJ consults BIA about each  applicant\u2019s needs as BIA typically has firsthand knowledge about tribes\u2019  needs for a correctional facility and whether the tribe has the  infrastructure to support a correctional facility, among other things. BIA  then prioritizes the list of applicants based on its knowledge of the  detention needs of the tribes. DOJ officials noted that the decision about  which tribes to award grants to rests solely with them; however, they do  weigh BIA\u2019s input about the tribes\u2019 needs for and capacity to utilize a  correctional facility when making grant award decisions. To help BIA  anticipate future operations and maintenance costs for new tribal  correctional facilities, each year DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)  provides BIA with a list of planned correctional facilities that includes the  site location, size, and completion date. BIA officials noted that this level  of coordination with DOJ is an improvement over past years as it helps to  facilitate planning and ensure they are prepared to assume responsibility  to staff, operate, and maintain tribal detention facilities.", "BIA and BJA also serve on a governmentwide coordinating body, the  Planning Alternatives and Correctional Institutions for Indian Country  Advisory Committee, which brings together federal stakeholders who play  a role in planning detention and correctional programs and facilities in  Indian country. The advisory committee is responsible for developing  strategic approaches to plan the training and technical assistance that BJA  provides to tribes that receive grant funding to construct or renovate  juvenile and adult correctional facilities. Specifically, among other things,  the agencies work together to plan the training and technical assistance to  be delivered to tribes on issues such as alternatives to help control and  prevent jail overcrowding, controlling costs to develop and operate  detention facilities, developing alternatives to incarceration, and  implementing substance abuse and mental health treatment programs at  correctional facilities.

To that end, in 2009, DOI, through BIA, and DOJ  established both department level and program level coordinating bodies  to increase communication and information exchange between the two  agencies. At the department level, the Deputy Attorney General and the  Deputy Secretary of the Interior jointly chair a working group that meets  quarterly to facilitate governmentwide policymaking on tribal justice  issues and coordinate agency activities on a range of tribal justice issues  that are designed to help BIA and DOJ achieve their individual and shared  goal of improving public safety in Indian country. For example, the  working group is to oversee BIA and DOJ\u2019s efforts to assess tribal  correctional and tribal court systems\u2019 needs and to develop strategies such  as prisoner reentry programs in Indian country. In addition, the working  group will oversee the implementation of various provisions included in  TLOA such as assessing the effectiveness of the enhanced sentencing  authority that tribal courts may exercise.", "At the program level, in 2009, BIA and DOJ established task forces to  address key issues including tribal judicial systems and tribal detention,  among other issues.

BIA officials noted that  DOJ could benefit from BIA\u2019s insights and firsthand knowledge about  the needs of tribal courts including those tribal courts that BIA has  identified as having the greatest need for additional funding.", "Further, BIA officials noted that they were unaware of the training and  technical assistance that DOJ provides to tribal courts and noted that  there could be potential unnecessary duplication with the training and  technical assistance that both agencies provide as well as inefficient  use of scarce resources. For example, according to BIA, there was an  instance where DOJ and BIA provided funding to a tribe to purchase  the hardware and software for a case management system, but neither  DOJ nor BIA consulted each other about the purchase. Ultimately, the  tribe did not have any funds to purchase software training and, as a  result never used the system.

We selected the tribes based on several  considerations. First, we identified the U.S. Attorney district offices that  received the largest volume of Indian country criminal matters from fiscal  years 2004 through 2008, the five most recent years of available data at the  time we conducted our selection. We interviewed DOJ officials about the  data-entry process, performed electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness of the data, and reviewed database  documentation to determine that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of our review. Next, we considered a variety of factors including  (1) reservation land size, (2) population, (3) types of tribal court  structures, (4) number and type of courts, and (5) number of full-time  judicial personnel such as judges and prosecutors. The selected tribes  have a range of land and population size, court size, and tribal court  structures such as traditional and modern court systems. We also obtained  documentation on the tribal courts\u2019 operations, caseload, and funding.  Because we are providing the caseload and funding data for informational  purposes only, we did not assess the reliability of the data we obtained  from the tribes.", "Additionally, we obtained the tribe\u2019s perspectives on the federal process to  communicate declination decisions. In light of the public safety and justice  issues underlying the requests for this work and the focus in the Tribal  Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) on criminal matters, we focused on  criminal rather than civil law matters during the course of this review.  While the results of these interviews cannot be generalized to reflect the  views of all federally recognized tribes across the United States, the  information obtained provided us with useful information on the  perspectives of various tribes about the challenges they face in  adjudicating criminal matters. Additionally, we identified federal efforts to  help support tribal efforts to adjudicate criminal matters in Indian country  based on new or amended statutory provisions enacted through TLOA. We  also interviewed cognizant officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  various DOJ components such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the  Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, and select U.S. Attorneys Offices to  obtain information about their efforts to implement TLOA provisions to  help address the challenges facing tribes in administering justice in Indian  country.", "To determine the extent that DOI and DOJ collaborate with each other to  support public safety and justice in tribal communities, we first compared  the agencies\u2019 efforts against criteria in Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government which holds that agencies are to share  information with external stakeholders that can affect the organization\u2019s  ability to achieve its goals. Next, we identified practices that our previous  work indicated can enhance and sustain collaboration among federal  agencies and assessed whether DOI and DOJ\u2019s interagency coordination  efforts reflected consideration of those practices. For purposes of this  report, we define collaboration as any joint activity by two or more  organizations that is intended to produce more public value than could be  produced when the organizations act alone. We use the term  \u201ccollaboration\u201d broadly to include interagency activities that others have  defined as cooperation, coordination, integration, or networking. Eight  practices we identified to enhance and sustain collaboration are as  follows:  (1) define and articulate a common goal;  (2) establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies to achieve that goal;  (3) identify and address needs by leveraging resources;  (4) agree on roles and responsibilities;  (5) establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate  (6) develop mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results;  (7) reinforce agency accountability for collaborative efforts through  agency plans and reports; and  (8) reinforce individual accountability for collaborative efforts through  performance management systems.", "In this report, we focused on two of the eight practices\u2014defining and  articulating a common goal and identifying and addressing needs by  leveraging resources\u2014that we previously identified for enhancing and  maintaining effective collaboration among federal agencies. We were not  able to address the remaining six practices because we found that DOI and  DOJ were in the early stages of implementing these two practices that  serve as the foundation for the remaining practices. For example, because  collaboration activities are in the early stages of development and the  agencies have not yet established joint strategies to achieve the goal of  enhancing the capacity of tribal courts, we did not expect the agencies to  have developed mechanisms to monitor and report on the results of their  collaboration, reinforce accountability by preparing reports, or establish  performance management systems. We selected examples that, in our best  judgment, clearly illustrated and strongly supported the need for  improvement in specific areas where the key practices could be  implemented. We met with officials from DOI and various DOJ  components such as the Office of Tribal Justice and Office of Justice  Programs to discuss the mechanisms they have put in place to enhance  and sustain collaboration between the two agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2009 through  February 2011 in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.

As a general principle, the federal government  recognizes Indian tribes as \u201cdistinct, independent political communities\u201d  with inherent powers of self-government to regulate their \u201cinternal and  social relations,\u201d which includes enacting substantive law over internal  matters and enforcing that law in their own forums. The federal  government, however has plenary and exclusive authority to regulate or  modify the powers of self-government the tribes otherwise possess, and  has exercised this authority to establish an intricate web of jurisdiction  over crime in Indian country.", "Enacted in 1817, the General Crimes Act (also referred to as the Federal  Enclaves Act or Indian Country Crimes Act), as amended, established  federal criminal jurisdiction in Indian country over cases where either the  alleged offender or the victim is Indian. It did not, for example, establish  federal jurisdiction over cases where both parties are Indian and, in effect,  left jurisdiction over cases where both parties are non-Indian to the state.  Enacted in 1885, the Major Crimes Act extended federal criminal  jurisdiction in Indian country to Indians who committed so-called \u201cmajor  crimes,\u201d regardless of the victim\u2019s status. As amended, the Major Crimes  Act provides the federal government with criminal jurisdiction over  Indians charged with felony-level offenses enumerated in the statute. The  tribes retained exclusive jurisdiction over other criminal offenses  (generally, misdemeanor-level) where both parties are Indian.", "State governments, however, may not exercise criminal jurisdiction over  Indians or their property in Indian country absent a \u201cclear and unequivocal  grant of that authority\u201d by the federal treaty or statute. Enacted in 1953,  Public Law 280 represents one example of a \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d grant  of state criminal jurisdiction. As amended, Public Law 280 confers  exclusive criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed in Indian country  to the governments of six states\u2014Alaska, California, Minnesota, Nebraska,  Oregon, and Wisconsin, except as specified by statute, thereby waiving  federal jurisdiction under the General and Major Crimes acts in these  states and subjecting Indians to prosecution in state court. Subsequent   amendments to Public Law 280 and other laws further define state  criminal jurisdiction in Indian country.", "To summarize the foregoing discussion, the exercise of criminal  jurisdiction by state governments in Indian country is generally limited to  two instances, both predicated on the offense occurring within the borders  of the state\u2014where both the alleged offender and victim are non-Indian,  or where a federal treaty or statute confers, or authorizes a state to  assume, criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country. Otherwise,  jurisdiction is distributed between federal and tribal governments. Where  both parties to the crime are Indian, the tribe generally has exclusive  jurisdiction for misdemeanor-level offenses, but its jurisdiction runs  concurrent with the federal government for felony-level offenses. Where  the alleged offender is Indian but the victim is non-Indian, tribal and  federal jurisdiction is generally concurrent. Finally, federal jurisdiction is  exclusive where the alleged offender is non-Indian and the victim is  Indian."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tribal Prosecutions under the Indian Civil Rights Act", "paragraphs": ["When a tribal government exercises its jurisdiction to prosecute an Indian  offender, it must do so in accordance with the Indian Civil Rights Act  (ICRA). Enacted in 1968, ICRA limited the extent to which tribes may  exercise their powers of self-government by imposing conditions on tribal  governments similar to those found in the Bill of Rights to the U.S.  Constitution. For example, the act extended the protections of free  speech, free exercise of religion, and due process and equal protection  under tribal laws. With respect to alleged criminal conduct, tribes are  prohibited from trying a person twice for the same offense (double  jeopardy), compelling an accused to testify against himself or herself in a  criminal case, and imposing excessive fines or inflicting cruel and unusual  punishment. Tribes must also afford a defendant the rights to a speedy  and public trial, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,  to be confronted by witnesses of the prosecution, to have compulsory  process for witnesses in his favor, and to be represented by counsel at his  own expense, among other things.", "ICRA also governs the sentencing authority tribes exercise over convicted  Indian offenders. First, any person accused of an offense punishable by  imprisonment has the right, upon request, to a trial by jury of not less than  six persons. Second, the act limits the maximum sentence a tribe may  impose. Prior to amendments made by the Tribal Law and Order Act  (TLOA) in July 2010, ICRA limited the maximum sentence for any one  offense to a term of 1 year imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both, regardless  of the severity of the alleged offense. The July 2010 amendments,  however, authorize tribal courts to impose sentences in excess of 1 year  imprisonment or $5,000 fine if the tribe affords the defendant certain  additional protections specified in the statute. Specifically, a tribal court  may subject a defendant to a maximum term of imprisonment of 3 years  (or a fine not to exceed $15,000, or both) for any one offense if the  defendant had been previously convicted of the same or a comparable  offense by any jurisdiction in the United States, or the defendant was  prosecuted for an offense comparable to one punishable by more than 1  year of imprisonment if prosecuted by the United States or any of the  states. To exercise this enhanced sentencing authority, the tribe must  afford a criminal defendant the following additional protections: effective  assistance of counsel; if indigent, the assistance of a licensed defense  attorney appointed at the tribe\u2019s expense; a presiding judge with sufficient  legal training and a license to practice law; prior to charging the  defendant, make publicly available the criminal laws and rules of evidence  and criminal procedure of the tribal government; and maintain a record  (audio or otherwise) of the criminal proceeding. Finally, although ICRA  protects alleged offenders from double jeopardy in tribal courts, neither  the federal government nor the tribal government is precluded from  pursuing a prosecution if the other sovereign elects to prosecute the  case.
