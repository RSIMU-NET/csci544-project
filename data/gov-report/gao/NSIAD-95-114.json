To protect proprietary data, we have not disclosed the identities of the business units and have frequently interchanged the business unit labels (A-F) used throughout this report. While the changes at these business units are not projectable to the entire defense industry, they provide some insight into the impact of defense downsizing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress wants a strong defense industrial base and has directed the Secretary of Defense to report annually on the ability of industry to support U.S. national security objectives. The Congress directed the Secretary to consider in the analysis for that report such factors as levels of spending for capital investment and research and development. In June 1993, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Inspector General criticized DOD\u2019s first report as being of limited use in helping congressional leaders make informed judgments because DOD lacked an adequate information system to carry out the assessment.", "Defense industry representatives also criticized that report. One common criticism was that the majority of the report\u2019s data applied to corporations rather than their defense segments. The second DOD report, released in September 1994, also concentrated on the corporate level rather than individual business units. Other studies of the effects of the spending decline have also assessed the impact at the corporate level rather than the individual business unit. Another shortcoming in many of these assessments was that they measured the severity of the decline in defense expenditures only from the peak years of the 1980s and not from other years in the cycle of defense expenditures as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Since the World War II drawdown, defense spending has experienced three peaks associated with the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Reagan administration military buildup. In fiscal year 1989, defense expenditures reached their highest peacetime level since World War II, exceeding defense spending at the peak of the Korean War and almost matching spending during the Vietnam War. Defense expenditures in fiscal year 1989 were $354.1 billion, but had declined to $274.5 billion by fiscal year 1994, a reduction of $79.6 billion or 22 percent. The Clinton administration is projecting defense expenditures of $224.5 billion in fiscal year 2000, which represents a $129.6-billion, or a 37-percent, decline in defense spending since fiscal year 1989. Figure 1 shows the trend in defense expenditures after the end of World War II.", "Although most defense authorities agree that the post-Cold War decline in spending is significant, it is comparable to the Vietnam War drawdown. As shown in table 1, the current decline is only 2 percentage points greater than the Vietnam War drawdown, which was spread over an 8-year period, whereas the post-Cold War drawdown is currently projected over a 10-year period. However, unlike the Vietnam War drawdown, defense contractors view the current decline as permanent, not cyclical.", "Measured against other years, the $260.2 billion in defense spending projected for fiscal year 1995 is about 13 percent greater than the $231 billion expended during fiscal year 1976 and about 4 percent greater than the $251.4 billion expended in fiscal year 1980. Fiscal year 1976 is a significant benchmark because it represents the lowest level in peacetime defense spending since the Korean War. Fiscal year 1980 is significant because it was the year prior to the beginning of the Reagan administration defense buildup. Based on current projections, peacetime defense spending will remain above the fiscal year 1976 level until fiscal year 1998, when spending is projected to decline to $225.1 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decline in Selected Business Unit Sales", "paragraphs": ["According to officials of the six business units we visited, the decline in defense spending since the late 1980s has significantly affected their defense sales.

The projected weighted average decline over the businesses was about 55 percent. Figure 2 shows the actual and projected sales decreases by business unit.", "Peak to latest projected year Although sales declines from the peak years are significant, several of the business units had sales that were actually lower in 1976 and 1980 than their future projections. Table 2 compares the business units\u2019 forecasted sales with their 1976 and 1980 sales. As shown, two of the business units projected their future sales to be higher than their 1976 sales, and three of the business units projected their future sales to be higher than their 1980 sales."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractors Reduce Spending in Response to Sales Declines", "paragraphs": ["Defense contractors have taken and are continuing to take aggressive actions to reduce spending as a result of post-Cold War sales declines.

Through 1993, the units\u2019 workforce reductions ranged from 30 percent to 76 percent. Through the latest projected year, the units\u2019 estimated reductions ranged between 44 percent to 79 percent. Three of the units projected reductions of over 75 percent, while the other three units projected reductions ranging from 44 percent to 57 percent.

Table 3 compares projected employment with the 1976 and 1980 levels.", "The downward employment trend at these six business units is consistent with the findings of other studies on the private sector defense industry workforce. One report, for example, showed that defense-related private employment had declined from about 3.7 million workers in 1987 to about 2.7 million workers in 1993, which represents a 26-percent employment decline over the period. According to that report, the 20 leading defense contractors had experienced an average employment reduction of 22 percent between 1987 and 1993. Other studies have projected a continuing downward trend in defense employment over the next several years. For example, a report prepared by the Logistics Management Institute for the Defense Conversion Commission estimated that private sector defense-related employment would likely decline by about 803,000 jobs, or 27 percent, from 1992 to 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Declines in IR&D/B&P Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the reductions in employment levels, the six business units had made substantial cuts in their IR&D/B&P expenditures.

However, as shown in table 4, two of the business units projected future expenditures for IR&D/B&P to be more than they spent in 1976. Two other business units forecasted their future expenditures to be more than they spent in 1980.", "Several studies showed a correlation between the level of defense expenditures and the amounts contractors spend on IR&D. One study, for example, stated that the level of defense procurement directly affects IR&D activities, which are supported to a large extent by overhead charges in production contracts. The report stated that when large production runs were the rule, many companies willingly invested their own funds in IR&D because they could reasonably expect to recover their investment. Another report predicted that, with fewer defense procurements, IR&D payments would decrease and companies might not be willing to risk conducting their own IR&D.", "To determine whether these reports applied to the business units we visited, we compared the changes in the business units\u2019 spending levels for IR&D/B&P with changes in their sales. For four of the six business units, we found that changes in IR&D/B&P expenditures generally correlated to their sales volume. For illustration purposes, figure 5 compares the trend in one business unit\u2019s sales and its IR&D/B&P expenditures.", "Because of concerns that the quantity and quality of IR&D would decline as budget cuts forced the defense industry to limit overhead costs, the Congress made substantial legislative revisions to the IR&D program in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 to encourage defense contractors to continue IR&D activities. Even with these revisions, defense contractors have continued to cut their IR&D/B&P expenditures, as their defense sales have declined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reductions in Capital Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["The six business units we visited have significantly cut their capital expenditures from their peak spending levels in the 1980s.

When 1976 was used as the base year, three business units projected higher capital expenditures in the future, but when 1980 was used as a base year, one business unit projected higher capital expenditures. Similar to IR&D/B&P expenditures, there is not a consistent trend in capital expenditures. For example, although Company A and Company C projected higher capital expenditures compared to 1976, the companies projected lower capital expenditures when compared to 1980. However, we found that changes in capital expenditures at three of the units correlated to the units\u2019 sales volume.", "Two business units had formal programs to limit future capital expenditures.
