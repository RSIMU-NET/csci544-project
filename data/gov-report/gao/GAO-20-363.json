After decades of producing nuclear  materials for weapons during World War II and the Cold War, operators of  the 586-square-mile campus ceased plutonium production in the late  1980s and began cleaning up the hazardous and radioactive waste that  was left behind. Fifty-four million gallons of this waste is stored in 160  large underground waste storage tanks and must be treated\u2014or  immobilized\u2014before disposal, according to legal requirements and  agreements made with federal and state environmental regulators. The  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the treatment and  disposal of radioactive and hazardous waste created as a byproduct of  producing nuclear weapons and energy research, and DOE\u2019s Office of  Environmental Management (EM) manages most of DOE\u2019s cleanup  activities for legacy defense waste and energy research, including  activities at Hanford. In January 2019, DOE estimated that completing the  cleanup of the Hanford Site would cost between $323 billion and $677  billion and would last for decades.", "In 2000, EM awarded a contract to Bechtel National, Inc.

The WTP,  under construction for nearly 20 years and costing over $11 billion to  date, has faced numerous technical challenges, cost overruns, and  schedule delays. As designed, the WTP is to consist of several facilities,  including a pretreatment facility that separates waste into streams with  high levels and lower levels of radioactivity. (See fig. 1.) In late 2012, EM  stopped work on the pretreatment facility and slowed work on other parts  of the WTP until the technical challenges could be resolved. While  working to resolve technical challenges within the pretreatment and other  WTP facilities, EM began exploring options to bypass the pretreatment  facility if necessary because EM is required by an amended consent  decree with the State of Washington to begin treating tank waste by  2023.

In May 2014, EM asked BNI to submit a plan for resolving the  challenges and resuming construction of the pretreatment facility. EM  ultimately identified eight key categories of technical challenges to be  resolved before resuming construction of the pretreatment facility (see  table 1 for a list of the eight categories, and see app. III for a more  detailed description of each category of technical challenges). The  majority of these categories involved portions of the pretreatment facility  intended to manage the HLW. For example, one category EM identified  involves preventing hydrogen from building up in the facilities\u2019 piping and  vessels, which could cause an explosion. Another category involves  preventing corrosive waste from eroding treatment equipment, which  could cause a leak of radioactive materials.", "In June 2014, BNI formed eight teams to address each category of  technical challenges. For example, to address the technical challenges  associated with mixing the waste in the pretreatment facility using a  technology known as pulse-jet mixing, the design completion team  developed a plan to standardize and test a new design to address pulse- jet mixing challenges. Similarly, to address concerns about the potential  weaknesses in equipment and piping located in rooms inaccessible to  humans once operations begin (known as black cells), EM formed a black  cell analysis team. BNI submitted interim updates to EM on the proposed  resolution of specific challenges as BNI addressed them. For example, in  December 2017, BNI informed EM of its resolution of the challenges  related to facility ventilation. Similarly, in September 2018, BNI informed  EM of its resolution of the challenges related to the black cells. BNI sent  similar correspondence on the other six categories of technical  challenges to EM throughout 2019. According to EM officials, EM and its  contractors provided DNFSB documentation and briefings on the  resolution of the technical challenges.", "In June 2019, BNI informed EM that it considered all eight categories of  technical challenges to be resolved. In July 2019, EM subsequently  informed BNI that it agreed with BNI\u2019s conclusions that the technical  challenges were resolved. According to ORP officials, \u201cresolved\u201d means  that all the required studies, calculations, and testing have been  completed and demonstrated to independent experts and EM that (1) the  issue is fully understood so that no further research is needed and (2) a  solution is ready for detailed design."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Has Not Yet Designed or Engineered the Solutions, and the DNFSB Does Not Consider the Technical Challenges to Be Resolved", "paragraphs": ["Although EM and BNI consider the technical challenges associated with  the pretreatment facility to be resolved, EM and BNI have not yet  designed or engineered the solutions. BNI acknowledged early in the  process that resolution of the technical challenges would involve not only  a conceptual solution, but also subsequent design, engineering, and, in  some cases, testing of the solutions before construction could resume on  the pretreatment facility. For example, in its June 2014 plan for  addressing the challenges, BNI noted that prior to making a decision to  proceed with construction of the facility, it would need to conduct a  number of additional steps, including updating the designs of the  pretreatment facility and assessing the nuclear safety basis and the  contract implications for the updated designs. In addition, ORP officials  told us that proposed revisions to the pretreatment facility would require  negotiation with Ecology. As of February 2020, EM and BNI had not yet  begun developing these required designs and engineering changes and  have no plans to do so until a decision is made on the future of the  facility. According to EM officials, ORP\u2019s current priorities are to begin  DFLAW operations and to conduct an analysis of alternatives related to  the treatment of the HLW.", "These next steps could involve significant work and potential rework to  the facility. According to EM officials, resolving the technical challenges  likely will require BNI to change its designs for the pretreatment facility  and conduct significant rework in portions of the facility that have been  completed. ORP officials said that they expect this design work to be  significant and do not expect it to be complete enough to proceed with the  construction of the facility until at least 2022, depending on the availability  of funding to support the design work. BNI\u2019s plan going forward includes a  number of steps related to updating the pretreatment facility designs. As a  result of this significant engineering work still ahead, as we reported in  May 2015, EM likely will have to conduct rework of the existing facility  (which is 40 percent built), leading to further cost increases and schedule  delays. For example, BNI will need to redesign any existing components  and systems that have become obsolete since EM halted construction or  that need to be reworked to accommodate the technical solutions.", "In addition, DNFSB officials have begun reviewing EM\u2019s proposed  solutions, but they said that they do not consider the technical challenges  to be resolved. Although EM does not require DNFSB approval to restart  construction of the pretreatment facility, ORP officials said that they  consider the next step in the process to be DNFSB review of their  solutions. DNFSB officials, on the other hand, said that the process used  to review issues is as follows: (1) DNFSB raises a concern; (2) EM comes  up with a conceptual solution, presents it to DNFSB, and receives  feedback; and (3) EM then comes up with a design solution, presents it to  the DNFSB, and receives feedback. According to DNFSB officials,  because they have not been able to review the updated engineering and  design plans, they are not in a position to approve the proposed solution.  Since 2012, DNFSB has been reviewing EM\u2019s proposed technical  solutions as part of its role to provide independent advice and  recommendations to DOE regarding the protection of public health and  safety at DOE facilities.", "As of December 2019, DNFSB had officially commented on one of EM\u2019s  proposed solutions\u2014related to technical challenges surrounding the  pulse-jet mixers\u2014and noted simply that EM\u2019s and BNI\u2019s work  \u201cstrengthens the technical foundation\u201d for using the mixers and that  DNFSB would \u201ccontinue to follow the design process.\u201d With regard to  the remaining challenges, DNFSB officials said that for some, additional  deficiencies needed to be addressed. For others, DNFSB officials said  they were reviewing the details of EM\u2019s proposed solution or needed  additional information from EM.

Settled sludge  layers will rise in temperature, increasing the hydrogen generation rate.  Up to 16 of the 177 underground tanks at Hanford contain large-size plutonium particles that could  settle onto internal surfaces of the pulse-jet mixer vessels, which use compressed air to mix the  waste. If the pulse-jet mixers could not then resuspend settled particles, an uncontrolled nuclear  chain reaction known as a criticality accident could occur.  In the Pretreatment facility and High-Level Waste (HLW) facility, the accumulation of hydrogen gas  in piping and small vessels can occur after the loss of off-site power or after an interruption of a  transfer of waste due to operator error and during normal operation in isolated pipe sections,  potentially causing an explosion.   Accumulating solids in pulse-jet mixing vessels could cause excessive air to be discharged in the  vessels. This discharge could cause premature erosion of vessel surface bottoms, all of which are  located in nonmaintanable areas called black cells. In addition, pulse-jet mixing vessels may need  structural modifications to account for abnormal environmental conditions, such as seismic events.   Because of uncertainties in waste feed characteristics, the vessel and piping design in the  Pretreatment facility and HLW facility may require revisions to account for the amount of wear the  equipment will need to withstand. Excessive wear could damage plant equipment and result in  interruption of operations or leakage of material from vessels and piping.  The potential incorporation of a Standards High Solids Vessel into Pretreatment requires a detailed  study to determine the feasibility and optimization of this design change. An additional opportunity  is created to revisit the capability to perform In service inspections in order to underpin resolution of  erosion/corrosion questions. The Project has not established an in-service inspection program.  Once WTP operations begin, equipment in black cells within the Pretreatment facility and HLW  facility must last for the WTP\u2019s 40-year expected design life without maintenance because  significant failures of components installed in the black cells could impact the throughput and  mission duration of the WTP. Potential weaknesses in equipment and piping located within black  cells must be identified before WTP operations begin to ensure that timely repairs can be  conducted, should failure of these components occur.  Ventilation systems in the Pretreatment facility, HLW facility, and Low-Activity Waste facility must  be able to contain radioactive material that could be released from primary confinement. The  structural integrity of some internal vessel components in these facilities could be compromised if  seismic or other events beyond the design basis occur. The ventilation system must survive a  release of radioactive material without shutdown, plugging, or blowing out filters to continue to  provide confinement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: High-Level Waste (HLW) Alternatives Being Analyzed by the Office of River Protection", "paragraphs": ["Appendix IV: High-Level Waste (HLW)  Alternatives Being Analyzed by the Office of  River Protection Description  HLW is received, characterized, and pretreated in HLW Feed Preparation Facility;  contaminated liquids produced in the process are concentrated in a new HLW Effluent  Management.
