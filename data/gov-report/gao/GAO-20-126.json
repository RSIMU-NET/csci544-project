From June 2017 to July 2019, the number of authorizations granted through FedRAMP by the 24 agencies increased from 390 to 926, a 137 percent increase. However, 15 agencies reported that they did not always use the program for authorizing cloud services. For example, one agency reported that it used 90 cloud services that were not authorized through FedRAMP and the other 14 agencies reported using a total of 157 cloud services that were not authorized through the program. In addition, 31 of 47 cloud service providers reported that during fiscal year 2017, agencies used providers' cloud services that had not been authorized through FedRAMP. Although the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required agencies to use the program, it did not effectively monitor agencies' compliance with this requirement. Consequently, OMB may have less assurance that cloud services used by agencies meet federal security requirements.", "Four selected agencies did not consistently address key elements of the FedRAMP authorization process (see table). Officials at the agencies attributed some of these shortcomings to a lack of clarity in the FedRAMP guidance.", "Program participants identified several benefits, but also noted challenges with implementing the FedRAMP. For example, almost half of the 24 agencies reported that the program had improved the security of their data. However, participants reported ongoing challenges with resources needed to comply with the program. GSA took steps to improve the program, but its FedRAMP guidance on requirements and responsibilities was not always clear and the program's process for monitoring the status of security controls over cloud services was limited. Until GSA addresses these challenges, agency implementation of the program's requirements will likely remain inconsistent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making one recommendation to OMB to enhance oversight, two to GSA to improve guidance and monitoring, and 22 to the selected agencies, including GSA.

Federal  agencies suggested that uniform guidance on authorization packages  could assist FedRAMP customers in making better risk-based  decisions in selecting cloud services. Agency officials we interviewed  stated the quality and reviews of authorization packages approved  through FedRAMP varied. Officials stated that inconsistencies in both  FedRAMP agency and JAB provisional authorization packages have  required some agencies to perform additional work. According to the  officials, while the JAB process takes longer, the review appears to be  more detailed than the agency process. Officials noted that improving  guidance on reviewing authorization packages could help with the  consistency and quality of the agency package reviews. The  FedRAMP PMO has taken action and published guidance during our  engagement to address more details of the authorization process.

The JAB technical  representatives we interviewed acknowledged that while control  implementation responsibilities between the agency and cloud service  provider are defined in the Control Implementation Summary, in some  cases, shared responsibilities are not clearly delineated. The JAB  technical representatives stated that the unclear shared responsibilities  could lead to inconsistent implementation of certain controls between the  agency and its provider.

For example, copy-protected  PDFs, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets comprised the remedial  action plans and other documents supporting continuous monitoring of  FedRAMP cloud service provider controls. Because of the static nature of  the documents, including restrictions on copying information concerning  cloud service provider controls, the documents could not be readily  integrated with agencies\u2019 automated security management tools in  providing ongoing awareness of control implementation. Further, agency  staff would have to spend time manually accessing and reviewing the  documents each time they needed to determine the status of a cloud  service\u2019s implementation of a particular control. Agency personnel would  also have to confirm that the documents they reviewed were the most  current version.

The scope of our review included the 24 agencies covered by the Chief  Financial Officers Act.", "To address the three objectives, we developed one survey for the 24  agencies and another survey for 83 cloud service providers identified by  the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) as participating in the  program. We administered these web-based surveys between April and  November 2018. We sent two follow-up email messages to all  nonrespondents and subsequently attempted to contact the remaining  nonrespondents by telephone or email at least twice more.", "To inform our survey questions and options, we designed our  questionnaire based on FedRAMP PMO documentation and interviews  with the 24 agencies and cloud service providers. We pretested the  surveys with three major federal agencies, three cloud service providers,  and one internal GAO group. We requested that agency chief information  officers and chief information security officers review and confirm the  results of the survey. We received completed surveys from 24 of 24  agencies (a 100 percent response rate) for our agency survey and 47 of  the 83 cloud survey providers identified (a 57 percent response rate) for  our cloud service provider survey. Not all survey respondents provided  answers to all survey questions.", "With any survey, error can be introduced with respect to measurement of  concepts, representation of respondents, and other factors, and we took  steps to minimize these errors. We conducted a nonresponse bias  analysis to determine whether certain cloud service providers might have  been more or less likely to respond to the survey than others. Specifically,  we examined whether a cloud service provider\u2019s service model (e.g.,  Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service),  impact level (e.g., high, moderate, low), or deployment model (e.g.,  government, hybrid, private) was related to whether the CSP responded  to the survey. We found that a higher share of cloud service providers  that provide Software as a Service (SaaS) responded to the survey than  those that provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). In addition, we found  that a higher share of cloud service providers that deployed in the  government community cloud responded to the survey than those that  deployed in the public cloud. These results suggest that cloud service  providers that utilize certain service or deployment models were more  likely to reply to the survey than others. As a result, the responses of the  cloud service provider survey represent only those cloud service  providers that participated in this survey, and are not generalizable to  cloud service providers as a whole. Despite these limitations, the survey  results provide insight into the experiences and views of cloud service  providers that did respond.", "In addition to the surveys, to address our first objective, we examined  2017, 2018, and 2019 Joint Authorization Board (JAB) and agency  authorization data from the 24 agencies to determine if there were an  increase, decrease, or no change in the usage of the program. We also  interviewed knowledgeable officials from the 24 agencies and FedRAMP  PMO to obtain their views on the program.", "To address our second objective, we selected four agencies from the 24  agencies based on those with the highest and lowest amount of  FedRAMP PMO reported FedRAMP authorizations as of June 15, 2017.  We selected the four agencies by dividing them into three equal groups of  eight agencies based on the highest to lowest number of FedRAMP PMO  reported service authorizations. We selected at least one agency with the  highest number of authorizations through FedRAMP in each group,  unless we conducted prior FedRAMP work with the agency. Given that  two agencies in the third group had the same number of services  authorized, we selected both agencies as one had a higher number of  reported provisional authorizations through the FedRAMP Joint  Authorization Board process and the other had the higher number of  reported authorizations through the FedRAMP agency process. To avoid  a duplication of our efforts given limited resources, we excluded DOD  because another GAO team was reviewing the department\u2019s cloud- related efforts, which included leveraging FedRAMP authorizations.", "As a result, we selected the Department of Health and Human Services,  General Services Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency,  and the United States Agency for International Development for our  review. Because HHS is a large federated agency, we selected three  operating divisions for a more detailed review. The three operating  divisions included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), and National Institutes of  Health (NIH). We selected these divisions based on their extensive usage  of cloud service providers authorized through FedRAMP.", "To select the agency systems\u2019 authorization packages for review, we first  identified six cloud services based on FedRAMP PMO data that indicated  as of June 15, 2017, the 24 agencies used these cloud services the most.  We then requested the selected agencies to provide us with an inventory  of systems that relied on the six cloud services in fiscal years 2017 and  2018. From these inventories, we selected 10 agency systems. However,  due to sensitivity concerns, we are not disclosing the names of the  systems in this report.", "The case studies we selected are not generalizable to the other agencies  covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act. However, it may show the  potential FedRAMP issues other agencies face.", "For each agency system, we reviewed security authorization  documentation, including:  cloud service provider documentation, such as the Control  Implementation Summary on agency and cloud service provider  responsibilities to determine the extent agencies documented  selected core controls and consistently documented responsibilities in  the system security plan;   security plans to determine the extent to which plans documented and  implemented selected identified core security controls, and met  FedRAMP and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  elements;  security assessment reports to determine if the effectiveness of  selected core controls had been assessed and operating as intended;  the extent to which agencies documented remedial action plans for  selected systems to determine if they met FedRAMP or Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) elements; and authorization letters to determine the extent appropriate officials  approved a cloud service and agency system for use.", "To select identified core controls as part of our authorization  documentation review, we identified and selected 24 security controls  from the 97 identified core controls. Then, to determine the agencies\u2019  compliance with the FedRAMP authorization process to assure the  protection of agency data, we compared the authorization documentation  with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, the  Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program guidance,  including the program\u2019s Security Assessment Framework, OMB guidance,  and NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4. Each authorization  package area was examined and reviewed by an analyst and each  conclusion was corroborated by a second analyst. Where there was  disagreement in the assessment, analysts discussed their analysis and  reached a consensus.", "In addition, we interviewed security representatives and management  officials from our selected agencies to determine the effectiveness of the  FedRAMP authorization process in reviewing the controls necessary for  securing agency data in the cloud, and potential rationale for deficiencies  identified in authorization documentation. We also interviewed FedRAMP  PMO and OMB staff on their efforts related to the FedRAMP authorization  process.", "To address our second and third objectives, we also interviewed JAB  technical representatives to obtain their views on the benefits and  challenges of FedRAMP. Additionally, we obtained information about how  the JAB technical representatives reviewed authorization packages.", "To determine the reliability of the data used to select agencies and of  other data to address our three objectives, we assessed the following:", "FedRAMP program management office points of contact list provided  for active cloud service providers and federal agency users of  FedRAMP,", "FedRAMP program management office data on the 24 CFO Act  agencies\u2019 fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 JAB and agency  authorizations,", "FedRAMP program management office data on cloud service provider  participation and agency usage of FedRAMP as of June 15, 2017,", "Agency inventory of systems relying on selected cloud services,", "Cloud service provider authorization documentation contained within", "Cloud service provider and agency reported third-party assessment  organizations\u2019 security assessment reports, and", "Agency plans of actions and milestones.", "To assess the reliability of the information received and reviewed on the  FedRAMP marketplace, we collected and reviewed information on  agencies\u2019 quality control procedures and asked program officials relevant  questions on the FedRAMP authorization log standard operating  procedure. We reviewed GSA program officials\u2019 responses to our data  reliability questions such as: how the information was generated, how  current the data provided was, how frequently it was updated, and how  the data was accurately and consistently entered into the system used.  The limitation FedRAMP officials noted was that the data generated was  based on voluntarily provided authorization to operate letters submitted to  the FedRAMP program management office by each of the CFO Act  agencies.", "To ensure that the agency systems we reviewed relied on selected cloud  service provider products, we had agencies confirm their use of the  service supporting the agency\u2019s system. We then compared the selected  services with agencies\u2019 annual FISMA reporting to OMB along with  system security documentation (e.g. system security plans) to determine  whether the cloud service services we selected were applicable to the  selected agency system. A limitation with this method of selection is if an  agency\u2019s inventory is inaccurate, we would need to reselect a system. For  this review, one agency\u2019s inventory and system was incomplete resulting  in removing that agency system from our selection.", "To confirm agencies\u2019 virtual access to packages in OMB\u2019s repository or a  cloud service provider\u2019s repository, we obtained screen captures of web  portal contents from the FedRAMP PMO. We compared these screen  captures with our own virtual access to the packages. We also obtained  additional information from the FedRAMP PMO on how it ensures the  accuracy and reliability of the cloud service provider package information.  One limitation of this method is that cloud service providers could update  documentation where access was outside of OMB MAX portal, and the  PMO may not be immediately aware of package updates.", "To verify the accuracy and reliability of plans of actions and milestones  provided by agencies, we compared the agency\u2019s plans of actions and  milestones with required OMB elements. We also requested that  agencies describe how they generated the plans of action and milestones  provided to us, identify the quality control procedures used, and any  limitations to the data they provided.", "We evaluated the materiality of the information we obtained and  compared it to our audit objectives. We assessed the reliability of the  information by reviewing related documents and internal controls such as  agency policies and procedures as well as examining packages stored in  OMB\u2019s MAX portal and cloud service provider repositories. We also  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials. Through these methods, we  concluded that the information was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2016 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
