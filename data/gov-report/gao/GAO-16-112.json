However, as GAO also found in December 2014, all JWST elements and major subsystems continue to remain within weeks of becoming the critical path\u2014the schedule with the least amount of schedule reserve\u2014for the overall project. Given their proximity to the critical path, the use of additional reserve on any element or major subsystem may reduce the overall project schedule reserve.", "Before the planned launch in October 2018, the project must complete five major integration and test events, three of which have not yet begun. Integration and testing is when problems are often identified and schedules tend to slip. At the same time, the project must also address over 100 technical risks and ensure that potential areas for mission failure are fully tested and understood.", "JWST continues to meet its cost commitments, but unreliable contractor performance data may pose a risk to project management. To help manage the project and account for new risks, project officials conducted a cost risk analysis of the prime contract. A cost risk analysis uses information about cost drivers, technical issues, and schedule to determine the reliability of a program's cost estimates. GAO found that while NASA's cost risk analysis substantially met best practices for cost estimating, officials do not plan to periodically update it. Instead, the project is using a risk-adjusted analysis to update and inform its cost position, but this analysis is a simplified version of a cost risk analysis\u2014and not a replacement\u2014and is based on contractor-provided performance data that contains anomalies that render the data unreliable. Further, the project does not have an independent surveillance mechanism, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency, to help ensure data anomalies are corrected by the contractor before being incorporated into larger cost analyses, as GAO recommended in 2012. As a result, the project is relying partially on unreliable information to inform its decision making and overall cost status."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the JWST project require contractors to identify, explain, and document anomalies in contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports.

JWST is being designed for a 5-year mission to find the first  stars and trace the evolution of galaxies from their beginning to their  current formation, and is intended to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5  million kilometers\u2014or 1 million miles\u2014from the Earth. With a 6.5-meter  primary mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about 100 times the  sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST\u2019s science instruments  are to observe very faint infrared sources and as such are required to  operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep these instruments  cold, a multi-layered tennis-court-sized sunshield is being developed to  protect the mirrors and instruments from the sun\u2019s heat. The sunshield  and primary mirror are designed to fold and stow for launch and fit within  the launch vehicle. When complete, the observatory segment of JWST is  to include several elements (Optical Telescope Element (OTE),  Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), and spacecraft) and major  subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The JWST project is divided into  three major segments: the observatory segment, the ground segment,  and the launch segment. The hardware configuration created when the  Optical Telescope Element and the Integrated Science Instrument  Module are integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element  by NASA, but we categorize it as such for ease of discussion.  Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy and control  various components of the telescope as well as collect and transmit data  back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and software are being  developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and international  partner efforts. See figure 1 below for an interactive graphic that depicts  the elements and major subsystems of JWST. For more information on  JWST\u2019s organizational structure, see appendix III.", "Given JWST\u2019s complexity, integration and test activities are comprised of  five separate periods\u2014two of which have already started\u2014over the  course of almost 7 years to build the observatory. During the test periods,  the project works to mitigate risks to an acceptable level prior to launch.  According to project officials, while some risks may be eliminated entirely  through various mitigation strategies, others will be accepted as residual  risks that remain upon launch. See figure 2 below for the overall planned  integration and test flow for JWST that includes the remaining schedule  reserve\u2014or extra time built into the schedule to address any issues  found.", "For the majority of the work remaining, the JWST project will rely on three  contractors: Northrop Grumman, Harris (formerly Exelis), and the Space  Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Northrop Grumman plays the largest  role, developing the sunshield, the OTE, the spacecraft, and a cooling  subsystem for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Northrop Grumman  performs most of this work under a prime contract with NASA, but its work  on the MIRI cooler is performed under a separate subcontract with the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Harris is manufacturing the test equipment,  equipping the test chamber, and assisting in the testing of the optics of  JWST. Finally, STScI will collect and evaluate research proposals from  the scientific community and will receive and store the scientific data  collected, both of which are services that they currently provide for the  Hubble Space Telescope.

Schedule reserve is allocated to  specific activities, elements, and major subsystems in the event there are  delays or to address unforeseen risks. Each JWST element and major  subsystem has been allocated schedule reserve. When an element or  major subsystem exhausts schedule reserve, it may begin to affect  schedule reserve on other elements or major subsystems whose  progress is dependent on prior work being finished for its activities to  proceed. The element or major subsystem with the least amount of  schedule reserve determines the critical path for the project. Any delay to  an activity that is on the critical path will reduce schedule reserve for the  whole project, and could ultimately impact the overall project schedule.", "Cost reserves are additional funds within the project manager\u2019s budget  that can be used to address unanticipated issues for any element or  major subsystem and are used to mitigate issues during the development  of a project. For example, cost reserves can be used to buy additional  materials to replace a component or, if a project needs to preserve  schedule reserve, reserves can be used to accelerate work by adding  shifts to expedite manufacturing and save time. NASA\u2019s Goddard Space  Flight Center (Goddard)\u2014the NASA center with responsibility for  managing JWST\u2014has issued procedural requirements that establish the  levels of both cost and schedule reserves that projects must hold at  project confirmation.

Prior to being approved for development, cost estimates  of the project ranged from $1 billion to $3.5 billion with expected launch  dates ranging from 2007 to 2011. Before 2011, early technical and  management challenges, contractor performance issues, low level cost  reserves, and poorly phased funding levels caused JWST to delay work  after confirmation, which contributed to significant cost and schedule  overruns, including launch delays. The Chair of the Senate Subcommittee  on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies requested from  NASA an independent review of JWST in June 2010. In response, NASA  commissioned the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which  issued its report in October 2010, and concluded that JWST was  executing well from a technical standpoint, but that the baseline funding  did not reflect the most probable cost with adequate reserves in each  year of project execution, resulting in an unexecutable project. Following  this review, the JWST program underwent a replan in September 2011,  and Congress in November 2011 placed an $8 billion cap on the  formulation and development costs for the project. On the basis of the  replan, NASA rebaselined JWST with a life-cycle cost estimate of $8.835  billion that included additional money for operations and a planned launch  in October 2018. The revised life-cycle cost estimate included a total of  13 months of funded schedule reserve.

Finally, we found that NASA  had not conducted a cost risk analysis since the 2011 replan. A cost risk  analysis determines the reliability of a program\u2019s cost estimate by  determining a program\u2019s cost drivers and the risk of cost overruns through  an analysis that links historical schedule information along with technical  issues and uncertainties in schedule and cost. Since new risks had  emerged, we recommended that NASA follow best practices when it  updated the 2011 analysis for the Northrop Grumman contract and  ensure the analysis is updated as significant risks emerge in the future.

Our prior work has shown that it is in integration and testing  where problems are most likely to be found and as a result, schedules  tend to slip. As we found in 2012, the project has a set amount of time  allocated to the final three integration and test efforts over the next 3  years, with between 2 and 4 months for each. This time could easily be  used if a significant problem occurred. For example, the OTIS  integration and test period\u2014the first major integration involving OTE and  ISIM\u2014planned to start in 2016 currently has 3 months of schedule  reserve allocated at the end of testing. The final event in the OTIS  integration and test effort is a cryovacuum test that takes approximately 3  months to complete. If an issue occurred that required stopping and  repeating the cryovacuum test, this reserve could easily be exhausted.  Additionally, as the project moves further into integration and testing,  events become more serial so flexibility will be diminished. Issues  uncovered in integration and testing also tend to be more expensive to  mitigate, due to increased schedule pressure.", "To prevent the use of additional schedule reserve, the project and its  contractor for OTIS testing are taking proactive steps to reduce risk  before testing needs to commence by ensuring the availability and  readiness of test equipment and the cryogenic chamber to be used to test  the optics of JWST. For example, the project\u2019s contractor that is to test  the optics has conducted two of three optical ground support equipment  tests on a replica of the OTE with 2 of 18 primary mirror segments  installed. According to the project, the first test met its intended objectives  and provided valuable insight into the performance of the ground support  equipment and preparation of the cryogenic chamber. The second test  was completed in October 2015, and project officials are currently  analyzing the results. The third test is to build upon these findings to  provide further confidence for the eventual OTIS testing.

According to program and  contractor officials, the majority of these harnesses were damaged due to  use of inappropriate tooling by the supplier. The damage was not  discovered until some of the harnesses were installed on the OTE. The  harnesses were removed for inspection with most requiring repairs or  replacement. According to contractor officials, initially, the harnesses  would have been installed at Northrop Grumman\u2019s facility in Redondo  Beach, California, but due to the workmanship issues, and in an effort to  preserve as much schedule as possible, all but two of the harnesses are  being installed at Goddard after the OTE was transferred there to begin  the integration of the mirrors with the backplane.", "Various spacecraft challenges during the past year have used about 3  months of schedule reserve. For example, Northrop Grumman planned  for certain integration activities to be conducted concurrently. However,  according to project officials, due to safety and access to the spacecraft  bus, the work had to be completed sequentially instead which took longer  than expected. Additionally, a propellant tank required redesign and  rework to meet its requirements.

NASA and JPL  assessed the removal of the electromagnetic interference and  electromagnetic compatibility testing as low risk, and a program official  stated that additional parallel activities and testing of the spare electronics  to further mitigate the risk have been added. However, various integration  and test experts we spoke with noted that eliminating testing is a sign that  the project may be taking on additional risk because discovery of issues  may be pushed to higher levels of testing or to later in the testing phase,  where problems are more costly and time consuming to address.", "To accommodate any delays to testing or problems that may be found,  JPL currently maintains 12 weeks of reserve for acceptance and end-to- end testing of the cryocooler.

According to the project,  approximately 25 of these risks are not likely to be closed until the  conclusion of the observatory integration and test phase\u2014just prior to  project launch. This is the point where the project has determined that no  further mitigations are feasible and that these risks have been tested per  a plan to reduce the risk, when possible, to an acceptable level. In some  cases, it may take years to resolve a particular risk. For example, the  project continues to track a risk related to the release mechanisms that  hold the spacecraft and the OTE together for launch. Once in space, they  are to activate and release to allow the OTE to separate from the  spacecraft. If the mechanisms do not operate correctly, mission failure will  occur. This risk was identified in January 2014 at the spacecraft critical  design review. During testing, these devices were causing excessive  shock when performing their releasing function. After redesign, the project  is continuing to work on resolving the underlying problem and qualifying  the new design. Additionally, while testing the redesigned mechanism, a  new concern arose that it could release early which would cause mission  failure. According to a program official, the redesigned mechanism is not  needed for spacecraft integration and test until summer of 2016 and  therefore these issues do not pose a significant schedule concern at this  time.", "As integration and testing moves forward, the project will need to be able  to resolve problems in a timely manner to stay on schedule. A backlog of  unresolved problems and risks may indicate there may not be enough  schedule left before launch to complete all necessary work.

Thus, ensuring that problem reports and problem failure reports  are resolved in a timely manner is key to successfully launching the  project on time. Project officials reported that they do not track problem  report and problem failure report closure rates over time; instead, they  monitor the reports to ensure that they are closed before subsequent test  events and receive monthly briefings from the contractors on the status of  their progress. According to project officials responsible for the ISIM and  OTIS development and testing, while there are numerous problem reports  open at any given time, they are comfortable with the number of open  reports at this stage of the project. Northrop Grumman officials reported  that development of the OTE, sunshield, and spacecraft are on track with  respect to problem and failure reports, which they refer to as  nonconformance reports. Additionally, experts we spoke with told us that  addressing requests for action (RFAs) from project reviews is important  because RFAs are written to identify potential risks to the project. Since  the spacecraft critical design review in January 2014, the project has  closed 14 RFAs from that review while one related to the release  mechanism noted above remains open.

Each of these could  result in a loss of minimum mission objectives, and thus needs to be fully  tested and understood. Nearly half of the single point failure modes  involve the deployment of the sunshield. The approval of single point  failures requires written justification from the project including sound  engineering judgement, supporting risk analysis, and implementation of  measures to mitigate the risk to acceptable levels.

This need derives from work taking longer than planned to  complete and additional work requested by NASA. For example, Northrop  Grumman\u2019s workforce projections for fiscal year 2015 predicted a peak in  the workforce in November 2014. However, the actual workforce peaked  in February 2015 and continued to remain above the projected peak until  August 2015. While workforce numbers have declined somewhat since  February, these increases largely remained in place through the end of  the fiscal year. In its role as prime contractor, Northrop Grumman\u2019s  workforce stayed within its budget in fiscal year 2015. From January  through July of 2015, its workforce was exactly at its funding threshold in  order to conduct new work and address technical issues for its body of  work.

Figure 6 below  illustrates the difference between the workforce levels that Northrop  Grumman projected at the beginning of fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and  its actual workforce levels for those periods.", "Based on its projections at the beginning of the fiscal year, Northrop  Grumman exceeded its total fiscal year 2014 workforce monthly  projections by about 12 percent, and exceeded its projections for fiscal  year 2015 by about 20 percent. On average, in fiscal year 2015, Northrop  Grumman was 121 FTEs above its projections each month, and at the  end of fiscal year 2015, it exceeded its monthly projection for September  2015 by 235 FTEs. While actuals have remained above projections since  the workforce levels peaked in February 2015, Northrop Grumman  currently projects that its workforce will decline throughout fiscal year  2016, with the exception of August 2016, when additional work is  projected to be needed for integration and testing, among other areas.  However, this was the projection for both fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and  has yet to happen. For example, while Northrop Grumman expected to be  ramping down by the end of fiscal year 2014, its projections at the start of  fiscal year 2015 were approximately 55 percent higher than where  workforce levels were projected for the end of fiscal year 2014. The  primary drivers that have increased the cost and size of the workforce  under the prime contract have been the development of the sunshield and  spacecraft and additional work NASA has requested. Over 60 percent of  the cost increases are attributed to addressing technical concerns such  as sunshield alignment and verification work, mechanical design  integration, and spacecraft mass reduction. Northrop Grumman has  covered additional costs pertaining to technical issues through its  management reserves, and has not needed project cost reserves in fiscal  years 2014 and 2015. The remaining cost increases are attributable to  new contract scope which has been funded by the JWST program. Some  of this new scope included additional spacecraft simulators, as well as  new thermal risk reduction testing to verify the final design changes made  to the core of the telescope\u2013the region between all the observatory  elements.", "Approximately 15 percent of work remains on Northrop Grumman\u2019s  contract and its management reserves exceed the recommended  minimum amount that should be held at the contractor level\u201410 percent  or more of the cost of work remaining on the project.

To incentivize the contractor to lower its workforce, project  officials evaluate workforce management as part of NASA\u2019s appraisal of  Northrop Grumman\u2019s performance in its award fee determinations. The  project also communicates frequently with the contractor including phone  calls, face to face meetings twice a month, and quarterly in-person  management meetings to discuss workforce planning, among other  subjects. The project has communicated the need to reduce the  workforce size, but since Northrop Grumman has operated within its  budget in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the award fee it has received has  not been reduced as a result of workforce size issues.", "The subcontractor for OTIS testing, Harris, needed additional funding to  cover cost overruns and additional work. Project cost reserves were  utilized to pay for this work to maintain schedule through a contract  change in January 2015. Over 55 percent of the increase was made to  address cost overruns that resulted from increasing workforce levels to  maintain schedule. The rest of the contract increase covered new scope.  As a result, Harris is anticipating more work than originally planned for  fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Despite the contract increases, Harris\u2019s  management reserves are 2.5 percent as of August 2015\u2014significantly  below the 10 percent cost of work remaining that is considered to be  healthy.

In December 2014, we  recommended that project officials update the 2011 JWST cost risk  analysis utilizing best practices, and to update it periodically as significant  risks emerge. NASA partially concurred with our recommendation  stating that the program and project use a range of tools to assess the  performance of the project and conducted a one-time update to the cost  risk analysis in 2014. We found that NASA\u2019s updated cost risk analysis  substantially met best practices. For example, it incorporated subject  matter expert input to model cost and schedule uncertainties from the  prime contractor\u2019s threats and opportunities list\u2014both of which are  components of the best practice of modeling a probability distribution for  each cost element\u2019s uncertainty based on data availability, reliability and  variability. See appendix I for a list of best practices that we used to  evaluate cost risk and uncertainty. In addition, NASA included correlation  between elements to account for different cost elements being affected by  the same external factors\u2014another best practice.", "However, the cost risk analysis also had some weaknesses as a result of  not fully following best practices. For the first best practice noted above  on modeling probability distribution, NASA relied on the contractor\u2019s risk  data without conducting corroborating interviews with contractor  personnel to obtain insight into threats and opportunities not listed in  contractor data. For the same best practice, the detailed schedule that  reflected all of the work that needed to be done by Northrop Grumman  that was used for the cost risk analysis had some activity sequencing  logic issues. For example, we found instances where activities listed were  not sequentially linked to one another. As a result, this called into  question the calculation of the critical path during simulations as well as  the ability of the schedule to dynamically respond to changes, which it  must do thousands of times during the risk simulations. Moreover, the  JWST project does not plan to periodically update its cost risk analysis  even as additional risks have emerged. JWST officials stated that the cost  risk analysis was a time intensive process to complete and that the  program and project use various tools consistent with best practices to  assess all major contractors\u2019 performance. Nonetheless, best practices  call for conducting periodic updates to a cost risk analysis as a project  progresses even if it is not experiencing problems. Updating the cost risk  analysis is also part of the best practice of implementing a risk  management plan with the contractor which calls for identifying and  analyzing risk, planning for risk mitigation, and continually tracking risks.  An accurate cost risk analysis is particularly vital to JWST because about  70 percent of the project cost reserves have been used to address  concerns that were not anticipated as threats by the project\u2019s budget  system. Failure to update the cost risk analysis as we recommended in  2014 limits stakeholder confidence that the cost risk analysis prepared in  2014 accurately reflects the project\u2019s current financial status. Given this  uncertainty, it is important for the project to have reliable information for  the risks that are known to inform decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unreliable EVM Data Limit Project\u2019s Ability to Reliably Forecast Future Cost Growth for Contractors", "paragraphs": ["One of the tools that the project has started to use in place of updating  the cost risk analysis is a monthly risk-adjusted analysis to provide insight  into potential future cost growth. The monthly risk-adjusted analyses are  based on contractor EVM data that incorporate known threats to provide  an estimate at completion (EAC) that is updated monthly by NASA for  each contractor. The results of these analyses may then be compared to  the contractors\u2019 estimates and project cost reserves to provide insight into  the project\u2019s ability to cover future increases. Monthly risk-adjusted  analyses demonstrate a commitment by NASA to manage and project  future costs.", "However, we found that the risk-adjusted analyses do not serve as an  adequate substitute for an updated cost risk analysis because they are a  simplified version of a cost risk analysis that does not allow the project to  prioritize risks or assign confidence levels to meet key milestones in the  schedule consistent with best practices for cost risk analyses.  Additionally, based on our analysis of contractor EVM data over 17  months, we found that some of the data used to conduct the analyses  were unreliable. First, we found that both Northrop Grumman and Harris  were reporting optimistic EACs at the time of our analysis that did not  align with their historical EVM performance and fell outside the low end of  our independent EAC range. Second, we found various anomalies in  contractor EVM data for both the Northrop Grumman and Harris work that  they had not identified throughout the 17-month period we examined. The  anomalies included unexplained entries for negative values of work  performed (meaning that work was unaccomplished or taken away rather  than accomplished during the reporting period), work tasks performed but  not scheduled, or actual costs incurred with no work performed. For  Northrop Grumman, many were relatively small in value ranging from a  few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. These anomalies are  problematic because they distort the EVM data, which affect the  projection of realistic EACs. We found that these anomalies occurred  consistently within the data over a 17-month period, which brings into  question the reliability of the risk-adjusted EAC analysis built upon this  information. NASA did not provide explanations into the anomalies for  either contractor. While the contractors were able to provide explanations  for the anomalies upon request, their explanations or corrections were not  always documented within EVM records. Some of the reasons the  contractors cited that were not in the EVM records included tasks  completed later than planned, schedule recovered on behind schedule  tasks, and replanning of customer-driven tasks. Finally, like the cost-risk  analysis in 2014, the risk-adjusted EAC analysis does not include  interviews with contractor officials to gain insight into risks which may not  be present in the contractors\u2019 threats and opportunities list. Without  updating the cost risk analysis, reconciling and documenting data  anomalies, and utilizing reliable data for the risk-adjusted EAC, the JWST  project does not have a reliable method to assess its cost reserve status  going forward. This means that some of the cost information the project  officials use to inform their decision making may indicate they are in good  shape when the reality might be otherwise, and as result, project  management may not have a solid basis for decision making.", "In discussions with the contractors, we found that the project also lacks  an independent surveillance mechanism, such as the Defense Contract  Management Agency, to monitor contractors\u2019 EVM data\u2014provided to the  project each month from two of the contractors. Surveillance entails  reviewing a contractor\u2019s EVM system with the purpose of focusing on how  well a contractor is using its EVM system to manage cost, schedule, and  technical performance. However, the lack of surveillance and the data  anomalies in EVM data are problems we previously identified across  NASA\u2019s portfolio of major spaceflight projects. We found in November  2012 that 4 of NASA\u2019s 10 major spaceflight projects we reviewed had  established formal independent surveillance reviews. For the 6 projects  that did not have formal independent surveillance in place, we found that  each provided evidence that they instituted monthly EVM data reviews,  which according to project officials, helped them to continually monitor  cost and schedule performance. However, we found that the rigor of both  the formal and informal surveillance reviews was questionable given the  numerous EVM data anomalies we found in the monthly EVM data. As a  result, we recommended that NASA improve the reliability of project EVM  data by requiring projects to implement a formal surveillance program that  ensured anomalies in contractor-delivered and in-house monthly earned  value management reports were identified and explained, and report  periodically to the center and mission directorate\u2019s leadership on relevant  trends in the number of unexplained anomalies. Citing resource  constraints, NASA partially concurred with the recommendation and  commented that it did not plan to implement a formal surveillance  program, but agreed that the reliability and utility of the EVM data needed  to be improved and noted several steps it planned to take to do so. We  continue to believe that implementing this recommendation would be  beneficial and prevent anomalies in EVM data from occurring that we  have identified on the JWST project. Implementing surveillance of EVM  contractor data is a best practice listed in the NASA Earned Value  Management Implementation Handbook and GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. With adequate surveillance in place, the anomalies  we found in the EVM data could have been identified earlier and  corrective action could have been directed to the contractors to explain  the anomalies in the data.

Making management decisions using unreliable data can result  in bad decision making and can misinform the project on its long-term  financial position which may have significant consequences if not  corrected. We recommended in our December 2014 report that NASA  conduct a cost risk analysis and follow best practices, which include  updating it as risks change during the life of the program. Because the  project is not going to conduct another cost risk analysis, putting  independent surveillance in place to improve the accuracy of its risk- adjusted analysis\u2014despite its weaknesses relative to the information a  cost risk analysis provides\u2014will provide better information to inform its  decision making. In November 2012, we recommended that NASA  improve the reliability of project EVM data by requiring its major  spaceflight projects to implement a formal surveillance program that  ensured anomalies in contractor-delivered data and in-house monthly  EVM reports were identified and explained. NASA partially concurred with  this recommendation but has not taken steps to require surveillance on  projects like JWST. However, we continue to believe that improving the  surveillance on projects will help reduce data anomalies from occurring  like the ones we identified on JWST, resulting in better information and  analyses to inform project decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To resolve contractor data reliability issues and ensure that the project  obtains reliable data to inform its analyses and overall cost position, we  recommend that the NASA Administrator direct JWST project officials to  require the contractors to identify, explain, and document all anomalies in  contractor-delivered monthly earned value management reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NASA for comment.

We  examined and analyzed monthly JWST project status reports to  management to monitor schedule reserve levels and usage and potential  risks and technical challenges that may impact the project\u2019s schedule,  and to gain insights on the project\u2019s progress since our last report in  December 2014. Further, we attended flight program reviews at the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) headquarters on  a quarterly basis where the current status of the program was briefed to  NASA headquarters officials outside of the project. We examined  selected individual risks for elements and major subsystems from monthly  risk registers prepared by the project to understand the likelihood of  occurrence and impacts to the schedule based on steps the project is  taking to mitigate the risks. We examined previous and current test  schedules and plans to understand the sequence, what risks will be  mitigated, which risks will continue, and any reductions to planned testing.  Furthermore, we interviewed experts within and outside of NASA to  identify criteria, best practices, and metrics that may be used to assess  the project\u2019s progress in reducing risk or provide insight into the health of  the project. Finally, we interviewed project officials at Goddard, contractor  officials from the Harris Corporation, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the  Space Telescope Science Institute, and different divisions of Northrop  Grumman Aerospace Systems concerning technological challenges that  have had an impact on schedule, and the project\u2019s and contractor\u2019s plans  to address these challenges.", "To assess the current cost status of the JWST project and the primary  challenges that may influence the project\u2019s ability to meet its future cost  commitments, we reviewed and analyzed program, project, contractor,  and subcontractor data and documentation and held interviews with  officials from these organizations. We reviewed JWST project status  reports on cost issues to determine the risks that could impact cost. We  analyzed contractor and subcontractor\u2019s workforce plans against  workforce actuals to determine whether contractors\u2019 are meeting their  workforce plans. We monitored and analyzed the status of program, and  project cost reserves in current and future fiscal years to determine the  project\u2019s financial posture.
