Aviation-related emissions of nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ozone, have been of particular concern to many airport operators. A federal study at 19 airports estimated that, by 2010, aircraft emissions have the potential to significantly contribute to air pollution in the areas around these airports. GAO agreed to review efforts in the United States and other countries to reduce emissions at airports and the effect of improvements in aircraft and engine design on emissions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many airports have taken measures to reduce emissions, such as converting airport ground vehicles from diesel or gasoline to cleaner alternative fuels. While the actual impact of these measures is unknown, some measures (such as shifting to cleaner alternative fuels) have the potential to significantly reduce emissions, such as nitrogen oxides. In some cases--such as at Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth airports--the emission reduction measures have been imposed by federal or state agencies to bring severely polluted areas into attainment with the Clean Air Act's air quality standards or to offset expected increases in emissions from airport expansion projects. Many industry and government officials that GAO contacted said that new, stricter federal air quality standards that will go into effect in 2003, combined with a boost in emissions due to an expected increase in air travel, could cause airports to be subject to more federal emission control requirements. In 1998, a group of government and industry stakeholders was established to develop a voluntary nationwide program to reduce aviation-related emissions; however, thus far, the group has not agreed to specific objectives or elements of a program. Other countries use many of the same measures as the United States to reduce emissions at airports. Two countries have imposed landing fees based on the amount of emissions produced by aircraft. However, U.S. officials question the effectiveness of these fees. Research and development efforts by the federal government and the aircraft industry have improved fuel efficiency and reduced many emissions from aircraft, including hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, but have increased emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are a precursor to ozone formation. As a result, many new aircraft are emitting more nitrogen oxides than the older aircraft they are replacing. For example, GAO's analysis of aircraft emission data shows that the engines employed on the newest models of a widely used jet aircraft, while meeting current standards for nitrogen oxide emissions, average over 40 percent more nitrogen oxides during landings and takeoffs than the engines used on the older models. Technologies are available to limit nitrogen oxide emissions from some other newer aircraft models. Many state and federal officials GAO contacted said that, in the long term, nitrogen oxide emissions from aircraft will need to be reduced as part of broader emission reduction efforts in order for some areas to meet federal ozone standards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although aviation-related activities result in the emission of pollutants that  account for only about 0.5 percent of total air pollution in the United  States, these pollutants are among the most prevalent and harmful in the  atmosphere and are expected to grow. The Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) expects the demand for air travel in the United  States to recover from the events of September 11, 2001, and then continue  a long-term trend of 3.6 percent annual growth. This expected growth has  heightened concerns among some communities, environmental groups,  and others that airport operations will have an increasingly detrimental  effect upon the environment. Although, to date, these groups have focused  primarily on the noise generated by aircraft operations, they are becoming  increasingly concerned about aviation\u2019s impact on air quality. Our August  2000 report found that the operators of the nation\u2019s 50 busiest airports  considered that air quality issues would become a bigger concern and  challenge for them in the future than any other environmental issue.  Airport operators were particularly mindful of the effects on air quality of  the increases in emissions due to airport growth. The emissions of most  concern to many airport operators, as well as to many state and local air  quality authorities, are nitrogen oxides, which are a primary contributor to  the formation of ozone, a major pollutant in many metropolitan areas.", "You asked us to provide information on how the aviation community is  addressing current and future concerns about air quality. Specifically, you  asked the following questions: (1) What efforts are being undertaken to  reduce emissions from airport activities, and what are the outcomes of  these efforts? (2) What additional efforts are being undertaken in other  countries to reduce aviation-related emissions? and (3) How have  improvements in aircraft and engine design affected aircraft emissions?", "To address these questions, we reviewed the results of environmental  reviews conducted over the past 3 years at major airports located in areas  (called nonattainment areas) that have not attained air quality standards  required by the Clean Air Act; surveyed air quality officials from the 13  states that have major airports in nonattainment areas; and visited seven  airports. To identify trends in aircraft emissions, we analyzed aircraft  landing and takeoff data for the U.S. commercial aircraft fleet in 2001  using a computer model developed by FAA. In addition, we interviewed  and gathered information from officials representing FAA, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and state and local  governments. We also reviewed previous reports on aviation emission  issues and available information on international efforts to reduce aviation  emissions. We conducted our work from September 2001 through  February 2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. See appendix I for additional information on our objectives,  scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although aviation-related activities currently account for only 0.5 percent  of total air pollution in the United States, the types of pollutants emitted by  these activities are among the most prevalent and harmful in the  atmosphere, and are expected to grow over time. The major sources of  aviation-related emissions are aircraft, which emit pollutants at ground  level as well as over a range of altitudes; the equipment (such as vehicles  that transport baggage) that services them on the ground at airports; and  vehicles transporting passengers to and from the airport. The amount of  emissions attributable to each source varies by airport. A 1997 study of  mobile source emissions at four airports found that ground access vehicles  were the most significant source (accounting for 27 to 63 percent of total  mobile source emissions), followed by aircraft (15 to 38 percent of the  total) and ground service equipment (12 to 13 percent of the total). The  emissions produced by these sources include carbon monoxide; sulfur  dioxide; particulate matter; toxic substances (such as benzene and  formaldehyde); and nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds,  which contribute to the formation of ozone, a major pollutant in many  metropolitan areas. In addition, aircraft emit carbon dioxide and other  gases that have been found to contribute to climate change due to  warming. According to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change, global aircraft emissions accounted for approximately 3.5  percent of the warming generated by human activities. (The types,  amounts, and impact of emissions from aviation-related sources are  described in detail in appendix II.)", "Although only limited research has been done on the impact of projected  growth in air travel on emissions, indications are that emissions are likely  to continue increasing. FAA reported in June 2001 that the number of  commercial flights is expected to increase about 23 percent by 2010 and  about 60 percent by 2025. Each flight represents a takeoff and landing  cycle during which most aircraft emissions enter the local atmosphere. In  addition, an EPA study of 19 airports projected that the proportion of  mobile-source emissions of nitrogen oxides attributable to aircraft in the  areas adjacent to these airports will triple from a range of 0.6 to 3.6  percent in 1990 to a range of 1.9 to 10.4 percent in 2010. Such projections,  however, do not consider recent industry changes, such as airlines\u2019  increased use of smaller aircraft and the financial uncertainties in the  aviation industry. A recent report by the Department of Transportation  indicated that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, combined with a  cut-back in business travel, had a major and perhaps long-lasting impact  on air traffic demand.", "A number of federal, state, and international agencies are involved in  controlling aviation-related emissions. The Clean Air Act mandates  standards for mobile sources of emissions such as aircraft, ground service  equipment, and automobiles. As mandated by the act, EPA promulgates  emission standards for aircraft, and has chosen to adopt international  emission standards for aircraft set by ICAO, which was chartered by the  United Nations to regulate international aviation and includes the United  States and 188 other nations. As the United States\u2019 representative to ICAO,  FAA, in consultation with EPA, works with representatives from other  member countries to formulate the standards. EPA and FAA work to  ensure that the effective date of emissions standards permit the  development and application of needed technology and give appropriate  consideration to the cost of compliance, according to FAA officials. The  officials also noted that EPA is responsible for consulting with FAA  concerning aircraft safety and noise before promulgating emission  standards. In addition to issuing aircraft emission standards, ICAO has  studied aviation-related emission issues and issued guidance to its  members on ways to reduce these emissions.", "States can address airport emissions in plans, known as state  implementation plans,  that they are required to submit to EPA for  reducing emissions in areas that fail to meet the National Ambient Air  Quality Standards set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act for common air  pollutants with health and environmental effects (known as criteria  pollutants). Geographic areas that have levels of a criteria pollutant above  those allowed by the standard are called nonattainment areas. Areas that  did not meet the standard for a criteria pollutant in the past but have  reached attainment and met certain procedural requirements are known as  maintenance areas. The options available to states for controlling  pollution from airports are limited because most emissions come from  mobile sources, such as automobiles, which are already regulated by EPA,  and states are generally preempted from issuing regulations on aircraft  emissions because of EPA\u2019s federal responsibility in this area. FAA is  responsible for enforcing the emission standards and for ensuring that  emissions resulting from airport construction projects under their  authority comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, which  requires an environmental review of such projects, and the Clean Air Act\u2019s  requirement that the projects comply with state implementation plans for  attaining air quality standards. (See appendix III for additional information  on federal, state, and international responsibilities concerning aviation- related emissions.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airports and Airlines are Taking a Variety of Actions to Reduce Emissions, Although Specific Impact of These Actions Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Many of the nation\u2019s busiest airports and airlines that serve them have  initiated voluntary emission reduction measures, such as converting  shuttle buses and other vehicles from diesel or gasoline fuels to cleaner  alternative fuels. While the actual impact of these measures is unknown,  some measures (such as shifting to new cleaner gas or diesel engines or  alternative fuels) have the potential to significantly reduce emissions, such  as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, and  carbon monoxide. The airports and airlines have undertaken these efforts  for a variety of reasons, including requirements by states imposed as part  of their plans to ensure that severely polluted areas (i.e., nonattainment  areas) achieve the air quality standards established by the Clean Air Act  and to gain federal approval for airport construction projects. In late 2003,  EPA will begin implementing stricter standards for ozone, which could  make it more difficult for areas to achieve or maintain attainment status.  Representatives from the aviation industry as well as federal and state  officials told us that the new air quality standards, combined with the  boost in emissions expected from increases in air travel, could cause  airports to be subject to more emission control requirements in the future.  In addition, according to FAA officials, approval of some projects in these  areas may be less likely because of several factors, including increased  focus on air quality by communities that oppose airport development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Airports\u2019 and Airlines\u2019 Voluntary Actions to Reduce Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Many of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, in conjunction with the air carriers  that serve them, have implemented voluntary control measures to reduce  emissions from major sources, including aircraft, ground support  equipment, and passenger vehicles entering and exiting the airport,  according to our review of FAA documents and interviews with airport  and state environmental officials. Specific guidelines or regulations for  airports to reduce emissions from these sources do not exist, but some  airports have been proactive in developing programs and practices that  reduce emissions. Although the actual impact of these measures is  unknown, some initiatives have the potential to significantly reduce  emissions from certain sources. For example, a number of carriers at  Dallas/Fort Worth International and Houston airports have agreed to  voluntarily reduce emissions associated with ground service equipment by  up to 75 percent. Figure 1 provides examples of activities to reduce  emissions that have been implemented at U.S. airports. Appendix V  provides more information on some airports\u2019 voluntary efforts to reduce  emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States Have Not Included Airports in Their Emission Control Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Only 3 of the 13 states with major commercial airports in nonattainment  areas\u2014California, Texas, and Massachusetts\u2014have targeted airports for  emission reductions. The remaining states have not included emission  reductions at airports as part of their strategies for bringing nonattainment  areas into compliance with the Clean Air Act\u2019s ambient air quality  standards because they have attempted to achieve sufficient reductions  from other pollution sources. Officials from these states noted that EPA  has the authority to set emission standards for aircraft and nonroad  vehicles, including ground support equipment at airports, which preempts  the states\u2019 regulation of these sources.", "California and Texas face major ozone nonattainment problems\u2014 California in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and Texas in the Dallas- Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas. According to air quality  officials from both states, even after imposing all of the traditional  emission control measures available, such as vehicle emission inspections,  the three metropolitan areas still may not be able to reach attainment  status for ozone by the 2010 deadline for Los Angeles and by the 2005 and  2007 deadlines for Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, respectively. Despite  potential legal challenges from airlines, both California and Texas turned  to airports for additional emission control measures. Texas has negotiated  an agreement with the Dallas/Fort Worth International and Houston  airports and the airlines that serve them to reduce emissions attributable  to ground support equipment by 90 percent. California has reached a  similar agreement with the major airlines serving the five commercial  airports in the Los Angeles nonattainment area to reduce emissions from  ground support equipment.", "California\u2019s efforts to cut ground support equipment emissions in the Los  Angeles area are part of a statewide campaign to reduce airport pollution.  In addition to using its limited authority under the Clean Air Act to  implement airport-related emission reductions, the state has also  employed a certification process provided for in federal law. Under this  provision, before FAA can approve a grant for any new airport, new  runway, or major runway extension project, the governor must certify that  the project complies with applicable air and water quality standards.  California has developed criteria for determining whether a proposed  airport expansion project would have an impact on the environment,  including air quality. Unlike other states, California uses the criteria as a  mandatory condition for project certification. If the project exceeds one of  the criteria\u2014by increasing the number of passengers, aircraft operations,  or parking spaces and thereby producing an impact on the environment\u2014 the airport is required to implement emission mitigation measures in order  to attain certification. Thus far, three airports\u2014Sacramento International,   San Jose International, and Ontario International\u2014have initiated  expansion projects that were required to comply with the certification  standards. However, in a legal opinion issued in August 2000, FAA\u2019s Office  of Chief Counsel stated that California has no legal authority to impose  operational limitations on airports through the certification process.  According to FAA, California has not publicly responded to the opinion. A  California air quality official told us that the state disagrees with the  opinion and does not plan to change its certification process.", "In 1999, Boston Logan International Airport began building a new runway  to reduce serious flight delays. As a condition for approving the project,  the state required the airport to cap emissions at 1999 levels (referred to as  a \u201cbenchmark\u201d) because it has determined that the airport is a significant  contributor to Boston\u2019s serious ozone problem. To stay within the limit,  the airport had considered reduction strategies that include charging  higher landing fees during peak operating times to reduce congestion and  the resulting emissions. Now that air traffic and emission levels have fallen  off since the events of September 11, 2001, the operator of the Boston  airport, the Massachusetts Port Authority, believes that peak pricing and  other emission reduction strategies will not be needed for several years to  keep emissions below 1999 levels. The Massachusetts Port Authority,  however, continues to work with airport tenants to implement voluntary  emission reduction strategies. More information on states\u2019 efforts to  reduce emissions appears in appendix IV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Airport Projects Have Been Able to Conform to Current Air Quality Standards", "paragraphs": ["In addition to facing control measures as part of state strategies to attain  the Clean Air Act\u2019s ambient air quality standards, airports must also submit  most major construction project proposals for federal environmental  review, which includes an evaluation of the proposed project\u2019s impacts on  air quality. The National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act  require that FAA perform environmental reviews of all airport projects  that involve the federal government, such as the construction of federally  subsidized runways. As part of this review process, FAA must determine  that emissions from projects at airports in nonattainment and maintenance  areas do not adversely interfere with states\u2019 plans for the areas to reach  attainment.", "We examined all environmental reviews conducted by FAA at major  commercial airports in nonattainment areas during the 3-year period 1998  to 2001. These reviews include those required by the National  Environmental Policy Act as well as those required under the Clean Air  Act to ensure compliance with state implementation plans for achieving  ambient air quality standards. During the period, FAA performed such  reviews at 24 of the 26 major commercial airports in nonattainment areas.  The projects reviewed included developing runways, expanding passenger  terminals and air cargo and airline support facilities, and developing  roadways and intersections on airport property.", "Our analysis of airport environmental review documents showed that  while air quality issues are a significant consideration for airports planning  major development projects, emissions have not been a major obstacle in  gaining approval for projects; however, FAA is concerned that increasing  emissions from operations could jeopardize the approval of future  expansion projects. In 12 of the 24 cases we examined, the environmental  reviews stated that the airport expansion projects would not affect air  quality in the regions. The environmental reviews for 7 of these 12 projects  estimated that emissions would decrease as a result of improvements in  operational efficiency. For example, John F. Kennedy International Airport  expected its proposed passenger terminal, air cargo, and airline support  facilities expansion project to decrease the emission of nitrogen oxides by  207.2 tons per year by 2010 (about a 5-percent reduction in total airport  nitrogen oxides emissions) because the project was expected to decrease  the amount of time aircraft take to taxi from the runway to the terminal.  For 8 of the projects, significant project-related emission increases  resulted from construction activities and, although the increases were  temporary, the airports were required, under EPA\u2019s general conformity  rules, to adopt mitigation measures to allow FAA to determine that the  projects complied with state implementation plans. In only 3 cases, was a  significant permanent rise in emissions expected to result from the  project. Five airports \u2014Atlanta Hartsfield, Dallas/Fort Worth International,  Los Angeles International, San Jose International, and Oakland  International\u2014were required to reduce emissions from other sources in  order to mitigate the effects of the increased emissions expected from  either project construction or operations related to a project. Atlanta  Hartsfield, for example, committed to reduce emissions associated with  construction by requiring construction equipment to be operated with  catalytic converters that would reduce emissions and by using a massive  conveyor system to haul fill material, thereby minimizing the use of trucks.", "Although most recent airport construction projects in nonattainment areas  met the requirements of the Clean Air Act, FAA officials noted that in the  future, approval of some projects in these areas could be in jeopardy if  state implementation plans did not make adequate allowances for  emissions that could result from growth in aviation-related activities or  include provisions for airports to offset future increases. FAA noted that  approval of projects is complicated by the fact that it is often difficult to  determine if a development project complies with the state  implementation plan because some plans do not contain an aviation  emission component, while other plans use a model or methodology to  calculate aviation emissions that is incompatible with FAA\u2019s model to  determine a project\u2019s compliance with air quality requirements. In  addition, FAA noted that approval of some projects may be complicated  by an increased focus on air quality by community groups that oppose  airport projects, the insistence of EPA and/or state and local air quality  agencies on mitigation measures when FAA has determined that proposed  projects will reduce emissions, and the general need to better understand  aviation emissions. According to FAA, approval of airport construction  projects may be further complicated by differences among federal and  state air quality standards, especially when state standards are more  restrictive, and differences among EPA and state/local air quality agencies  on the appropriate analysis and mitigation measures. Also, FAA officials  have noted an increasing trend for communities to demand under the  National Environmental Policy Act that FAA undertake and disclose the  effects of air toxics and health effects studies. Finally, although emissions  from construction activities are temporary, if they are above allowable  levels, FAA is required to undertake and issue a full determination that the  project/activity will conform to the state implementation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Programs for Reducing Airport Emissions", "paragraphs": ["FAA, EPA, and some states have developed programs to reduce emissions  from aviation-related activities and established jointly with the aviation  industry a process that has tried to reach a voluntary consensus on how to  further reduce emissions. For example, as part of its Inherently Low- Emission Airport Vehicle Pilot Program, required by Congress in 2000,  FAA awarded federal grants of up to $2 million to each of 10 airports for  alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure. FAA is using the program to  evaluate the vehicles\u2019 reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness in  the airport environment. FAA initially anticipated that the program would  reduce emissions by 22,584 tons of ozone, 314,840 tons of carbon  monoxide, 384 tons of particulates, and 924 tons of sulfur dioxide during  the projected lifetime of the airport equipment. To achieve this reduction,  FAA expected the airports to purchase about 1,600 pieces of alternative  fuel ground support equipment and 600 alternative fuel ground access  vehicles, such as airport cars, buses, and shuttles. As of October 2002, FAA  reported a slower-than-expected start-up of the program, with only five  airports (Baltimore-Washington International, Dallas/Forth Worth  International, Baton Rouge Metropolitan, Sacramento International, and  Denver International) making notable progress on the program. According  to FAA, the effects of the events of September 11, 2001, have caused  unforeseen delays and acquisition deferrals for many low-emission vehicle  projects, particularly those that rely on airline financing to convert ground  support equipment to alternative fuels.", "Although FAA plans to provide $17.3 million for the Inherently Low- Emission Airport Vehicle Pilot Program, airports and air carriers  expressed the need for more federal funding to reduce emissions. Some  airports have said that they would like flexibility in how the Airport  Improvement Program or passenger facility charge funds can be used to  mitigate or offset emissions from expansion projects. For instance,  Sacramento Airport officials stated that they would like the city\u2019s light rail  system to be connected to the airport to reduce emissions from ground  access vehicles. However, Airport Improvement Program or passenger  facility charge funds cannot be used for emission mitigation projects  located outside airport property. According to FAA, DOT\u2019s Congestion  Mitigation and Air Quality grant program can be used to finance emission  mitigation projects located outside of airport property.", "Some states also have emission reduction assistance programs that are  available to airports. The California Environmental Protection Agency  developed the Carl Moyer Program, which is an incentive-based program  that covers the incremental cost of purchasing airport vehicles with  cleaner engines, including ground support equipment at airports. The  program taps into available new environmental technologies to help the  state advance clean air goals. It provides funds to private companies or  public agencies to offset the incremental cost of purchasing the cleaner  engines. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission also  established incentive funds for emission reduction efforts, similar to  California\u2019s program. As in California, the funds are not specifically  designated for emission reductions at airports, but air carriers that are not  participating in the agreement with the Commission to voluntarily reduce  ground support equipment emissions can receive grants to convert their  ground support equipment. Airlines that are part of the voluntary  agreement would not be eligible for the incentive funds.", "Some airport operators we spoke with would like EPA to set up a process  in which airports could obtain \u201ccredit\u201d for the amount of emissions  reduced by their voluntary efforts; the credits can be \u201cbanked\u201d by the  airport to use at a future date to offset expected increases in emissions or  they can be sold to other nonairport entities in the region that are required  to offset emissions. The airport operators also indicated that having such a  program encourages airport sponsors to undertake efforts to reduce  emissions. Such an emission credit program is available in Washington  State. Airports there can implement emission reduction efforts and obtain  emission credits, which they can save and use to offset increased  emissions from future expansion projects. Thus far, such a system has  been adopted at one location, Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, which  worked with the local clean air agency to establish a credit program for  voluntary emission reduction actions. If airports are not allowed to save  emission credits, any voluntary reductions will lower their emission  baseline, which is used to calculate the impact of future emissions, and  limit their options for any emission reductions required to obtain approval  for future projects. Because of this situation, some airport officials told  us that they have waited to initiate emission reduction efforts until the  efforts are needed to gain approval for an expansion project. EPA  encourages airports to contact their state and local air quality agencies  and negotiate emission credit agreements, as was done by Seattle-Tacoma  International Airport. However, according to FAA officials, this localized  case-by-case approach to issuing emission credit is inefficient. Instead,  FAA supports a consistent national approach that it believes would lessen  the burden on airports to obtain emission credits from their respective  states.", "In 1998, FAA and EPA established a process\u2014known as the stakeholders  group\u2014which includes representatives from state environmental agencies,  airports, air carriers, and the aerospace industry to discuss voluntary  efforts to lower nitrogen oxides and other emissions. They established the  process because federal and industry officials told us that the current  approach to reducing emissions\u2014uncoordinated efforts by individual  airports and states\u2014was inefficient and possibly ineffective from a  nationwide perspective. For example, some federal officials believe the  current approach encourages airlines to move their more polluting  equipment to airports that do not require cleaner vehicles, and the aviation  industry is concerned about the impact that differing state requirements  might have on their operations. According to EPA, another reason for  establishing the process was concerns by EPA, state environmental  agencies, and environmental groups about international emissions  standards, particularly standards for nitrogen oxides.", "The stakeholders group decided to focus on achieving lower aircraft  emissions through a voluntary program because this strategy offered the  potential for achieving desired goals with less effort and time than a  regulatory approach. Initially, the group\u2019s discussions focused on emission  reduction retrofit kits, which could be applied to some existing aircraft  engines, but this was found to not be technically feasible. However, as the  process evolved, the stakeholders expanded the focus to evaluating  various emission reduction strategies for aircraft and ground support  equipment. According to participants, the group is currently working to  establish a national voluntary agreement for reducing ground service  equipment emissions in the nearer term, similar to the agreement in  California. In the longer term, the group is considering reductions in  aircraft emissions through an approach known as \u201cenvironmental design  space\u201d that recognizes the need to balance such reductions with other  competing goals such as noise reduction, while assuring safety and  reliability. FAA also noted that airport operators used the stakeholders  group to highlight the need for more guidance on the process for ensuring  that federal actions, such as the construction of new runways, conform to  the appropriate state implementation plans. FAA and EPA issued guidance  on the process in September 2002. The group had also commissioned a  study to establish a baseline of aviation-related emissions and another  study of options for reducing them. However, the study will not be  completed because of resource constraints, according to participants.", "FAA noted that the progress of the stakeholders group has been impeded  by the impact of the events of September 11, 2001, on the airlines and the  complex nature of addressing all stakeholders\u2019 viewpoints to achieve  consensus on a framework that can be applied nationally. The activities of  the group were suspended after September 11, but resumed in May 2002.  According to one member of the group, many participants have been  frustrated by the group\u2019s slow progress, but they hope to define a  nationwide program to reduce emissions from ground service equipment  in 2003 and continue discussion of aircraft emission reduction options.  However, the group has not defined specific objectives or established time  frames for achieving its goal of reducing aviation-related emissions.  Furthermore, the group\u2019s activities may be limited by the financial  situation of participating air carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Air Quality Standards Will Pose a Challenge to Some States and Airports", "paragraphs": ["In late 2003, EPA plans to begin implementing a more stringent standard  for ozone emissions, which could require more sources, including airports,  to tighten controls on nitrogen oxides and some types of volatile organic  compound emissions, which contribute to ozone formation.

Some state air quality officials that we spoke to believe that the  continued growth of aviation-related ozone precursor emissions, coupled  with such emissions from other sources, may affect their ability to meet to  the new standard.", "The implementation of the 8-hour standard for ozone could have  significant implications for airports. Currently, 26 major commercial  airports are located in nonattainment areas for ozone. EPA has yet to  designate and classify which areas will not be in attainment with the 8- hour standard. However, the agency estimates that under the 8-hour  standard, areas containing 12 additional airports could be designated as  nonattainment areas. Airports in these areas could be constrained in their  ability to initiate development projects if they did not comply with the  state implementation plans. EPA, however, believes that the new 8-hour  standard provides an opportunity for the airports and the states that have  not addressed airport emissions in their state implementation plans to  identify airport emission growth rates when new plans are developed  under the 8-hour standard.", "Among the 13 state air quality officials we surveyed, 5 expect that aviation  emissions will somewhat or moderately hinder their state\u2019s ability to  demonstrate compliance with EPA\u2019s new 8-hour ozone emission standard,  and 3 stated that aviation emissions will greatly hinder their ability to  comply. Some of these officials also said they are uncertain how their  state will meet the new standards. Because the new 8-hour standard is  more stringent, the states will need to develop more rigorous and  innovative control measures for all sources and may have to rely on the  federal government to reduce emissions from sources over which the state  does not have jurisdiction, such as aircraft engines."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Two Countries Have Introduced Emission- Based Fees", "paragraphs": ["Other countries use many of the same measures to reduce emissions at  airports as the United States and, in addition, two countries have imposed  landing fees based on the amount of nitrogen oxides emissions produced  by aircraft.

Emission-based landing fees,  although considered for Boston Logan International Airport, have not been  implemented at any U.S. airports and many in the U.S. aviation community  question their effectiveness.", "ICAO established a working group to identify and evaluate the potential  role of market-based options, including emission charges, fuel taxes, and  emission-trading regimes, in reducing aviation-related emissions. Thus  far, the working group has concentrated on carbon dioxide emissions and  has concluded that the aviation sector\u2019s participation in an emission- trading system would be a cost-effective measure to reduce carbon  dioxide in the long term. The ICAO Assembly, the organization\u2019s highest  body, has endorsed the development of an open emission-trading system  for international aviation and has instructed its Committee on Aviation  Environmental Protection to develop guidelines for open emission trading.  The ICAO committee has also been studying emission charges or taxes as  well as evaluating voluntary programs to reduce emissions. ICAO\u2019s current  policy, adopted in 1996, recommends that emission-based fees be in the  form of charges rather than taxes and that the funds collected should be  applied to mitigating the impact of aircraft engine emissions.", "Switzerland was the first country to implement a market-based system for  reducing aviation-related nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compound  emissions. In 1995, the Swiss federal government enacted legislation that  allowed airports to impose emission charges on aircraft. In September  1997, the Zurich airport used this authority to establish emission-based  landing fees as an incentive for air carriers to reduce emissions from  aircraft using the airport. The use of emission-based landing fees has  expanded to other airports in Switzerland and Sweden. The Geneva,  Switzerland, airport implemented an emission-based landing fee similar to  the fee scheme used in the Zurich airport in November 1998. Several  Swedish airports also implemented emission fees after the Swedish Civil  Aviation Administration approved such charges in January 1998. Similar to  the system at Zurich airport, the Swedish airports reduced the landing  charges so that income from emission charges is not considered an  additional source of revenue.", "The establishment of emission-based landing fees in Switzerland and  Sweden has affected the operations of airlines with frequent flights to  airports in these countries. According to a representative of a jet engine  manufacturer, a Swiss airline purchased a number of new aircraft  equipped with engines designed to emit lower amounts of nitrogen oxides.  The representative said that the airline wanted the engines in order to  reduce its landing fees at Swiss airports. However, the airline filed for  bankruptcy in 2001 and has ceased operations. Only a few other airlines  have expressed interest in equipping their new aircraft with engines that  emit less nitrogen oxides because they are more expensive and less fuel- efficient and have higher operating costs. As of December 2002, no other  airlines had purchased such engines.", "No conclusive studies on the effectiveness of these emission-based landing  fees have been completed. According to the Zurich Airport Authority,  results of the emission-based landing fee can be shown only in the long  term, making it difficult to quantify whether emissions such as nitrogen  oxides or volatile organic compounds have been reduced. (FAA officials  stated that the effects of emission-based fees can be estimated using  existing models. For example, a 2001 ICAO working paper on market- based options for reducing carbon dioxide emissions found that enroute  emissions charges would be insufficient to meet reduction targets.)  Nevertheless, an aviation expert said that the emission-based landing fees  have caused airlines to begin considering the cost of nitrogen oxides and  volatile organic compound emissions as part of their business decisions.", "Emission-based landing fees have not been introduced at any U.S. airports.  Boston Logan International Airport considered implementing such fees to  reduce emissions, but a 2001 study commissioned by the Massachusetts  Port Authority, which operates the airport, determined them to be  ineffective. The study found that emission-based landing fees would be a  small portion of commercial air carriers\u2019 operating expenses and would be  unlikely to affect their operational, purchasing, or leasing behavior  substantially enough for them to consider using lower nitrogen-oxides- emitting aircraft and engines. Thus, the study concluded, the emission- based landing fees would not significantly induce commercial airlines to  use aircraft engines emitting lower levels of nitrogen oxides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements in Aircraft and Engine Design Have Reduced Many Aircraft Emissions, but Nitrogen Oxides Emissions are Increasing", "paragraphs": ["Although research and development efforts by NASA and aircraft and  engine manufacturers have led to engine and airframe improvements that  have increased fuel efficiency and lowered carbon dioxide and  hydrocarbon emissions, trade-offs among several factors, including engine  performance, have also resulted in increased nitrogen oxides emissions.

Engine options for  some aircraft are now being introduced that reduce nitrogen oxides  emissions. Additionally, NASA has ongoing research into technologies that  could reduce nitrogen oxides emissions from jet engines to well below  current standards. However, aviation industry representatives are unsure  whether the technologies will ever be developed to the point where they  can be incorporated into future production engines because of  uncertainties about funding and other factors. Given the long lifespan of  aircraft, even if the technologies are developed, it could be decades before  enough airplanes are replaced to have a measurable effect on reducing  nitrogen oxides.

Air  carriers\u2019 desire to control fuel costs provided the impetus for these efforts.  (Appendix VI provides a brief overview of fuel reduction technologies.)", "According to aircraft design experts, fuel consumption is the single biggest  factor affecting the amount of most aircraft emissions. Table 1 shows the  amount of emissions produced by a typical aircraft turbine engine during  cruising operations for each 1,000 grams of fuel burned.", "According to aviation experts, new aircraft designs are reducing carbon  dioxide emissions by about 1 percent per year\u2014the same rate at which  fuel consumption is being reduced. ICAO expects this carbon dioxide and  fuel reduction trend to continue for the next 20 years. Carbon monoxide  and hydrocarbon cruise emissions are declining even faster than the fuel  reduction rates. These emissions, which are formed when a portion of the  fuel is only partially combusted, are much easier to minimize with the  hotter engine temperatures of the new more fuel-efficient engine designs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Aircraft Designs Produce Significantly More Nitrogen Oxides during Landings and Takeoffs", "paragraphs": ["A byproduct of the improvements in jet engine design has been an  increase in nitrogen oxides emissions during landings and takeoffs and  while cruising, according to aviation industry experts.

However, as engine-operating temperatures increase so do  nitrogen oxides emissions. This phenomenon is most pronounced during  landings and takeoffs, when engine power settings are at their highest. It is  during the landing/takeoff cycle that nitrogen oxides emissions have the  biggest impact on local air quality.", "Our analysis of aircraft landing/takeoff emissions shows that newer  aircraft produce considerably more nitrogen oxides than older models. We  identified examples of aircraft models and engines introduced in the last   5 years and compared their emissions with emissions from older aircraft  they might replace. We found, for example, that although the newer  Boeing 737 series aircraft are more fuel-efficient, are capable of flying  longer distances (or with more weight), emit less carbon monoxide and  hydrocarbons, and produce less takeoff noise than their predecessors,  they also produce 47 percent more nitrogen oxides during landing/takeoff  (see table 2).", "Significantly higher emissions of nitrogen oxides during landing/takeoff  for the aircraft introduced in the last 5 years also occur in the largest  aircraft. For example, the Boeing 777, the newest of the large jets, emits  significantly more nitrogen oxides than comparable older aircraft.

Even before we adjusted for the greater seating capacity of the larger  Boeing 747-400, we found that the most comparable Boeing 777\u2014the  200ER model\u2014produces 34 percent more nitrogen oxides emissions, even  though ICAO data shows that the Boeing 777 is quieter and more fuel- efficient than the older aircraft it is replacing. For example, on a per seat  basis, the Boeing 777 can be as much as 30 percent more fuel-efficient than  older model Boeing 747s.", "As shown in table 4, the percentage increase in nitrogen oxides during  landing/takeoff is 57 percent when the two aircraft are compared on a per  seat basis (the amount of emissions divided by the number of seats on the  aircraft).", "EPA and FAA regulate nitrogen oxides emissions and other emissions for  U.S. commercial aircraft by requiring engine designs to meet ICAO  standards for these emissions. Prior to production, all new engine designs  are tested to determine the amount of nitrogen oxides and other emission  characteristics. Only engines that meet the standards are certified for  production. ICAO standards for nitrogen oxides were first adopted in 1981  and more stringent standards were adopted in 1993 (20 percent more  stringent, effective 1996) and again in 1998 (16 percent more stringent,  effective 2004). ICAO working groups are assessing whether or not the  standards for nitrogen oxides emissions should be made more stringent  than the standards that will take effect in 2004. Options being considered  could make the standards between 5 percent and 30 percent more  stringent between 2008 and 2012.", "Under ICAO standards, newly designed engines and modified versions of  older designs are allowed to produce significantly more nitrogen oxides  than their predecessors. This is because the ICAO standards recognize that  nitrogen oxides emissions are a function of engine power capability and  operating pressure. Therefore, the standards allow for higher nitrogen  oxides emissions for engines that (1) operate at higher-pressure ratios,  which increase their fuel efficiency and (2) produce more power. For  example, the most common updated Boeing 737-700 aircraft model and  engine produces 41 percent more nitrogen oxides during landing/takeoff  than the most common older version it is replacing (see table 5). Both  engines will meet the new ICAO standard, which will go into effect in 2004  (the old engine betters the standard by about 15 percent, the new one by  about 10 percent). A lower nitrogen oxides producing engine is available  for the Boeing 737-700. This engine produces 18.5 percent more nitrogen  oxides than the older Boeing 737-700 that it is most comparable to in  power and versatility. However, this engine is less common in the fleet  that then the more powerful one that offers more aircraft versatility. The  database we use shows that in the U.S. fleet there were 8 Boeing 737-700s  with the lower nitrogen oxides emitting engines and 118 with the more  powerful engines.", "There is an ongoing debate between the aviation and environmental  communities over the best method for developing nitrogen oxides  certification standards. Some in the aviation community want to maintain  the current system under which the standards are made more stringent  only when the engine manufacturers have produced engines that meet the  new standards and new standards only apply to newly certified engines.  (An industry official identified only two older types of engines that would  not meet the more stringent 2004 nitrogen oxides standards.) Officials for  the aviation industry said that it would be inadvisable to force more  aggressive nitrogen oxides standards because new engine development  programs are already complex and have many business and schedule  risks. These officials added that the environmental regulatory process  lacks cost-benefits data to defend a more aggressive approach that could  result in extreme financial harm for engine and aircraft manufacturers if  the approach delayed a new program. Further, some believe that if  reductions in nitrogen oxides were to become a higher priority, it would  be better to have market-based incentives that reward lower nitrogen  oxides emissions than have aggressive and rigid pass/fail regulatory  barriers.", "Moreover, some federal, state, and local environmental officials believe  more incentives are needed to reduce aircraft nitrogen oxides emissions  beyond the ICAO certification standards that are to take effect in 2004.  They say that the current system gives little value to reducing nitrogen  oxides in the many trade-offs among emissions, fuel-consumption, and  other factors made during engine design. They reason that if there were  more incentives to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions beyond the  certification requirements, these incentives would accelerate innovations  that minimize degradations in other engine performance characteristics  such as fuel efficiency.", "While NASA and engine manufacturers have made continuous  improvements for decades in technologies that have improved fuel  efficiency, decreased noise, and decreased all emissions including  nitrogen oxides, the design of the newest generation of engines has  resulted in trade-offs that favor fuel efficiency and increase nitrogen  oxides. Two engine manufacturers have responded to this problem by  developing options for several new engines that reduce nitrogen oxides.  (General Electric has developed a \u201cdual annular combustor\u201d technology  for one of its CFM56 engines and Pratt Whitney has developed a  \u201cTechnology for Affordable Low NOx\u201d  for some of its engines.  This TALON technology is being used on some aircraft in the U.S. fleet.)

However, the development of more fuel-efficient engines  by NASA and the engine manufacturers, which are resulting in higher  nitrogen oxides emissions, and the lack of economic incentives for  airlines to support efforts to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions make the  possibility of reaching these goals uncertain. In the last several years,  increases in nitrogen oxides emissions from the more fuel-efficient  engines have outpaced improvements made to reduce these emissions.  Appendix VI provides more information on research to reduce nitrogen  oxides emissions.", "Adding to the uncertainty of introducing technologies to reduce nitrogen  oxides is the limited federal funding for this research effort. NASA officials  told us that in the past they developed their research to the full engine test  level before engine manufacturers would take over responsibility for  integrating the improvements into production-ready engines. However,  budget cuts made in their emission research programs beginning in fiscal  year 2000 have resulted in them ending their research at the engine  component level below full engine testing.

NASA\u2019s research to reduce nitrogen  oxides is a component of its Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program.  The goal of this program is to develop technologies that will enable U.S.  manufacturers to compete in the global marketplace for new commercial  gas turbine engines. The current program is funded at $50 million per year.  Industry representatives stated that shrinking budgets have made it  difficult for NASA to maintain a level of effort at a critical mass for each  project within the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program.  Furthermore, they added that engine manufacturers could not afford to  work with immature technology when they are engaged in new engine  development projects. This is because new engine developments are tied  into projects with the airlines, and the engines must meet tight cost,  schedule, and performance goals if they are to win market share.", "The Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program is a scaled-back version of  a larger aeronautical research program that was terminated in fiscal year  2000. NASA officials said that budget cuts have reduced research in the  current program by about 40 percent from the previous program. In the  previous program, research was typically developed to the point where the  technology was integrated into the full engine system. In the current  program, funding is only available to incorporate the technology into  engine components. The National Research Council has concluded that  the current funding level jeopardizes achieving program results and does  not carry the research far enough for the engine manufacturing industry to  readily adopt it.", "As a result of the uncertainties surrounding emission reduction technology  research, it is unclear when new production aircraft will, in the aggregate,  start lowering landing/takeoff nitrogen oxides emissions on a per seat  basis during the landing/takeoff cycle.

For  example, several of those officials said that available control measures for  other air pollution sources have been nearly exhausted. They noted that  aircraft have not been as strictly regulated as other sources, such as  automobiles, and that reductions from aircraft may be needed in the future  for some areas to maintain attainment of the Clean Air Act\u2019s standards.  Likewise, in 2002, the National Academy of Science\u2019s National Research  Council reported that the advances that have led to increased efficiencies  in individual airplanes are not sufficient to decrease the total emissions of  the global fleet, which is increasing in response to accelerating demand.  In the same vein, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported  in 1999 that \u201calthough improvements in aircraft and engine technology and  in the efficiency of the air traffic control system will bring environmental  benefits, these will not fully offset the effects of the increased emissions  resulting from the projected growth in aviation.\u201d", "Concerns about aircraft emissions have prompted calls for an improved  approach for controlling them.

The Council emphasized that the success of this approach  requires commitment and leadership at the highest level as well as a  national strategy and plan that, among other things, coordinates research  and technology goals, budgets, and expenditures with national  environmental goals. Along the same lines, a recent industry article on the  environmental effectiveness of ICAO emission standards suggested that a  programmatic framework is required to guide the development of a  consensus on policy options for further reducing aircraft emissions.

When combined  with some types of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, carbon  dioxide forms ozone, which is the most significant air pollutant in many  urban areas as well as a greenhouse gas in the upper atmosphere.  Particulate matter emissions result from the incomplete combustion of  fuel. High-power aircraft operations, such as takeoffs and climb outs,  produce the highest rate of particulate matter emission due to the high fuel  consumption under those conditions.

The burning of aviation fuel also produces carbon  dioxide, which is not considered a pollutant in the lower atmosphere but is  a primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. During the  landing and takeoff cycles, and at cruising altitudes, aircraft produce  different levels of air pollutant emissions. Emission rates for volatile  organic compounds and carbon monoxide are highest when aircraft  engines are operating at low power, such as when idling or taxiing.  Conversely, nitrogen oxides emissions rise with an increasing power level  and combustion temperature. Thus, the highest nitrogen oxides emissions  occur during aircraft takeoff and climb out. In addition, aircraft have  mounted auxiliary power units that are sometimes used to provide  electricity and air conditioning while aircraft are parked at terminal gates  and these units emit low levels of the same pollutants as aircraft engines.

In cities with major  airports, aircraft-related emissions could be higher or lower. In a 1999  study of 19 airports located in 10 cities, EPA found that the proportion of  nitrogen oxides emissions from mobile sources attributed to aircraft  ranged from 0.6 percent to 3.6 percent in 1990. EPA also found that aircraft  accounted for 0.2 percent to 2.8 percent of volatile organic compound  emissions from mobile sources in the 10 cities during the period. From  information contained in a recent study of emissions at Dallas/Fort Worth  International Airport we estimated that aircraft produced about 3 percent  of the nitrogen oxides and about 5 percent of the carbon monoxide  present in the metropolitan area. A 1999 study of emissions at Chicago  O\u2019Hare International Airport found that aircraft and the airport as a whole  emitted about 1.6 percent and 2.6 percent of the total volatile organic  compound emissions, respectively, within a 10-mile radius of the airport\u2019s  terminal area and that nonairport sources were considerably more  important to local air quality than aircraft.

Aircraft operations  were found responsible for the next largest share of emissions from  mobile sources, with total contributions of 15 to 38 percent and 26 to 37  percent for volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, respectively.  Ground support equipment accounted for 12 to 13 percent of total  emissions from volatile organic compounds and 14 to 20 percent of total  nitrogen oxides from mobile sources at the airports. The report also found  that auxiliary power units for aircraft contributed a small amount of the  emissions from volatile organic compounds and 9 to 20 percent of total  nitrogen oxides emissions from mobile sources.

The airport is trying  to negotiate with federal agencies to receive credits for the amount of  emission reductions achieved by using solar power energy and selling  surplus electricity to the state. If successful, the airport could use these  credits to gain approval of future expansion projects that increase  emissions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Overview of Aircraft Fuel, Noise, and Nitrogen Oxides Reduction Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Fuel efficiency improvements involve every aspect of an aircraft\u2019s design.  Traditionally, about 40 percent of the improvements have come from  airframe improvements and 60 percent from propulsive and engine  improvements. Airframe improvements include improving the  aerodynamic shape and structural efficiency (for example, reduced  aircraft weight). Propulsive improvements have primarily resulted from  increasing the size of the bypass fan and improving the shape of the  bypass fan blades. Engine improvements have centered on increasing the  pressure of the air that goes through the engine core (the engine operating  pressure). The increased engine operating pressures allow more work to  be extracted from a unit of fuel, thereby improving fuel consumption.", "One of the first major technology breakthroughs with commercial jet  engines occurred in the mid-1960s with the introduction of the turbofan jet  engine (see figure 3). This design uses a bypass fan in front of the jet  engine core to move much of the propulsive air and bypass the core of the  jet that contains the compressor, combustor, and turbine. The primary  motivation for this advancement was increased fuel efficiency. However,  the reduced noise of this new design was an additional benefit. Noise was  reduced because the bypass air moves at a slower speed than the air going  through the core. Further noise reductions have evolved over time by  increasing the size of the bypass fans and improving the shapes of the  bypass fan blades. Researchers at NASA have indicated they are facing  diminishing returns as they seek to reduce noise by further improving  bypass fans and aircraft surfaces. They are also exploring more advanced  technologies such as using electronics to actively control noise.", "NASA, in association with jet engine manufacturers and the academic  community, is working on several technologies to reduce nitrogen oxides  emissions. NASA\u2019s research to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions is a  component of its Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program. The goal of  this program is to develop technologies that will enable U.S.  manufacturers to compete in the global marketplace for new commercial  gas turbine engines. An important aspect of this program is reducing jet  engine emissions of nitrogen oxides. NASA has set what it considers  ambitious goals for its nitrogen oxides reduction research. These goals  include the following:    Demonstrate combustion technology, in a NASA test laboratory, that will  reduce nitrogen oxides 70 percent relative to today\u2019s standard. This  equates to a 20-50 percent reduction compared with the best engines being  produced today.", "Demonstrate these technologies in engine combustor components by 2005.    Hand off the technologies to manufacturers in a timely fashion so they can  be incorporated in new engines in the 2007-2010 time frame.", "Study long-term concepts that could greatly reduce or eliminate nitrogen  oxides emissions in the 2025-2050 time frame.", "According to representatives from jet engine manufacturers, nitrogen  oxides reduction research is complex and time consuming and requires  specialized and expensive test equipment. They also said that basic  research needed to understand the formation of nitrogen oxides in jet  engines and to make significant changes to current engine designs is so  expensive and lacking in marketplace investment rewards that no  significant or sustained basic research in this area would take place  without NASA taking the lead.", "Adding to the complexities of this research is the extreme variation in jet  engine designs. Other research and development by NASA and engine  manufacturer is constantly raising engine-operating pressures as a way of  improving fuel consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  However, these developments tend to increase nitrogen oxides emissions,  and further modifying engine designs to reduce nitrogen oxides has a  direct impact on every other aspect of engine design: safety, operability,  service life, operating costs, maintenance costs, and production costs. Jet  engine manufacturers are taking divergent design approaches as they  research how to maintain these other high-priority design characteristics  while reducing nitrogen oxides emissions. As a result, NASA divides its  resources over numerous projects.", "NASA\u2019s Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program is scheduled to  complete research and technology on aircraft engine combustor  refinements that reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides so that the  refinements can be introduced on aircraft by 2010. Because of the 30-year  projected life of commercial aircraft, it could take decades before enough  lower emitting aircraft are introduced in the commercial fleet to  contribute to significant reductions in nitrogen oxides. NASA\u2019s nitrogen  oxides research under the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology Program is  centered on developing lean-burning rather than rich burning combustors  that are in commercial service today. These lean-burning combustors will  increase fuel/air mixing rates that, when combined with the lean fuel/air  ratios, will reduce temperatures locally in the combustor and thus reduce  the nitrogen oxides emissions generated. Because of funding constraints,  NASA does not plan to implement the next phase of development, which is  to examine the combustor improvements in a full engine test environment.  NASA is relying on the engine manufacturers to implement this full engine  development. Both NASA and aviation industry engineers said that this full  engine development phase will be far more complex and involve many  more design trade-offs than the combustor development phase.  Additionally, they acknowledged that some of the nitrogen oxides  reductions achieved during the combustor development phase would be  lost during the full engine development phase. NASA researchers indicated  these losses could be particularly severe because engine manufacturers  are concurrently making other design changes to their engines to minimize  fuel consumption and these changes will increase nitrogen oxides  emissions. Consequently, NASA researchers are not sure how many of the  improvements they expect to achieve by 2005 will survive as the engine  manufacturers take over responsibility for completing the development of  these improvements in a full engine test environment and then integrate  these improvements into production-ready engines.", "NASA is also working on a long-term revolutionary jet engine design that  could significantly reduce all emissions including nitrogen oxides while  also reducing fuel consumption. Under its \u201cintelligent propulsions  controls\u201d design concept, engine functions are more precisely controlled  using computers. For example, with this design, the number of ports  delivering fuel to the engine combustion chamber would be greatly  increased, and each port would be computer controlled. NASA officials  are optimistic about the potential of this concept, but they added that  research is in the early stages and that it will probably take 20 years or  more to develop. NASA\u2019s overall long-term research plan calls for  spending about $20 million per year over the next 5-year period to explore  improved fuel burn and nitrogen oxides emission reduction technologies.", "NASA researchers are also studying the possibility of developing zero  emissions (except water) hydrogen-fueled aircraft with an electric  propulsion system. While they note that there would have to be many  breakthroughs in hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies and high-  powered lightweight electric motors before a hydrogen-fueled commercial  airliner is feasible, they believe many of the needed breakthroughs could  occur in the next 50 years.", "NASA is also researching nonengine methods that will indirectly reduce  nitrogen oxides (and all other emissions) by reducing fuel consumption.  This work includes more efficient airframes through aerodynamic  improvements, structural improvements (i.e., reducing aircraft weight),  and operational efficiencies (i.e., more fuel efficient flight routes, reduced  taxi time). Historically, 40 percent of aviation fuel improvements have  come from such efficiency improvements. Aviation emission experts  emphasize that it is important that research into these types of  improvements continue along with the engine research. The advantage of  these improvements is that all emissions are reduced simultaneously  without having to make emission trade-offs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Additional Information on Our Analysis of Aircraft Emissions", "paragraphs": ["Using the Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System (version 4.01)  computer model developed by FAA and fleet data obtained from AvSoft,  we calculated the landing/takeoff emissions for every aircraft model and  engine combination in the U.S. commercial aircraft fleet during 2001.
