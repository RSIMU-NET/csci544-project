Further, in October 2011, GAO reported that states and local agencies faced challenges in developing and maintaining their biosurveillance capabilities, such as obtaining resources for an adequate workforce, and that the federal government had not conducted an assessment of state and local jurisdictions' ability to contribute to a national biosurveillance capability. To help ensure the successful implementation of a complex, intergovernmental undertaking, GAO recommended in 2010 that the White House's Homeland Security Council direct the National Security Council Staff to develop a national biosurveillance strategy, and further recommended in 2011 that the strategy consider nonfederal capabilities. The White House issued the National Strategy for Biosurveillance in July 2012, which describes the U.S. government's approach to strengthening biosurveillance. However, the strategy did not fully respond to the challenges GAO identified. For example, it did not establish a framework to prioritize resource investments or address the need to leverage nonfederal resources. The White House was to issue an implementation plan within 120 days of publishing the strategy. GAO has reported that it is possible that the implementation plan could address issues previously identified, such as resource investment prioritization; however, the plan has not been released as of June 2015.", "In August 2011, GAO reported that there was no centralized coordination to oversee federal agencies' efforts to implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9) on the nation's food and agriculture defense policy, which includes food and agriculture disease surveillance. GAO also found that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) had no department-wide strategy for implementing its HSPD-9 responsibilities. Therefore, GAO recommended that the National Security Council Staff and the Department of Homeland Security resume their efforts to coordinate and oversee implementation, and that USDA develop a department-wide strategy. In response, the National Security Council Staff began hosting interagency working group meetings, and DHS has worked to develop a report on agencies' HSPD-9 implementation efforts, which officials stated will be finalized by late summer 2015. As of February 2015, USDA had conducted a gap analysis of its HSPD-9 implementation efforts but had not yet developed a department-wide strategy. Further, GAO reported in May 2013 that USDA's Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) had broadened its previous disease-by-disease surveillance approach to an approach in which the agency monitors the overall health of livestock and poultry, but had not yet integrated this approach into an overall strategy aligned with the nation's larger biosurveillance efforts, such as efforts called for in HSPD-9. GAO recommended that APHIS integrate its new approach into an overall strategy aligned with national homeland security efforts, and develop goals and measures for the new approach. In June 2015, officials stated that APHIS has begun to develop some measures, but noted that resource constraints limit their ability to assess their new approach to disease surveillance. Fully integrating its new approach into an overall strategy aligned with broader homeland security efforts, as GAO recommended, will better position APHIS to support national efforts to address threats to animal and human health."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A catastrophic biological event, such as a naturally occurring pandemic or  a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, could cause  thousands of casualties, weaken the economy, and threaten national  security. Biosurveillance aims to detect such events as early as possible  and to enhance situational awareness and decision making by gathering,  integrating, interpreting, and communicating essential information related  to all-hazards threats or disease activity affecting human, animal, or plant  health. The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the  Midwest and on the Pacific coast underscores the importance of  maintaining effective animal and plant surveillance systems within the  broader context of biosurveillance, as the disruption of the agriculture or  food production systems can present a serious threat to the national  economy, trade, and human health. Although the current strain is only  affecting birds at this time, prior influenza strains have had devastating  effects on humans.

Without a unifying framework; structure; and an entity with the authority,  resources, time, and responsibility for guiding its implementation, we  concluded that it would be very difficult to create an integrated approach  to building and sustaining a national biosurveillance capability. National  and agency strategies note that coordination is important because a  national biosurveillance capability relies on the ability of a complex  interagency and intergovernmental network to work together and meet an  ever-evolving threat.

In 2011, we found that although the federal  government did provide some resources to help control disease in  humans and animals in tribal and insular areas, there were no specific  efforts to ensure that states and local agencies can contribute to the  national biosurveillance capability. In addition, we noted that the federal  government had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of state  and local jurisdictions\u2019 ability to contribute to a national biosurveillance  capability.

In August 2011, we found that there  was no centralized coordination to oversee the federal government\u2019s  overall progress implementing HSPD-9 on the nation\u2019s food and  agriculture defense policy, responsibilities for which are distributed across  several agencies.
