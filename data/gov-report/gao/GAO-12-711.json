Similarly, DOD reported in its 2011 Global Defense Posture Report to Congress that savings associated with permanently stationing forces in the United States rather than overseas are often offset by such factors as increased rotational costs. Based on direction from the Senate Armed Services Committee, GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD has (1) conducted analysis to support recent overseas posture decisions and (2) developed a process for making posture decisions that align with strategy and consider costs.

The Navy considered three options: (1) deploying ships to the region from U.S. bases, (2) forward stationing ships and crews overseas, and (3) deploying ships to the region and rotating crews from U.S. bases. The Navy concluded that forward stationing ships was the most efficient option, but GAO found that it did not fully consider the option to rotate crews from U.S. bases and, in a classified analysis, it used different assumptions for forward stationing versus deploying from the United States. These assumptions could affect the results of the analysis and have long-term cost implications. GAO\u0092s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that a business case or cost-benefit analysis finds the best value solution by presenting facts and supporting details among competing alternatives, including the life cycle costs and benefits, and sensitivity to changes in assumptions. Without an analysis that controls for differing assumptions or considers factors such as complete life cycle costs, the long-term costs associated with its decision to forward station ships will remain unknown.", "Reduction of U.S. Army force structure in Europe . The planned reductions of U.S. Army forces in Europe will likely save money; however, decisions that could affect the extent of the savings are pending. For example, a 2010 Army analysis found $2 billion in savings over 10 years by returning forces from Germany, but assumed that new facilities estimated at $800 million would need to be built in the United States to house them. However, present planned reductions in overall Army end strength could eliminate the need for new construction. Further, DOD announced that it will rotate forces from the United States to Europe, but the nature of the rotations\u0097which could include significant costs depending on their size and frequency\u0097has not yet been defined. According to DOD officials, until such determinations are made, the savings to DOD will remain uncertain.", "DOD has taken steps to align posture initiatives with strategy and cost, but continues to lack comprehensive and consistent cost estimates of initiatives. DOD\u0092s evolving posture process links initiatives with defense goals. Stakeholders from key DOD entities prioritize the initiatives in a voting process based on strategic criteria; cost is discussed, but not voted on. Furthermore, combatant commands did not completely and consistently report cost data in their theater posture plans because of the lack of readily available cost information. GAO found two primary reasons for this: unclear roles and responsibilities of key DOD organizations that have access to the cost data needed to compile and report comprehensive cost estimates and lack of a standardized format to compile and report cost data from component commands.

The Navy concluded that  forward stationing ships represented the most efficient and strategically  beneficial of the three options. We reviewed the Navy\u2019s documentation  associated with the decision and found two key issues. First, the Navy did  not fully consider the rotational crewing option. Second, the Navy used  different operational assumptions for the remaining two options and did  not control for those differences prior to comparing the analytical results.", "Limited analysis of the rotational crewing option. The Navy provided  little documentation for its analysis of the option to forward station  ships and rotate crews from U.S. bases\u2014also known as rotational  crewing. This option avoids permanently relocating ship crews and  their families. Navy officials stated that rotational crewing was  undesirable because of its deleterious effect on crew efficiency and  morale. Our previous reports found that the Navy had not developed  comprehensive guidance for implementing rotational crewing  initiatives or a systemic approach for analyzing rotational crewing  alternatives and lessons learned. Moreover, as we reported in 2008,  initial Navy rotational crewing efforts had provided greater forward  presence for Navy ships by eliminating ship transits and maintaining  more on-station time in distant operating areas. Therefore, a  rotational crewing approach for this posture decision could potentially  provide a strategically effective and cost-effective option. However,  the Navy provided less analysis of this option than the other two  options, which may have prevented the Navy from determining the  potential operational value of this approach.", "Different operational assumptions not controlled for in analysis of  alternatives. The Navy provided more documentation and analysis for  its comparison of the forward stationing option to the current approach  of U.S.-based deployments to the region. As a result of its analysis,  the Navy concluded that the forward stationing option requires  significantly fewer ships to meet European ballistic missile defense  mission requirements and therefore represents the more efficient and  cost-effective option. However, we found that the Navy applied  different assumptions to the two options and did not demonstrate that  it had controlled for those differences, both of which could affect the  outcome of the analysis. Further, Navy officials did not demonstrate  that they had considered the long-term life cycle effect and associated  costs for each forward deployed ship. Such factors may represent  significant costs, without which DOD may lack the comprehensive  analysis needed to determine the most efficient approach for meeting  ballistic missile defense mission requirements.", "GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that a business  case analysis or a cost-benefit analysis seeks to find the best value  solution by linking each alternative to how it satisfies a strategic objective.  This linkage is achieved by developing business cases that present facts  and supporting details among competing alternatives, including the life  cycle costs and quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits. Specifically,  each alternative should identify (1) relative life cycle costs and benefits;  (2) methods and rationale for quantifying the life cycle costs and benefits;  (3) effect and value of cost, schedule, and performance trade-offs;   (4) sensitivity to changes in assumptions; and (5) risk factors. Finally, the  analysis should be unbiased, consider all possible alternatives, and be  rigorous enough that independent auditors can review it and clearly  understand why a particular alternative was chosen. DOD guidance  regarding economic analysis similarly encourages the use of sensitivity  analysis, a tool that can be used to determine the extent to which costs  and benefits change or are sensitive to changes in key factors; this  analysis can produce a range of costs and benefits that may provide a  better guide or indicator than a single estimate.", "In contrast, the Navy\u2019s choice to forward station ships in Europe was  informed by cost and strategic factors. The Navy considered a number of  basing options in or near the Mediterranean and developed a decision  matrix that included both strategic and cost factors, such as the proximity  of each site to the planned deployment regions and the amount of military  construction that would be required at each site to support the ships and  their crews. Based on these factors, Navy officials determined that Naval  Station Rota provided the best option. From a strategic and operational  perspective, Naval Station Rota provides the U.S. Navy with a large  maritime port and an associated airfield close to current and potential  future operating areas. Additionally, since it is a home port for the  Spanish Navy and currently houses Spanish military ships of similar size,  there is no need to expand the port pier space to accommodate the  incoming ships. Figure 3 shows the current port pier space.", "While Naval Station Rota can accommodate the expanded mission, some  costs will be incurred. The infrastructure at Rota was initially designed to  accommodate a much larger contingent of military personnel and family  members than it does currently. Its capacity, according to Navy officials,  is sufficient to accommodate the personnel numbers expected once the  ships, their crews, and the crews\u2019 families are stationed there. As such,  although some military construction will be required, less would be  required at Rota than at any of the other sites in the U.S. European  Command area of responsibility that were considered. Specifically, the  Navy estimated it would cost approximately $33 million for construction of  new facilities and upgrades to existing infrastructure. Further, Naval  Station Rota officials explained, and we observed, that the base currently  has sufficient galley, medical, and housing facilities and that there are no  plans to expand the physical footprint of on-base support infrastructure.  The Navy also considered estimated up-front and recurring increases in  operational and personnel expenses, including those for additional  support personnel and increased utilities costs.

DOD\u2019s evolving global defense posture process links  posture initiatives with defense goals and prioritizes those initiatives  based on strategic and implementation criteria. Strategic criteria are  defined by four focus areas: enabling crisis response, ensuring access for  global posture enablers, shaping and improving security cooperation, and  supporting contingencies and ongoing operations. Implementation criteria  include such factors as operational flexibility, operational management  and institutional provisions of the force, ease of implementation, and  international relations.

The result is a list of posture initiatives ranked in order  of strategic priority. During the process, the stakeholders also discuss the  approximate costs associated with each initiative, but cost is not  considered a key factor and is not voted on.

Our prior work has  demonstrated, however, that comprehensive cost information is a key  component in enabling decision makers to set funding priorities, develop  annual budget requests, and evaluate resource requirements at key  decision points. Specifically, GAO previously recommended that DOD  should compile and report comprehensive cost data in the combatant  commands\u2019 theater posture plans.to this recommendation, DOD revised an enclosure in the 2010 Joint  Strategic Capabilities Plan to direct the combatant commands to include  the following cost data on current posture in their theater posture plans:   DOD officials told us that in response ongoing, current year, and 5-year planned posture initiatives listed by host nation participation (when appropriate).  title and cost;  full project costs, that is, construction costs plus furniture, fixtures,  equipment, and any operation and maintenance costs;  implementation progress (when appropriate); and  Despite this guidance, our review of the 2011 theater posture plans  submitted by the five geographic combatant commands found that though  all of them partially complied with the revised guidance, none met all the  requirements.

The first is the lack of clarity about roles and  responsibilities. Joint doctrine discussing the components of a joint force  notes the responsibility of service component commanders to develop  program and budget requests that comply with combatant commander  guidance on warfighting requirements and priorities. In addition, the  doctrine states that component commanders will provide a copy of the  program submission to the combatant commander prior to forwarding it to  the service headquarters, and will keep the combatant commander  informed of the status of combatant command requirements while service  programs are under development. However, according to OSD officials,  the combatant commands did not have access to comprehensive cost  data that they were required to compile and report because some of the  data are compiled by service component commands and the military  departments. Officials we interviewed from three combatant commands  echoed this sentiment, explaining that while the combatant command is  responsible for developing mission requirements for its respective region,  it is the military departments that are responsible for developing the  budgets that fund initiatives meant to address mission requirements. OSD  officials told us that in order to address this lack of clarity over roles and  responsibilities, OSD has drafted a DOD instruction outlining the U.S.  global defense posture process, which includes specific guidance to the  combatant commands and military departments on providing cost data  associated with new posture initiatives. Additionally, OSD officials told us  that they are in the process of promulgating a data call to issue to the  military departments and combatant commands to facilitate determination  of the cost of current overseas posture. Key OSD organizations involved  in these efforts include OSD Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation;  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); and the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. We were  unable to evaluate the instruction, however, because it was under  continuous revision and had not been finalized during the time of our  review.", "The second reason that combatant commands have not been able to  accurately and consistently report cost information for their posture  initiatives is the lack of a standardized format with which to report the  information. Current DOD guidance does not provide a standardized  format for the combatant commands to use when requesting information  from service component commands, in order to consistently report the  required cost data for each posture initiative. Accordingly, officials from  U.S. Army Europe and U.S. Air Force Europe stated, for example, that  requests for cost data are either too broad or too vague and that fulfilling  these data requests is labor intensive.

To this end, estimates associated with global posture decisions should be  backed by rigorous analysis based on information that is as complete and  comprehensive as possible. The potential costs or cost savings that may  arise from recent posture decisions in the U.S. European Command area  of responsibility will remain uncertain without additional analysis.  Specifically, the decision to forward station Aegis-equipped ships at Naval  Station Rota may allow the Navy to meet the ballistic mission with fewer  ships overall but could cost DOD approximately $1 billion over a 5-year  period.

Additionally, we found that the Navy did not  control for the different assumptions used to develop the ship number  requirements associated with the forward stationing and U.S.-based  deployment approaches, which could have altered the results of the  analysis and could represent significant long-term costs. If the Navy  maintains that forward stationing is the most effective and efficient means  to meet the ballistic missile defense requirement in Europe, DOD would  still benefit from determining the life cycle costs associated with the  decision in order to determine its true long-term costs, which could be  significant. While DOD provided onetime capital costs and average yearly  operations and maintenance costs for this option, it remains unclear  whether these are long-term life cycle cost estimates. Based on our  findings and our cost estimating guide that states that a credible business  case analysis should include life cycle costs as well as quantifiable and  nonquantifiable benefits, we maintain that the Navy, DOD, and Congress  would benefit from additional analysis in order to develop a more  comprehensive cost estimate associated with the decision to forward  station ships in Rota.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Secretary of the Army to identify and assess options to rotate  forces in Europe and their associated costs, including the impacts on  future basing in Europe, and stated that certain actions are ongoing.  Specifically, the Army is currently working with U.S. European Command  and various Army components to identify and assess options for rotating  personnel and equipment through Europe for training and exercises with  allies and partners. If fully implemented, we believe DOD\u2019s actions should  meet the intent of our recommendation.", "DOD also agreed with our recommendation to clarify the roles and  responsibilities of key OSD organizations, the military departments, and  the service component commands, and establish a standardized  reporting format that will be included in applicable guidance for key DOD  organizations to use to ensure that cost information is consistently  summarized and reported to inform the posture planning process, and  stated that certain actions are under way to address these matters. For  example, DOD stated that the department is in the final stages of  approving an instruction on the U.S. Global Defense Posture Process that  will document roles, responsibilities, and requirements for global posture  planning for key OSD organizations, the Joint Staff, the military  departments, and the combatant commands. The instruction will  institutionalize the Global Posture Integration Team and Global Posture  Executive Council to provide formal oversight of global posture  management. Additionally, DOD is in the process of issuing a data call to  the military departments and combatant commands to help determine the  existing infrastructure costs at enduring overseas installations. Lastly,  DOD stated that the Joint Staff issued supplemental Theater Posture Plan  guidance to the combatant commands in February 2012, including  standardized reporting criteria (e.g., estimated costs) for future posture  initiatives. If they are fully implemented, we believe DOD\u2019s actions should  meet the intent of our recommendation.", "The department also provided a number of general and technical  comments that we considered and incorporated, as appropriate. A  complete copy of DODs written comments is reprinted in appendix II.", "We are sending a copy of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretary of the Navy; and the Secretary of the Army.

To determine  the extent to which DOD conducted analysis to support the decision to  station four Navy destroyers in Rota, Spain, we analyzed key documents  and briefings provided by the U.S. Navy, U.S. European Command, and  Naval Station Rota in order to assess assumptions, courses of action  considered, and cost estimates. We conducted a site visit to Naval  Station Rota to observe existing capabilities and needs for military  construction projects identified by the Navy. We also collected information  by interviewing officials from the U.S. Navy, Office of the Chief of Naval  Operations; U.S. European Command; U.S. Navy Europe; and Naval  Station Rota. To determine the extent to which DOD conducted analysis  to support force structure reduction of Army brigade combat teams in  Europe, we reviewed key documents from U.S European Command and  U.S. Army Europe describing the status of planned force structure  changes in Europe, including the 2010 and 2011 theater posture plans for  U.S. European Command\u2019s area of responsibility. We also collected  information by interviewing officials from Office of the Secretary of  Defense (OSD), OSD Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation; the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Department of the Army,  Program Assessment and Evaluation Division; U.S. European Command;  and U.S. Army Europe. We analyzed and assessed cost estimates for  multiple courses of action associated with the number of brigade combat  teams in Europe developed by the U.S. Army, Program Assessment and  Evaluation Division, against GAO\u2019s cost estimating criteria to determine  the extent to which Army analysts employed best practices when  developing the estimates.", "To determine the extent to which DOD developed a process for making  decisions about global posture initiatives that aligns with strategy and  considers costs, as well as efforts made by combatant commands to  compile and report comprehensive cost data on existing global posture  and new posture initiatives in their theater posture plans, we evaluated  core global posture strategy documents; current and draft DOD guidance;  and other documentation we collected through interviewing with officials  from OSD, the Joint Staff, U.S. European Command and its three service  component commands, U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Africa Command,  the four military service headquarters, OSD, OSD Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), and  the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics. To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s global posture process  includes a consideration of cost, we observed the Joint Staff\u2019s November  2011 Posture Review Seminar at which officials employed the Global  Posture Initiative and Project Prioritization Process to rank posture  initiatives identified in the combatant commands\u2019 respective theater  posture plans. We also analyzed and evaluated theater posture plans  from 2010 and 2011 for each combatant command to determine the  extent to which the plans included comprehensive cost data for each  posture initiative. To identify potential challenges associated with the  combatant commands\u2019 directive to compile and report comprehensive  cost data, we collected information through interviews with officials from  U.S. European Command and its service component commands, U.S.  Pacific Command, and U.S. Africa Command.", "We conducted this performance audit between June 2011 and May 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
