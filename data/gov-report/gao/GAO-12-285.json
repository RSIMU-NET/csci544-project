However, although State could report total Chief of Mission numbers by agency, in mid-2011 GAO identified discrepancies in State\u0092s data system used to capture more-detailed staffing information such as location and position type. State began taking steps in the fall of 2011 to improve the reliability of its data system. Also, DOD reported expanding its overall civilian presence from 394 civilians in January 2009 to 2,929 in December 2011 to help assist U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The extent to which DOD\u0092s data is reliable is unknown due to omissions and double counting, among other things. In a 2009 report, GAO noted similar data issues and recommended DOD improve data concerning deployed civilians. DOD concurred with the recommendation and expects the issues will be addressed by a new tracking system to be completed in fiscal year 2012.", "DOD has taken preliminary steps to implement its Civilian Expeditionary Workforce (CEW) policy, including establishing a program office; however, nearly 3 years after DOD\u0092s directive established the CEW, the program has not been fully developed and implemented. Specifically, DOD components have not identified and designated the number and types of positions that should constitute the CEW because guidance for making such determinations has not been provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Officials stated that once key assumptions regarding the size and composition of the CEW have been finalized, implementing guidance will be issued. Until guidance that instructs the components on how to identify and designate the number and types of positions that will constitute the CEW is developed, DOD may not be able to (1) make the CEW a significant portion of the civilian workforce as called for in DOD\u0092s fiscal year 2009 Civilian Human Capital Strategic Plan, (2) meet readiness goals for the CEW as required in DOD\u0092s Strategic Management Plan for fiscal years 2012-2013, and (3) position itself to respond to future missions.", "U.S. agencies under Chief of Mission authority and DOD provided Afghanistan-specific, predeployment training to their civilians, but DOD faced challenges. State offered predeployment training courses to address its requirements for Chief of Mission personnel and designated a centralized point of contact to help ensure that no personnel were deployed without taking required training, including the Foreign Affairs Counter Threat course. While predeployment training requirements were established for Afghanistan by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commander, DOD relied on its various components to provide the training to its civilians. In some cases, DOD components offered duplicate training courses and did not address all theater requirements in their training because DOD did not have a process for identifying and synchronizing requirements and coordinating efforts to implement them, as called for in the Strategic Plan for the Next Generation of Training for the Department of Defense.

Housed with military personnel, these field-deployed civilians  were to coordinate with their military and Afghan counterparts to integrate  their capacity-building activities into the larger counterinsurgency  campaign. Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) has deployed  civilians to Afghanistan under the authority of U.S. Central Command to  support combat operations through equipment maintenance, logistical  support, and intelligence gathering and analysis.

To determine the  reliability of the staffing data, we reviewed available documentation  pertaining to the data systems and procedures used to develop staffing  data, examined the data for outliers and missing observations, and  conducted follow-up interviews to discuss questions that arose in our  analysis of the data. Furthermore, we compared State data against  staffing data obtained from other agencies under Chief of Mission  authority, including the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the  Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and the Treasury. We found  State\u2019s staffing data to be sufficiently reliable to provide an indication of  the positions filled at the level of the agency but not sufficiently reliable to  report on more-detailed staffing information, such as position type. For  DOD, we compared program requirements and staffing data for the  Ministry of Defense Advisors program and Afghanistan Pakistan Hands  program with documentation obtained from the program office.

In addition, we interviewed officials  from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the CEW program office, the  military services, and U.S. Central Command to further understand the  current status of efforts to fully implement the CEW, the department\u2019s plans  for the CEW of the future, and how the CEW was currently supporting the  department\u2019s needs for deployable civilians.", "For our third objective, to determine the extent to which U.S. agencies  had provided required Afghanistan-specific and Foreign Affairs Counter  Threat (FACT) training to their personnel before deployment, we first  identified Chief of Mission and DOD training requirements. For personnel  under Chief of Mission authority, we compared training requirements with  waiver logs, State Foreign Service Institute attendance rosters, available  staffing data, and State Diplomatic Security\u2019s FACT Tracker to determine  whether civilians deploying through the Chief of Mission had received the  required training. For DOD, we compared the Office of the Secretary of  Defense and U.S. Central Command training requirements with training  curricula contained in regulations, training websites, course schedules,  and course handbooks offered by DOD organizations that deploy civilians  to Afghanistan.

To  implement the U.S. strategy, the U.S. Mission Afghanistan committed in  April 2009 to expand its civilian personnel both in Kabul and in the field.  U.S. government civilians in Afghanistan generally fall under either the  authority of the Chief of Mission (i.e., the U.S. Ambassador) or under  DOD\u2019s combatant commander authority. The Chief of Mission has  authority over almost every U.S. executive branch employee there,  except those under the command of a U.S. military commander or those  on the staff of an international organization. Although typically stationed  at the U.S. Embassy and consulates, U.S. Chief of Mission personnel in  Afghanistan can also be deployed at a variety of military facilities outside  of Kabul. These field-deployed civilians rely on the military for security,  mobility, food, and lodging but remain under Chief of Mission authority.

The U.S.  and International Security Assistance Force civilian-military effort includes  the use of provincial reconstruction teams and district support teams.  Provincial reconstruction teams are combined civilian and military groups  responsible for integrating the activities of all military and civilian elements  in an assigned province. This integration includes harnessing both civilian  and military resources to perform security, governance, and development  activities to implement the U.S. counterinsurgency and stabilization  strategy as well as to monitor and report on progress. District support  teams are combined civilian and military groups responsible for integrating  the security, governance, and development activities of all civilian and  military elements in an assigned district.", "To enhance civilian-military coordination, the U.S. Mission Afghanistan  has established a parallel civilian structure within each relevant military  installation (i.e., regional command down to district support teams), with  senior civilian representatives and civilian team leads managing and  supervising Mission personnel at each level, as well as coordinating with  their military and local Afghan government counterparts. Together, the  senior civilians and military commanders at each level coordinate to  perform stability, capacity-building, and development operations in their  area of responsibility. Mission contingents at the field facilities typically  contain State, USAID, and/or USDA personnel. U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agents also deploy to some military facilities in the field but  primarily conduct counternarcotics activities with U.S. military and Afghan  counternarcotics forces.", "U.S. Mission Afghanistan develops requests for Chief of Mission civilian  positions in Afghanistan, and State Headquarters approves these  requests after consulting with other agencies.

During these staffing reviews, participants use strategic \u201clines of effort\u201d to  classify and prioritize all Chief of Mission positions in Afghanistan  according to their priority and feasibility of staffing. Strategic lines of effort  for Afghanistan comprise management operations, agriculture, public  diplomacy, rule of law, economic growth, counternarcotics, infrastructure,  border management, stabilization, governance, threat finance, and  bilateral relationship. Approved requirements and their staffing progress  are discussed among State, other agencies under Chief of Mission  authority such as USAID and USDA, and U.S. Embassy Kabul at  biweekly teleconferences. Agencies under Chief of Mission authority rely  on both temporary, external hires and permanent employees to staff  civilian requirements in Afghanistan.

According to DOD officials, the department establishes  civilian requirements and fills positions through an integrated military and  civilian planning process. Civilian requirements begin at the Joint Task  Force level, with commanders identifying military and civilian personnel  needed to complete a mission. The commander specifies unit and  individual needs in request for forces and joint manning documents, and  sends these documents to the corresponding combatant commanders for  validation and position designation. When the joint manning document is  approved, the Joint Chiefs of Staff record and designate the service  responsible for filling positions. At that time, individual positions are  designated as military or civilian, or acceptable for either to fill. Once all  positions are validated and categorized, the request is sent to the Joint  Force Coordinator within the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The CEW  predeployment training consists of an 11-day course that covers areas  such as personal and family benefits and legal information; survival skills,  including first aid; HMMWV rollover training and Counter-Improvised  Explosive Device training; and language and cultural awareness skills. As  a result, those Air Force civilians deploying through the CEW received  training on some of the same material, such as Counter-Improvised  Explosive Device training, twice prior to deployment. According to DOD  officials, in November 2011, DOD began granting some waivers from the  CEW training to Air Force civilians that completed Combat Airman Skills  Training. Afghanistan are required to complete this training; therefore, Air Force  civilians who do not receive Combat Airman Skills Training would still be  required to complete both Air Force and CEW predeployment training.  Additionally, some Army civilian training did not meet the requirements  established by U.S. Central Command.

We are encouraged by State and DOD\u2019s efforts to  improve tracking of deployed civilian personnel. Additionally, as DOD has  expanded its involvement in overseas military operations worldwide, it  has grown increasingly reliant on its civilian workforce to provide support  to these operations. While DOD\u2019s efforts to institutionalize the CEW are  commendable, until DOD makes decisions regarding the size of the CEW  and issues implementation guidance, the CEW may not be capable of  supporting future overseas operations as well as departmentwide goals to  strengthen and rightsize the DOD total workforce.", "Furthermore, having policies and procedures in place to help ensure that  U.S. civilians receive necessary training before they deploy to a high- threat working environment such as Afghanistan can enhance their safety  as well as their ability to accomplish the mission.

Our scope was limited to U.S. direct hires and did not include  locally engaged staff or contractors. Because, according to DOD officials,  the majority of DOD civilians directly serve in combat support positions,  we focused our request for staffing data on organizations or programs  intended to enhance the capacity of the Afghan government, which  included the Ministry of Defense Advisors and Afghanistan Pakistan  Hands programs.

We also met with officials from the Ministry of Defense  Advisors program, Afghanistan Pakistan Hands program, and Joint Chiefs  of Staff to discuss the data sources, internal controls, and data reliability  related to their respective staffing data. We found State civilian staffing  data for Afghanistan to be sufficiently reliable to provide an indication of  the positions filled at the level of the agency, but State ACPTS data were  not sufficiently reliable to report on more-detailed staffing information,  such as position type. For the Ministry of Defense Advisors program and  the Afghanistan Pakistan Hands program, we found that program  documents supported the requirements and the number of filled positions  that the program offices provided and that the data from these programs  were sufficiently reliable to illustrate the positions filled within these  programs.
