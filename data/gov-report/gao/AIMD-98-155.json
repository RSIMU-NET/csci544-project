It is also critical to secure the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) computer systems that provide information to air traffic controllers and aircraft flight crews to ensure safe and expeditious movement of aircraft. Failure to adequately protect these systems, as well as the facilities that house them, could cause nationwide disruption of air traffic or even loss of life due to collisions. Since malicious attacks on computer systems are an increasing threat, it is essential that FAA ensure the integrity and availability of ATC information and protect it from unauthorized users.", "Given the paramount importance of computer security of ATC systems, you asked us to determine (1) whether FAA is effectively managing physical security at ATC facilities and systems security for its current operational systems, (2) whether FAA is effectively managing systems security for future ATC modernization systems, and (3) the effectiveness of FAA\u2019s management structure and implementation of policy for computer security.

These systems and facilities are interconnected by complex communications networks that separately transmit both voice and digital data. As stated in our 1997 report on high-risk issues, while the use of interconnected systems promises significant benefits in improved government operations, it also increases vulnerability to anonymous intruders who may manipulate data to commit fraud, obtain sensitive information, or severely disrupt operations. Since this interconnectivity is expected to grow as systems are modernized to meet the projected increases in air traffic and to replace aging equipment, the ATC network will become even more vulnerable to such network-related threats.", "The threat to information systems is also growing because of the increasing availability of strategies and tools for launching planned attacks. For example, in May 1996 we reported that tests at the Department of Defense showed that Defense systems may have experienced as many as 250,000 attacks during 1995, about 65 percent of these succeeded in gaining access, and only about 4 percent were detected.", "Since intruders can use a variety of techniques to attack computer systems, it is essential that FAA\u2019s approach to computer security be comprehensive and include (1) physical security of the facilities that house ATC systems (e.g., locks, guards, fences, and surveillance equipment), (2) information security of the ATC systems (e.g., safeguards incorporated into computer hardware and software), and (3) telecommunications security of the networks linking ATC systems and facilities (e.g., secure gateways, firewalls, and communication port protection devices).", "For years, the need for federal agencies to protect sensitive and critical, but unclassified, federal data has been recognized in various laws, including the Privacy Act of 1974, the Computer Security Act of 1987, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and was recently reemphasized in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The adequacy of controls over computerized data is also addressed indirectly by the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. For example, FMFIA requires agency managers to evaluate their internal control systems annually and report to the President and the Congress any material weaknesses that could lead to fraud, waste, and abuse in government operations. In addition, a considerable body of federal guidance on information security has been developed by both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of our review were to determine (1) whether FAA is effectively managing physical security at ATC facilities and systems security for its current operational systems, (2) whether FAA is effectively managing systems security for future ATC modernization systems, and (3) the effectiveness of FAA\u2019s management structure and implementation of policy for computer security.", "To determine whether FAA is effectively managing physical security at ATC facilities, we reviewed FAA Order 1600.6C, Physical Security Management Program, to determine ATC facility security inspection and accreditation requirements;

verified the accuracy of the FIRs accreditation data with each of the nine regional FIRs program managers by requesting accreditation reports for each facility that FIRs reported as being accredited; for those facilities that were not accredited, requested dates of their initial comprehensive physical security inspection and follow-up inspections from each of the nine regional FIRs program managers to determine why ATC facilities were not accredited; verified the initial and follow-up inspection dates by requesting and reviewing documentation for each inspection conducted from April 16, 1993, to July 31, 1997, and then provided our analyses to Office of Civil Aviation Security Operations officials, who in turn verified it with each region;

FAA policy, dated April 1993, required that these facilities be inspected by April 1995 and that annual or triennial follow-up inspections be conducted depending on the type of facility to determine the status of physical security at each facility. These inspections determine whether the facility meets the physical security standards established in FAA policy and are the basis for accrediting ATC facilities (i.e., concluding that they are secure).", "FAA is not effectively managing physical security at ATC facilities. Known physical security weaknesses exist at many ATC facilities. For example, an inspection of a facility that controls aircraft disclosed 26 physical security findings including (1) fire protection systems that failed to meet minimum detection and suppression standards and (2) service contract employees that were given unrestricted access to sensitive areas without having appropriate background investigations. FAA recently confirmed its physical security weaknesses when it performed detailed assessments of several key ATC facilities following the Oklahoma City bombing to determine physical security risks and the associated security measures and costs required to reduce these risks to an acceptable level. For example, an assessment of a facility that controls aircraft concluded that access control procedures are weak to nonexistent and that the center is extremely vulnerable to criminal and terrorist attack.", "In addition, FAA is unaware of physical security weaknesses that may exist at other FAA facilities. For example, FAA has not assessed the physical security controls at 187 facilities since 1993 and therefore does not know how vulnerable they are. Until FAA inspects its remaining facilities, it does not know if they are secure and if the appropriate controls are in place to prevent loss or damage to FAA property, injury to FAA employees, or compromise of FAA\u2019s capability to perform critical air safety functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATC Operational System Security Is Ineffective and Systems Are Vulnerable", "paragraphs": ["FAA policy requires that all ATC systems be certified and accredited. A risk assessment, which identifies and evaluates vulnerabilities, is a key requirement for certification and accreditation. We recently reported that leading information security organizations use risk assessments to identify and manage security risks confronting their organizations.", "FAA has not assessed, certified, or accredited most operational ATC systems. A review conducted for FAA\u2019s Office of Civil Aviation Security in October 1996 concluded that FAA had not conducted risk assessments on 83 of 90, or over 90 percent, of all operational ATC systems. FAA officials told us that this assessment is an accurate depiction of the agency\u2019s knowledge regarding operational systems security. As a result, FAA does not know how vulnerable these operational ATC systems are and consequently has no basis for determining what protective measures are required. Further, the review concluded that of the 7 systems assessed, only 3 resulted in certifications because 4 systems did not have the proper certification documentation. Accordingly, less than 4 percent of the 90 operational systems are certified. In addition, FAA has not assessed most ATC telecommunication systems. For example, FAA\u2019s officials responsible for maintaining the nine FAA-owned and leased communication networks told us that only one has been assessed. Such poor security management exists despite the fact that FAA\u2019s 1994 Telecommunications Strategic Plan stated that \u201cvulnerabilities that can be exploited in aeronautical telecommunications potentially threaten property and public safety.\u201d FAA\u2019s 1997 Telecommunications Strategic Plan continues to identify security of telecommunication systems as an area in need of improvement.", "Office of Civil Aviation Security officials told us that they were not aware of a single ATC system that was accredited. We found similar results when we reviewed six operational systems to determine if they were assessed, certified, or accredited. Risk assessments had been conducted and certification reports written for only two of the systems, while none of the systems had been accredited. The Associate Administrator for Civil Aviation Security, who is responsible for accrediting systems, told us that FAA has decided to spend its limited funds not on securing currently operating systems, but rather on developing new systems and that FAA management is reluctant to acknowledge information security threats.", "FAA claims that because current ATC systems often utilize custom-built, 20-year-old equipment with special purpose operating systems, proprietary communication interfaces, and custom-built software, the possibilities for unauthorized access are limited. While these configurations may not be commonly understood by external hackers, one cannot conclude that old or obscure systems are, a priori, secure. In addition, the certification reports that FAA has done reveal operational systems vulnerabilities. Furthermore, archaic and proprietary features of the ATC system provide no protection from attack by disgruntled current and former employees who understand them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Is Not Effectively Managing Security for New ATC Systems", "paragraphs": ["Essential computer security measures can be provided most effectively and cost efficiently if they are addressed during systems design. Retrofitting security features into an operational system is far more expensive and often less effective. Sound overall security guidance, including a security architecture, security concept of operations, and security standards, is needed to ensure that well formulated security requirements are included in specifications for all new ATC systems.", "FAA has no security architecture, security concept of operations, or security standards. As a result, implementation of security requirements across ATC development efforts is sporadic and ad hoc. Of the six current ATC system development efforts that we reviewed, four had security requirements, but only two of the four developed their security requirements based on a risk assessment. Without security requirements based on sound risk assessments, FAA lacks assurance that future ATC systems will be protected from attack. Further, with no security requirements specified during systems design, any attempts to retrofit security features later will be increasingly costly and technically challenging. An FAA June 1993 report to the Congress on information security states that because FAA lacks a security architecture to guide the development of ATC security measures, technical security requirements will be retrofitted or not implemented at all because the retrofit \u201ccould be so costly or technically complex that it would not be feasible.\u201d", "In April 1996, the Associate Administrator for Research and Acquisitions established the National Airspace Systems (NAS) Information Security (NIS) group to develop, along with other security initiatives, the requisite security architecture, security concept of operations, and security standards. The NIS group has developed a mission need statement that asserts that \u201cinformation security is the FAA mission area with the greatest need for policy, procedural, and technical improvement. Immediate action is called for, to develop and integrate information security into ATC systems throughout their life cycles.\u201d FAA has estimated that it will cost about $183 million to improve ATC information security. The NIS group has developed an action plan that describes each of its proposed improvement activities. However, over 2 years later it has not developed detailed plans or schedules to accomplish these tasks.", "As FAA modernizes and increases system interconnectivity, ATC systems will become more vulnerable, placing even more importance on FAA\u2019s ability to develop adequate security measures. These future vulnerabilities are well documented in FAA\u2019s information security mission need statement and also in reports completed by the President\u2019s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. The President\u2019s Commission summary report concluded that the future ATC architecture appears to have vulnerabilities and recommended that FAA act immediately to develop, establish, fund, and implement a comprehensive systems security program to protect the modernized ATC system from information-based and other disruptions, intrusions, and attacks. It further recommended that this program be guided by the detailed recommendations made in the NAS vulnerability assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Management Structure Is Not Effectively Implementing and Enforcing Computer Security Policy", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s management structure and implementation of policy for computer security has been ineffective: the Office of Civil Aviation Security has not adequately enforced the security policies it has formulated; the Office of Air Traffic Services has not adequately implemented security policy for operational ATC systems; and the Office of Research and Acquisitions has not adequately implemented policy for new ATC systems development. For example, the Office of Civil Aviation Security has not enforced FAA policies that require the assessment of physical security controls at all ATC facilities and vulnerabilities, threats, and safeguards for all operational ATC computer systems; the Office of Air Traffic Services has not implemented FAA policies that require it to analyze all ATC systems for security vulnerabilities, threats, and safeguards; and the Office of Research and Acquisitions has not implemented the FAA policy that requires it to include, in specifications for all new ATC modernization systems, requirements for security based on risk assessments.", "FAA established a central security focal point, the NIS group, to develop additional security guidance (i.e., a security architecture, a security concept of operations, and security standards), to conduct risk assessments of selected ATC systems, to create a mechanism to respond to security incidents, and to provide security engineering support to ATC system development teams. The NIS group includes members from the Offices of Civil Aviation Security, Air Traffic Services, and Research and Acquisitions.", "Establishing a central security focal point is a practice employed by leading security organizations. In order to be effective, the security focal point must have the authority to enforce the organization\u2019s security policies or have access to senior executives that are organizationally positioned to take action and effect change across organizational divisions. One approach for ensuring that a central group has such access at FAA would be to place it under a Chief Information Officer (CIO) who reports directly to the FAA Administrator. This approach is consistent with the Clinger-Cohen Act, which requires that major federal departments and agencies establish CIOs who report to the department/agency head and are responsible for implementing effective information management.", "FAA does not have a CIO reporting to the Administrator. Although the NIS group has access to certain key Associate Administrators (e.g., the Associate Administrator for Civil Aviation Security and the Associate Administrator for Research and Acquisitions), it does not have access to the management level that can effect change across organizational divisions (e.g., FAA\u2019s Administrator or Deputy Administrator). Thus, there is no assurance that the NIS group\u2019s guidance, once issued, will be adequately implemented and enforced, that results of its risk assessments will be acted upon, and that all security breaches will be reported and adequately responded to. Until existing ATC computer security policy is effectively implemented and enforced, operational and developmental ATC systems will continue to be vulnerable to compromise of sensitive information and interruption of critical services.", "In addition, OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, requires that systems, such as ATC systems, be accredited by the management official who is responsible for the functions supported by the systems and whose mission is adversely affected by any security weaknesses that remain (i.e., the official who owns the operational systems). At FAA, this management official is the Associate Administrator for Air Traffic Services.

Information system security safeguards, either those now in place or those planned for future ATC systems, cannot be fully effective as long as FAA continues to function with significant physical security vulnerabilities. Also, because FAA has not assessed physical security controls at all facilities since 1993, it does not know how vulnerable they are.", "Similarly, FAA does not know how vulnerable its operational ATC systems are and cannot adequately protect them until it performs the appropriate system risk assessments and certifies and accredits ATC systems. In addition, FAA is not effectively incorporating security controls into new ATC systems. FAA has taken preliminary steps to develop security guidance by forming the NIS group and estimating the cost to fill this void. However, until this group develops the guidance and the ATC development teams apply it, new ATC system development will not effectively address security issues.", "Until FAA\u2019s three organizations responsible for ATC system security carry out their computer security responsibilities adequately, sensitive information is at risk of being compromised and flight services interrupted. Moreover, central security groups assigned to assist these organizations can only be successful if they have the authority to enforce their actions or a direct line to top management to ensure that needed changes can be implemented across organizational divisions. At FAA this central security group has neither.
