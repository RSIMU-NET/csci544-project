Federal union members generally cannot bargain over wages and cannot strike, and federal employees are not required to join unions and pay union dues in order to be represented by the union.", "Given the budget constraints facing federal agencies, you expressed concern about the amount of time and expenses devoted to union activities and paid for by the federal government. In particular, you were concerned about the amount of money the Social Security Administration (SSA) pays for union activities out of the Social Security trust funds.", "Because of your interest in this matter, you asked us to look at the history of union involvement in the federal government; the statutory basis for the federal government to pay employee salaries and expenses for union activities; the amount of time spent on and costs associated with union activities at SSA; and how the agency accounts for this time and money. You also asked us to comment on how the amount of time and money spent by SSA on union activities compares with what is spent by other large federal agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and how it compares with the amount spent by the U.S. Postal Service, which operates more like a private-sector company. Finally, you asked us to provide information on union activities in the private sector. We initially testified on these matters before the Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Social Security, on June 4, 1996.", "To develop this information, we interviewed management and union officials at SSA headquarters and 4 of SSA\u2019s 10 regional offices. We also reviewed union contracts, payroll records, and time-reporting forms.

At IRS and the Postal Service, we obtained available information on union activity from headquarters and selected field facilities, but did not verify its accuracy. We also discussed the role and function of unions in the federal government with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and discussed the private-sector use of time for union activities with labor-relations experts at various trade associations, colleges, and universities. We also reviewed a 1995 Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) publication that summarized trends in labor/management contracts for private industry. Finally, to determine the types of contract provisions that exist in private industry for spending time on union activities, we reviewed 10 contracts on file at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

At SSA, employees are represented by three unions: the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents over 95 percent of SSA employees who are represented by a union; the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU); and the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE). Of SSA\u2019s 65,000 employees, about 52,000 nonsupervisory employees are represented by the unions, and about 47 percent of those represented are dues-paying union members. Union operations at SSA are governed by a national AFGE contract and six other union contracts with individual NTEU and NFFE components.", "At the other federal organizations we visited, 10 major unions had national recognition: 5 at VA, 1 at IRS, and 4 at the Postal Service. A total of 165,000 employees were represented by these unions at VA, 97,000 at IRS, and 751,000 at the Postal Service.

Bank time includes time spent on union- or employee-initiated grievances (complaints regarding any matter related to employment) as well as on union-initiated activities, such as training or representational duties. The category known as \u201cnonbank time\u201d in field offices, and equivalent categories in other components, generally refers to time spent on management-initiated activities; bargaining over changes to work assignments and working conditions (such as disallowed leave, employee work space, and equipment); management-initiated grievances; and any other time not specifically designated as bank time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History of Federal Government Union Activity", "paragraphs": ["In 1912, the Lloyd-LaFollette Act established the right of postal employees to join a union and set a precedent for other federal employees to join unions.

The Council consisted of the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, the Secretary of Labor, and an official of the Executive Office of the President. The order transferred many of the functions of the former Civil Service Commission to OPM. It also clarified language to expressly permit bargaining on operational issues for employees adversely affected by organizational realignments or technological changes.", "In 1970, the Postal Reorganization Act brought postal labor relations under a structure similar to that applicable to companies in the private sector in that collective bargaining for wages, hours, and working conditions was authorized subject to regulation by the National Labor Relations Board.", "However, like other federal employees, postal employees could not be compelled to join or pay dues to a union and could not strike.", "The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided a statutory basis for the current federal labor/management relations program and set up an independent body, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), to administer the program. FLRA is composed of three members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The act authorized FLRA to assume administrative functions previously performed by the Council.

Specifically, the agency could authorize and the union could agree to either (1) up to 40 hours of official time for negotiation during regular working hours or (2) up to one-half the time actually spent in negotiations.

The hours reported on these forms are then periodically aggregated and submitted to SSA headquarters for totaling. This time-reporting system consists of two component systems that cover roughly an equal number of employees. The first is an automated system that captures time reported by union representatives working in field offices, which are the primary point of public contact with SSA, and at teleservice centers, where calls to SSA\u2019s national 800 number are answered. The second component is a manual system used to capture time spent by union representatives at SSA headquarters, as well as at Program Service Centers, the Office of Hearings and Appeals, and other components.

By tracing source documents for union representatives\u2019 time to reported totals in the system, we discovered additional time not captured by the two systems in these locations. These gaps occurred primarily in the manual system and resulted from inaccurate reporting from the source documents, overlooked reports for some union representatives, and uncounted reports for some organizational units during certain reporting periods. We also verified only that similar procedures were being used at three other regions, which could result in similar underreporting at these locations.

It is possible, however, that some time spent on Partnership activities is currently being reported in other activity categories. Consequently, as Partnership activities increase, we would expect the time devoted to them to also increase.

It also pays the travel and per-diem costs of all union representatives whenever meetings are held at management\u2019s initiative. Union representation at major SSA initiatives\u2014such as the reengineering of its disability programs, the National Partnership Council, and Partnership training\u2014has added to travel and per-diem costs.

The unions use these funds for their internal expenses, which include the cost of lodging and transportation for union-provided training; the unions\u2019 share of grievance costs; miscellaneous furniture, supplies, and equipment for some union offices; the salaries of the AFGE local president and his staff, who represent SSA headquarters employees; and a share of national union expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Management and Union Views Differ on Official Time", "paragraphs": ["SSA managers and union officials and representatives provided us their views about the use of official time for union activities.

They went on to say that they have trouble maintaining adequate staffing levels in the office to serve walk-in traffic, answer telephones, and handle routine office workloads. In an April 1996 memo from the Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources to field managers, SSA attempted to clarify the circumstances under which requests for official time may be delayed or denied. Additionally, 18 field managers expressed concern about the amount of time they spend responding to union requests for information regarding bargaining and grievances. We did not verify the accuracy of any of the field managers\u2019 statements.

Finally, in 1983, an arbitrator named Justin Smith was appointed by the American Arbitration Association to resolve issues regarding the interpretation of how official time was to be used for representational activities. Mr. Smith significantly liberalized SSA\u2019s official time interpretation and also designated himself as arbitrator of all future official time disputes for the life of the contract. Over time, SSA disputed many of Mr. Smith\u2019s rulings that were favorable to the unions. As a result of complaints by SSA management, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) appointed a second arbitrator, who ruled that Mr. Smith had exceeded his authority.", "To resolve ongoing disputes about official time in SSA field offices, SSA and AFGE signed a new contract in January 1990 that specified a fixed amount of official time to be used by the field office representatives for certain union activities; this time was called \u201cbank time.\u201d The contract also specified additional allowable time for other union activities; this was called \u201cnonbank time.\u201d No fixed amount of official time was specified for nonbank time, however, and the union and SSA disagreed over which activities qualified as bank time activities and which qualified as nonbank time activities. An agreement was reached in August 1990 between SSA and AFGE that clarified the definition of nonbank time activities to include activities such as bargaining on management-initiated changes, FLRA proceedings, and representing employees who have filed formal equal employment opportunity complaints."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Union Activities at the Postal Service, VA, and IRS", "paragraphs": ["To compare the amount and cost of time charged to union activities at other agencies with those charged at SSA, we met with agency and union officials at the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

These hours did not include substantial additional time spent on other union activities that were paid for by either the Postal Service or the unions. For example, the Postal Service also paid for time spent on unfair labor practices (ULP) charges and employee involvement programs and training, a practice that is similar to Partnership activities at other federal agencies. However, officials at the Postal Service told us that it was in the process of withdrawing its support for the largest employee involvement program by reassigning about 400 of these full-time employees to their postal duties. Postal officials also told us that the salaries of an additional 460 full-time union officials were paid by the unions. In addition, time that was spent by part-time union representatives on the contract negotiation process was either paid for by the unions or was considered \u201coff the clock.\u201d Neither of these sets of time charges and costs was included in the reported totals.

SSA believed that our report did not adequately portray the importance of Partnership between the agency and its unions. It also attributed $7 million in yearly savings from decreased ULPs and arbitration cases from 1990 through 1995 to the results of Partnership. Our report states that the executive order on Partnership directs agencies to involve labor organizations as full partners with management to better fulfill the agencies\u2019 mission. It also states that, today, unions operating in federal government agencies have significant involvement in operational and management decisions. Partnership activities at SSA are just beginning, and it would be inappropriate at this time to make such a direct correlation between the decline in ULPs and arbitration cases and Partnership. Figures 4 and 5 in the body of the report show similar declines in these activities from 1990 to 1991, before the initiation of Partnership. 2. SSA disagrees in part with what their field managers told us regarding when and how union activities are carried out. SSA states that the amount of time spent on union activities is subject to the control of local management to the extent that these requests for time are reasonable. In an April 1996 memo to field managers from the Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources, SSA attempted to clarify the circumstances under which requests for official time may be delayed or denied. The memo does not address union designation of representatives nor the specific amount of time allocated to representatives to perform union activities. Our report has been changed to reflect this. 3. We disagree with SSA\u2019s statement that the headquarters reporting system is designed to capture the number and names of individuals. We found that the documents forwarded to headquarters and retained as system source documents do not routinely identify the name and number of individuals charging union time. 4. SSA originally supplied documentation that listed an individual receiving a salary of $80,001 to $90,000 as a full-time union representative. It subsequently indicated that this information was incorrect, and that, while he was a union steward, the individual was not a full-time union representative.
