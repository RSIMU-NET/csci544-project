GAO was asked to report on (1) DOD's oversight of schools receiving TA funds, and (2) the extent to which DOD coordinates with accrediting agencies and the U.S. Department of Education (Education) in its oversight activities. GAO conducted site visits to selected military education centers and interviewed officials from DOD, its contractors, Education, accrediting agencies and their association, and postsecondary institutions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD is taking steps to enhance its oversight of schools receiving TA funds, but areas for improvement remain. Specifically, DOD could benefit from a systematic risk-based oversight approach, increased accountability in its education quality review process, and a centralized system to track complaints. DOD does not systematically target its oversight efforts based on factors that may indicate an increased risk for problems, such as complaints against schools or the number of service members enrolled at a school. Instead, DOD's oversight policies and procedures vary by a school's level of program participation, and schools that operate on base are subject to the highest level of oversight. DOD plans to implement more uniform oversight policies and procedures, but they are not expected to take effect until 2012. In addition, the process DOD used to review the academic courses and services provided by schools and military education centers was narrow in scope and lacked accountability. The review was limited to schools offering traditional classroom instruction at installations and did not include distance education courses, which account for 71 percent of courses taken in fiscal year 2009. The contract for these quality reviews expired on December 31, 2010, and DOD plans to resume its reviews on October 1, 2011, when a new contractor is selected. DOD is developing an expanded quality review process and plans to select schools based, in part, on the amount of TA funds received. With regard to accountability, DOD's review process provided recommendations that could improve educational programming, but there is no DOD-wide process to ensure that these recommendations have been addressed. Furthermore, DOD lacks a system to track complaints about schools and their outcomes. As a result, it may be difficult for DOD and its services to accurately identify and address any servicewide problems and trends. DOD's limited coordination with accreditors and Education may hinder its oversight efforts. DOD verifies whether a school is accredited; however, it does not gather some key information from accreditors when conducting its oversight activities, such as whether schools are in jeopardy of losing their accreditation. Accreditors can place schools on warning or probation status for issues such as providing inaccurate information to the public and poor institutional governance. Schools can experience various problems within the 3- to 10-year accreditation renewal period, and these problems can negatively affect students, including service members. Additionally, DOD does not require schools to have new programs and other changes approved by accrediting agencies in order to receive TA funds. Currently, students enrolled in unapproved programs or locations are ineligible to receive federal student aid from Education, but can receive TA funds. DOD's coordination with Education has generally been limited to accreditation issues and Education's online resources about schools and financial aid. DOD does not utilize information from Education's school-monitoring activities to inform its oversight efforts. Education's findings from program reviews and financial audits of schools provide insights about schools' financial condition, level of compliance, and governance. Collectively, this information could provide DOD with information that can be used to better target schools for review or inform other oversight decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) improve accountability for recommendations made by third-party quality reviews, (2) develop a centralized process to track complaints against schools, (3) conduct a systemic review of its oversight processes, (4) take actions to ensure TA funds are used only for accreditor-approved courses and programs, and (5) require and verify state authorization for all schools."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Military Tuition  Assistance (TA) Program provided $517 million in tuition assistance to  approximately 377,000 service members who elected to pursue off-duty  postsecondary education. DOD offers these benefits to service members  in order to help them fulfill their academic goals and enhance their  professional development. In order to participate in the program, DOD  requires that postsecondary institutions must be accredited by an  accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education  (Education).

SOC, a consortium of approximately 1,900 colleges and  universities, is funded by DOD through a contract with the American  Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). SOC functions in  cooperation with 15 higher-education associations, DOD, and active and  reserve components of the military services to expand and improve  voluntary postsecondary education opportunities for service members  worldwide. SOC criteria stipulate that school policies and practices be  fair, equitable, and effective in recognizing the special conditions faced by  military students, such as trouble completing college degrees because of  their frequent moves. Colleges and universities within SOC must have  policies that meet four SOC criteria relating to transfer of credit, academic  residency requirement, credit for military training and experience, and  credit for nationally recognized testing programs. In addition, they must  also follow SOC\u2019s three principles: (1) service members should share in  the postsecondary educational opportunities available to other citizens;  (2) educational programs for service members should rely primarily on  programs, courses, and services provided by appropriately accredited  institutions and organizations; and (3) institutions should maintain a  necessary flexibility of programs and procedures, such as recognition of  learning gained in the military and part-time student status.", "Since 1991, DOD\u2019s Military Installation Voluntary Education Review  (MIVER) process has provided an independent third-party assessment of  the quality of postsecondary education programs offered to off-duty  service members at military installations around the world. DOD  contracted with the American Council on Education (ACE) to administer  the MIVER. The MIVER had two purposes: (1) to assess the quality of  selected on-installation voluntary education programs and (2) to assist in  the improvement of such education through appropriate recommendations  to institutions, installations, DOD, and the military services. To assess the  quality of education programs offered by schools on installations and to  ensure that these program are comparable to those offered at a school\u2019s  other campuses, MIVER assessed schools\u2019 missions, education programs,  program administration, resources, and program evaluation. The MIVER  also examined the installations\u2019 mission statements and command  support, program management and leadership, student services,  resources, and the voluntary education program plans to determine the  quality of their education programs and services. A visiting team  composed of college and university professors selected by the contractor  evaluated the quality of educational services and support provided by the  installation\u2019s education center and servicing institutions. The MIVER  provided installations and schools with commendations for their areas of  strength, and recommendations for areas needing improvement. It also  provided the military services with observations on issues that require the  military services\u2019 attention. MIVERs were for the purpose of quality  assessment and enhancement only; these reviews were not intended to  replace institutional accreditation. The MIVER contract with ACE expired  on December 31, 2010, and DOD elected not to renew the contract because  it is expanding the scope of these reviews, but DOD is currently in the  process of obtaining a new contract for its reviews.

The amount of TA funding going toward distance  learning programs creates new oversight challenges for DOD and its  military services, especially since DOD oversight has primarily focused on  schools offering traditional classroom instruction on military installations.", "Increased oversight is needed to remedy gaps in the accountability of the  quality review process and the process to address complaints against  schools. Although DOD has plans to improve its oversight of schools  receiving TA funds, without accountability measures for its quality review  process, DOD cannot be certain its efforts to safeguard TA funds will be  effective. In addition, while DOD is aware of some concerns regarding  schools\u2019 improper recruiting practices, without a centralized process to  track complaints against schools and their resolution, DOD lacks the  ability to accurately determine trends in areas requiring oversight and  whether concerns have been adequately addressed.", "DOD could further enhance its oversight efforts by leveraging resources  and information that accrediting agencies and Education already collect.  For example, the additional consumer protections provided by  Education\u2019s regulations on schools\u2019 substantive changes could provide  DOD with additional assurance that TA funds are going toward courses  and programs that have been properly vetted by the schools\u2019 accreditors.  Without leveraging these additional oversight tools, DOD and its military  services may lack key information that could help strengthen and inform  future program oversight. Targeted improvements in these areas may help  DOD and its military services to better ensure that TA funds are being  properly utilized and services members are receiving quality education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Undersecretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to take the following 5 actions to  improve its oversight of schools receiving TA funds:  1.  To improve the accountability of DOD, its military services, their  installations, and participating postsecondary schools in developing its  new third-party review process, require all schools, installations, and the military services to formally  respond in writing to related recommendations pertaining to them, and   develop a process to track and document the status of all  recommendations for improvement.  2.  Evaluate ways to develop a centralized process to record and track the  status and outcomes of complaints. This should be done in a way that  balances the need for a comprehensive tracking system with, to the  extent possible, minimizing the reporting burden placed on education  center staff at military installations. 3.  Undertake a systematic review of its oversight of schools receiving TA  program funds. In doing so, the Undersecretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness should consider the following:   developing a more systematic risk-based approach to oversight by  utilizing information from accrediting agencies and Education to better  target schools,   modifying its proposed standard MOU to include an explicit prohibition  against school conduct that may adversely affect service members,  such as misrepresentation, and reviewing Education\u2019s recently promulgated requirements for state  authorization of schools and coordinate with Education to determine  the extent to which these requirements are useful for overseeing  schools receiving TA funds. 4.  Prohibit TA funds from being used to pay for courses and programs  that are not included within the scope of an institution\u2019s accreditation.  This could include leveraging Education\u2019s knowledge and expertise to  determine the extent to which other substantive changes listed in  Education\u2019s regulations are applicable to the military education  programs.  5.  Require and verify that all schools receiving TA funds are authorized  by their state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and Education.

We visited one installation per military service\u2014Joint Base  Andrews, Fort Carson, Marine Corps Base Quantico, and Naval Station  Norfolk.
