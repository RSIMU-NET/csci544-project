For the ongoing work, GAO reviewed VA documentation and interviewed VA officials, and VA medical center staff. Finally, GAO met with senior VA officials on June 5, 2020, to obtain agency views on the new observations GAO discusses in this statement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken some steps in recent years to modernize its processes to acquire hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of medical supplies annually. However, implementation delays for key initiatives, including a new, enterprise-wide inventory management system, limit VA's ability to have an agile, responsive supply chain. Prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in November 2017 and in GAO's High-Risk report in March 2019, GAO reported on weaknesses in VA's acquisition management. For example, GAO reported that VA's implementation of its Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program\u2014VA's primary means for purchasing medical supplies\u2014lacked an effective medical supply procurement strategy, clinician involvement, and reliable data systems. GAO also found that several of VA's medical supply management practices were not in line with those employed by private sector leading hospital networks.", "VA is developing another iteration of its MSPV program, called MSPV 2.0, which GAO's preliminary observations show is intended to address some of the shortfalls GAO has identified in its past and ongoing program reviews. In November 2017, GAO recommended that VA develop, document and communicate an overarching MSPV-NG strategy\u2014to include how the program office will prioritize categories of supplies and increase clinician involvement in this process. Preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work indicate that VA has taken some steps, as it implements MSPV 2.0, to address this priority recommendation. However, GAO's preliminary observations also indicate that the MSPV 2.0 program implementation is delayed and some of these existing program challenges may not be remedied.", "Based on preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work, VA's implementation of a new supply and inventory management system is delayed. As a result, VA had to rely on an antiquated inventory management system, and initial, manual spreadsheets to oversee the stock of critical medical supplies at its medical centers. This limited the ability of VA management to have real-time information on its pandemic response supplies, ranging from N95 face masks to isolation gowns, to make key decisions. As of April 2020, VA has an automated tool to manage its reporting process, but the information must be gathered and manually reported by each of VA's 170 medical centers on a daily basis.", "GAO's preliminary observations also show that in response to COVID-19, VA is using various contracting organizations and mechanisms to meet its critical medical supply needs. These include using national and regional contracting offices to obtain supplies from existing contract vehicles, new contracts and agreements, and the Federal Emergency Management Administration's Strategic National Stockpile to respond to the pandemic."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made 40 recommendations since 2015 to improve acquisition management at the VA. VA agreed with those recommendations and has implemented 22 of them.

VA spends hundreds of millions of dollars annually on medical  supplies to meet the health care needs of about 9 million veterans and  has one of the most significant acquisition management functions in the  federal government.", "Since 2015, we have issued five reports on VA\u2019s acquisition management  challenges, with 40 recommendations, and we elevated this issue to  GAO\u2019s High-Risk List in 2019, due to longstanding problems such as  ineffective purchasing of medical supplies and lack of reliable data  systems. VA has addressed 22 of our prior recommendations. For  example, in November 2017, GAO recommended that VA develop,  document, and communicate an overarching Medical-Surgical Prime  Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) strategy\u2014to include how the  program office will prioritize categories of supplies and increase clinician  involvement in this effort. Our preliminary observations from our ongoing  work indicate that although VA has taken some steps to address this  priority recommendation, it has yet to fully implement it. Further, VA has  also begun efforts to modernize its supply chain, but our ongoing work  indicates that several key initiatives are delayed, further limiting VA\u2019s  ability to have an agile, responsive acquisition management system.", "Like most medical institutions nationwide, VA has faced difficulties  obtaining personal protective equipment (PPE) for its medical workforce  during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and VA\u2019s  antiquated inventory management system hampered its ability to identify  the extent to which each of its 170 medical centers faced these  shortages. VA officials reported that they had difficulty obtaining sufficient  supplies from their existing supply chain and associated contracting  vehicles; thus, VA used new contracts and agreements to fill some of this  void.", "My remarks today are based on two issued reports\u2014our 2019 High Risk  report segment on VA Acquisition Management and our 2017 report on  VA\u2019s MSPV-NG program\u2014as well as our ongoing audits of VA\u2019s COVID- 19-related medical expenditures and VA\u2019s MSPV program. Today, I will  summarize a few key findings from these reports and some of our initial  observations from this ongoing work related to VA\u2019s progress toward  building a more resilient supply chain.", "As part of our work for our November 2017 and March 2019 reports and  our ongoing MSPV 2.0 work, we reviewed VA policies, communications,  briefings, prior GAO reports on best practices for organizational  transformation, relevant legislation, and other documents. We conducted  interviews with VA officials responsible for Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) and VA-wide procurement and logistics, program office managers,  and supply chain managers, among other VA officials. We also conducted  site visits to 12 medical centers, selected based on highest total spending  on medical and surgical supplies, among other things. As part of our work  on VA\u2019s response to the COVID-19 medical procurements, we reviewed  VA memoranda, briefings, Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) procurement data, and we met with key VA  personnel responsible for the agency\u2019s response to COVID-19. Finally,  we met with senior VA officials on June 5, 2020, to obtain agency views  on the new observations we discuss in this statement.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

These included the lack of an effective medical supply  procurement strategy, clinician involvement, and reliable data systems.  We also found that several of VA\u2019s medical supply management practices  were not in line with those employed by private sector leading hospital  networks. We recommended, among other things, that VA develop,  document, and communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for  the program. This strategy, originally planned for completion by  December 2017, was delayed to March 2019, and then further delayed  due to VA\u2019s implementation of its new MSPV 2.0 program, which is also  delayed. We also found that VA\u2019s initial formulary consisted of around  6,000 items at launch, and, according to senior VA contracting officials,  many items on the formulary were not those needed by medical centers.  These factors resulted in an initial formulary that did not meet the needs  of VA\u2019s medical centers (VAMC).", "The MSPV-NG program office subsequently took steps to expand the  formulary, growing it to over 22,000 items, and is developing the next  iteration of the program, called MSPV 2.0. MSPV 2.0 is intended to  address some of the shortfalls we previously identified in MSPV-NG,  including more than doubling the number of items on the formulary, to a  planned 49,000. VA\u2019s MSPV 2.0 prime vendor procurement has been  subject to multiple bid protests. After three protests challenged the terms  of the solicitation, VA responded by voluntarily taking corrective action  and revising the solicitation. The terms of the revised solicitation were  challenged in a subsequent protest that was sustained, resulting in VA  further revising the solicitation to address the matter. Because of these  events, agency officials told us that VA has altered its MSPV 2.0  procurement plans several times and there has been significant delay in  program implementation from the originally planned March 2020 date to  as late as February 2021.", "Based on preliminary observations of our ongoing work, some of the  current MSPV-NG challenges persist and may not be remedied by MSPV  2.0. Specifically, medical center staff we interviewed from May 2019  through October 2019 cited continued problems with consistently  receiving the supplies they order through MSPV-NG, such as backorders  on frequently ordered items. For example, preceding the COVID-19  pandemic, supply chain problems with one of VA\u2019s prime vendors created  supply shortages for infection control gowns, and staff at one VAMC we  visited in June 2019 had to obtain gowns from its emergency cache as a  temporary measure. Further, VA\u2019s plans for MSPV 2.0 give no indication  that they will update their practice of manually maintaining the formulary  using spreadsheets, which, based on our discussions with several VAMC  logistics officers, can lead to errors such as inadvertent omission of items  from the formulary. We plan to issue a report on our review of the MSPV  2.0 program in fall 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Antiquated Inventory Management System Limited VA Management\u2019s Ability to Oversee Real-Time Supply Data at Its 170 Medical Centers", "paragraphs": ["According to senior VA procurement and logistics officials interviewed  during our ongoing review of VA\u2019s COVID-19 procurement for critical  medical supplies, VA experienced difficulty obtaining several types of  supplies needed to protect its front-line workforce during the COVID-19  response, ranging from N95 masks to isolation gowns. According to  senior VA acquisition and logistics officials, beginning in late February to  early March 2020, VA requested that medical centers provide daily  updates via spreadsheets to try to obtain the most real time information  possible on the levels of PPE on hand, usage, and gaps. These  spreadsheets, which were reported manually on a daily basis from each  of the VAMCs, were the primary means by which Veterans Health  Administration (VHA) leadership obtained detailed information on the  stock of critical supplies at its VAMCs in real-time. The insight provided by  these spreadsheets was not something that VHA leadership had in any  type of ongoing or systematic way, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In  April 2020, VA developed an automated tool to manage this reporting  process, but, according to officials, the information must still be gathered  and manually reported by each of the 170 VAMCs on a daily basis.", "In May 2019, the VA Inspector General found that proper inventory  monitoring and management was lacking at many VAMCs, noting that  inventory management practices ranged from inaccurate to nonexistent.  In 2013, we also reported on weaknesses in VA\u2019s inventory management  systems and made recommendations to VA to evaluate its efforts to  improve in this area.", "However, our preliminary observations from our ongoing review of VA\u2019s  MSPV program indicate that VA will likely rely on its antiquated system for  the foreseeable future. Specifically, VA plans to transition to the Defense  Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) inventory management system, called Defense  Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS). DMLSS serves as DLA\u2019s  primary MSPV ordering system and supports DLA\u2019s inventory  management, among other things. According to DLA officials, DMLSS  produces data that VAMCs could use to analyze their order history and  find recommendations for future purchases. VA\u2019s implementation  schedule shows that it will take seven years to roll out DMLSS and its  successor at all VAMCs. In the near-term, VA had planned to implement  DMLSS at three medical centers in mid-to-late 2019. However, due to  technology integration issues between VA\u2019s financial system and the  DMLSS system, implementation at these three VAMCs is delayed.  According to the Chief Supply Chain Officer at one of these VAMCs, the  original DMLSS implementation date has changed several times from an  initial start date of August 2019, which may be delayed to at least October  2020.", "VA uses a \u201cjust in time\u201d inventory supply model\u2014a practice employed by  many hospital networks where only limited stock is maintained on-site.  However, for this model to succeed, VA needs both visibility into current  stock and consistent deliveries from the MSPV-NG program. Based on  our preliminary observations, VA faces challenges with both visibility and  delivery. VA acquisition leadership has recognized the shortcomings in its  medical supply chain management, and has identified supply chain  modernization as a priority. As part of our ongoing review of VA\u2019s MSPV  program, we reviewed VHA\u2019s Modernization Campaign Plan, dated March  2019, and VHA\u2019s Modernization Plan briefing slides, dated February  2020, which describe several modernization initiatives including MSPV 2.0 and DMLSS.

These include using national  and regional contracting offices to procure supplies and services, and  using existing contract vehicles and new sources. In response to the  pandemic, VA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Logistics also issued a  memorandum on March 15, 2020, to implement emergency flexibilities  available under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, such as increasing  the micro-purchase threshold to $20,000.", "Our analysis of contracting activity in the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) indicates that VHA\u2019s Network  Contracting Offices\u2014which support the various regions of VA\u2019s hospital  network\u2014increased their supply purchases, mostly by entering into new  contracts. Department-wide contracting organizations that would  normally not make individual supply purchases\u2014such as VHA\u2019s Program  Contracting Activity Central and VA\u2019s Strategic Acquisition Center\u2014also  played a substantial role. In addition, logistics staff at VAMCs continued  to use the MSPV-NG program to order supplies. VA had existing clauses  in MSPV-NG contracts that established terms for the suppliers to maintain  support to VA in the event of a catastrophe. But, according to senior VA  acquisition officials, because those suppliers faced the same shortages in  the broader market, they were not able to provide enough supplies to  meet VA\u2019s surging demand.", "Figure 1 shows the COVID-19-related contract obligations, from March  13, 2020 through June 3, 2020, made by the various VA contracting  offices. These obligations include both supplies, such as PPE, and  services, such as information technology systems to support  telemedicine.", "Our analysis of preliminary data on orders placed directly by VAMC staff  for COVID-19-related items found that, in April 2020, the value of VA\u2019s  reported COVID-19-related purchases through the MSPV-NG program  began to decrease relative to the values reported in prior months.", "According to senior VA acquisition and logistics officials, in part, because  MSPV-NG and other existing VA supply contracts and agreements did  not meet VA\u2019s needs, its acquisition workforce had to make purchases  through other contracting mechanisms, such as micro-purchases using  government purchase cards, to fill the gap. Between March 13, 2020 and  June 3, 2020 VA obligated more than 51 percent ($687 million) of the  $1.3 billion it spent on products and services for the COVID-19 response  through purchases made outside the MSPV-NG program and other  established VA contracting mechanisms. About 27 percent of this $1.3  billion ($364 million) was for veteran-owned small business set-aside  purchases, under VA\u2019s Veterans First program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Collaborated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in Response to COVID-19", "paragraphs": ["On April 17, 2020, VA placed its first supply requests through the Federal  Emergency Management Administration\u2019s (FEMA) Strategic National  Stockpile program, according to VA senior acquisition and logistics  officials.

However, these senior procurement and logistics officials noted that VA  support services officials\u2014who had primary responsibility for requesting  medical items through FEMA\u2014did not have an existing relationship with  FEMA or a process in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic for placing  medical supply requests through FEMA. Officials said that this led to a  brief, initial delay in processing VA\u2019s first request.", "In summary, VA experienced many of the same challenges obtaining  medical supplies as most private sector hospitals and other entities in  responding to this devastating pandemic.
