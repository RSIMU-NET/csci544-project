To obtain a first-hand  perspective of the conduct of in-field address canvassing we visited 18 of  the 39 Area Census Offices (see appendix II). These sites were selected  based on several factors, including rural-urban mix, participation in the  2018 End-to-End Test, and whether a site was scheduled to start the  operation earlier than others.", "At each location, we interviewed Bureau staff, including census field  supervisors, address listers, and office management, to discuss what  went well and what challenges they faced during in-field address  canvassing.

Precise maps are critical for counting the population in the proper  locations\u2014the basis of congressional apportionment and redistricting.", "Our prior work has shown that developing an accurate address list is  challenging\u2014in part because people can reside in unconventional  dwellings, such as converted garages, basements, and other forms of  \u201chidden\u201d housing. For example, as shown in figure 1, what appears to be  a single-family house could contain an apartment, as suggested by its two  doorbells.", "During address canvassing, the Bureau verifies that its master address  file and maps are accurate to ensure the tabulation for all housing units  and group quarters is correct. For the 2010 Census, the address  canvassing operation mobilized almost 150,000 field workers to canvass  almost every street in the United States and Puerto Rico to update the  Bureau\u2019s address list and map data\u2014and in 2012 reported the cost at  nearly $450 million. The cost of going door to door in 2010, along with the  emerging availability of imagery data, led the Bureau to explore an  approach for 2020 address canvassing that would allow for fewer boots  on the ground.", "To reduce costs for the 2020 Census, the Bureau took a new approach  and some address canvassing work was completed in-office. The  Bureau compared current satellite imagery to the contents of its master  address file to determine if areas had housing changes, such as new  residential developments or repurposed structures. If the satellite imagery  and the master address file matched, then the Bureau considered those  areas to be resolved or stable and did not canvass them in-field.", "These areas that were unresolved by the in-office review were sent to in- field address canvassing. Field staff called listers used laptop computers  to compare what they saw on the ground to the address list and maps.  Listers confirmed, added, and deleted addresses or moved addresses to  their correct map positions. The listers were trained to speak with a  knowledgeable resident at each housing unit to confirm or update  address data, ask about additional units, confirm the housing unit location  on the map (known as the map spot), and collect a map spot either using  global positioning systems (GPS) or manually. If no one was available,  listers were to use house numbers and street signs to verify the address  data.

Seven listers we observed did not provide  confidentiality notices. Occupants may be more willing to provide their  information if they know their responses will not be shared. We  communicated the information regarding our observations to the Bureau,  and on August 26, 2019, the Bureau instructed its field offices to remind  listers of the appropriate procedures.", "According to Bureau officials, some amount of temporary staff deviates  from following procedures with every decennial census. As such, to  control for this, the Bureau implemented a Quality Control (QC)  component for in-field address canvassing that is designed to detect and  correct deficient production listers\u2019 work. QC started on August 11, 2019,  and included a total workload of around 3.4 million addresses. For this  operation, an automated system selected the sample of addresses to  review; these addresses were assigned to QC listers. QC listers received  instructions to begin canvassing at a specified location, usually an  intersection, and to continue canvassing addresses until the system  identified the work unit as \u201ccomplete\u201d for QC purposes.", "An address worked by a production lister was considered to have \u201cfailed\u201d  QC if the QC lister recorded changes, or if the lister missed the address  and the QC lister found it. Depending on the size of the block, after a  predetermined number of addresses fail within a block, the system fails  the entire block. Once a block fails, the QC lister must recanvas all the  addresses in that block. Based on preliminary results, Bureau officials  estimate that 4.3 percent, or about 2.2 million addresses, failed.  According to Bureau officials, while they did not have a predetermined  target for what was an acceptable range for the total number of  addresses that failed QC, they nevertheless are reasonably confident that  this was in an acceptable range for QC errors encountered during the  operation. They further stated that they could not compare 2020 QC  results to 2010 because the 2010 Address Canvassing Operation  canvassed 100 percent of the addresses in-field, while the 2020 In-field  Address Canvassing Operation only covered approximately 35 percent of  the addresses across the country.", "Lister productivity for QC was also higher than expected. The Bureau  anticipated the QC productivity at 8.03 addresses per hour compared to  the actual rate of 14.05 addresses per hour. Higher-than-expected  productivity rates contributed to a reduction in costs and the actual cost of  QC production was $10.3 million versus the anticipated cost of $25.6  million, a savings of $15.3 million.

The Bureau told us it filled the gap with listers who lived well outside of  the area in which they were supposed to work\u2014in some cases from a  different state. This strategy allowed the Bureau to complete the  operation on schedule; however, though the operation as a whole was  under budget, the Bureau incurred unplanned costs for travel (airfare,  personal mileage rates, rental cars, hotel stays, and per diem).", "As we previously reported, these hiring problems are an early warning for  what may occur later in the census during nonresponse follow-up, when  the Bureau intends to hire between 320,000 to 500,000 enumerators to  follow up with households that did not initially respond to the census. The  Bureau said the hiring issues were caused by delays in processing  background checks and greater-than-expected attrition. According to the  Bureau, these delays arose, in part, due to early shortages of staff to  review background checks and because a significant number of  applicants did not completely or accurately fill out related forms. In  February 2019, the Bureau began to bring on about 130 temporary staff  to review forms for accuracy and completeness prior to submission for  investigation and to help investigators conduct the pre-employment  background checks.", "Those delays in turn contributed to subsequent challenges in onboarding  listers for address canvassing. For example, according to Bureau officials,  the delays in early hiring for Area Census Office staff meant some offices  did not have enough clerks in place to process paperwork for listers or  make reminder phone calls to hire and onboard listers.", "Regarding attrition, more listers quit than expected at two points in the  hiring process:", "Fingerprinting: The Bureau expected about 15 percent of applicants  would leave the hiring process after being selected and before  submitting fingerprints. However, the attrition rate was closer to 25  percent. Bureau officials told us they attributed this to selected  applicants, in some cases, having to travel long distances to be  fingerprinted.", "Training: The Bureau found that fewer selected and cleared  applicants attended training than anticipated. Bureau officials  attributed this to fewer clerks being available to call trainees with  reminders to attend training due to delays in clerks receiving their own  background checks.", "Bureau officials also attributed some of this attrition to the 60-day period  between the selection of applicants and their training. This new time  frame was put in place for the 2020 Census to provide adequate time for  adjudication of background checks.", "The Bureau has begun to address these challenges by adapting its hiring  and onboarding processes for peak operations, such as nonresponse  follow-up, which is to begin May 2020. For example, the Bureau:  Increased the number of fingerprinting locations and machines.  According to Bureau officials, it added 133 additional sites and 300  additional machines, bringing the total number of vendor sites for  fingerprinting to 829.", "Staffed Area Census Offices to help newly-selected applicants for  positions complete their forms and initiate the background check  process.", "Hired additional staff to help clear background checks.

Operational issues such as listers not working assigned  hours or falling behind schedule need to be resolved quickly because of  the tight time frames of the address canvassing and subsequent  operations. For the address canvassing operation, the system generated  codes that covered a variety of operational issues such as unusually high  or low productivity (which may be a sign of fraud or failure to follow  procedures) and administrative issues such as compliance with overtime  and completion of expense reports and time cards.", "During the operation, more than 621,000 alerts were sent to census field  supervisors. Each alert requires the supervisor to take action and then  record how the alert was resolved. To assist supervisors, these alerts  need to be reliable and properly used. However, nine out of 22 census  field supervisors we spoke to indicated the alerts were not always useful.  For example, almost 40 percent of those alerts were related to no  progress being made on a block. This was due in part to listers opening  all of the blocks they were assigned on their laptops in order to manage  their workload, triggering the system that work had begun on all assigned  blocks when in fact the lister was only working one block. We first heard  about this issue from field supervisors in late August. Census field  supervisors we spoke to indicated that these alerts took an inordinate  amount of time to resolve, in part because almost every lister would open  every block to plan his or her day.", "We alerted Bureau officials in headquarters, and they notified area  census offices to remind supervisors to instruct listers not to open all of  their blocks at once. After the notification was sent out, Bureau officials  reported that the number of alerts due to blocks not being worked  declined. Bureau officials further stated that this issue would not impact  nonresponse follow-up because enumerators do not receive multiple  assignments, but instead receive, work, and transmit only one  assignment of housing units for follow-up a day.", "Another challenge faced by census field supervisors was providing  feedback to listers on why addresses failed quality control. Four of 22  census field supervisors we spoke with were not aware that they had  access to the reasons why addresses on a block failed quality control.  Knowing where to find this information would have allowed census field  supervisors to communicate this information to listers, thus improving  lister performance as well as the accuracy of the data collected. We  shared this information on some census field supervisor\u2019s lack of  awareness with the Bureau and on August 26, 2019, the Bureau notified  its field offices to remind supervisors that detailed information on why  addresses failed quality control was available on their laptops.", "For nonresponse follow-up, Bureau officials told us QC information about  any enumerator with a specified number of failed cases will be sent  directly to the Regional Census Center rather than the census field  supervisor. The Regional Census Center will decide whether the  enumerator should continue working and, if so, what corrective action to  take, such as retraining.
