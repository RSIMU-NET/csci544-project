In addition, the performance plan includes goals and measures for the internal processes it characterizes as crosscutting.", "NASA officials told us that the enterprise performance targets are indicators of progress toward the agency\u2019s near-term goals. Generally, the enterprise near-term goals are objective and free from bias. The plan provides both quantitative and qualitative measures for aspects of some of the goals. For example, in addition to quantitative measures for exploring the role of gravity in physical, chemical, and biological processes, the plan provides for using \u201cthe data obtained by fluid physics experiments on suspensions of colloidal particles on MSL-1  to answer fundamental questions in condensed matter physics.....\u201d NASA officials acknowledged that this would require the use of qualitative measures to determine whether the fundamental questions have been answered.", "OMB recommends that outcome goals be included in a performance plan whenever possible, but recognizes that agencies will supplement outcome goals with output goals. Some of NASA\u2019s performance measures are outcome oriented; others are output oriented. NASA officials told us that outputs are used when demonstrating intermediate progress in support of future outcomes and often reflect program commitments made in conjunction with science users. For instance, they said that the performance target of orbiting the asteroid Eros closer than 50 kilometers\u2014a performance measure associated with NASA\u2019s objective of exploring the solar system\u2014matches Near-Earth Rendezvous program expectations and specifications. A few performance goals are not specific to fiscal year 1999; rather, they span multiple years. For example, the plan provides for reducing \u201caverage spacecraft cost for Space Science and Earth Science missions to $190 million from $590 million.\u201d However, the performance target is based on comparing spacecraft programs completed in the time period of fiscal years 1990 through 1994 with those completed between fiscal years 1995 through 1999. NASA officials told us that expressing multiple year programs in a single-year context required by the Results Act was difficult and a source of frustration for the agency.", "In order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of the goals and performance measures chosen for its crosscutting processes, it would have been helpful for the plan to acknowledge the agency\u2019s major management challenges and associated corrective actions.

We have also identified other management challenges. These include: improving systems and information for monitoring contractor activities and complying with contract management requirements; implementing a new accounting system and the importance of this effort to providing Congress and agency management with better financial information and allowing the agency to move to full cost accounting; and resolving uneven progress toward better NASA and Department of Defense cooperation and developing a national perspective on aerospace test facilities.", "OMB guidance states that performance goals for corrective steps for major management problems should be included for problems whose resolution is mission-critical, such as problems that could materially impede the achievement of program goals. Recognizing those management challenges appears to meet the intent of OMB\u2019s guidance.", "Furthermore, although the performance plan includes performance targets related to contracting, such as increasing the obligated funds for Performance-Based Contracts to 80 percent, the performance measure can be better understood by referencing the agency\u2019s efforts to ensure that it has relevant and reliable methods for timely and accurate monitoring of its contract management activities.

NASA\u2019s performance plan contains a table that allocates NASA\u2019s $13.5 billion fiscal year 1999 budget request among its four enterprises and several other consolidated budget accounts. Each of the enterprises is related to a set of performance goals. However, the plan does not clearly explain how NASA\u2019s program activities relate to the budget totals presented for each enterprise. There is no crosswalk to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between the specific program activities in the budget and the goals and measures in the performance plan.

With the exception of stating that NASA assumes that International Space Station partners will meet their own schedules, the plan does not explain how NASA will address external factors that could affect the agency\u2019s performance during the coming fiscal year. In its strategic plan, NASA had identified several key external factors, such as the stability of future budgets. We believe that a similar discussion in the performance plan would be helpful.

In describing its internal crosscutting process characterized as \u201cCommunicate Knowledge,\u201d one of the objectives described is the development of educational outreach programs.

As previously discussed, the plan recognizes that securing collaboration and cooperation with other agencies and research partners is key to the successful accomplishment of its goals. In its description of the objective of making major scientific contributions to national and international environmental assessments, the plan can be improved by indicating whether NASA will rely on information provided by its partner, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to assess atmospheric effects of aviation, and if so, how the accuracy and reliability of FAA\u2019s data will be assessed.

Unfortunately, all the information NASA needs to measure the costs associated with its performance is currently not available.

Responding to the issues raised in this report, NASA concludes that it has complied with the requirements of GPRA. We agree. Our point in the report was that the plan contains areas that could be strengthened, making it more useful to the Congress. In discussing the strengths of NASA\u2019s performance plan, our report recognizes that the plan provided good linkage between strategic goals and the goals in the performance plan and that performance measures were generally objective, quantifiable, and useful for assessing progress. However, our report also clearly states that NASA\u2019s plan could provide a clearer picture of intended performance across the agency and does not fully portray how NASA\u2019s strategies and resources will help it achieve the plan\u2019s performance goals. The report also states that NASA\u2019s plan does not clearly explain how program activities relate to the budget; and that there is no crosswalk to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between the specific program activities in the budget and the goals and measures in the performance plan. As stated in our report, NASA is in agreement to merge the budget justification and performance plan process in an effort to provide a crosswalk showing the relationship of performance targets to program activities and resources. 2. In commenting on measures for major management challenges, NASA recognizes that the plan does not include measures to improve the management challenges we address. While these management issues may be addressed in other management documents, such as the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s Five-Year Plan, Chief Information Officer\u2019s Information Technology Implementation Plan and implementation planning documents being developed by the Office of Procurement, to which NASA alludes, we did not review these documents; neither does the performance plan include reference to them. Referencing these documents in the plan would have been useful in providing specific sources for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of these issues. We continue to believe that an acknowledgement of major management challenges and associated corrective actions would make the plan more useful for purposes of the Results Act. 3. In addressing the issue of resource requirements to achieve performance, NASA correctly restates our concern that the plan only addresses funding requirements for fiscal year 1999 at the Enterprise level. As in their comment to our point on not identifying management challenges, NASA makes the assumption that, since a discussion of operational processes, skills and technology, human and capital resources required to meet the performance goals is provided in the budget justification, it need not be included in the performance plan. Referencing these documents in the plan would have been useful in providing specific sources for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of these issues. 4. Responding to our concern that the plan\u2019s implementation strategy of applying the \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d approach to spacecraft development is not clearly explained, NASA contends that the statement that follows in the plan is a clear enough description of its approach. We do not agree. The statement NASA alludes to says that \u201cProgram managers are encouraged to accept prudent risk, shorten development time of technologies and missions, explore new conceptual approaches, streamline management, and incorporate innovative methods and technologies to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.\u201d In our opinion, this statement does not provide a clear explanation of NASA\u2019s implementation strategy. We continue to believe that a more explicit discussion of this approach is needed. 5. Our issue regarding EOSDIS is not in its lack of identification in the section discussing crosscutting information technology. Rather, we take issue with EOSDIS not being specifically mentioned either in the references cited in NASA\u2019s comments or anywhere else in the performance plan, despite the fact that NASA plans to spend well over $1 billion on the system. NASA\u2019s comment assumes that the reader of the plan would recognize EOSDIS as the vehicle for improving dissemination of Earth Science research results. We believe that a large investment such as EOSDIS should be explicitly addressed in the performance plan in order to ensure that its actual performance is understood. For example, a test of one part of EOSDIS in March 1998 revealed software problems that will force the launch of the EOS AM-1 satellite to be delayed by at least 6 months. We believe that the cost and schedule impact of this and other EOSDIS development problems needs to be explicitly and objectively assessed. 6. Responding to our concern about the lack of any discussion in the plan about the credibility of performance information, NASA officials expressed the belief that the data it collects will be credible and that we may be premature in passing judgement. As support, NASA references the audit of its fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 Accountability Reports by Arthur Andersen LLP, which the agency says found no significant issues with the credibility of NASA\u2019s performance information plans. We have three points regarding NASA\u2019s comment. First, the plan would have been strengthened by referencing the results of the Arthur Andersen LLP audit in the performance plan. Second, while a review of the Accountability Reports was not in the scope of our review, we believe that the objectives and performance measures in the performance plan are likely to be more results oriented than those included in the Accountability Reports NASA references. Third, while the plan does identify internal and external organizations that will evaluate its performance, we believe that it is not premature for NASA\u2019s performance plan to include a discussion of procedures that will be used to verify and validate performance data and the limitations that could exist with internal sources of data that NASA plans to use to assess performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the General Counsel", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["NASA Budget: Carryover Balances in Selected Programs (GAO/NSIAD-96-206, July 16, 1996).", "High-Risk Program: Information on Selected High-Risk Areas (GAO/HR-97-30, May 16, 1997).", "Results Act: Observations on NASA\u2019s May 1997 Draft Strategic Plan (GAO/NSIAD-97-205R, July 22, 1997).", "NASA: Major Management Problems (GAO/T-NSIAD-97-178, July 24, 1997).", "Managing for Results: Agencies\u2019 Annual Performance Plans Can Help Address Strategic Planning Challenges (GAO/GGD-98-44, Jan. 30, 1998).", "Aerospace Testing: Promise of Closer NASA/DOD Cooperation Remains Largely Unfulfilled (GAO/NSIAD-98-52, Mar. 11, 1998).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
