The JSF program, which has 90 percent of its investments still in the future, plans to concurrently test and produce aircraft thus weakening DOD's business case and jeopardizing its recapitalization efforts. It plans to begin producing aircraft in 2007 with less than 1 percent of the flight test program completed. DOD's current plan to buy about 3,100 new major tactical systems to replace its legacy aircraft represents a 33-percent reduction in quantities from original plans. With reduced buys and delays in delivery of the new systems, costs to keep legacy aircraft operational and relevant have increased. While the Secretary of Defense maintains that continued U.S. air dominance depends on a recapitalized force, DOD has not presented an investment strategy for tactical aircraft systems that measures needs, capability gaps, alternatives, and affordability. Without such a strategy, DOD cannot reasonably ensure it will recapitalize the force and deliver needed capabilities to the warfighter within cost and schedule targets. As DOD moves forward with its efforts to recapitalize its tactical aircraft, it needs to rethink the current business cases for the F-22A and JSF programs.

The F-22A was developed to replace the F-15 air  superiority aircraft. The continued need for the F-22A, the quantities  required, and modification costs to perform its mission have been the  subject of a continuing debate within DOD and the Congress.

Critics argue that the Soviet threat it was originally designed  to counter no longer exists and that its remaining budget dollars could be  better invested in enhancing current air assets and acquiring new and  more transformational capabilities that will allow DOD to meet evolving  threats. Its fiscal year 2007 request includes $800 million for continuing  development and modifications for aircraft enhancements such as  equipping the F-22A with an improved ground attack capability and  improving aircraft reliability.

However, the currently configured F-22A is not equipped to  carry out these roles without further investments in its development. The  F-22As modernization program is currently being planned for three basic  blocks, or spirals, of increasing capability to be developed and delivered  over time.

Moreover, the JSF program remains committed to a  business case that invests heavily in production before testing has  demonstrated acceptable performance of the aircraft. At the same time,  the JSF program has contracted to develop and deliver the aircraft\u2019s full  capability in a single-step, 12-year development program\u2014a daunting task  given the need to incorporate the technological advances that, according  to DOD, represent a quantum leap in capability.

By then, DOD will have procured more than double that  amount\u2014424 aircraft at an estimated cost of about $49 billion, and  spending for monthly production activities is expected to be about   $1 billion, an increase from $100 million a month when production is  scheduled to begin in 2007.

JSF has already  increased its cost estimate and delayed deliveries despite a lengthy  replanning effort that added over $7 billion and 18 months to the  development program. JSF officials have stated that the restructured  program has little or no flexibility for future changes or unanticipated  risks. The program has planned about 8 years to complete significant  remaining activities of the system development and demonstration phase,  including  fully maturing 7 of the 8 critical technologies;    completing the designs and releasing the engineering drawings for all    manufacturing and delivering 15 flight test aircraft and 7 ground test    developing 19 million lines of software code; and    completing a 7-year, 12,000-hour flight test program.", "The JSF program\u2019s latest planned funding profile for development and  procurement, produced in December 2004 by the JSF program office,  assumes annual funding rates to hover close to $13 billion between   2012 and 2022, peaking at $13.8 billion in 2013. If the program fails to  achieve its current estimated costs, funding challenges could be even  greater than that. The Office of Secretary of Defense Cost Analysis  Improvement Group was to update its formal independent cost estimate in  the spring of 2005. The group now does not expect to formally complete  its estimate until spring 2006, but its preliminary estimate was  substantially higher than the program office\u2019s. A modest cost increase  would have dramatic impacts on funding. For example, a 10 percent  increase in production costs would amount to over $21 billion (see fig. 2).", "DOD has recently made decisions to reduce near-term funding  requirements that could cause future JSF costs to increase. It had begun to  invest in the program to develop an alternative engine for the aircraft, but  now plans to cancel further investments in order to make the remaining  funds available for other priorities. According to DOD, it believes that  there is no cost benefit or savings with an engine competition for the JSF  and there is low operational risk with going solely with a single engine  supplier. DOD has already invested $1.2 billion in funding for this  development effort through fiscal year 2006. By canceling the program, it  expects to save $1.8 billion through fiscal year 2011. Developing  alternative engines is a practice that has been used in past fighter aircraft  development programs like the F-16 and F-15 programs. An alternative  engine program may help maintain the industrial base for fighter engine  technology, result in price competition in the future for engine acquisition  and spare parts, instill incentives to develop a more reliable engine, and  ensure an operational alternative should the current engine develop a  problem that would ground the entire fleet of JSF aircraft. As result, the  JSF decision should be supported by a sound business case analysis. To  date, we have not seen such an analysis.", "Finally, the uncertainties inherent in concurrently developing, testing, and  producing the JSF aircraft prevent the pricing of initial production orders  on a fixed price basis. Consequently, the program office plans to place  initial procurement orders on cost reimbursement contracts. These  contracts will provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the  extent prescribed in the contract. With cost reimbursement contracts a  greater cost risk is placed on the buyer\u2014in this case, DOD. For the JSF,  procurement should start when risk is low enough to enter into a fixed  price agreement with the contractor based on demonstrations of the fully  configured aircraft and manufacturing processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Tactical Aircraft Recapitalization Goals Are Not Being Met", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not been able to achieve its recapitalization goals for its tactical  aircraft forces. Originally, DOD had planned to buy a total of 4,500 tactical  aircraft to replace the aging legacy force. Today, because of delays in the  acquisition programs, increased development and procurement costs, and  affordability pressures, it plans to buy almost one-third fewer tactical  aircraft (see fig. 3). The delivery of these new aircraft has also been  delayed past original plans. DOD has spent nearly $75 billion on the   F-22A and JSF programs since they began, but this accounts for only   122 new operational aircraft.", "Because DOD\u2019s recapitalization efforts have not materialized as planned,  many aircraft acquired in the 1980s will have to remain in the inventory  longer than originally expected, incurring higher investment costs to keep  them operational. According to DOD officials, these aging aircraft are  approaching the end of their service lives and are costly to maintain at a  high readiness level. While Air Force officials assert that aircraft readiness  rates are steady, they agree that the costs to operate and maintain its  aircraft over the last decade have risen substantially. Regardless, the  military utility of the aging aircraft is decreasing.", "The funds used to operate, support, and upgrade the current inventory of  legacy aircraft represent opportunity costs that could be used to develop  and buy new aircraft. From fiscal years 2006 to 2011, DOD plans to spend  about $57 billion for operations and maintenance and military personnel  for legacy tactical fighter aircraft. Some of these funds could be invested  in newer aircraft that would be more capable and less costly to operate.  For example, the Air Force Independent Cost Estimate Summary shows  that the F-22A will be less expensive to operate than the F-15. The F-22A  will require fewer maintenance personnel for each squadron, and one  squadron of F-22As can replace two squadrons of F-15. This saves about  780 maintenance personnel as well as about $148 million in annual  operating and support cost according to the independent cost estimate.", "Over the same time frame, DOD also plans to spend an average of   $1.5 billion each year\u2014-or $8.8 billion total\u2014to modernize or improve  legacy tactical fighter aircraft (see fig. 4). Further delays or changes in the  F-22A or JSF programs could require additional funding to keep legacy  aircraft in the inventory and relevant to the warfighter\u2019s needs.", "In testimony last year, we suggested that the QDR would provide an  opportunity for DOD to assess its tactical aircraft recapitalization plans  and weigh options for accomplishing its specific and overarching goals. In  February 2006, the Secretary of Defense testified that recapitalization of  DOD\u2019s tactical aircraft is important to maintain America\u2019s air dominance.  Despite this continued declaration about recapitalizing tactical aircraft,  DOD\u2019s 2006 QDR report did not present a detailed investment strategy that  addressed needs and gaps, identified alternatives, and assessed costs and  benefits.

To take advantage of this  opportunity, however, DOD must fundamentally change the way it buys  weapon systems. Specifically, the department must change how it selects  weapon systems to buy, and how it establishes and executes the business  case. Although the F-22A program has progressed further in the  acquisition process than the JSF program, both programs are at critical  decision-making junctures, and the time for DOD to implement change is  now.", "Before additional investments in the F-22A program are made, DOD and  the Air Force must agree on the aircraft\u2019s capabilities and quantities and  the resources that can be made available to meet these requirements. A  cost and benefit analysis of F-22A capabilities and alternative solutions  weighed against current and expected threats is needed to determine  whether a sound business case for the F-22A is possible and whether  investing an additional $13.8 billion over the next 5 years to procure or  modernize these aircraft is justified.", "With more than 90 percent of investment decisions to develop, test, and  buy JSF aircraft remaining, DOD could implement significant changes in  its business case before investing further in the JSF program. The JSF  program should delay production and investments in production capability  until the aircraft design qualities and integrated mission capabilities of the  fully configured and integrated JSF aircraft variants have been proven to  work in flight testing. Also, an evolutionary acquisition strategy to limit  requirements for the aircraft\u2019s first increment of capabilities that can be  achieved with proven technologies and available resources could  significantly reduce the JSF program\u2019s cost and schedule risks. Such a  strategy would allow the program to begin testing and low-rate production  sooner and, ultimately, to deliver a useful product in sufficient quantities  to the warfighter sooner. Once the JSF is delivered, DOD could begin  retiring its aging and costly tactical aircraft. Capabilities that demand as  yet undemonstrated technologies would be included as requirements in  future JSF aircraft increments that would be separately managed. An  evolutionary, knowledge-based acquisition approach would not only help  significantly minimize risk and deliver capabilities to the warfighter  sooner, it would be in line with current DOD policy preferences.", "DOD\u2019s use of an evolutionary, knowledge-based approach is not  unprecedented. The F-16 program successfully evolved capabilities over  the span of 30 years, with an initial F-16 capability delivered to the  warfighter about 4 years after development started. Figure 5 illustrates the  F-16 incremental development approach.", "The F-16 program provides a good acquisition model for the JSF program.  For JSF, an evolutionary approach could entail delivering a first increment  aircraft with at least as much capability as legacy aircraft with sufficient  quantities to allow DOD to retire its aging tactical aircraft sooner and  reduce operating inefficiencies. Limiting development to 5-year  increments or less, as suggested in DOD\u2019s acquisition policy, would force  smaller, more manageable commitments in capabilities and make costs  and schedules more predictable. Some of the more challenging JSF  capabilities, such as advanced mission systems or prognostics  technologies, would be deferred and added to follow-on efforts once they  are demonstrated in the technology development environment\u2014a more  conducive environment to maturing and proving new technologies. A  shorter system development phase would have other important benefits. It  would allow DOD to align a program manager\u2019s tenure to the completion  of the phase, which would enable program managers to be held  accountable for decisions. It also would allow DOD to use fixed-price-type  contracts for production, and thereby reduce the government\u2019s cost risk.", "Additionally, DOD should do a more comprehensive business case  analysis of the costs, benefits and risks before terminating the alternative  engine effort. A competitive engine program may (1) incentivize  contractors\u2019 to minimize life cycle costs; (2) improve engine reliability and  quality in the future; (3) provide operational options; and (4) maintain the  industrial base.", "At a broader level, DOD needs to make more substantive changes to its  requirements, funding, and acquisition processes to improve weapon  system program outcomes. We have recommended these changes in past  reports and DOD has agreed with them. The January 2006 Defense  Acquisition Performance Assessment report, based on a study directed by  the Deputy Secretary of Defense, made some important observations  regarding DOD acquisitions. The report concluded that the current  acquisition process is slow, overly complex, and incompatible with  meeting the needs of DOD in a diverse marketplace. Notably, the report  confirmed that a successful acquisition process must be based on  requirements that are relevant, timely, informed by the combatant  commanders, and supported by mature technologies and resources  necessary to realize development. The report also pointed out that DOD\u2019s  acquisition process currently operates under a \u201cconspiracy of hope,\u201d  striving to achieve full capability in a single step and consistently  underestimating what it would cost to attain this capability. The report  makes a number of key recommendations for changing DOD\u2019s acquisition  process including the following:    develop a new requirements process that has greater combatant  commander involvement and is time-phased, fiscally informed, and  jointly prioritized;    change the current acquisition policy to ensure a time-constrained  development program is strictly followed;    keep program managers from the start of development through  delivery of the \u201cBeyond Low-Rate Initial Production Report\u201d; and    move the start of a development program to the point in time that a  successful preliminary design review is completed.", "Our work in weapons acquisition and best practices over the past several  years has drawn similar conclusions. We have made numerous  recommendations on DOD\u2019s acquisition processes and policy\u2014as well as  recommendations on specific major weapon system programs\u2014to  improve cost, schedule, and performance outcomes and to increase  accountability for investment decisions. In 2000, DOD revised its  acquisition policy to address some of our recommendations. Specifically,  DOD has written into its policy an approach that emphasizes the  importance of knowledge at critical junctures before managers agree to  invest more money in the next phase of weapon system development.  Theoretically, a knowledge-based approach results in evolutionary\u2014that  is, incremental, manageable, predictable\u2014development and uses controls  to help managers gauge progress in meeting cost, schedule, and  performance goals. However, DOD policy lacks the controls needed to  ensure effective implementation of this approach. Furthermore, decision  makers have not consistently applied the necessary discipline to  implement its acquisition policy and assign much-needed accountability  for decisions and outcomes. Some of key elements of acquisition that we  believe DOD needs to focus on include the following:    constraining individual program requirements by working within  available resources and by leveraging systems engineering;    establishing clear business cases for each individual investment;    enabling science and technology organizations to shoulder the    ensuring that the workforce is capable of managing requirements  trades, source selection, and knowledge-based acquisition strategies;    establishing and enforcing controls to ensure appropriate knowledge is  captured and used at critical junctures before moving programs  forward and investing more money; and    aligning tenure for program managers that matches the program\u2019s  acquisition time to ensure greater accountability for outcomes.", "In conclusion, despite DOD\u2019s repeated declaration that recapitalizing its  aging tactical aircraft fleet is a top priority, the department continues to  follow an acquisition strategy that consistently results in escalating costs  that undercut DOD\u2019s buying power, forces DOD to reduce aircraft  purchases, and delays delivering needed capabilities to the warfighter.  Continuing to follow a strategy that results in disappointing outcomes  cannot be encouraged\u2014particularly given our current fiscal and national  security realities.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I will be happy to  answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittee may  have."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Related Products", "paragraphs": ["Joint Strike Fighter: DOD Plans to Enter Production before Testing  Demonstrates Acceptable Performance, GAO-06-356 (Washington D.C.:  March 15, 2006).", "Defense Acquisitions: Business Case and Business Arrangements Key  for Future Combat System\u2019s Success, GAO-06-478T (Washington D.C.:  March 1, 2006).", "Defense Acquisitions: DOD Management Approach and Processes Not  Well-Suited to Support Development of Global Information Grid,   GAO-06-211, (Washington D.C.: January 30, 2006).", "Defense Acquisitions: DOD Has Paid Billions in Award and Incentive  Fees Regardless of Acquisition Outcomes, GAO-06-66, (Washington D.C.:  December 19, 2005).", "Unmanned Aircraft Systems: Global Hawk Cost Increase Understated in  Nunn-McCurdy Report, GAO-06-222R, (Washington D.C.: December 15,  2005)", "DOD Acquisition Outcomes: A Case for Change, GAO-06-257T,  (Washington D.C.: November 15, 2005).", "Defense Acquisitions: Progress and Challenges Facing the DD(X)  Surface Combatant Program GAO-05-924T.
