This increase was largely driven by the cost of employee and retiree benefits. Specifically, the amount WMATA was required to contribute to its pension plans increased by an annual average of about 19 percent during this period. Due to their relative size, proportion of retirees compared to active members, and investment decisions, these pension plans pose significant risk to WMATA's financial operations, yet WMATA has not fully assessed the risks. Without comprehensive information on the risks facing its pension plans, WMATA may not be prepared for economic scenarios that could increase its required contributions to an extent that might jeopardize its ability to provide some transit service.", "WMATA has implemented two employee performance management systems that cover all employees, but these systems lack some key elements of an effectively designed and implemented performance management system. For example, WMATA's performance management systems are not designed to make meaningful distinctions in performance, a key element of an effective system. This design is due in part to WMATA's lack of comprehensive policies and procedures for its performance management systems. In addition, WMATA lacks sufficient controls to ensure that supervisors complete required performance evaluations accurately and on-time. For example, in 10 of 50 performance evaluations we reviewed, we found scoring errors where employees were assigned a performance rating inconsistent with the supporting review.

WMATA officials attributed these increases to several factors. First, they  stated that paratransit service ridership and the contractor cost per trip  have increased. The officials estimated that providing paratransit service  currently costs WMATA about $50 per passenger trip. Second, WMATA  officials said adding five new Silver Line stations resulted in increases in contract costs because some of the services already provided by  contractors, including custodial services and some track work, were  extended to the new stations. Third, WMATA officials said they have been  using more contractors in recent years to control costs and improve  efficiency.

Unfunded liabilities are the estimated value of the  amount of additional assets, beyond any existing plan assets, that would  be required to fully fund accrued liabilities of a plan. The assets of  WMATA\u2019s pensions largely consist of investments in stocks, bonds, and  real estate. Unfunded liabilities are similar to other kinds of debt because  they constitute a promise to make a future payment or provide a benefit.", "According to WMATA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial  Report, WMATA\u2019s pension plans were underfunded by $1.1 billion for  fiscal year 2017, of which $814 million was attributed to WMATA\u2019s largest  pension plan\u2014Local 689. In contrast, WMATA\u2019s four retiree health  plans were pay-as-you-go during fiscal years 2006 through 2017,  meaning WMATA\u2019s annual plan contributions were benefit payments for  retirees each year in that period. Since WMATA did not make  contributions to prefund retiree health benefits, funds necessary for future  benefits were not accumulated as assets. As a result, the entire accrued  liability was an unfunded liability, and WMATA\u2019s four retiree health plans  were unfunded by over $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2017.", "WMATA officials said they have made several changes to reduce  unfunded pension and retiree health liabilities through negotiations with  WMATA\u2019s unions. For example, in 2014, Local 689 employees began  contributing a portion of their compensation (1 percent) to the Local 689  pension plan. This amount increased to 3 percent in 2015. Local 689  employee contributions reported for fiscal year 2017 were about $22  million, which was about 17 percent of the $127.5 million reported for  WMATA\u2019s contribution to their pension plan for that year. In addition,  according to WMATA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial  Report, non-represented and Local 2 employees hired on or after January  1, 1999 are not eligible for the defined benefit pension plan. WMATA also  reported that Local 689 and Local 2 employees hired on or after January  1, 2010, Metro Special Police hired after February 25, 2016, and non- represented employees hired after January 1, 2017 are not eligible for  retiree health benefits. Most recently, WMATA created a trust to fund  WMATA\u2019s retiree health benefits and invested $3 million in the trust.", "WMATA\u2019s pension plans, due to their relative size and maturity and  investment decisions, pose a particular risk to WMATA\u2019s financial  operations:", "Relative size and maturity: The size of WMATA\u2019s pension plans and  the overall maturity of the plans\u2019 participants pose a combined  financial risk to WMATA. WMATA\u2019s pension plans assets and  liabilities are large relative to its business operations. For example, in  fiscal year 2017, WMATA\u2019s pension assets ($3.6 billion) were about 5  times more, and its pension liabilities ($4.7 billion) about 6.5 times  more than its annual wages and salaries ($728 million). Because of  their relative size, changes in the value of these assets or liabilities\u2014 for example, as a result of underperforming investments or revisions  to actuarial assumptions\u2014could significantly affect WMATA\u2019s  operations. In addition, WMATA\u2019s pension plans are considered  \u201cmature\u201d by actuarial measures, meaning, for example, that they have  a high proportion of retirees compared to active members. A 2017  WMATA Board of Directors Pension Subcommittee report indicated  that if WMATA\u2019s assumed rate of return across all five plans  decreased from 7.66 percent to 7 percent, WMATA\u2019s required annual  pension contribution would increase $42 million, a 26 percent  increase, from 22 percent of wages and salaries ($160.7 million) to  about 28 percent of wages and salaries ($203 million).", "Investment decisions: WMATA\u2019s pension plans assume higher rates  of return than state and local pension plans generally do, according to  a recent National Association of State Retirement Administrators  report. For the 2017 plan year, WMATA\u2019s largest pension plan had  an assumed rate of return of 7.85 percent per year, and the weighted  average assumed rate of return for WMATA\u2019s five plans combined  was 7.66 percent. The average assumed rate of return among the  largest state and local government plans was 7.52 percent in 2017,  and dropped to a planned 7.36 percent for fiscal year 2018. If  WMATA\u2019s pension plan assets return significantly less than assumed,  WMATA\u2019s unfunded liabilities will be higher than anticipated,  potentially resulting in a spike in required contributions, as occurred in  the years following the 2007-2009 financial crisis (see fig. 2 above).", "WMATA\u2019s pension plans are largely invested in the stock market,  which also poses risk. For example, according to a November 2017  report to WMATA\u2019s Board of Directors Pension Subcommittee, 69  percent of WMATA\u2019s plan assets across all five pension plans were  invested in the stock market, and only 18 percent in fixed income or  cash. Investing in assets such as stocks may increase expected  investment returns, but it also increases risk because stock returns  are more volatile than investments in high quality bonds that provide a  more stable rate of return. In addition, with its mature plans,  WMATA faces a shorter time horizon before benefits for its retirees  and older workers will become due, leaving less time to recover from  investment shortfalls. According to literature on challenges facing U.S.  pension plans, plans should take on less risk as they become more  mature. This is because investment losses\u2014and corresponding  required increases in contributions\u2014can potentially be a high  percentage of wage and salary costs, with less time to make  adjustments. As described above, WMATA\u2019s pension plans are  considered mature, yet they still have a high percentage allocated to  risky assets.", "Although WMATA recently hired a consultant to complete a high-level  review of its pensions, it has not fully assessed the risks of its five  pension plans to the agency\u2019s financial operations. In 2016 and 2017  WMATA hired a consultant to provide an overview of its five pension  plans, including reviewing the plans\u2019 funding strategies and performance.  However, the stated purpose of these reports did not include an  assessment of risk, and the reports included only limited analysis of the  various risks facing WMATA from the plans, for example forecasting  WMATA\u2019s pension contributions over the next 10 years, but only under  one scenario. In addition, WMATA provided us with analyses conducted  by an actuary for each of its five pension plans, which included some  limited risk analysis for three of the five pension plans, and no risk  analysis for the other two plans, including the Local 689 plan\u2014WMATA\u2019s  largest. Neither WMATA nor the trustees for the Local 689 plan have fully  assessed the risks of that plan. WMATA\u2019s Office of Internal Compliance  has developed a process to periodically assess risks across the agency,  known as an Enterprise Risk Management Program, and reported that  pension risks could be assessed within this framework. However,  WMATA has not yet assessed the fiscal risks from its pension plans  within this program. WMATA officials said they are in the process of  identifying risks to include in this program for 2019.", "The internal control standards WMATA follows state that organizations  should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving their  objectives. Further, a Society of Actuaries Blue Ribbon Panel reported  that it is important for stakeholders\u2014such as trustees, funding entities,  plan members, union officials, and, in WMATA\u2019s case, its Board of  Directors\u2014to have comprehensive information about the current and  expected future financial position of pension plans and the extent of risks  facing pension plans. According to the Blue Ribbon Panel, this  information should include, among other things, \u201cstress testing,\u201d which  projects a plan\u2019s financial outcomes under adverse scenarios.", "WMATA officials told us that WMATA has not fully assessed pension  risks because WMATA\u2019s management does not have control over  decisions related to the risks its pension plans take. For example,  WMATA officials told us that given that both asset-allocation and  investment-return assumptions are the purview of plan trustees who are  required to act independently, WMATA has left the decision to determine  if risk analysis is necessary to the individual plans\u2019 trustees. WMATA  officials stated that even if they were to identify risks, there are not many  actions WMATA management could take to change them because  trustees have ultimate control over the plans\u2019 investment decisions.  However, the investment risks taken by the pension plans\u2019 trustees  ultimately affect the amount that WMATA is required to contribute, and  assessing those risks could help WMATA better anticipate its required  future pension contributions.", "Without a comprehensive assessment of these risks, WMATA and its  stakeholders\u2014such as its Board of Directors\u2014are limited in their ability to  prepare for economic scenarios that could ultimately increase the amount  WMATA is required to contribute to its pension plans. In addition, if  disappointing market returns were the result of a broader economic  downturn, WMATA\u2019s revenues\u2014such as those from local jurisdictions\u2014 could decline at the same time as higher pension contributions were  required. For example, as noted earlier, if WMATA\u2019s pension plans\u2019  assets of $3.6 billion return significantly less than assumed, WMATA  could experience a spike in required contributions, as it did in the years  following the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis. Such a spike would further  constrain WMATA\u2019s operating budget, and potentially jeopardize its ability  to pay for pension contributions or provide transit service. Moreover,  without a comprehensive assessment of these risks under various  scenarios, WMATA may lack useful information to develop risk mitigation  efforts and to inform its collective bargaining negotiations about pay and  benefits.

For example, Metro Special Police must earn a solid  performer or better rating to be eligible for salary increases. We have  previously noted that high-performing organizations seek to create pay  systems that clearly link to employee contributions. WMATA does not  link pay to performance for employees who fall under Performance  Conversations. Pay increases for these employees\u2014who are represented  by two of the largest unions at WMATA\u2014are determined by years of  service as described in the collective bargaining agreements. WMATA  officials said they had considered linking some pay to performance in the  past, but had not pursued this since they believe any changes to how pay  is awarded would have to be negotiated between WMATA and each  respective bargaining unit.", "Although WMATA has linked individual performance to pay for some  employees, the design of WMATA\u2019s performance management systems  lacks three additional key elements of an effective performance  management system as identified in our prior work and internal control  standards followed by WMATA. Those key elements are: aligning employee and agency goals and identifying responsibilities making meaningful distinctions in performance, and using tailored competencies to define needed skills and behaviors.", "Aligning employee and agency goals and identifying responsibilities:  PERFORMetro is not designed to align individual employee performance  with all of its strategic goals. While Performance Conversation forms  guide supervisors to discuss the employees\u2019 performance in relation to  each of WMATA\u2019s four strategic goals, supervisors under PERFORMetro  are required to evaluate employees on individual performance objectives  that are aligned with three of these goals. Supervisors under  PERFORMetro are not required to evaluate employees on a performance  objective aligned with WMATA\u2019s fourth strategic goal\u2014improving regional  mobility. WMATA officials told us it is up to individual supervisors to  determine whether to evaluate an employee on the fourth strategic goal.  Of the 50 performance reviews we assessed, we observed one that  aligned an employee\u2019s performance objectives with the organizational  goal of improving regional mobility. According to leading performance  management practices we previously identified, aligning individual  performance objectives with organizational goals helps individuals see  the connection between their daily activities and the organization\u2019s  goals. Without a mechanism in place to do this for PERFORMetro staff,  WMATA may not know how these employees are contributing to  increasing regional mobility, and employees may not know how they are  performing relative to this goal.", "In addition, WMATA has not consistently identified how its performance  management systems support its overarching strategic goals or assigned  responsibilities for implementing these systems. While WMATA issued a  staff memo in April 2016 that identified a goal for Performance  Conversations\u2014to ensure that employees understand how their  performance supports Metro\u2019s strategic goals\u2014WMATA has not done so  for PERFORMetro. In addition, none of the performance management  documents we reviewed clearly assigned authority or defined  responsibilities for implementing either PERFORMetro or Performance  Conversations. According to the COSO internal control standards, setting  program goals is a key part of the management process, and program- level goals should cascade from agency-level goals. Additionally, these  standards include establishing policies and procedures that effectively  document a program\u2019s design, delegation of authorities, and assignments  of responsibilities.", "Making meaningful distinctions: WMATA\u2019s performance management  systems are not designed to make meaningful distinctions in  performance. According to leading performance management practices,  the organization\u2019s leadership should make meaningful distinctions  between acceptable and outstanding performance of individuals.", "However, both of WMATA\u2019s performance management systems lack  clear definitions for supervisors and employees to use in assessing  performance. For example, WMATA leaves it up to employees and their  supervisors to identify and define many of the objectives on which  employees under PERFORMetro are evaluated. WMATA officials said  this provides supervisors some flexibility to account for the responsibilities  of employees in different positions. However, the result is that two  employees performing the same functions may be evaluated on different  objectives, making it difficult to distinguish their performance. Further,  under PERFORMetro supervisors are required to rate employees on each  objective as \u201cmet,\u201d \u201cdid not meet,\u201d and \u201cexceeded,\u201d but WMATA does not  provide definitions for these categories for each objective. As a result, two  employees rated under PERFORMetro could receive different ratings for  comparable performance. In addition, for employees under the  Performance Conversations system, WMATA does not require  supervisors to rate employee performance. Rather, officials told us that  WMATA implemented Performance Conversations as a way to  encourage more positive, performance-based interactions between  employees and management that expanded beyond discipline. WMATA  has a discipline-based program for most employees under Performance  Conversations (Local 689 bus and rail operations employees and Local  922 bus operators) that establishes standards of conduct these  employees must adhere to, and identifies penalties if they do not. This  discipline-based program lays out the penalties for violations of employee  standards of conduct such as speeding or failing to stop at a red signal.  The penalties for conduct violations range from written warnings, to  suspensions, to termination.", "Using competencies tailored to each position: WMATA\u2019s performance  management systems do not consistently use competencies to identify  the behaviors individual employees are expected to contribute to strategic  goals. Although WMATA has established competencies as part of its  PERFORMetro system, these competencies are defined in a uniform  manner that does not reflect the varied job responsibilities of its  employees. Inclusion of such competencies tailored to each position\u2019s  responsibilities is a leading practice for an effective performance  management system. Competencies, which define the skills and  supporting behaviors that individuals are expected to exhibit to carry out  their work effectively can provide a fuller picture of an individual\u2019s  performance. WMATA defines four competencies for all employees under PERFORMetro\u2014\u201dfocuses on safety,\u201d \u201cserves customers,\u201d  \u201caccountability,\u201d and \u201cteamwork.\u201d However, these competencies are  defined in the same way for all employees under PERFORMetro and are  not based on the job responsibilities of each position. For example,  WMATA assesses the performance of individuals performing different job  functions\u2014such as administrative staff and police officers\u2014by the same  competencies and without consideration for how skills and behaviors vary  by job function. As such, some portions of the competency descriptions  are not applicable to all employees. For example, all PERFORMetro  employees are evaluated on the extent that they wear required personal  protective equipment and/or clothing, but this may not apply to someone  in accounting or human resources. WMATA officials said they are aware  of this, and that supervisors choose which portions of the competency  descriptions to apply to their employees. Finally, WMATA officials said  they do not include competencies for employees under Performance  Conversations because Performance Conversations are intended to  promote performance discussions, not to evaluate employee  performance. However, without competencies tailored to employees\u2019  positions, supervisors are limited in their ability to assess employee  performance.", "WMATA\u2019s performance management systems lack key elements of an  effective performance management system in part because the agency  has not established comprehensive policies and procedures, as called for  by COSO, for its performance management systems. Instead, the agency  relies on piecemeal documents\u2014such as staff memos and training\u2014and  individual supervisors to define and carry out performance management.  By establishing comprehensive policies and procedures that document  key elements, such as defined objectives and rating categories, WMATA  would be better positioned to assess staff performance and ensure  performance management is consistently implemented across  supervisors.

As stated in our report, WMATA  hired a consultant in 2016 and 2017 to provide an overview of its five  pension plans, including reviewing the plans\u2019 funding strategies and  performance. However, the stated purpose of these reports did not  include an assessment of risk, and the reports included only limited  analysis of the various risks WMATA is facing from the plans, and only  considered a single scenario for estimating WMATA\u2019s future pension  obligations. As such we concluded that these reports did not constitute a  comprehensive assessment of risks facing WMATA from its pension  plans. Given the plans\u2019 large size relative to WMATA\u2019s business  operations, high proportion of retirees compared to active members, high  percentage allocation to risky assets, and high assumed rates of return,  WMATA\u2019s pension plans pose significant risk to its financial operations.

We selected 2006 to account for any potential  effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis on pension or other costs, and  because WMATA began contributing to its largest pension plan again in  2006 after a 6-year period of not contributing to this plan. To adjust  WMATA\u2019s costs for inflation, we used quarterly data on the GDP price  index, which we obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Inflation  adjustment factors are calculated to align with the definition of WMATA\u2019s  fiscal year, which begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following  calendar year. Our calculations adjust nominal values for inflation to find  real values are expressed in fiscal year 2017 dollars, where fiscal year  refers to WMATA\u2019s fiscal year. We also reviewed data WMATA provided  on operating and capital overtime costs, and the most recent actuarial  reports for each of WMATA\u2019s five pension plans for more information on  WMATA\u2019s pension obligations. Additionally, we analyzed characteristics  of WMATA\u2019s five pension plans in consultation with GAO\u2019s Chief Actuary  and in relation to actuarial principles and recent literature. Further, we  consulted with GAO\u2019s Chief Actuary for assistance in interpreting  information about WMATA\u2019s pension and retiree medical plans.", "To assess WMATA\u2019s pension costs, we reviewed pension expense\u2014  which reports WMATA\u2019s expense for its pension plans during a year, as  measured in accordance with pension accounting standards for financial  reporting purposes\u2014and pension contributions, which reports the amount  WMATA paid into its pension plans during a year. Both pension expense  and pension contributions increased substantially from fiscal years 2006  through 2017. While pension expense is the pension component of  WMATA\u2019s employee and retiree benefit cost data described above,  changes in pension accounting reporting standards in 2014 resulted in  pension expense being reported differently before and after 2014. As  such, we relied on pension contributions as our primary measure of  growth of WMATA\u2019s annual pension costs. To assess the reliability of  WMATA\u2019s budget data, and other data WMATA provided, we interviewed  WMATA officials on practices used to assemble these data. We found  these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To identify factors  contributing to changes in workforce costs, we interviewed WMATA  officials and reviewed WMATA\u2019s annual budgets, annual financial  statements, and actuarial statements for information on the total number  of authorized represented and non-represented staff, changes in  operating overtime costs, changes in pension-related costs, and other  factors that could influence workforce cost changes since fiscal year  2006.", "To evaluate how WMATA identifies and addresses its workforce needs,  we compared WMATA\u2019s workforce planning and workforce development  efforts to leading practices we previously identified and the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) internal  control standards, which WMATA follows. We previously developed  these leading strategic workforce planning practices based on a review of  documents from (1) organizations with government-wide responsibilities  for or expertise in workforce planning models and tools, such as the  Office of Personnel Management and the National Academy of Public  Administration, and (2) federal agencies recommended as having  promising workforce planning programs. Additionally, to identify these  practices we reviewed our prior reports and testimonies on human capital  issues and met with officials from the aforementioned organizations  concerning existing workforce planning models and lessons learned from  workforce planning experiences.", "In addition to comparing WMATA\u2019s workforce planning efforts to leading  practices and COSO standards, we reviewed WMATA\u2019s 2017\u20132019  individual department business plans and 2013\u20132025 strategic plan to  describe how WMATA identifies its short- and long-term workforce  needs. Furthermore, we obtained and reviewed WMATA information on  the positions WMATA eliminated in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, including  the number of positions that were vacant or occupied. Lastly, we  compared WMATA\u2019s workforce planning approach to those at a non- generalizable sample of five similar U.S. transit and rail agencies,  selected based on similarity in size, age, unions representing agency  staff, and stakeholder recommendations. Agency size was measured  according to unlinked passenger trips and passenger miles data in the  American Public Transportation Association\u2019s 2016 Public Transportation  Fact Book, the most recent issue available at the time of selection.  System age and union status were determined by a review of publicly  available information about each transit system such as academic papers  and transit agency websites. With input from industry, federal, WMATA,  and union stakeholders, we selected the following peer agencies: (1)  Chicago Transit Authority, (2) Los Angeles County Metropolitan  Transportation Authority, (3) San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit  District, (4) Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and (5)  Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad.", "To evaluate how WMATA designed, implemented, and monitored its  performance management systems, we reviewed documentation on  WMATA\u2019s two employee performance management systems\u2014 \u201dPERFORMetro\u201d for non-represented, Office and Professional Employees  International Union Local 2, Fraternal Order of Police, and International  Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 639 employees; and \u201cPerformance  Conversation\u201d for Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689 and International  Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 922 employees. We compared these  systems to leading performance management practices we have  previously identified and to the COSO internal control standards. We  previously identified these key practices for modern, effective, and  credible performance management systems by synthesizing information  contained in its previous performance management work. These  practices were also provided for comments to officials from the Office of  Personnel Management, the Senior Executives Association and the  Center for Human Resources Management at the National Academy of  Public Administration. In addition to comparing WMATA\u2019s performance  management systems to key practices and COSO internal control  standards, we also reviewed WMATA\u2019s 2013\u20132025 strategic plan, which  outlines WMATA\u2019s four strategic goals: (1) build and maintain a premier  safety culture and system, (2) meet or exceed expectations by  consistently delivering quality service, (3) improve regional mobility and  connect communities, and (4) ensure financial stability and invest in our  people and assets.", "To assess how WMATA implemented its performance management  systems, including what management controls it had in place to track the  completion of required annual employee performance reviews, we  interviewed WMATA human resources officials and assessed the data  they collected on the number of 2016 PERFORMetro year-end reviews  that were required and submitted by supervisors. WMATA officials could  not tell us how many PERFORMetro reviews or Performance  Conversation forms were required over the period we requested. WMATA  officials said that they had data on the number of 2016 PERFORMetro  reviews submitted to human resources, but did not collect any data on  Performance Conversation forms. As such, we requested the list of  submitted 2016 PERFORMetro reviews. WMATA human resources  management sent an email to all supervisors asking them to send the  reviews they had conducted in the 2016 performance period if they had  not already done so. While this information met our purposes for  performing a non-generalizable review of selected completed  performance reviews, data on the number of employees who were  required to have a performance review under PERFORMetro in the 2016  performance period and the number of those employees who received a  review were not reliable for reporting purposes. WMATA officials agreed  with our assessment that these data were not reliable for reporting  purposes.", "From the list of PERFORMetro reviews we received, we selected an initial  non-generalizable sample of 60 files to assess based on employee group  (non-represented, Local 2, and Metro Transit Police) and job title. We  selected 20 files from each of the three employee groups\u201410 files each  from the two job titles within each employee group with the highest  number of identified reviews. We selected the 60 files by assigning  random numbers to each file within the six selected job titles and  selecting the first 10 files in the sorted, randomized list. We adjusted our  random selection as needed to ensure our selection included  performance reviews completed by multiple supervisors. Our final  selection included the following performance review files:", "Non-represented employees (20 files total)", "Rail Operations Supervisor (10 files)", "Transit Field Operations Supervisor (10 files)", "Local 2 employees (20 files total)", "Training and Safety Instructor (10 files)", "Central Control Supervisor (10 files)", "METRO Transit Police Department (20 files total)", "METRO Police S (10 files)", "Special Police Series (10 files)", "While conducting our file review, we found that the Special Police Series  evaluation forms were significantly different than the other files and did  not align with the data collection instrument we had designed. As a result,  we did not include these 10 files, leaving us with 50 files included in our  final analysis. Lastly, as discussed in our report, we did not review any  Performance Conversation files as WMATA officials told us that they do  not track the completion of these forms and therefore did not have any  data on the number of Performance Conversation year-end reviews that  were completed in fiscal year 2017, the first year Performance  Conversations were implemented. Finally, we interviewed officials from  the FTA and union leadership from four of the five unions representing  WMATA employees.", "We conducted our work from July 2017 to September 2018 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Matt Barranca (Assistant  Director), Sarah Farkas (Analyst in Charge); Namita Bhatia Sabharwal;  Lacey Coppage; Tom Gilbert; Josh Ormond; Steve Rabinowitz; Michelle  Weathers; Hannah Weigle; and Elizabeth Wood made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["In recent years, Washington, D.C.'s Metro transit system has had serious safety problems and has lost revenue during lengthy maintenance.
