This report uses GAO's tax expenditures evaluation guide to determine what is known about: (1) the deferral of income for controlled foreign corporations; (2) deferred taxes for certain financial firms on income earned overseas; and (3) the graduated corporate income tax rate. GAO combined the two deferral provisions for evaluation purposes.", "GAO's guide suggests using five questions to evaluate a tax expenditure: (1) what is its purpose and is the purpose being achieved; (2) does it meet the criteria for good tax policy; (3) how is it related to other federal programs; (4) what are its consequences for the federal budget; and (5) how is its evaluation being managed? To address these questions, GAO reviewed the legislative history and relevant academic and government studies, analyzed 2010 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data, and interviewed agency officials and tax experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Deferral : Both deferral tax expenditures confer the benefit of effectively reducing taxes by delaying the taxation of certain income of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations until it is repatriated to the U.S. parent as dividends.", "1. While views on the purpose of deferral have changed over time, currently, it is often viewed by experts as promoting the competitiveness of U.S. multinational corporations. Some experts argue that this view is too narrow. For example, this definition of competitiveness ignores the effect on other corporations that cannot use deferral, such as those that are purely domestic or export without foreign subsidiaries. Further, it ignores impacts on the wider economy.", "2. Good tax policy has several dimensions. By delaying the tax on foreign source income, deferral could distort corporate investment and location decisions in a way that lower taxes, but favor less productive activities over more productive ones. Informed judgments about deferral's effect on the fairness of the tax system cannot be made because who benefits from deferral, after accounting for such factors as changes in prices and wages, has not been determined. However, there is widespread agreement among experts and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that deferral adds complexity to the tax code.", "3. GAO did not identify other federal spending programs that provide similar support to U.S. multinational corporations.", "4.

No federal agency has been tasked with evaluating deferral.", "Graduated corporate income tax rate schedule : The graduated tax rates lower tax rates for corporations with less than $10 million in taxable income.", "1. The purpose of the graduated corporate income tax rate schedule is viewed by the sources GAO reviewed as supporting small businesses. However, evidence is mixed on whether it achieves this purpose. The tax rates may not be well targeted toward supporting small businesses because corporations that are large in terms of assets and gross receipts may have taxable income that is small enough to qualify for the rates.", "2. The economic efficiency of the graduated rates depends on whether they correct for a market failure. This includes too few small businesses forming, given their potential for profit and innovation, which offsets the possible distortions from its advantaging one type of business organization over others. GAO did not identify any studies of the efficiency effects or those that specifically estimate the distribution of the benefits from the graduated rates. According to IRS staff, while the graduated rates present little complexity, some evidence of tax planning to avoid higher rates has been found.", "3.

Currently, there are two provisions that relate to the deferral of U.S.  taxation of foreign-source income: a general provision that applies to all  controlled foreign corporations and a special provision applicable to active  financial-services income. Another key component of reform discussions  is the appropriate corporate income tax rate and structure. The current  structure includes a set of graduated tax rates. The Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) identifies both deferral provisions and the graduated  rates as corporate tax expenditures because they are reductions in the  federal corporate income tax liability that result from special provisions of  the tax code. As our prior work pointed out, these tax expenditures are  among the largest utilized only by corporate taxpayers. According to  Treasury\u2019s estimates, the amount of corporate tax revenue forgone from  these three tax expenditures totaled almost $49 billion in fiscal year  2012. Modifying or eliminating these tax expenditures as part of  corporate tax reform will likely involve tradeoffs between various  objectives pursued by the federal government, such as tax revenue and  corporate investment.", "Because of your ongoing interest in whether and how well these tax  expenditures are achieving their purposes, you requested that we apply  the guide that we recently developed for evaluating the performance of  tax expenditures to certain corporate ones. determine what is known about the following three tax expenditures: (1)  the deferral of income for controlled foreign corporations; (2) deferred  taxes for certain financial firms on income earned overseas; and (3) the  graduated corporate income tax rate.", "This report uses our guide to  Because the two deferral provisions are so similar, we combine them for  evaluation purposes, and then evaluate the graduated rates separately.", "Our tax expenditure evaluation guide outlines a series of questions and  criteria that can be used to evaluate tax expenditures.

We also interviewed officials at  Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and three external experts,  one from CRS and two from universities, who have researched and  written extensively on the U.S. corporate income tax system. The results  from these interviews are not generalizable. When no consensus existed  among our sources for the answer to a question, we summarized the  debate and provided citations for the various views. We analyzed  Treasury\u2019s tax expenditure estimates from 1998 to 2012, and 2011  estimates by JCT on the revenue effects of changing tax expenditures.  We also analyzed 2010 data from the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI), the  most recent year available at the time of our work, and data from the  Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that covered 1987 to 2012.

Instead, these countries use a  territorial tax system that taxes only the income earned within a country\u2019s  physical borders, and exempts from tax dividends received from foreign  subsidiaries on their foreign earnings as well as gains realized on the sale  of foreign subsidiaries. There has been a trend of developed countries  moving towards territorial tax systems. As of 2012, 28 of the 34 current  member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development have adopted some form of a territorial tax system.  However, most countries generally do not use a pure form of either the  worldwide (also known as a full-inclusion system) or territorial tax system.  Rather, countries tend to use a hybrid system that contains some features  of both systems. For example, the deferral provisions in the U.S.  worldwide system delay the taxation of foreign source income, whereas a  purer form of the worldwide system would tax this income as it is earned.  As we have previously found, countries using the territorial approach do  not exempt all foreign source income from taxation, but have exceptions  for certain types of passive income.", "The income of controlled foreign corporations that is generated through  the primary business activities related to financial-services is excepted  from Subpart F\u2019s anti-deferral regime. Interest income, for example, which  would typically fall under the Subpart F definition, and thus would be  taxed currently whether or not it is repatriated to a U.S. parent  corporation, is permitted to be deferred under this active financial- services income provision. This tax expenditure is an exception to  Subpart F because it treats what would otherwise be considered passive  income as active business income that can be deferred since it was  earned through the primary business activities of financial-services  companies. The effect of the exception is to include financial-services  companies among the U.S. corporations that can defer taxation on their  business income earned abroad.", "The United States taxes all foreign and domestic corporate income using  a graduated corporate income tax rate structure. Corporations with less  than $10 million in net taxable corporate income are subject to different  tax rates, depending on the amount of income earned.

For others, competitiveness is a more general concept,  referring to the set of institutions, policies, and human and natural  endowments that make a country productive.

In this way, the U.S. worldwide system  has some features less like a pure worldwide system and more like a  territorial system. Moving in either direction would affect deferral. On one  hand, the United States could eliminate deferral if it moved towards a  more pure worldwide system by adopting a full inclusion system where  foreign source income is taxed by the United States as it is earned rather  than when it is repatriated. On the other hand, the United States could  move towards a more territorial system by exempting foreign source  income from U.S. taxation, or, in effect, making deferral permanent.effect on corporations\u2019 decision making and ultimately on efficiency will  depend on which way of ending deferral is adopted. The following  discusses some of the decisions that have been identified in the literature  where deferral could increase or decrease distortions.", "Some tax experts argue that deferral may distort decisions about where  U.S. corporations invest, compared to a full-inclusion system, if the U.S.  tax rate is higher than foreign tax rates, as is often the case. This  difference in tax rates, combined with the ability to defer paying the higher  U.S. tax until income is repatriated, could mean that a U.S. corporation  earns more after taxes from a less productive investment abroad than  from a more productive investment at home. The efficiency loss is the  loss of income (or product) that results when the corporation chooses the  less productive foreign investment because it produces a higher after-tax  return. Some research has shown that differences in tax burden do affect  corporations\u2019 real investment decisions, which could lead to these  efficiency losses. this distortion affecting the allocation of investment domestically or abroad  could potentially be reduced because the tax incentive to invest abroad  would be eliminated, since corporations would pay the same U.S. tax on  their worldwide income, whether it comes from foreign or domestic  investments. Under a territorial system, these investment location  distortions may increase relative to the current system because the tax  incentive to invest in low-tax countries may be enhanced when the  differences in tax rates are made permanent. However, the  responsiveness of investment decisions to tax rate differences indicates  that U.S. corporations could be at a disadvantage under a full inclusion  system as they could be competing against foreign companies which  would likely be taxed under a territorial tax system and at a lower tax rate.  This disadvantage would be removed under a territorial system where  U.S. corporations would face the same tax rate as foreign competitors  also operating in those countries.", "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Tax Effects on Foreign  Direct Investment: Recent Evidence and Policy Analysis: Tax Policy Study No. 17 (2007).", "Some experts and research that we reviewed argue that deferral may  reduce distortions, compared to a full inclusion system, about where  businesses decide to incorporate, and whether U.S. corporations choose  to change their country of incorporation to a foreign country (so-called  corporate inversions). By choosing not to have its corporate residence in  the U.S., a corporation could permanently avoid U.S. tax on income  earned abroad, and whatever income it is able to shift out of the U.S.  Deferral may somewhat reduce this distortion by allowing corporations to  defer from tax income earned abroad. Some research has indicated that  taxing income, once it is repatriated, affects decisions of where to  incorporate, or to change incorporation from one country to another.  Some research has also shown that most inversions that occur for tax  reasons are to avoid U.S. tax on income earned in the U.S. by increasing  the scope for income shifting rather than to avoid U.S. tax on foreign- source income. However, recent research has found mixed results on  trends in the number of inversions. Some have found that only a small  number of U.S. corporations that conduct initial public offerings have  reincorporated in low-tax countries, while others have recently highlighted  an increase in inversions. In 2004, legislation was passed to limit the  ability of U.S. corporations to change their country of incorporation to a  foreign country. This corporate residence distortion could be increased  by full inclusion, which would raise the effective U.S. tax on income  earned abroad, and encourage companies to avoid this tax by moving  their residence abroad. A territorial system would eliminate this incentive  by removing the U.S. tax on foreign source income.", "It is also argued that deferral, compared to a full inclusion system,  improves economic efficiency by removing distortions that affect  decisions about which subsidiaries and other assets corporations own.  Some corporate groups may be able to use foreign subsidiaries and  assets more productively because of synergies that result from ownership  within the corporate group, while another corporate group that acquired  these subsidiaries and assets would not have these synergies and  therefore would not be able to use them as productively. For this reason,  tax differences could lead to productivity loss when a corporation without  those synergies, but with more favorable tax treatment is able to outbid  for ownership of those assets a corporation with those synergies. In this  case, the use of deferral or a territorial system makes inefficiency less  likely and the move to full inclusion makes it more likely. However, others  argue that ownership synergies do not have significant effects on  productivity because there are numerous ways for corporations to use  assets as productively without owning them, such as leasing, contract  manufacturing, or licensing of trademarks or technology.deferral or a move to a territorial system would not produce significant  efficiency gains.", "Some research has also shown that deferral can distort decision making  by affecting the timing of repatriations, referred to as the \u201clockout\u201d effect.  The distortion would happen if deferral incentivizes corporations to keep  income abroad rather than repatriating it to the higher tax country. This  income may be more productive if repatriated and reinvested at home  rather than retained (or \u201clocked out\u201d) abroad for tax reasons.

Deferral\u2019s effect on the decisions just  discussed, where to invest, where to locate headquarters, whether to  make an acquisition, and when to repatriate income can depend on  factors such as the location of the market (domestic or foreign) and the  source of investment capital (again, domestic or foreign).

Economic incidence is difficult to determine due to  the complexity of the interactions that produce these price and income  changes. Studies of the distribution of burdens and benefits usually base  their estimates of economic incidence on empirical studies of how prices  in relevant markets, including markets for goods and services or labor  and capital markets, respond to changes in certain tax provisions.

The tax  expenditure estimates show that revenue losses from the general deferral  tax expenditure have increased significantly. These estimates of  increasing tax revenue losses are consistent with changes in the location  of earnings of U.S. corporations. During this period, U.S. corporations  were earning an increasing share of their profits from foreign sources,  likely increasing the amount of income deferred abroad.

Businesses are  less likely to incorporate if corporate tax rates are high, compared to  individual tax rates, and instead may choose another form of business  entity that is taxed under the individual tax rates.

Other sources of potential inefficiency include the incentive  provided by the graduated rates for small businesses to form as C  corporations to take advantage of lower corporate rates, compared to  those of individual tax rates.

Under the  current system, investment abroad has a lower tax cost when repatriation  of the foreign source income is deferred.
