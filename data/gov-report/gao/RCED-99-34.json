In earlier reports, we stated that USDA has made progress in achieving several specific goals set forth in the act. This progress included reducing the number of employees by nearly 20,000, consolidating headquarters offices, and combining field offices.

Several components of the Secretary\u2019s reorganization required enabling legislation, which the Congress provided in the Reorganization Act of 1994.", "In addition to granting USDA broad authority for streamlining and reorganization, the Reorganization Act of 1994 directed USDA to (1) reduce the number of full-time-equivalent staff by at least 7,500 by the end of fiscal year 1999, (2) reduce the number of staff so that the percentage of the reduction in headquarters is at least twice that in the field offices, (3) consolidate headquarters offices, and (4) combine field offices and have them share resources.", "By the end of fiscal year 1997, USDA had achieved most of the act\u2019s goals. It had reduced its overall staff-years by nearly 20,000, from about 129,500 in 1993 to about 110,000 by the end of 1997; 22 percent of the reductions occurred in headquarters, and about 13 percent occurred in field offices. In addition, the number of USDA agencies fell from 43 to 29, most of which are under seven mission areas. (App. I shows USDA\u2019s staff by mission area and agencies and headquarters staff offices.) Of the seven mission areas, five include more than one agency. In four of these five mission areas,USDA has designated one agency as the lead administrative agency for the mission area.

USDA officials explained that the plan, when fully implemented, is expected to reduce costs and improve customer service and operating efficiencies. In addition, they said the plan will require up to 4 years to implement because the Department will need to complete a number of time-consuming and complex actions\u2014relocating offices, developing common policies and procedures, and instituting common computing systems. Even though these actions are expected to provide savings and efficiencies in the long term, the Department has not identified the costs it will incur in the short term to achieve these savings.

The plan\u2019s functions include financial management (excluding budgeting), human resources, civil rights, information technology, and management services (such as procurement and printing). By consolidating these functions into a single administrative support unit in each state or consolidated operations center, USDA expects to reduce the administrative staff for the seven field-based agencies by 45 percent from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 2002. However, by 1997, two-thirds of these reductions had already occurred. (See table 1.)

These challenges include relocating offices, developing common policies and procedures, and adopting a common computing environment. In addition, USDA officials said that strong leadership will be needed to implement the plan and additional investments for collocating offices and modernizing business processes and information technology will be required."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Relocating Offices", "paragraphs": ["Currently, in 28 states, the state offices for each of the different field-based agencies are not located in the same facility (collocated), and in 19 of these states, the offices are not even located in the same city. USDA is planning to begin consolidating administrative functions before many of these state offices have collocated. In those instances, the agencies will continue to maintain staff in up to three separate offices. Consequently, in these states, the benefits of sharing resources\u2014reducing staff and equipment and expanding staff expertise\u2014will not be fully realized until the agencies\u2019 state offices are collocated. For example, in Kansas, the FSA, NRCS, and RD state offices are located from 50 to 100 miles apart in three separate cities. As a result, even though these agencies\u2019 administrative staff will be one organization on paper, they will continue to function in up to three separate locations until the offices are collocated, requiring USDA to retain more administrative staff and continue to pay for separate equipment and facilities.", "In addition, at least some of the 24 collocated state offices will need to be reorganized before they can operate efficiently under the Administrative Convergence Plan. For example, several collocated state offices have separate office suites for each agency\u2019s staff. Agency officials acknowledged that to combine administrative staff into functional work units under administrative convergence, it will be necessary to move staff within existing office space, reconfigure existing office space, or move agency operations to new facilities.", "In other cases, collocated offices are already designed to operate effectively under the planned administrative convergence. For example, the new state office for FSA, NRCS, and RD in Boise, Idaho\u2014opened in February 1998\u2014is expected to facilitate administrative convergence once the plan is implemented. When the three agencies planned the new office, they required that all employees in a functional area\u2014such as human resources or information technology\u2014share a common work space. In addition, the agencies share common mail rooms, printing equipment, and other office facilities. According to state officials, their location in a shared facility has already increased the efficiency of their operations by allowing them to have fewer staff, less space, and less equipment.", "USDA estimates that it will cost as much as $29 million to collocate offices in 24 of the 28 states where they are not currently collocated, including moving personnel and acquiring new space, and an undetermined amount to reconfigure existing space for collocated offices. Figure 3 shows the states with collocated offices, and those with noncollocated offices. (App. IV provides more detailed information on the noncollocated locations).", "While FSA, NRCS, and RD are subject to the same administrative regulations, each has developed a different approach to implementing them. As a result, there are slight to significant differences in the policies, procedures, and business processes that each agency follows.", "For example, NRCS and RD state offices have authority over personnel actions for employees up to the level of General Schedule-13 and are delegated authority to obligate funds for most categories of procurement. In contrast, FSA state offices have far less authority over personnel actions and procurement.", "For budgeting, NRCS provides each state with a single budget allocation for its program and administrative expenses. However, RD allocates specific budget line items to its state offices for their individual programs, salaries, and administrative expenses. FSA headquarters allocates the total number of staff that each state may have each fiscal year and retains control over certain state-level administrative expenses, such as office leasing and information technology.", "State office officials note that their agencies also need to develop common business processes to standardize their personnel and recordkeeping systems. Currently, the National Finance Center provides payroll processing for USDA employees. However, NRCS uses a different process than FSA and RD for entering personnel and payroll transactions transmitted to the center."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing a Common Computing Environment", "paragraphs": ["To modernize and integrate the separate information systems currently used by the agencies undergoing administrative convergence, USDA plans to acquire a single, integrated information system\u2014referred to as the common computing environment. The common computing environment, as part of USDA\u2019s effort to modernize its business processes and information technology, will consist of new computer hardware and software applications. This new integrated system may require as many as 38,000 new personal computers and 24,000 printers, which will be expected to operate in more than 3,000 locations nationwide. As we reported in August 1998, USDA estimates that the costs of implementing a common computing environment may exceed $2.6 billion over its expected 15-year life cycle.", "The effort to acquire and install this system will be significant, complex, time-consuming, and costly. Achieving a common computing environment requires these agencies to accomplish many activities, such as reengineering and creating a common set of business processes, designing common software, and determining the requirements for hardware. In addition, FSA, NRCS, and RD have 150 existing software applications, many of which must be modified. It is not clear when USDA will complete these tasks. Some planning documents show that the tasks may be completed by fiscal year 2002, while others show a completion date as late as fiscal year 2008. Until existing business applications are modified, USDA plans to maintain and operate both the old and new information systems.", "In our August 1998 report, we found several fundamental planning and management weaknesses in the Department\u2019s effort to modernize business processes and technology for the agencies undergoing administrative convergence. In light of these weaknesses, we suggested that the Congress consider limiting funding for information technology for these agencies\u2019 field offices to no more than the level needed to meet Year 2000 compliance requirements until appropriate action was taken to resolve these weaknesses. USDA started acquiring new hardware and software for its common computing environment at the end of fiscal year 1998, when it purchased over 16,000 personal computers. While this purchase was principally made to replace computers that are not Year 2000 compliant, USDA also expects this procurement to enable its field-based agencies to use common software applications that will support administrative convergence in such areas as human resources, procurement, and travel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Need for Strong Leadership", "paragraphs": ["USDA officials emphasized the need for the Secretary to move quickly to fill key leadership positions for the Support Services Bureau and charge the appointed officials with the responsibility to implement the Administrative Convergence Plan once it has been approved.

These decisions include determining how the new organization will be funded in the long term, how authority will be delegated within the organization, and how staff will be classified.", "Currently, three separate administrative structures provide support to seven agencies in 50 states, two territories, and several FAS overseas offices. As mentioned earlier, these agencies have developed different approaches to delivering administrative services to their customers. The administrators for these three structures are focused on the delivery of several programs in addition to administrative support.

However, they acknowledge that budgetary savings from staff reductions will be decreased in the next several years by the costs of collocating state offices, modernizing business processes, and acquiring and implementing a common computing environment. If the administrative convergence is fully implemented in 2002, the savings in administrative staff is projected to total about $144 million annually. However, these savings will be reduced by the approximately $29 million associated with merging offices in 24 of the 28 states that do not yet have collocated offices and by several million dollars annually for modernizing business processes and implementing a common computing environment.

However, although it has developed savings estimates associated with staff-year reductions, these estimates do not include any offsetting expenses as a result of employee buyouts and reductions in force.

Additional outcome-oriented performance measures could help USDA determine when it is achieving the overall objectives of the Reorganization Act of 1994. For example, using the ratio of the number of employees served per personnel specialist as a broad measure of efficiency, we found that although USDA had reduced its personnel staff departmentwide by 17 percent from September 1993 to September 1997, the ratio decreased from 55 to 54 employees served by one personnel specialist, indicating that the personnel reductions had not increased efficiency. Other measures of effectiveness could include (1) financial measures, such as cost per employee hired; (2) customer satisfaction measures, such as those associated with responsiveness and quality; and (3) process effectiveness measures, such as the time it takes to complete specific administrative functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USDA has made a number of organizational changes since 1994 to reduce its staff and streamline its operations.

The 1994 act also had as its objectives more efficient operations to better carry out the Department\u2019s missions. Without an assessment of the overall effects of its departmentwide streamlining efforts, USDA cannot know the extent to which its efforts have been successful in achieving all of the objectives mandated by the 1994 act.", "USDA\u2019s current reorganization task\u2014the convergence of administrative functions at the state level for the field-based agencies\u2014is complex and, even under the best of circumstances, will be difficult to implement effectively and efficiently. However, we believe that there are weaknesses in USDA\u2019s current plans for administrative convergence that could hinder its successful implementation. First, while the convergence is likely to save money in the long run, USDA has not calculated the costs associated with implementing the plan. As a result, USDA managers lack key cost information that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of various actions that the Department has taken or will take in connection with administrative convergence.
