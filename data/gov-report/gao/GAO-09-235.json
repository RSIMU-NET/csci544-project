With more than 50 percent of its civilian workforce (about 700,000 civilians) eligible to retire in the next few years, DOD may be faced with deciding how to fill numerous mission-critical positions--some involving senior leadership. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 requires DOD to develop a strategic human capital plan, update it annually through 2010, and address eight requirements. GAO previously found that DOD's 2007 plan did not meet most requirements. The 2007 NDAA added nine requirements to the annual update to shape DOD's senior leader workforce. GAO was asked to assess the extent to which DOD's 2008 update addressed (1) the 2006 human capital planning requirements, (2) the 2007 senior leader requirements, and (3) key factors that may affect civilian workforce planning. GAO analyzed the update, compared it with the requirements, and reviewed factors identified in the update and prior GAO work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DOD's 2008 update to its strategic human capital plan, when compared with the first plan, shows progress in addressing the FY 2006 NDAA requirements, the update only partially addresses each of the act's requirements. For example, DOD identified 25 critical skills and competencies--referred to as enterprisewide mission-critical occupations, which included logistics management and medical occupations. The update, however, does not contain assessments for over half of the 25 occupations, and the completed assessments of future enterprisewide mission-critical occupations do not cover the required 10-year period. Also, DOD's update included analyses of \"gaps,\" or differences between the existing and future workforce for about half of the 25 occupations. Finally, DOD's update partially addressed the act's requirements for a plan of action for closing the gaps in DOD's civilian workforce. Although DOD recently established a program management office whose responsibility is to monitor DOD's updates to the strategic human capital plan, the office does not have and does not plan to have a performance plan--a road map--that articulates how the NDAA requirements will be met. Until such a plan is developed, DOD may not be able to design the best strategies to address the legislative requirements and meet its civilian workforce needs. DOD's 2008 update and related documentation address four of the nine requirements in the FY 2007 NDAA for DOD's senior leader workforce and partially address the remaining five. For example, the update identifies a plan of action to address, among other things, changes in the number of authorized senior leaders. However, the update noted that DOD had conducted only initial leadership assessments as a first step in identifying some of its needs, capabilities, and gaps in the existing or projected senior leader workforce and stated that the final assessments would not be completed until the summer of 2009. Although DOD recently established an executive management office to manage the career life cycle of DOD senior leaders, as well as the FY 2007 NDAA requirements, this office has not and does not plan to develop a performance plan to address the NDAA-related requirements. While DOD's 2008 update identified some key factors that could affect civilian workforce plans, such as base closures and legislation requiring the use of government employees for certain functions, it does not include strategies for addressing these factors. For example, the update noted that DOD may consider using government employees to perform, among other things, an activity performed by a contractor when an economic analysis shows DOD civilian employees are the low-cost providers, but DOD does not provide a strategy for doing so. Further, GAO's body of work has noted a similar factor not discussed in DOD's update--DOD's extensive reliance on contractors and its long-standing challenges in developing a civilian workforce strategy to address the use of contractors and the appropriate mix of contractors and civilians. Without strategies that address key factors like the use of contractors, DOD may not have the right number of people, in the right place, at the right time, and at a reasonable cost to achieve its mission in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Having the right number of federal civilian personnel with the right skills  Having the right number of federal civilian personnel with the right skills  is critical to achieving the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) mission.

WASS is used to  evaluate workforce trends and can perform simple to complex analyses  from counts and averages to trend analyses, using such characteristics as  employee age, retirement plan participation, and historical retirement  data. CIVFORS was adapted from an Army military forecasting model for  civilian use in 1987 and uses data from DOD\u2019s Defense Civilian Personnel  Data System (DCPDS). CIVFORS is a life-cycle modeling and projection  tool, which models most significant events, including personnel actions  such as promotions, reassignments, and retirements. Officials can use a  default projection model or create their own, which can be tailored to  examine issues such as projected vacancies of hard-to-fill occupations or  turnover in specific regions by occupation. The workforce forecasts are  generated over a 7-year projection period, using the most recent 5 years of  historical data. While CIVFORS is used at the DOD enterprisewide level,  the department has not directed the components to use the system. As a  result, components use various systems and approaches for their forecasts  and trend analyses. For example, when we met with officials from the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) they noted that while they had received  training on WASS/CIVFORS, the agency was not currently using the  program, though they were having discussions to determine if they wanted  to use the system in the future.

The update mentioned that the department may  consider using government employees to perform, among other things, a  new mission requirement or an activity performed by a contractor when  an economic analysis shows DOD civilian employees are the low-cost  providers. The department further noted that the increased use of civilians  to accomplish such critical work will put greater demands on its civilian  human resources, policies, and practices.", "We have previously reported a similar factor that has been a primary  challenge for DOD\u2014the department\u2019s increasing reliance on contractors.  GAO\u2019s body of work has shown that DOD faces long-standing challenges  with increased reliance on contractors to perform core missions. These  challenges are accentuated in operations such as Iraq, where DOD has  lacked adequate numbers of personnel to provide oversight and  management of contractors.", "Key to meeting this primary challenge is developing workforce strategies  that consider the extent to which contractors should be used and the  appropriate mix of contractor and federal personnel. In 2003, we  recommended that DOD develop a human capital strategic plan that  considers contractor roles and the mix of federal civilian and contractor  employees in these plans. DOD did not concur with this recommendation,  at the time, noting that the use of contractors was just another tool to  accomplish the department\u2019s mission and was not a separate workforce  with separate needs to manage.

Among other things, we discussed the department\u2019s efforts  to establish an executive management office for talent management and  succession planning at the OSD level.", "Finally, we identified and reviewed factors that may affect DOD\u2019s civilian  workforce planning such as those that DOD identified in its update. We  also analyzed prior GAO reports examining other human capital  challenges within DOD related to the department\u2019s reliance on contractors  and discussed these matters with DOD and service officials. We conducted  this performance audit from February 2008 to February 2009, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Examples of DOD\u2019s and the Components\u2019 Senior Leader Development and Training Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Programs", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, in response to recommendations from the Commission on Roles  and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense (DOD)  created its Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP). This  is a program aimed at preparing civilian employees for key leadership  positions throughout the department. DOD refers to DLAMP as a  systematic program of \u201cjoint\u201d civilian leader training, education, and  development that provides the framework for developing civilians with a  DOD-wide capability, substantive knowledge of the national security  mission, and strong leadership and management skills.", "Between 1997 and 2006, 1,894 participants were admitted to DLAMP, of  which 1,132 completed senior-level professional military education, 480  graduated, 470 remained in the program, and 187 were selected for Senior  Executive Service positions. Based on feedback from the components and  program participants, DOD made modifications to the program and  decided to end DLAMP in its current form in 2010. The modifications to  DLAMP resulted in it being transitioned into a new program called  Defense Senior Leader Development Program (DSLDP).", "The modified approach in DSLDP focuses on developing senior civilian  leaders to excel in the 21st century\u2019s joint, interagency, and multinational  environment. DSLDP supports the governmentwide effort to foster  interagency cooperation and information sharing by providing  opportunities to understand and experience, first-hand, the issues and  challenges facing leaders across DOD and the broader national security  arena.", "Table 4 shows the differences between DOD\u2019s DLAMP and DSLDP  programs. For example, DLAMP was a self-paced program and DSLDP  uses a cohort-based approach.", "In addition to DLAMP, DOD has revamped its Executive Leadership  Development Program (ELDP), another program at the Office of the  Secretary of Defense level designed to develop a pipeline of high-potential  future leaders. The ELDP is a 10-month program for GS-12- to GS-14- equivalent civilian personnel.

The specific sections  are entitled, \u201cThe following additional comments are provided regarding  the GAO report\u201d and \u201cDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE GENERAL  COMMENTS.\u201d  1.  DOD states that contractor issues were not a part of our interviews  and fact finding for this review. However, as identified in the DOD  notification letter, other challenges and emerging issues facing DOD\u2019s  Senior Executive Service (SES) workforce in the human capital area  was a key question included in this review. Our approach included  reviewing our prior work, analyzing DOD\u2019s update, interviewing OSD  and component officials about these issues, and discussing our  potential findings with them. These officials noted that contractor  reliance was a major challenge for the department, and we noted that  the DOD 2008 update did not mention this as one of the challenges  and, thus, did not provide a strategy. As noted in our report we  assessed the extent to which the update addressed key factors like the  reliance on contractors.  2.  DOD states that our report mentions the need for increased contract  oversight and that this issue, again, was not part of our interviews or  fact-finding. See comment 1.  3.  DOD stated that our review was bifurcated between an independent  GAO review of the defense acquisition workforce section and a review  of the remaining part of the update to DOD\u2019s plan. This is not correct.  This review focused on how DOD\u2019s 2008 update submitted to Congress  addressed the Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 and 2007 National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) and key factors that could affect civilian  human capital planning. According to section 851 of the FY 2008  NDAA, DOD was required to include a section on the defense  acquisition workforce planning efforts in its 2008 update, but it did not.  This review focused on DOD\u2019s 2008 update. A separate GAO review is  looking at, among other things, the defense acquisition workforce  requirements in the FY 2008 NDAA.  4.  DOD stated that we did not address the department\u2019s efforts to  institutionalize strategic human capital management planning. We  disagree. As we state in the report, the objectives for our review were  to assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s update addressed the FY 2006 and  FY 2007 NDAA requirements and key factors that may affect civilian  workforce planning and our report was, therefore, structured  accordingly. Our report did, however, note some of DOD\u2019s efforts\u2014 including issuance of a DOD Instruction on Strategic Human Capital  Management and training for component representatives on the Office  of Personnel Management\u2019s forecasting tool.  5.  DOD\u2019s comments provided a list of institutionalized efforts that  included issuance of a DOD Strategic Human Capital Management  instruction. This information is referenced in our report.  6.  DOD\u2019s comments provided a list of institutionalized efforts that  mentioned training of component representatives on the Office of  Personnel Management forecasting tool. This information is  referenced in our report.  7.  DOD\u2019s comments provided a list of institutionalized efforts that  mentioned formulation, submission, and authorization of a budget for  the strategic human capital management program office. We added  some of this information to our report.  8.  DOD\u2019s comments noted that our report said that more than 50 percent  of the DOD civilian workforce is eligible to retire in the next few years  and noted that this statement was correct but misleading because the  figure included optional and early retirement. We have revised our  report accordingly.  9.  DOD\u2019s comments said that our assertion that the department\u2019s  forecasting was for a 7-year period and not a 10-year period is correct;  however, the department believes that a 7-year forecast is valid and  should be acceptable because it mirrors DOD\u2019s budget planning cycle.  We provided DOD\u2019s perspective in our report but note that the FY 2006  NDAA requires a 10-year forecast.  10. The department noted that our report said DOD does not have and  does not plan to have a performance plan or road map for its newly  formed civilian workforce readiness program office and that this  statement was not correct. It further noted that, at the time of our  review, the newly formed program office was only a couple of months  old, its staffing was still in progress, and there would definitely be both  a performance plan and a road map for the office. The department  stated that these were just not complete at the time of the GAO  engagement. We disagree. To the contrary, DOD did not provide us  with any specific documentation that a performance plan was in  progress during our review. In fact, we were told that the department  did not have a performance plan and the Civilian Personnel Policy  office, which has responsibility for the new program management  office, normally does not produce such documents. We were further  told that, essentially, any overall plan for the new office was scattered  through several documents\u2014including position descriptions, budget  requests, and briefings to senior leadership.  11. DOD stated that our report discussed DOD\u2019s mix of contractors and  civilians and this was not discussed during our interviews. We  disagree. See comment 1.  12. DOD\u2019s comments state that our report discussed the department\u2019s  reliance on contractors and this was not raised in discussions with  DOD. We disagree. See comment 1.  13. DOD\u2019s comments assert that our report incorrectly states that the  department did forecasting only for eleven mission-critical  occupations and this was not correct. We have revised the report  accordingly.  14. DOD states that our report indicates that the department did a gap  analysis for about half of its 25 enterprisewide mission-critical  occupations, but it was not clear to what gap analyses this was  referring. It further noted that, if the report was referring to a  competency gap assessment, it was misleading and noted that the  update had discussed competency assessments on pages 2-15 through  2-25 of its update. We note that our report states that 11 gap  assessments were done with the forecasting tool---10 of which DOD  identified as \u201csteady state\u201d and one with an actual gap. We further  noted that the update also discussed other gap assessments for six  enterprisewide mission-critical occupations. We note that only one of  these was not previously identified as one of the 11 mission-critical  occupations with gap assessments\u2014this was the computer science  mission-critical occupation. We also clarified that competency gap  assessments were done at the component levels and provided  examples in the body of our report.  15. DOD states that our report indicates DOD\u2019s update partially addressed  a plan of action to develop and reshape the civilian workforce and note  that while its recruitment, retention and development activities did not  focus solely on its mission-critical occupations, the strategies are  widespread and cover most of the department\u2019s occupations. We note,  however, that the law required the plan to address identified gaps in its  \u201ccritical\u201d skills and competencies or what DOD has identified as  enterprisewide mission-critical occupations.  16. While DOD acknowledged our report correctly stated that its update  contained appendixes on 12 mission-critical occupations, it believed  that we did not reflect the totality of the Departments efforts because  the acquisition workforce section was not considered in the GAO  assessment. As stated in comment 3, information from the section on  defense acquisition workforce planning was not included in our report  because it was not completed during the course of our review.  17. DOD\u2019s comments stated that the acquisition community had  conducted a human capital analysis and undertaken initiatives to  strengthen this workforce and these should be included in the GAO  report. We disagree. See comment 3.  18. DOD stated that chapter 3 of its update addressed recruitment and  development strategies to meet DOD civilian workforce needs\u2014noting  that strategies were key to ensuring the successful conversion of  military positions to civilians and readying a supply of candidates to  meet in-sourcing requirements. Accordingly, the department noted that  it believed it indeed had strategies in place to address emergent  recruitment needs. We note however that the introduction and  executive summary of the update noted several factors we discussed  as challenges and stated that strategies, at the time of our review, were  being developed\u2014and, as stated previously, contractor reliance was  not identified as a challenge in the update."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, Marion Gatling, Assistant Director;  Andrew Curry; Michael Hanson; Mae Jones; Amber Lopez; Lonnie  McAllister; Brian Pegram; Charlie Perdue; Terry Richardson; and Nicole  Volchko made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Human Capital: Diversity in the Federal SES and Processes for Selecting  New Executives.
