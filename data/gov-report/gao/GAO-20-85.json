This report provides information on FTA's emergency relief allocations and examines FTA's and FEMA's coordination.

Most of Puerto Rico's funds, and around half the funds FTA allocated ($116 million), will be distributed to one transit system\u2014Tren Urbano\u2014San Juan's rail-transit service provider (see figure below).", "While FTA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared information and coordinated efforts, both agencies still approved about $35,000 to one applicant for the same expenses. GAO found that FTA awarded a grant in April 2019 that included expenses for which FEMA had already obligated funds in January 2019. Although FTA contacted FEMA prior to the award to inquire whether the applicant had received FEMA funding, FEMA did not respond within 5 days, and per an agreement between FTA and FEMA, FTA processed the application. After GAO identified the duplicate funding, FTA and FEMA took steps to limit the potential for duplicate funding; FTA, for example, changed its policy of moving applications forward after 5 days if FEMA does not respond. FTA and FEMA officials noted challenges they face in identifying transit expenses in the applications they receive. For example, they may be unaware that a transit agency received FEMA funds if it received those funds through a larger entity such as a city, county, or state government. Although the amount of funding FEMA and FTA approved for the same expenses was relatively small, without addressing these challenges, FTA and FEMA will continue to face the risk that both agencies will approve funding for the same expense in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FTA and FEMA identify and develop controls, such as methods to more easily identify transit expenses within larger applications, to address the risk of duplicate funding.

Two agencies play an important role in providing  funding to transit agencies following a disaster: the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) within the  Department of Transportation (DOT).", "Prior to 2012, the primary source of federal funding for transit agencies  working to recover after a disaster was FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance  Program. In 2012, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century  Act (MAP-21) authorized FTA\u2019s Public Transportation Emergency Relief  program. Because the FTA program is focused on public transportation  specifically\u2014unlike FEMA\u2019s more general program\u2014FTA has primary  responsibility for reimbursing emergency response and recovery costs  after an emergency or major disaster that affects a public transportation  system if FTA receives funds for the program in an annual or  supplemental appropriation, or continuing resolution. In February 2018,  Congress appropriated $330 million to FTA\u2019s Public Transportation  Emergency Relief program in a supplemental appropriation\u2014the second  time funding has been appropriated to the program\u2014to provide funding to  transit agencies affected by the 2017 hurricanes (Harvey, Irma, and  Maria).

This report provides information on the amount of emergency relief funds FTA  allocated to repair and replace transit facilities damaged by hurricanes  Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the purposes of these allocations, and examines the extent to which transit agencies applied to FEMA for  funding as well as FTA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s coordination.", "To determine the amount of funds FTA allocated to repair and replace  transit facilities damaged by the 2017 hurricanes, we reviewed FTA\u2019s May  31, 2018, notice of allocation of emergency relief funds, in which FTA  described the amount of funding it would provide to each municipality and  public transit provider. To understand the purpose of the allocations and  how FTA funds would be used, we reviewed FTA\u2019s damage assessment  reports for the 2017 hurricane. These reports describe the location and  type of damage in specific areas as well as the estimated costs to  address the damage. One analyst categorized the types of expenses into  specific categories and summed the total amount of funding provided for  various types of expenses (such as repairs to bus terminals), and a  second analyst verified the categorizations. To assess the reliability of the  data, we shared our analysis with FTA and incorporated its proposed  updates, where appropriate. We did not independently verify the  estimated damage costs. In addition, we conducted site visits to Texas,  Florida, and Puerto Rico (the states and territory receiving the largest  FTA allocations following the 2017 hurricane) to tour damaged facilities  and interview officials from a non-generalizable selection of two to four  transit agencies in each state or territory. Sites were selected to include  transit agencies with the largest allocations as well as those within driving  distance of one another, for logistical reasons.", "To examine whether transit agencies applied to FEMA for funding, we  interviewed the transit agencies mentioned above and we conducted a  web-based survey of the 52 transit agencies that received a direct  allocation of emergency relief funding from FTA (FTA grantees). Forty- four of the 52 FTA grantees (85 percent) completed our survey. We  asked about the level of their engagement with FEMA. We initially fielded  the survey from December 10, 2018, to January 15, 2019, and continued  to accept responses from a few grantees until March 12, 2019. To assess  FTA and FEMA\u2019s coordination, we interviewed officials from FTA  headquarters and division offices responsible for administering the Public  Transportation Emergency Relief program, as well as FEMA officials at  headquarters and regional offices responsible for administering FEMA\u2019s  Public Assistance program for the selected states and territories. We  reviewed documentation from FTA and FEMA coordination meetings, as  well as emails regarding specific applications between FTA and FEMA  staff. We compared FTA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s coordination against federal  internal control standards as well as statutory requirements in MAP-21  and FTA and FEMA guidance regarding how the agencies should  coordinate.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to November 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

For example, Congress provided  roughly $232 million in response to the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes and  over $10 billion in response to Hurricane Sandy.", "FEMA is the federal government\u2019s primary agency for disaster response.  In addition to coordinating disaster response and recovery operations,  FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program provides funding to state and local  governments and some nonprofit organizations for recovery efforts after a  disaster, including removing debris, implementing emergency protective  measures, and repairing or replacing damaged public equipment or  facilities. Once the President has declared a disaster, FEMA; the state or  territorial government (the recipient); and the local or territorial entities  (the subrecipient) work together to develop damage assessments and  formulate project worksheets for eligible projects. Project worksheets  detail the scope of work and estimated cost for repairing or replacing  disaster-damaged infrastructure. After a project has completed FEMA\u2019s  review process and is approved, funding is available to FEMA for  obligation from the Disaster Relief Fund. The recipient draws down\u2014or  withdraws\u2014funding to pay the subrecipient for eligible work upon  completion.", "Because FTA\u2019s Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program is  focused on public transportation specifically\u2014unlike FEMA\u2019s more  general program\u2014FTA has primary responsibility for reimbursing  emergency response and recovery costs after an emergency or major  disaster affects a public transportation system if FTA receives funds for  the program in an annual or supplemental appropriation or continuing  resolution. The Public Transportation Emergency Relief program is a  reimbursable grant program and allows FTA to make grants for capital  projects to protect, repair, reconstruct, or replace equipment and facilities  of a public transportation system as well as for eligible operating costs.  Such costs include reestablishing, expanding, or relocating public- transportation route service in the event of a natural disaster that affects a  wide area or a catastrophic failure from any external cause.", "Congress has not provided an annual appropriation for FTA\u2019s Public  Transportation Emergency Relief Program but has provided supplemental  appropriations following a specific event. Eligible recipients (referred to in  this report as \u201cFTA grantees\u201d) of FTA\u2019s Public Transportation Emergency  Relief funding are entities that receive funds directly from FTA. Following  the appropriation for the 2017 hurricanes, FTA staff and contractors  visited sites to develop damage assessments\u2014these assessments  provide information on, among other things, the specific location, type of  facility or equipment, nature and extent of damage, and a preliminary cost  estimate to restore, replace, or reconstruct the damaged system. FTA  then uses the information in these damage assessments to determine  how to allocate funding among the affected FTA grantees. After FTA  announces the allocations, FTA grantees can submit an application for  funding to FTA. After FTA has approved the application and obligated  funds, recipients must execute the grant agreement to draw down funding  for reimbursement of eligible expenses.", "As required by MAP-21, FTA and FEMA have entered into a  memorandum of agreement (MOA) to delineate the roles and  responsibilities of the two agencies and establish procedures to  coordinate assistance for public transportation following a disaster. We  reported in 2014 that because FTA\u2019s Public Transportation Emergency  Relief Program is inherently limited by its inability to fund any activities  without specific congressional action (in contrast to the other emergency  program we examined), FTA and FEMA face challenges clearly  delineating the responsibilities and costs each agency will assume during  future disasters. We recommended that FTA and FEMA establish  specific guidelines to monitor, evaluate, and report the results of  collaborative efforts for future disasters. FEMA concurred with this  recommendation and FTA took no position. The agencies addressed the  recommendation by: (1) implementing a communications protocol to  coordinate the two agencies in providing funding to transit agencies and  (2) committing to jointly monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on the  effectiveness of agency collaboration following events in which both  agencies provided funding.", "In August and September 2017, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria  made landfall in Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico,  affecting over 28 million people and causing significant damage to public  transit infrastructure (see fig. 1).

FTA\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s  communications protocol also states that it may be appropriate for an  agency to receive funding from both FTA and FEMA in a situation where  the grantee provides both public transportation services and services  other than public transportation.

FTA and FEMA officials informed us of, and provided  documentation of, their coordination efforts, such as biweekly conference  calls, and email correspondence among staff. For example, when  Congress appropriated funds to FTA, FEMA provided FTA a list of  agencies that had applied to FEMA for funding. In addition, when FTA  reviewed grant applications, FTA staff emailed FEMA staff to inquire whether applicants had already requested funding from FEMA. To avoid  delays in processing applications, FEMA and FTA established an  agreement that if FEMA did not respond to such requests in 5 days, then  FTA could proceed with processing the application. Based on our  document reviews, we found that FTA staff also emailed FEMA staff a  copy of the final award.

In June  2019, we found a case in which FEMA and FTA both approved roughly  $6,000 to repair a light pole at a bus stop in Collier County, Florida.  Specifically, although FEMA had obligated funds to Collier County for the  light pole in January 2019, FTA awarded funds for the same light pole in  April 2019. One month prior to FTA\u2019s award to Collier County, we notified  FTA that Collier County had indicated in our survey that it had been in  contact with FEMA. Subsequently, FTA staff twice emailed FEMA staff to  inquire as to whether Collier had requested funds from FEMA, but FEMA  staff did not respond. Per their agreement, FTA moved the application  forward after receiving no response from FEMA within the 5-day  timeframe. FTA awarded the funding to Collier County in April 2019. After  we notified FTA and FEMA that they both appeared to have awarded  funds for the same expense, FEMA de-obligated the funds for Collier  County. In addition, FEMA conducted an additional review and found that  both agencies had also approved $29,000 in funding for repairs to a  transit facility in Collier County. FEMA officials stated they were in the  process of de-obligating those funds as well. Although both agencies  awarded funds to Collier County, the County had not yet executed the  FTA grant or drawn down any of the funds.", "FTA and FEMA officials noted that both agencies can face challenges in  identifying transit expenses submitted to both agencies. For example,  FTA may be unaware of transit agencies receiving FEMA funds if these  agencies are not direct recipients of such funds, but rather receive funds  through a larger entity such as a city, county, or state government. Thus,  although FEMA provides FTA with a list of entities that applied for FEMA  funds, the list may only show a county\u2019s name, rather than the name of a  transit agency. In addition, while FTA also asks applicants whether they  have received FEMA funds, applicants may be unaware of the status of  their FEMA reimbursement. For example, officials from Collier County\u2019s  public transit department told us they were unaware that FEMA had  obligated funding for their transit expenses until May 2019 (one month  after the FTA award), because it took several months for the funding from  FEMA to be processed at the state and county level.", "While FTA officials shared proposed and final awards with FEMA, we  identified 10 cases, including Collier County, in which FEMA officials did  not respond within the established 5-day time frame. When we asked why  FEMA did not respond within the 5-day time frame, FEMA regional staff  stated that the responsible person had since left that office. However,  officials noted challenges they face identifying transit expenses contained  within applications sent to FEMA by larger entities that may contain  hundreds of pages, while at the same time processing a large number of  applications related to the hurricanes. Specifically, in order to identify  transit expenses within an application, FEMA staff may need to search  these hundreds of pages using various transit-related word searches. For  example, according to FEMA officials, Collier County currently has a total  of 126 active ongoing and obligated projects and 86 inactive projects that  were either withdrawn or determined ineligible.", "After we notified FTA and FEMA that they had approved funding to Collier  County for the same expense, both agencies took steps to limit the  potential for duplicate funding in future awards. As noted above, FEMA  conducted an additional review of applications for which FEMA had not  responded to FTA\u2019s inquiries within the 5-day time frame and identified  the $29,000 for transit facility repairs that FTA and FEMA both approved  for Collier County. In addition, FTA officials updated their internal grants  guidance to indicate that FTA staff should not process an application if  FEMA has not responded and FTA has reason to believe there may be a  potential for duplicate funding (for example, the recipient notifies FTA that  it had previously worked with FEMA to reimburse transit expenses). In  such cases, FTA may only proceed after FEMA has replied in writing that  they have not identified any expenses in the FTA grant that are also in a  FEMA grant, or, if FEMA does identify duplicate funding, after one agency  removes such expenses from their grant to the recipient.", "In 2014, we noted that evaluating and reporting the results of  collaborative efforts can identify areas for improvement and  recommended that FTA and FEMA establish specific guidelines to  monitor, evaluate, and report the results of collaborative efforts. FTA and  FEMA implemented this recommendation and committed to jointly  monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019  collaboration following future events in which both agencies provide  funding. In addition, FTA and FEMA took action to address the duplicate  award of funding we identified in our review. Nonetheless, FEMA staff  continue to face challenges identifying transit expenses within  applications submitted by larger entities, and FTA may be unaware of  whether transit entities are included in such applications.

FTA and FEMA have taken important steps  to coordinate, including establishing an MOA and communications  protocol that outline how FTA and FEMA staff should share information.  Although FEMA and FTA both approved a relatively small amount of  funding for the same expenses in Collier County, the issues that  contributed to this outcome involve a risk of providing duplicate funding in  the future.
