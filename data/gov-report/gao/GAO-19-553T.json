It provides payments for eligible veterans to cover tuition and fees, housing and other costs while they pursue a higher education. However, for some veterans this pursuit is interrupted when the school they attend unexpectedly closes.", "This testimony addresses (1) the distribution of Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments among schools, (2) outcomes of students at schools that receive the most Post-9/11 GI Bill payments, and (3) how school closures can affect student veterans.", "To address these topics, GAO reviewed VA data on Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments to schools for fiscal year 2017, the most recent school-level data available. GAO analyzed student outcome measures for these schools using Department of Education data reported for school year 2017-2018. GAO also reviewed its prior reports issued between 2013 and 2017 on school closures, credit transfers, and related challenges faced by student veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2017, nearly 700,000 student veterans used their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to attend programs at almost 6,000 schools. Of the almost $4.5 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments VA made to schools in fiscal year 2017, about 40 percent went to public schools, 30 percent to nonprofits, and 30 percent to for-profits. A small number of schools received a large share of the tuition and fees paid, with 30 percent of payments totaling $1.4 billion going to 50 schools that enrolled over 190,000 veterans in fiscal year 2017.", "The average student outcomes at the 50 schools that received the highest total amount of Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments in fiscal year 2017 were generally comparable to the national averages, but varied widely when examined by school sector. For example, the average 4-year program graduation rate for the top 50 schools was the same as the national average (61 percent). Within the top 50 schools, average graduation rates varied between public (73 percent), nonprofit (66 percent) and for-profit schools (22 percent).", "Although a relatively small number of schools close each year, these closures can affect thousands of student veterans. School closures, which have increased in recent years, are particularly harmful when they involve large schools that close abruptly with little or no advance warning. For example, more than 7,000 veterans receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits were attending schools operated by Corinthian Colleges and ITT Educational Services when they abruptly closed in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Although veterans affected by school closures may qualify to have their GI Bill benefits restored, these closures can create hardships for veterans and significant costs for taxpayers. For example, veterans can face challenges transferring credits and continuing their education at a new school. This may make it more difficult for veterans to complete their degrees before exhausting their eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. School closures also pose a financial risk for the government and taxpayers due to the costs associated with restoring benefits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the effect of school closures on  student veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has provided  $94 billion in education benefits under the Post-9/11 Veterans  Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) to over 2 million  veterans since the program began in 2009, according to VA. This  program provides funding that helps cover eligible veterans\u2019 tuition and  fees (that VA pays directly to schools), as well as monthly housing  benefits and book stipends (that VA pays directly to veterans). These  benefits enable veterans to pursue a higher education and develop skills  to help them re-enter the workforce. However, recent news reports about  school closures have raised questions about the effect of these closures  on student veterans\u2019 education benefits.", "My remarks today address three objectives: (1) the distribution of Post- 9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee payments among schools, (2) the outcomes of  students at schools that receive the most Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee  payments, and (3) how school closures can affect student veterans. To  answer objective one, we analyzed school-level data from VA on Post- 9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries, tuition and fee payments, and school  characteristics for fiscal year 2017, the most recent data available. For  our second objective, we analyzed school-level 4-year program  graduation rates, retention rates, and school characteristics from the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Integrated Postsecondary  Education Data System (IPEDS) for school year 2017-2018, the most  recent data available. In addition, to estimate how many student  veterans receive federal student aid we reviewed data from Education\u2019s  National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) for school year  2015-16, the most recent data available. We assessed the reliability of  the VA and Education data by performing electronic tests on specific data  elements used in our analyses and by reviewing documentation about the  specific data systems and our prior work that assessed the reliability of  similar data. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the VA  and Education data were sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes.  My testimony related to objective three is based on our prior reports on  this topic issued between 2013 and 2017 and cited throughout this  statement. We used multiple methodologies to develop the findings,  conclusions, and recommendations for these reports. A more detailed  discussion of the objectives, scope, and methodologies, including our  assessment of data reliability, is available in each report.", "We provided a copy of the applicable new information that we are  reporting in this testimony to VA and Education for comment. VA and  Education provided technical comments, which we addressed as  appropriate.", "The work upon which this statement is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took  effect on August 1, 2009, is now VA\u2019s largest educational program. This  program generally provides benefits to veterans who served on active  duty for at least 90 days beginning on or after September 11, 2001. Full  benefits are generally available to those who served on active duty for 36  months, for which VA will pay the net cost for in-state tuition and fees at  public schools and up to an annual maximum amount at nonprofit and for- profit schools ($24,477 in academic year 2019-2020). VA pays schools  directly for tuition and fees and sends additional payments for housing  and books directly to veterans who are eligible for these payments. To  receive education benefits through the Post-9/11 GI Bill, students submit  applications to VA, schools certify enrollments, and VA processes claims  and payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Sources of Student Aid", "paragraphs": ["For help covering the costs of their postsecondary education, veterans  may also be eligible for grants and loans available from federal student  aid programs administered by Education, such as Pell Grants and Direct  Loans.

VA education payments, such as  Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, are not considered when calculating eligibility  for federal student aid and do not affect the amount of aid a veteran can  receive from Education. Student veterans may also be eligible for state  and institutional aid (scholarships from state governments or schools, for  example)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Student Veterans Attend a Wide Range of Schools, but a Small Number of Schools Receive a Large Share of Post- 9/11 GI Bill Payments", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 700,000 student veterans received Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition and fee  benefits to attend almost 6,000 schools in fiscal year 2017.

Veterans may also use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for training opportunities  at schools that do not offer college degrees, including training in areas  such as driving, emergency medical training, and barber or beautician  skills.

In 2017 we reported  that about 95 schools closed in school year 2015-16, according to  Education data, which was higher than in previous years, primarily due to  a rise in for-profit school closures (see fig. 5).", "Schools can close in different manners and for a variety of reasons,  including declining enrollments, financial problems, loss of accreditation,  and legal actions. When a school ceases operations in an orderly process  over several months it gives students time to complete the current school  term and make arrangements to transfer and continue their education at  another school. The effect of school closures is often worse when the  closures occur abruptly with little or no advance warning, because these  schools generally do not have time to establish transfer arrangements  that allow students to easily continue their education at another school.", "Abrupt closures of large schools, although infrequent, can affect  thousands of student veterans and result in large financial losses for the  federal government and taxpayers. For example, Corinthian Colleges  Inc. (Corinthian) enrolled more than 72,000 students before its closure in  April 2015. The following year, ITT Educational Services Inc. (ITT),  another large for-profit provider of higher education, closed all of its 136  campuses in September 2016, affecting more than 35,000 students. More  than 7,000 Post-9/11 GI Bill students were pursuing educational  programs at schools operated by ITT and Corinthian at the time of their  closures, according to VA. More recently, closures at Education  Corporation of America in 2018 and Dream Center Education Holdings in  2019, which operated schools under multiple brands, including Argosy  University and several campuses of The Art Institutes, affected tens of  thousands of students, including thousands of Post-9/11 GI Bill recipients.", "Student veterans attending a school that closes may be eligible to have  some or all of their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits restored. As a result of the  Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, VA  restores GI Bill entitlements to eligible beneficiaries affected by recent  and future school closures. Student veterans may also be entitled to a  discharge on eligible federal student loans they may have received from  Education or to have their Pell Grant eligibility restored if they are unable  to complete a program because their school closed.", "Despite these options for having benefits restored and loans discharged,  school closures can still create hardships for veterans. As we have  previously reported, college students in general can face challenges  transferring credits and continuing their education at a new school under  any circumstances. Students who transferred lost, on average, an  estimated 43 percent of their credits, and credit loss varied depending on  the transfer path, based on data from 2004 to 2009. For example,  students who transferred between public schools\u2014the majority of transfer  students\u2014lost an estimated 37 percent of their credits. In comparison,  students who transferred from for-profit schools to public schools\u2014which  happens less frequently\u2014lost an estimated 94 percent of their credits.  Even if a student\u2019s credits transfer, they may not apply toward fulfilling  degree requirements for their intended major. In these cases, a student  will likely have to take additional courses at their new school, which could  potentially delay graduation and result in additional costs to pay for  repeated courses. Further, some student veterans with credits that do not  transfer may exhaust their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits before completing  their degree.", "School closures can also exacerbate other challenges veterans may face  pursuing their education. As we have previously reported, many student  veterans already cope with challenges transitioning from the military to an  academic environment. For example, they can face challenges  navigating the academic bureaucracy, whether in attempting to receive  transfer credit for previous college courses or in determining what other  sources of financial aid may be available to them. Many student veterans  are also trying to balance school with family and work obligations or  dealing with the effects of combat-related physical and psychological  injuries. When a school closes, the burden of finding and enrolling in a  new school may be especially difficult for these veterans.", "Closures can also pose a financial risk for the government and taxpayers  to the extent that Post-9/11 GI benefits are restored and federal student  loans are discharged. For example, in 2017 the Congressional Budget  Office estimated that restoring Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and other VA  education benefits to student veterans who attend schools that closed will  increase direct spending by $320 million over the 10 year period from  2018 to 2027. School closures can also result in hundreds of millions of  dollars in financial losses for the federal government and taxpayers due to  discharged federal student loans.", "In conclusion, the Post-9/11 GI Bill has provided valuable education  benefits to millions of veterans who attend a wide range of schools.  However, when schools abruptly shut their doors, it can leave student  veterans\u2014who already face unique challenges in an academic  environment\u2014without a clear path to continuing their education and can  force taxpayers to cover the cost of restoring their benefits and  discharged student loans. Student veterans who continue their education  at another school may also find that many of the credits they earned will  not ultimately help them after they transfer, delaying their degrees and  resulting in additional costs. As the number of school closures has  increased in recent years, the risks and challenges associated with such  closures are particularly salient for student veterans, their families, and  the federal government.", "Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Bilirakis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
