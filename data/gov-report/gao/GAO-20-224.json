JWST is intended to operate in an orbit approximately  1.5 million kilometers\u2014or 1 million miles\u2014from Earth. With a 6.5-meter  (21.3 foot) diameter mirror, JWST is expected to operate at about 100  times the sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope. Its science  instruments are designed to observe faint infrared sources and therefore  are required to operate at extremely cold temperatures. To help keep  these instruments cold, the JWST project will rely on a multi-layered,  tennis court-sized sunshield to protect the mirrors and instruments from  the sun\u2019s heat.", "The JWST project is divided into three major segments: observatory,  ground, and launch. When complete, the observatory segment will  include several elements (Optical Telescope Element, Integrated Science  Instrument Module, and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield  and cryocooler). Additionally, JWST is dependent on software to deploy  and control various components of the telescope, and to collect and  transmit data back to Earth. The elements, major subsystems, and  software are being developed through a mixture of NASA, contractor, and  international partner efforts. See figure 1 for the elements and major  subsystems of JWST and appendix I for more details, including a  description of the elements, major subsystems, and instruments.", "JWST depends on more deployment events\u2014steps after launch that  configure the observatory for its mission and place it in orbit\u2014than a  typical science mission. Due to the observatory\u2019s large size, it is nearly  impossible to perform deployment tests of the fully assembled  observatory in a thermal vacuum chamber to simulate the space  environment, so the verification of deployment elements is accomplished  by a combination of lower level component tests in flight-simulated  environments; ambient deployment tests for subsystem, element, and  observatory levels; and detailed analysis and simulations at various levels  of assembly.

Leading up  to observatory integration, the project completed thermal vacuum testing  of the spacecraft element in May 2019. This testing helped to ensure that  JWST hardware will function properly in the vacuum of space and  withstand significant temperature variations during deployment and  operation, and provided data to corroborate modelling on which the  observatory\u2019s mission is based.

Multiple technical issues have  contributed to the use of schedule reserve since the June 2018 replan,  but two identified in March and April 2019 have had the most significant  effect. The program identified two significant anomalies during pre-testing  events for the spacecraft element\u2019s thermal vacuum testing, which first  delayed thermal vacuum testing and then required additional time for  investigation and implementation of solutions. Specifically, a traveling  wave tube amplifier and a command and telemetry processor had errant  powering issues during testing. These are important components of the  observatory\u2019s communication systems that enable JWST to send large  amounts of science data and telemetry to the ground segment at high  speed.", "Though the anomalies occurred at the same time and were both power- related, NASA does not believe they are related and has initiated  separate review boards to determine solutions. The amplifier failure is  attributed to workmanship issues on the part of a subcontractor. As of  October 2019, the exact cause of the processor anomaly remained under  investigation, but the electrical problem had been isolated to faults within  specific circuit cards. NASA has taken steps to address the risks  presented by both anomalies: it has received replacement amplifiers and  has upgraded and tested an engineering model processor to replace the  faulty one aboard the observatory if necessary.", "As a result of technical issues discovered since the June 2018 replan, the  JWST program has had to use significantly more schedule reserve than it  planned to and has been working towards the replan\u2019s formally committed  launch date of March 2021. As of October 2019, the project had used 224  days of schedule reserve, or about 76 percent of the total project and  program-held schedule reserve incorporated into the June 2018 replan.  All project-held schedule margin was used by March 2019, a point at  which the project would have retained approximately 4 months of reserve  according to its original plan. At one point since our March 2019 report,  the project had as little as 18 percent of its total schedule reserve left, but  contractor-led corrective action plans regained time through found  efficiencies. As a result of these challenges, the project\u2019s reserve fell  below what is indicated by Goddard policy. NASA determined in May  2019 that the November 2020 launch date that the project had hoped to  achieve was no longer feasible, and switched focus to meeting the  committed launch date of March 2021. Figure 2 shows the level of  planned reserve for JWST, reserve indicated by Goddard policy, and the  project\u2019s actual use of schedule reserve.", "Since then, however, the JWST project has determined that the March  2021 launch readiness date may not be feasible either, based on a  detailed assessment of risks, costs, and schedule. In October 2019, the  project completed a joint cost and schedule confidence level analysis in  response to a GAO recommendation made in a previous report on the  JWST program. Because of schedule delays resulting from technical  challenges coupled with remaining risks faced by the project, the analysis  assessed only a 12 percent confidence level for the project\u2019s ability to  meet the March 2021 launch readiness date. NASA typically establishes  its cost and schedule baseline commitments at 70 percent confidence  level. According to the analysis, this 70 percent baseline confidence level  is associated with a July 2021 launch date. The project does not currently  intend to change the launch readiness date in response to this analysis  alone, but plans to assess the feasibility of the launch readiness date  again in spring 2020 after significant technical tasks are completed.", "NASA and Northrop Grumman have a plan to recover schedule reserve  but certain portions of the plan remain under technical review. Following  the amplifier and processor anomalies, Northrop Grumman developed a  corrective action plan to recover schedule reserve, and the contractor and  NASA continue to look for ways to gain efficiencies. In June 2019,  Northrop Grumman suggested a number of potential schedule  optimization steps that were reviewed by NASA management. Northrop  Grumman has begun to be implement some of these steps. If all steps  are taken, the contractor estimates 65 days of project schedule will be  recovered, nearly doubling the amount of reserve available to the project  when the anomalies were discovered. Among the efforts described in this  corrective action plan are to streamline aspects of vibration testing and to  modify build and repair schedules so that a major panel on the spacecraft  will only have to be opened once. Combined, these two steps would save  an estimated 46 days. However, officials noted that for the plan for a  single panel opening to remain viable, corrective actions for the amplifier  and processor replacements would need to remain on schedule. The  project continues to review some of Northrop Grumman\u2019s proposed  efficiencies, but more than half of these schedule savings have already  been incorporated into the schedule reserve forecast.", "The project also continues to identify and monitor risks that could  potentially result in further use of schedule margin.

This  flap will act as balance against solar pressure that could cause  unwanted movement of the observatory while in orbit. Observatory- level vibration testing cannot begin until the flap is removed, repaired,  and replaced aboard the spacecraft.", "In September 2019, the project found that a non-explosive actuator on  one of its membrane retention devices did not fire as planned. These  devices, which help to unfurl the sunshield of the spacecraft, are  supposed to be electrically redundant, but only one of the two  mechanisms used to fire the actuator worked during the test. The  program reports that there are approximately 180 actuators on the  JWST and the failure of any one of these actuators could result in the  total loss of JWST science mission objectives. If the redundancy for  the actuators is reduced, it would have a major impact on system  reliability.", "The project is evaluating whether it needs to replace certain  membrane retention devices that may not be able to withstand the  coupled pressure placed upon them by the launch and newly  designed fairing ventilation. Testing in the past did not account for all  aspects of the pressures placed upon this hardware during launch  and spaceflight. The project indicated that it is completing an analysis  to determine if stronger devices need to be installed.", "The JWST project office reviews and reports on these and other risks  monthly. As of October 2019, the project is tracking 50 risks\u2014three more  than when we last reported on JWST\u2014of which 12 continue to be  assessed as moderate concerns. Of the 50, 23 have been assessed to be  at acceptable levels of risk but continue to be monitored should changes  affect their status. For example, the risk associated with cabling within  the sunshield was elevated in October 2019 when the project found that  further testing was needed to ensure slack did not present an  unacceptable threat to the spacecraft during deployment. Finally, nine of  the 50 risks currently tracked by the project are related to the more than  300 single points of failure aboard the observatory.", "The project must conduct significant integration and testing activities in  the coming months that could present further challenges. Our previous  work on major NASA acquisition programs found that integration and  testing is the phase when challenges are most likely to be found and  schedules can slip. The science elements and the spacecraft have only  recently been integrated. NASA will have to manage seven top-level  integration and testing steps between October 2019 and December 2020  to include observatory-level vibration testing, sunshield deployment and  stow, and electrical testing and repairs. Currently, this will all have to be  completed with a diminished amount of schedule reserve.

According to officials, funding is sufficient to continue work even if the  launch date slips 3-4 months past the March 2021 launch date.  However, the technical issues identified during integration and testing  activities have required the contractor workforce to remain engaged,  instead of drawing down as planned. Rather than see a temporary drop in  contractor work hours as hardware deliveries were completed ahead of  observatory-level testing and integration activities, the project has  maintained contractor workforce levels to address the issues described  above.

The IRB\u2019s monitoring of the JWST project ended with the  February 2019 follow up (see figure 5).", "Though NASA agreed with the intent of all the IRB recommendations, it  took a different approach than described in the IRB report when  implementing the three recommendations where the agency\u2019s response  was assessed to be inadequate. NASA conducted additional work for the  majority of recommendations assessed by the IRB to be incomplete.  However, NASA determined that a few of the IRB recommendations  managed at the headquarters level should not be implemented the way  they were delineated in the IRB report. Specifically,", "The IRB found that the JWST reporting structure was complex,  confusing, and ineffective. The IRB made two recommendations for  NASA to update its reporting chain. The IRB believed the Science  Mission Directorate Associate Administrator should have responsibility  of the entire JWST program and the Goddard Space Flight Center  Director should be responsible for all aspects of the JWST project.  The IRB asserted that restricting the involvement of the Goddard  director will reduce the probability of JWST success. NASA agreed  that it is important to have clear organizational roles and  responsibilities but had a difference of opinion about the best course  of action. In November 2018 and July 2019, NASA announced  updates to the JWST reporting structure. However, both times it  reduced the role of the Goddard director in favor of more direct line of  accountability from the JWST program to the Science Mission  Directorate Associate Administrator and the NASA Associate  Administrator. NASA asserts that these changes will provide more  clear accountability for program performance and allow for expedited  decision making.", "The IRB recommended that NASA\u2019s Launch Services Program should  have accountability for the JWST launch. NASA has taken actions to  increase the involvement of the Launch Services Program but NASA  maintains that it is not prudent or possible for the Launch Services  Program to be accountable for the launch because the European  Space Agency is contributing the launch vehicle and managing the  launch. The IRB recognized the unique circumstances of using an  international launch vehicle but continued to assert the importance of  Launch Services Program accountability.

Most of these changes emphasize greater involvement  of NASA specialists in meetings and reviews. NASA officials reported that  its increased presence with the contractor has had positive effects for  both ensuring project outcomes and increasing morale of the government  and contractor workforce. For example, NASA integration and testing  leadership is present and embedded in Northrop Grumman\u2019s meetings\u2014 directly participating in planning sessions, reporting, and reviews of  failures and anomalies. As a result, the project was able to plan for early  integration of the observatory and completed key integration activities  without being the primary driver of the project\u2019s schedule. According to  officials, expanded participation has helped to ensure more realistic  exercises that include procedural concerns as well as engineering  considerations. NASA officials said that the increased participation has  allowed NASA input to be incorporated early\u2014potentially reducing issues  in the future.

Award fee  documentation over the course of the Northrop Grumman contract  indicates that contractor performance was assessed as below its average  before periods of significant cost and schedule growth. On average,  Northrop Grumman has been rated as very good with about three-fourths  of evaluations assessing its performance as either excellent or very good.  For the award fee evaluations that fall below Northrop Grumman\u2019s  average score, cost performance has contributed to the majority of these  dips and schedule performance has contributed to almost half. In  particular, schedule performance has reduced the contractor\u2019s overall  evaluation for all award fee periods since April 2017. The latest dip below  the contractor\u2019s average preceded lifecycle cost growth of $828 million  and schedule growth of nearly 2.5 years (see figure 6).", "Since our March 2019 report, Northrop Grumman\u2019s ratings have improved  but remain below its average. For the award fee period from October  2017 through March 2018, Northrop Grumman received an unsatisfactory  rating, which resulted in the contractor receiving no award fee for the first  and only time in the life of the contract. The unacceptable rating was  driven by cost and schedule performance\u2014including the anticipation of  breaching the $8 billion congressional cost cap established in response to  the 2011 rebaseline. In the following two periods, Northrop Grumman has  improved its evaluation, but schedule performance remains a concern.  During the last award fee period assessed, NASA was internally  managing to a November 2020 launch date.
