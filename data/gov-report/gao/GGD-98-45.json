For example, the 1991 change doubled from $2 million to $4 million the assets NASD required of companies applying for listing. The 1997 change tightened this asset requirement from total assets of $4 million to net tangible assets of $4 million. Net tangible assets are total assets minus total liabilities and goodwill. The 1997 rule change retained the $1 minimum bid price for common and preferred stock for continued listing. However, the 1997 rule change removes an alternative available under the 1991 rule allowing a company to maintain its listing when its bid price falls below $1, as long as its capital and surplus exceed $2 million and the market value of its public float exceeds $1 million. NASD\u2019s rationale for this requirement was that it provided a safeguard against certain market activity associated with low-priced securities. Nasdaq officials said the new quantitative listing and maintenance requirements would further protect investors and enhance the quality and credibility of the Nasdaq Smallcap Market.", "In addition to the quantitative requirements, NASD\u2019s 1997 rule change also included a peer review requirement for independent auditors of Nasdaq SmallCap listed companies. To meet this requirement, these companies must be audited by an independent auditor that has received or is enrolled in a peer review program that meets acceptable guidelines and is subject to oversight by an independent body. To qualify, such a peer review program must provide that an accounting firm\u2019s quality control system is to be externally peer reviewed every 3 years.

However, in 1986, Nasdaq\u2019s written response to SEC\u2019s inspection report disagreed with SEC\u2019s findings. Nasdaq cited alternative means to address one recommendation it declined to implement and stated that its practices regarding issuers making delinquent filings met the intent of SEC\u2019s second recommendation. Because SEC had not followed up on its 1986 recommendations until 1997, this disagreement continued for 11 years, and Nasdaq believed it had addressed the issues SEC raised. Disagreements like this could be avoided if recommendations were followed up systematically and not dependent solely on subsequent inspections.", "OCIE officials told us that the reason the Nasdaq Listing Department had not been inspected since 1986 was because SEC must inspect a wide range of exchange programs with limited resources, and SEC had no inspection cycle for listing departments until 1996. OCIE officials told us that they began to reevaluate the cycles and coverage of SEC\u2019s inspection program when OCIE was created in 1995. They said they made a number of changes to the program, including establishing inspection cycles for listing departments. As additional resources became available, OCIE shortened its inspection cycles. In November 1996, the OCIE Director placed regional SRO listing departments on a regular 3-year cycle of inspections; and the American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and the New York Stock Exchange were to be inspected, at least in part, on a 2-year cycle. OCIE inspected equity listing programs at all the exchanges in 1997. An SEC document states that the length of time since the last visit and known problems are criteria to be considered when OCIE sets its inspection goals.", "OCIE officials also told us they have instituted a number of procedures in addition to subsequent inspections to ensure that SEC\u2019s recommendations are addressed. First, the recommendations are to be included in a report sent to the SRO, and the SRO is requested to respond in writing to the recommendations within 60 days, outlining remedial actions it intends to take. SEC is to ask the SRO to provide a specific timetable for the actions, and the SRO must send SEC written confirmation at the completion of each action. Second, in cases where the findings and recommendations are more significant, the SRO may be required to report the findings and intended remedial actions to its board of directors. Senior officials of the SRO may be required to meet with OCIE to discuss the report; and in the most egregious cases, OCIE may refer the matter to SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division. Third, OCIE is to analyze the written SRO responses to ensure that (1) each recommendation has been adequately addressed, (2) the results have been reported to senior management, and (3) any outstanding issues are being monitored. When OCIE makes a large number of recommendations, it is to prepare spreadsheets to monitor the progress of remedial actions. Fourth, OCIE may conduct a follow-up inspection that focuses on the remedial actions taken to ensure that the SRO has properly implemented OCIE\u2019s recommendations. OCIE staff also are to review the remedial actions in its next cyclical inspection of the program. OCIE officials told us that these procedures are intended to ensure that problems found during an inspection do not persist and that immediate remedial action is properly implemented.", "These new OCIE procedures should significantly improve recommendation follow-up. However, these procedures do not involve Commissioners, the agency\u2019s highest authorities. Involving the Commissioners in following up on recommendations would provide them information on the status of corrective actions deemed significant by SEC staff and would provide an additional incentive for SROs to comply. One way to accomplish this would be for SEC staff to periodically report all open, significant recommendations to the Commission. Involving the Commission would be analogous to OCIE\u2019s policy of involving an SRO\u2019s board of directors when OCIE deems its findings significant enough to merit board involvement.

Nasdaq agrees that a going concern opinion is a factor that the Listing Department should always consider. However, it believes that other factors, such as the proceeds from the sale of stock, may counterbalance the opinion. In late 1996, Nasdaq added going concern audit opinions as a separate data element in its database of information about Nasdaq-listed companies.

The NASDR Web site (NASDR.com) also provides investors with a basic primer on how securities regulation works and how investors can avoid problems before they occur. The site also provides information on steps investors can take if they run into difficulty. In August 1996, NASD established the Office of Individual Investor Services to enhance investor education and outreach efforts and to establish a strong advocate for the individual investor within NASD. This office offers training on investment basics, provides guidance on working with a broker, publishes an investor newsletter, makes presentations, and provides information at investor forums.", "To separate the compliance responsibilities of the Listing Department from its marketing responsibilities to obtain new listings, Nasdaq restructured its reporting lines so that the head of the Listing Department no longer reports to a Senior Vice President with direct marketing responsibilities. The Listing Department now reports to the Executive Vice President for Issuer, Investor, and International Services.

Nasdaq staff use the information in the database to gauge the day-to-day operations of the hearings process.

For example, the Department produces no routine reports for senior management that present overall program statistics. By not routinely aggregating and analyzing overall program statistics over time, Nasdaq cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of its exceptions granting policies. Key indicators of effectiveness, such as the outcomes of companies granted exceptions, compared to those not granted exceptions as well as compared to program goals, can help to demonstrate the effectiveness of Nasdaq\u2019s exceptions granting policies.", "For example, Nasdaq officials provided statistics that showed they received 1,147 listing applications for the SmallCap Market between May 1994 and June 1997. Of that number 66 companies, or 5.8 percent, were listed with exceptions to listing requirements. During the same period, Nasdaq granted exceptions to maintenance requirements to 168 companies. On an annualized basis, the average number of companies granted an exception was 53, or 3.8 percent of the average number of companies (1,381) listed on the SmallCap market at any given time. These numbers have little meaning without some context. Collecting and analyzing the data over time, especially the outcomes for these companies (whether they remain on the SmallCap Market or list on another market), could provide Nasdaq a key indicator of the effectiveness of its exceptions granting process.", "Nasdaq officials also provided statistics for us that showed 562 companies dropped off the SmallCap Market from May 1, 1994, to May 30, 1997. Of that number, 409 were delisted as noncompliant, and 153 delisted voluntarily. On an annualized basis, the 562 companies that were no longer listed represent a turnover rate of about 182 companies, or 13.2 percent of the average number of companies (1,381) listed at any given time. Collected and analyzed over time, data on this turnover rate of companies listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, including information on what happened to those companies, would provide Nasdaq, SEC, and investors a key indicator of the effectiveness of its listing and maintenance standards. Such data, when compared to program goals, can help demonstrate Listing Department results; identify performance gaps; and align activities, core processes, and resources.

Before 1995, frequent and regular inspections were SEC\u2019s primary method of following up to ensure its recommendations were implemented. Our work at Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Department showed that infrequent inspections and the lack of an effective recommendation follow-up system allowed deficiencies that SEC identified to remain uncorrected for long periods. OCIE\u2019s action in 1996 to establish regular inspection cycles for SRO listing departments, if properly implemented, should help ensure that deficiencies in these departments do not remain uncorrected for long periods. More importantly, OCIE\u2019s new procedures provide a systematic process to follow up on the recommendations it makes in all of its SRO inspections. Including SEC Commissioners, who have the authority to require SROs to comply with OCIE\u2019s recommendations, in the process would provide an additional incentive for SROs to comply with OCIE recommendations.", "We share SEC\u2019s concern that the deficiencies identified in Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Department operations could have had the effect of misleading investors who are entitled to assume that the stocks listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Stock Market meet the listing and maintenance requirements of that marketplace. The Listing Department has made changes in its operations that, if implemented correctly, should improve the SmallCap Market and enhance investor protection. Not all of these changes have been completely implemented, and others have not been in effect long enough to adequately assess their effectiveness.", "Our work also showed that Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Department does not routinely use overall program statistics to evaluate and guide its activities.
