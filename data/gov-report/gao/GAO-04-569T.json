GAO was asked to testify on its completed work on the nature, status, and management of the USVISIT program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The US-VISIT program is inherently risky, both because of the type of program it is and because of the way it is being managed. First, US-VISIT is inherently risky because it is to perform a critical, multifaceted mission, its scope is large and complex, it must meet a demanding implementation schedule, and its potential cost is enormous. That is, one critical aspect of the program's mission is to prevent the entry of persons who pose a threat to the United States; failing in this mission could have serious consequences. To carry out this mission, the program aims to control the pre-entry, entry, status, and exit of millions of travelers--a large and complex process. In addition, through legislative mandate, it has challenging milestones (such as the system being implemented at all U.S. ports of entry by December 31, 2005). Finally, DHS estimated that the program would cost $7.2 billion through fiscal year 2014, but this estimate did not include all costs and underestimated some others. All these factors add risk. Second, several factors related to the program's management increase the risk of not delivering mission valued commensurate with costs or not delivering defined program capabilities on time and within budget. For example, the program is to rely initially on integrating existing systems with reported problems that could limit US-VISIT performance. In addition, the requirements for interim facilities at high-volume land ports of entry are not only demanding, they are based on assumptions that, if altered, could significantly affect facility plans. Further, DHS did not define the benefits versus costs of near-term program increments (that is, the interim versions of the program that are being pursued while the final version is being defined). Addressing these issues is the responsibility of the program office, which however was not adequately staffed, had not clearly defined roles and responsibilities for its staff, and had not established key processes for managing the acquisition and deployment of US-VISIT. Despite the program management challenges confronting US-VISIT, the first increment was deployed at the beginning of this year. However, the program still faces a number of risks, including the ones described above. To address these, GAO has made a series of recommendations regarding the planned scope of US-VISIT and its management. Addressing the identified risks increases the likelihood that the deployment of US-VISIT will be successful--the predictable outcome of sound management of a welljustified and designed program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on US-VISIT (the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status  Indicator Technology), a large, complex program that is intended to  achieve a daunting set of goals: it is to enhance homeland security and the  integrity of the U.S. immigration system, and at the same time it is to  facilitate legitimate border crossing and protect privacy.

When the Department of State issues the travel documentation,  biographic (and in some cases biometric) data are collected and made  available to border management agencies. The biometric data are  transmitted from State to DHS, where the prints are run against the US- VISIT IDENT biometric database to verify identity and to check the  biometric watchlist. The results of the biometric check are transmitted  back to State.", "Commercial air and sea carriers are required by law to transmit crew and  passenger manifests to appropriate immigration officers before arriving in  the United States. These manifests are transmitted through APIS. The  APIS lists are run against the biographic lookout system and identify those  arrivals who have biometric data available. In addition, POEs review the  APIS list in order to identify foreign nationals who need to be scrutinized  more closely.", "Entry process. When a foreign national arrives at a POE\u2019s primary  inspection booth, biographic information, such as name and date of birth,  is displayed on the bottom half of a computer workstation screen, along  with a photograph obtained from State\u2019s CCD. The inspector at the booth  scans the foreign national\u2019s fingerprints (left and right index fingers) and  takes a digital photograph. This information is forwarded to the IDENT  database, where it is checked against stored fingerprints in the IDENT  lookout database. If the foreign national\u2019s fingerprints are already in  IDENT, the system performs a match (a comparison of the fingerprint  taken during the primary inspection to the one on file) to confirm that the  person submitting the fingerprints is the person on file.

Specifically, in November 2002, we  reported that a rough order of magnitude estimate of the cost to  implement visas with biometrics would be between $1.3 billion and $2.9  billion initially and between $0.7 and $1.5 billion annually thereafter. This  estimate is based on certain assumptions, including that all current visa- issuing embassies and consulates will be equipped to collect biometrics  from visa applicants. Assuming that biometrics are implemented by  December 2004, this means that the recurring cost of having biometric  visas through DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2014 life cycle period would be between $7  and $15 billion.
