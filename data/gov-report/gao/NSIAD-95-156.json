It further increased assistance to the former Soviet Union and established a multiagency approach for providing assistance.

In January 1994, the State Department Coordinator approved the first overall U.S. assistance strategy for the former Soviet Union, and in May 1994, the Coordinator approved the strategy specifically for Russia. This strategy has three core objectives: (1) help the transition to a market economy, (2) support the transition to a democratic political system, and (3) ease the human cost associated with the transition.

Russian nationals served as codirectors, and PIER staff received free apartments and office space.", "To accomplish the housing sector reform project, the Urban Institute worked closely with officials in the Ministries of Finance and Economy and the State Committee on Architecture and Construction at the federal level, the Moscow city government, various maintenance firms, banks, and grass-roots condominium associations. Although office space in Moscow is expensive and scarce, the Institute received free office space. In addition, Russian nationals played a key role on the Institute\u2019s staff.", "In contrast, many less successful projects lacked the buy-in of Russians at either the local or federal level and had little Russian involvement or contribution. For example, the State Committee of the Russian Federation for the Management of State Property (GKI), Russia\u2019s federal agency overseeing the privatization effort, was instrumental in designing the voucher clearing and commercial real estate projects. However, in some cities, local officials were not involved in designing the projects and had little interest in them; as a result, these projects were not fully successful.", "The officer resettlement project established housing in several cities, but not in Novosibirsk, where city officials reneged on a previous administration\u2019s commitment to provide needed infrastructure support. Because officials at the federal and oblast\u2019 levels were not involved in the initial agreements, they had no authority to require the new city administration to fulfill the contract, nor were they willing to provide additional funding for the project.", "The district heating project was not completed in Yekaterinburg because local officials did not allow monitoring equipment to be installed.

In addition, successful projects involved contractors that had appropriate experience to carry out the project. For example, the Urban Institute has had two long-term advisers living in Moscow since 1992 who maintained close contact with Russians involved in housing reforms. PIER\u2019s project director had lived in Moscow for 3 years. Other members of its American staff had lived in Kemerovo and Vorkuta, the key cities of the major coal mining oblasts, since 1993 and 1994, respectively. The two field staff have years of experience as coal mine engineers.

For example, neither IBTCI nor RCG/Haggler Bailly had permanently assigned American staff in the cities being assisted. IBTCI\u2019s consultants would fly in, make rapid diagnoses, deal with problems quickly, and then leave.

For example, the project design required RCG/Haggler Bailly to provide energy efficiency equipment and audits but did not include methods to replicate the project in other cities, or extend monitoring efforts to determine how the equipment or studies were used. The USAID Inspector General reported that other projects did not include any follow-up steps to ensure that the assistance provided was used. In addition, projects focusing on health care training and commercial real estate leasing did not consider local needs and conditions and thus had limited impact.", "Several projects did not adequately identify outcomes or measurable results. For example, the Tri Valley Growers\u2019 contract with USAID did not stipulate how many agribusiness partnerships were to be established. The design of the coal project also did not adequately identify outcomes or measurable results, but PIER developed an effective project nonetheless. The USAID Inspector General found similar problems when reviewing many projects in the region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Russian Involvement and Commitment", "paragraphs": ["It is widely acknowledged that the Russian people themselves will determine the ultimate success or failure of political and economic reforms. Without their involvement and commitment to change, outside assistance will have a limited effect. For example, the support and involvement of Russian federal agencies, such as GKI in the privatization effort and the ministries related to housing, ensure that projects in those sectors are likely to have a wide and sustained effect. The coal project\u2019s impact depends on Russia\u2019s commitment to restructure the coal industry.", "In several sectors, a Russian commitment to reform remains elusive. Powerful factions in the Russian legislative branch strongly oppose land reform, and the Ministry of Health has not demonstrated a commitment to health care reform. This lack of commitment raises concerns that projects in the agriculture and health sectors will not have widespread benefits. USAID is now working with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, but the level of support from other important federal ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, is still questionable.", "Other domestic conditions will also influence a project\u2019s success. Russia\u2019s commitment to breaking up monopolies and its ability to attract capital for modernizing outdated equipment, restructuring existing state enterprises, and starting new businesses will affect the pace and scope of Russia\u2019s transformation to a market economy. Moreover, projects such as introducing mortgage lending will depend on macroeconomic policy and land reforms. Russia is counting on foreign capital to help move the transition process forward, but such factors as the unstable economic situation, a poor and uncertain tax structure, an undeveloped financial market infrastructure, and an increased crime rate make foreign investors hesitant to invest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USAID Management Performance", "paragraphs": ["USAID responded quickly to assist Russia in undertaking its political and economic reforms, as called for in the Freedom Support Act.

We found that USAID officials were unaware of positive and negative aspects of the projects implemented by IBTCI, RCG/Haggler Bailly, and PIER. USAID officials had not visited some projects, and USAID did not have representatives located outside Moscow. USAID expected its Russian staff to conduct field monitoring, but the Russian nationals lacked the necessary training. USAID officials said they considered but rejected the idea of establishing field offices outside Moscow.", "Without adequate staff, USAID relied mainly on contractors\u2019 written and oral reports to monitor the projects, but some contractors did not report all problems. The USAID Inspector General also found shortcomings in the reporting process: contractors were not required to report on their progress toward specific objectives or indicators. Moreover, USAID did not enforce some of its reporting requirements. For example, Deloitte & Touche did not provide the required lists of equipment purchased with USAID funds and brought into the country, and USAID did not enforce the requirement.", "Although the State Department allowed USAID/Moscow to increase U.S. direct-hire personnel and personal services contractors from 27 in fiscal year 1993 to 66 in fiscal year 1995, USAID officials said even more staff were needed to adequately monitor the program. However, State would not allow the USAID mission to grow further because, among other reasons, the USAID assistance program is scheduled to end by the end of the decade.", "In some cases, USAID had not determined the relative success or failure of projects so that it could apply lessons learned to other efforts. It did not conduct the required periodic assessments/evaluations of the coal and agribusiness projects. The omnibus contracts do not require an evaluation of the individual tasks, but instead evaluations are to be done at the end of the contracts, according to USAID officials. The omnibus contracts for USAID\u2019s private sector initiatives alone have obligated approximately $200 million and are not scheduled to terminate until 1996, too late to apply lessons learned. In addition, an evaluation that was conducted was not accurate. A contractor evaluated the district heating project in June 1993 and gave it high marks. Our 1995 review of the project found major shortcomings, such as equipment still in boxes after being delivered in 1993, even though the evaluation report said the equipment had been installed and was being used.

First, as USAID\u2019s Moscow office assumed more management responsibility, contractors had to begin dealing with another layer of management review. This caused delays and confusion among some contractors. Second, there were tensions between the Washington and Moscow offices because of differences regarding program implementation. For example, the offices disagreed about which reformers and Russian government agencies to work with. Third, the USAID/Moscow office lacked some essential documents to enable officials to carry out their duties. We found that key contract and financial documents were not available in Moscow, a problem also reported by the USAID Inspector General.", "The State Department Coordinator opposed giving greater authority to USAID/Moscow because he believed USAID/Washington needed to maintain a more prominent role. He said that because assistance to Russia is an important foreign policy issue, key decisions should not be delegated to the field.

USAID\u2019s management information system did not list contractors by region, and USAID sometimes did not tell new contractors about other contractors\u2019 activities. In some cities, contractors contacted each other on their own and started coordinating their efforts. However, this was being done on an ad hoc basis. In Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg, U.S. Consuls General facilitated contractor coordination. The USAID Inspector General found that many projects with similar goals were not linked to one another.

USAID pointed to a new computerized monitoring system that is expected to produce its first report in November 1995.", "USAID agreed with our recommendation regarding the focus of its assistance projects and said it was taking steps to implement it. In addition, USAID said it was taking corrective action to address the management problems we identified. However, it stressed that its assistance has had a positive impact and occurred in a difficult operating environment. USAID indicated that it had made progress in setting up its own monitoring, reporting, and evaluation system. It should be pointed out, however, that in November 1994, the USAID Inspector General reported that the system was still far from able to measure program results.", "USAID said that our report would have provided a more balanced and accurate view of the systemic impact and sustainability of a project\u2019s activities if we had considered the activity in the context of the whole program. USAID stated that, in nearly every case, the individual projects we focused on were part of a larger project or program that would have substantial impact on reforming Russia\u2019s economy. USAID is correct that the projects we examined were usually one component of a larger sector program; however, USAID is incorrect in its assertion that we evaluated projects in isolation and without considering the context of the whole program. The overriding objective of USAID\u2019s program in Russia is to contribute to reforming both the political and economic systems. This is also the objective of the assistance program for each sector and, with few exceptions, of each project that supports a sector program. Our examination focused on the individual building blocks that support sector programs and ultimately support the reform effort in Russia. In some cases, we found that the individual building blocks will not contribute to systemic reform in the sector or in Russia overall. Even though this does not mean that an entire program, of which a less-than-successful project is a part, will fail in its systemic reform objective, it does mean that an unsuccessful project is not contributing to a program\u2019s success.", "We also disagree with USAID\u2019s assertion that significant systemic reform has resulted from USAID activities in all sectors. For example, the agribusiness partnerships project, including components reviewed by the USAID Inspector General, comprises most of the USAID funding going to the sector but is not expected to contribute significantly to systemic reforms. Only a limited degree of systemic reform has occurred in other sectors as well, including the health care and the environmental sectors.

As of December 1994, it had arranged training for 46 beneficiaries who attended business courses in Pskov, Novgorod, and Volgograd. The USAID official said construction delays and the subsequent delays in officers relocating to their respective cities affected start-up activities. Further, the official said the Commission did not adequately identify the officers\u2019 training needs and failed to recognize that many of them were not interested in training.", "Project officials said only minimal progress was made in addressing other secondary goals, such as demonstrating new housing technologies, expanding customer choices, and implementing more stringent quality control standards. For example, in Tula, contractors constructed 14-, 16-, and 30-unit duplexes, which took as long or longer to build than traditional high rise structures. (See fig. III.2.) PADCO field representatives worked with local builders to ensure that quality control measures were introduced and achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["The officer resettlement pilot project accomplished its objective of providing housing to demobilized officers.

The primary changes included (1) obtaining total support, involvement, and buy-in from all three levels of Russian government; (2) using the voucher certificate program to expedite the relocation of 2,500 officers; (3) stipulating that a maximum of 10 percent of the demobilized officers could come from local jurisdictions; (4) using a U.S. construction management firm as the prime construction contractor and subcontract to the individual builders; (5) using only experienced, well-connected Russian builders; (6) selecting partially completed buildings and sites with existing infrastructure; (7) using a traditional Russian housing design; and (8) providing a more realistic per unit cost ($25,000 versus $8,500).

We have incorporated these comments into the report where appropriate. 2. Although we noted project shortcomings, we also recognized the contribution Deloitte & Touche made toward the privatization process and considered the project a success. Moreover, we recognized USAID\u2019s positive contribution to the overall privatization effort. 3. We conducted a detailed review of Tri Valley Growers\u2019 performance, one of the three contractors responsible for implementing the agribusiness partnerships project, to determine whether this expenditure of funds had any sustainable impact. We concluded that it did not. Although we did not draw any conclusions about the agribusiness partnerships project as a whole, our analysis casts doubt on whether the project can have a systemic impact if the individual partnerships are not having an impact. (See comments 29 and 30 for additional discussion.) 4. It is too early to know whether USAID\u2019s prediction concerning the outcome of ongoing activities in the energy sector will result in significant sector reform. Many of these projects are just starting and must overcome many obstacles. For example, in our September 1994 report on nuclear safety, we reported that there are no guarantees that the international assistance effort will result in safer reactors or expedite the closure of the riskiest reactors. In fact, in the absence of a commitment to close down the reactors, the assistance may encourage their continued operation. We noted that donor countries face formidable challenges in promoting the closure of the Soviet-designed reactors because the countries operating them depend on the nuclear power to meet their needs for domestic energy and export income. 5. We agree that the new evaluation system is promising in that it should provide an improved basis to evaluate USAID\u2019s programs in the NIS. However, since the first report is not due until November 1995, it is too early to know whether the system will fulfill its promise. The value of the system will depend on the indicators selected, the reliability of the data, and the subjective judgments of USAID officials preparing the reports. For the system to have credibility, USAID will have to be able to identify shortcomings as well as successes. 6. We have modified the report to reflect this information. 7. We were able to reconcile obligations and expenditures in the USAID financial report with other USAID documentation. Accordingly, we have deleted the examples from the report. 8. Our draft report included information on the work of the Consuls General. We have modified our report to update the information on increased site visits. 9. Although market forces played a role in the limited use of some of the centers, the lack of local support as well as other factors also caused the low activity levels at some centers. More importantly, it is questionable whether USAID should spend funds on activities without a market unless it has a strategy to create demand for the product it is financing. 10. We visited only one site (in Siberia during February) because of the limited amount of time we had in country. Vorkuta can be reached by plane in the winter. USAID can visit the sites at other times during the year. We believe that three site visits\u2014two occurred after we began our audit\u2014in 31 months is inadequate for monitoring purposes. Day-to-day contacts with PIER staff are important; however, they do not substitute for site monitoring or provide USAID with an objective basis for evaluating the project\u2019s success. 11. The accomplishments noted in our report are those that have had the greatest impact. PIER did not provide us with any statistics that indicated increased mine safety or productivity. Moveover, a September 1994 study produced by the U.S. Department of the Interior indicates that mine safety in Russia is actually getting worse. The beneficiaries we spoke with indicated that they were implementing new mining methods introduced by PIER; however, they did not mention any measurable increases in productivity. In addition, although productivity and efficiency are important, overall production for the coal sector is still too high. Finally, PIER\u2019s Moscow director stated that this project has had the greatest impact in the areas of restructuring, private sector involvement, and social safety net development. 12. Our report does not state that an interim evaluation is imminent and may lead to activities being redirected. Our report states that \u201cUSAID management admitted that no annual assessments or midterm evaluations were conducted,\u201d even when required by the cooperative agreement. 13. USAID\u2019s new procedures did not affect the program during the time frames we reviewed. Also, the work plan example should be taken in the context that several iterations of the plan have been submitted and revised since November 1994. 14. Our draft report did not recommend that more authority be delegated. 15. Our report was modified to show that the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources was involved in the initial selection of project activities. However, the Ministry did not participate in designing the projects as USAID suggests. USAID acknowledges the almost immediate shift of its relationship from the central to the local government once the projects were selected. We remain concerned over the lack of federal involvement, especially regarding the provision of resources and the limited potential for replicability. We believe that without outside funding or support from the federal level, sustainability and replication will be difficult. 16. As indicated in the report, we found that as of February 1995, the Far East project had contributed little to systemic reform and is unsustainable without outside funding. The report discusses the project\u2019s attempt to address systemic reform through efforts to maintain and restock the forestry base. 17. As indicated in the report, the deliverables identified in the delivery orders generally cited reports and studies as the results. We are unable to verify USAID\u2019s statements regarding the project\u2019s results. 18. Although we recognize that this project was only one of many in the energy sector, we found that the project is unlikely to contribute to systemic reform because of its design and the lack of monitoring and follow-up by USAID. 19. USAID suggested that we select this project in part because USAID represented it as a success, based on an independent evaluation. We visited only Yekaterinburg for two primary reasons: USAID suggested that it was a good site to visit and it was one of only two cities where equipment was installed and extensive energy audits and training were provided. However, as we reported, the equipment had not been installed. USAID\u2019s assertion that our conclusion is based almost entirely on the site visit is wrong. Our conclusion is also based on discussions with representatives from RCG/Haggler Bailly, Joseph Technology, Honeywell, and USAID officials responsible for the project and our review of numerous documents on the entire project. 20. We did not make statements or draw conclusions about other projects in the program or about the overall program. We noted that there was no indication that the project we reviewed had contributed to systemic reform. The energy efficiency audits and demonstration sites can only have an impact on systemic reform if USAID ensures that (1) equipment is installed; (2) equipment and training is used; (3) the recommendations in the energy audits are implemented; (4) the results of the project are monitored, recorded, and publicized; (5) appropriate personnel have access to the demonstration sites; and (6) problems such as lack of equipment certification are corrected. At the time we conducted our fieldwork, USAID was not ensuring any of these elements because the project did not include any mechanisms for long-term monitoring or replicating the project. USAID, in its comments, acknowledged that the project alone is unlikely to have an impact on systemic reform. 21. We agree that the dollar value of the uninstalled equipment constitutes a relatively small percentage of all the equipment purchased. The fact that USAID was unaware of the problems in Yekaterinburg and had not monitored whether any cost savings had been achieved and did not know whether any systemic improvements had resulted from the equipment, energy audits, and training provided is the issue. 22. The consultant\u2019s evaluation indicated that all of the equipment was installed in April 1993. The documents we reviewed indicate that the equipment was provided in April and May 1993. If the equipment did not arrive until June 1993 as USAID suggests, USAID should have known the evaluation had problems when it indicated that all the equipment was installed 1 or 2 months before the equipment ever arrived. 23. We contacted individuals who were identified as participants by USAID/Moscow. 24. Our conclusion that the training was irrelevant was not based on our discussions with the participants of the PIET training courses. It was based on statements by various USAID officials, including the USAID/Moscow Mission Director and the Chief of USAID/Washington\u2019s Europe and the Newly Independent States/Health and Population Office. For example, USAID officials told us that a 2-week training course without follow-on activities could not be expected to result in any systemic reform. In addition, as we also noted in the report, because USAID had not conducted any long-term monitoring of the participants, it had no evidence that any of the participants instituted systemic changes based on the training. The opinions and views of the participants we interviewed were used to provide insight as to why no systemic changes had occurred. 25. Contrary to USAID\u2019s comments, we referred to the course evaluations in our draft report. We stated that \u201c. . . most participants were satisfied with the course and believed it was applicable to their work conditions.\u201d However, our assessment was not concerned with whether the participants were satisfied with the course but with whether the goals of the PIET contract and the Freedom Support Act were fulfilled. 26. We question USAID\u2019s assertion about the actual positive impact of the training and follow-on assistance. First, at the time of our review, follow-on assistance was not planned to begin for another 6 months and no assessment had been completed to confirm or deny USAID\u2019s assertion. Second, despite repeated USAID statements that the Siberian participants were involved in follow-on projects, USAID project officials did not know how many were actually involved. When the contractor compiled this data for us, the USAID project official in charge of the program was surprised that 75 percent of the participants in Siberia were not involved with the planned follow-on activities. Finally, USAID health officials we spoke with were unanimous in their assessment that the follow-on project\u2019s progress to date has been a disappointment. 27. Contrary to USAID\u2019s assertion, we met with the Russian Privatization Center (RPC) official responsible for the project. This official questioned the competence of some of the consultants.", "We also believe that the characterization of this project as a qualified success is an overstatement. Project task orders were never modified, thus the focus of the project remained to increase the availability of commercial real estate. However, after project completion, large amounts of commercial real estate continued to be leased in the selected cities under conditions that encouraged inefficient use, and the municipalities failed to maximize revenues.", "At our most recent meeting, on June 2, Jay Kalotra  presented a preliminary draft of the wrap-up memo for the project. At that time, I reminded Jay several times that deviations from the Perm\u2019 model would have to be rigorously defended to both USAID and the senior management of the RPC. Jay\u2019s response was that IBTCI deviated from the Perm\u2019 model in large part because the model was ill-suited to the chosen roll-out cities. To a considerable extent, this may be true. However, this obviously does not exonerate IBTCI, since their task was to find cities where a pure roll-out could be performed. [underscoring supplied] In its most recent memos, IBTCI suggests that they told us at the outset they would adopt a broader approach than BCG took in Perm\u2019. While it is true that IBTCI states some very ambitious goals, it is disingenuous to suggest that we agreed to replace the Perm\u2019 model with something else. . . .  . . . However, as noted above, even three weeks ago IBTCI was maintaining the pretense of Perm\u2019-style results. And it was only when we actually visited the project sites that we could see the extent to which deviations had occurred.", "It is not realistic to expect the agribusiness partnerships program to have a significant, measurable impact on overall food systems in the NIS. The limited number of partnerships being supported suggests such national level impacts are unlikely during the life of the activity, if ever.", "USAID/Moscow staff stated that the agribusiness partnerships project could not by itself influence systemic reform. 31. Although TVG has established three partnerships in Russia, only one (Petoseed) is functioning. According to TVG staff, CTC Foods has run into financial problems; consequently, its potato processing facility may never be constructed. Finally, the third partnership (Big Sky Foods Trading, Inc.) has only recently been approved, and it is too early to determine whether this project will be successful. 32. USAID staff in Moscow and Washington characterized the project as discontinued because no more partnerships can be introduced and no more funds will be obligated. 33. USAID/Moscow staff said TVG had not performed adequately and had not identified appropriate partnerships. The documents we reviewed also indicated that TVG was not performing well. 34. Our report includes examples of the causes for delays in the approval process, including the need to deal with legal issues. 35. We modified the report to reflect this foreign policy goal. However, the primary objective for the pilot project announced in April 1993 did not focus on relocating officers from the Baltics. The announcement made in July 1993 focused the program on the removal of officers from the Baltics. 36.
