This report addresses (1) privacy laws applicable to consumer information held by resellers, (2) gaps in the law that may exist, and (3) views on approaches for improving consumer data privacy.", "To address these objectives, GAO analyzed laws, studies, and other documents, and interviewed representatives of federal agencies, the reseller and marketing industries, consumer and privacy groups, and others. GAO focused primarily on consumer information used for marketing purposes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["No overarching federal privacy law governs the collection and sale of personal information among private-sector companies, including information resellers. Instead, a variety of laws tailored to specific purposes, situations, or entities governs the use, sharing, and protection of personal information. For example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act limits the use and distribution of personal information collected or used to help determine eligibility for such things as credit or employment, but does not apply to information used for marketing. Other laws apply specifically to health care providers, financial institutions, videotape service providers, or to the online collection of information about children.", "The current statutory framework for consumer privacy does not fully address new technologies--such as the tracking of online behavior or mobile devices--and the vastly increased marketplace for personal information, including the proliferation of information sharing among third parties. With regard to data used for marketing, no federal statute provides consumers the right to learn what information is held about them and who holds it. In many circumstances, consumers also do not have the legal right to control the collection or sharing with third parties of sensitive personal information (such as their shopping habits and health interests) for marketing purposes. As a result, although some industry participants have stated that current privacy laws are adequate--particularly in light of self-regulatory measures under way--GAO found that gaps exist in the current statutory framework for privacy. And that the framework does not fully reflect the Fair Information Practice Principles, widely accepted principles for protecting the privacy and security of personal information that have served as a basis for many of the privacy recommendations federal agencies have made.", "Views differ on the approach that any new privacy legislation or regulation should take. Some privacy advocates generally have argued that a comprehensive overarching privacy law would provide greater consistency and address gaps in law left by the current sector-specific approach. Other stakeholders have stated that a comprehensive, one-size-fits-all approach to privacy would be burdensome and inflexible. In addition, some privacy advocates have cited the need for legislation that would provide consumers with greater ability to access, control the use of, and correct information about them, particularly with respect to data used for purposes other than those for which they originally were provided. At the same time, industry representatives have asserted that restrictions on the collection and use of personal data would impose compliance costs, inhibit innovation and efficiency, and reduce consumer benefits, such as more relevant advertising and beneficial products and services. Nonetheless, the rapid increase in the amount and type of personal information that is collected and resold warrants reconsideration of how well the current privacy framework protects personal information. The challenge will be providing appropriate privacy protections without unduly inhibiting the benefits to consumers, commerce, and innovation that data sharing can accord."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider strengthening the consumer privacy framework to reflect the effects of changes in technology and the increased market for consumer information.

The information reseller industry has grown significantly in recent  years, as has the amount of consumer information that these companies  assemble and distribute.

Some resellers offer products that  help companies comply with legal requirements or identify, investigate,  and prevent fraudulent transactions (for example, by enabling  confirmation of a customer\u2019s identity). Some information resellers, such  as Spokeo and Intelius, also offer individual reference services that sell  personal identifying information about consumers to individuals or  companies.", "In addition, many information resellers, such as Acxiom and LexisNexis,  offer products that companies use for marketing purposes. Resellers may  focus on groups of likely customers who share common characteristics,  and therefore may have similar interests or preferences. For example,  resellers may offer information products that allow clients to target their  online advertisements and help ensure that promotional materials are  sent to the most relevant individuals. Resellers may offer retailers the  ability to add purchase and lifestyle information to their existing customer  databases. In addition, resellers may offer clients marketing lists with  contact information of prospective customers.", "Resellers maintain large, sophisticated databases with information from a  variety of sources about individuals and families. The consumer  information that each reseller maintains and sells varies, but can include  names, addresses, family members, neighbors, credit histories, motor  vehicle records, insurance claims, criminal records, employment histories,  incomes, ethnicities, purchase histories, interests, and hobbies. (See  appendix II for a detailed list of examples of the types of consumer  information held by information resellers.) As shown in figure 1, resellers  obtain their information from three primary types of sources: public  records, publicly available information, and nonpublic information.", "Public records, available to anyone, generally are obtained from  governmental entities. What constitutes a public record depends on  state and federal laws, but may include birth and death records,  property records, tax lien and assessor files, voter registrations,  licensing records, and court records (including criminal records,  bankruptcy filings, civil case files, and legal judgments).", "Publicly available information is not found in public records, but  nevertheless is publicly available through sources such as telephone  directories, business directories, classified advertisements,  newspapers or magazines, and other materials.", "Nonpublic information derives from proprietary sources. For example,  consumers may provide the information directly to businesses through  loyalty card programs at grocery or retail stores, website registrations,  warranty registrations, contests, surveys and questionnaires, and  purchase histories. Resellers (or a third party such as a website  operator acting on behalf of the reseller) also may collect nonpublic  information about consumers\u2019 online locations and actions, including a  computer\u2019s Internet protocol address, the browser used, activities  during a consumer\u2019s visit to a website (such as search terms or  purchases), and activities conducted on other websites.", "Consumer information can be derived from mobile networks, devices  (including smartphones and tablets), operating systems, and applications.

Characterizing the precise size and nature of the  industry can be difficult because definitions for resellers vary and data on  resellers often are limited or not comparable.

Instead, Census has assigned different  primary codes, including \u201cdata processing and preparation,\u201d \u201cdirect mail  advertising services,\u201d \u201ccredit reporting services,\u201d and \u201cinformation retrieval  services.\u201dor other statistical information on the information resellers industry as a  whole.

A U.S. government advisory committee  first proposed the practices in 1973 in response to concerns about the  consequences computerized data systems could have on the privacy of  personal information. While the FIPPs are principles as opposed to legal  requirements, they provide a framework for balancing the need for privacy  with other interests. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) developed a revised version of the FIPPs in 1980  that has been widely adopted (see table 1).", "Many organizations and governments have used these principles, with  some variation, as best practices.

The FIPPs also served as the  basis for a framework for consumer data privacy that the White House  issued in February 2012.

Accordingly, FCRA applies to the three nationwide  consumer reporting agencies (commonly called credit bureaus) and to  any other information resellers that resell consumer reports for use by  others. FCRA limits resellers\u2019 use and distribution of personal data\u2014for  example, by allowing consumers to opt out of allowing consumer  reporting agencies to share their personal information with third parties for  prescreened marketing offers. The act also allows individuals to access  and dispute the accuracy of personal data held on them.

To avoid creating duplicative regulatory burdens, the Administration  supported exempting companies from consumer data privacy legislation  to the extent that their activities were subject to existing federal data  privacy laws.

Other industry representatives have  noted that companies often clearly disclose to consumers that information  consumers provide may be used for marketing purposes.

FTC called on information resellers that  compile data for marketing purposes to explore creating a centralized  website where resellers would identify themselves and describe how they  collect and use consumer data, and the access rights and other choices  that consumers have. Some industry representatives with whom we  spoke said that such a centralized website would serve to confuse most  consumers and be costly to businesses.

As noted earlier, no federal law  that we examined gives consumers the right to correct or delete  inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information used for marketing or  look-up purposes not covered by FCRA. Some privacy advocates and  members of Congress have argued that consumers should have the  inherent right to correct inaccurate information about them that is being  held and sold. In addition, one privacy advocate noted that uses of data  not covered by FCRA can include fraud prevention and identity  verification, and that inaccuracies in these databases can cause  inconvenience or harm to a consumer. For data used for marketing,  another privacy advocate has noted that companies may base some  individual product pricing on a consumer\u2019s profile, so inaccurate data  could affect the price offered. However, both FTC and the Direct  Marketing Association have expressed the belief that special measures  are not needed to ensure the accuracy of data maintained and used for  marketing purposes because the only resulting harm to consumers might  be to receive irrelevant advertising. The Administration expressed a  similar view in its 2012 privacy framework, which noted that in providing  consumers the opportunity to correct inaccurate data, companies may  consider the scale, scope, and sensitivity of the data and whether  consumers would be exposed to any financial, physical, or other material  harm if the data were inaccurate. In addition, some resellers have stated  that because they acquire information continuously from a variety of  sources, providing consumers with an opportunity to correct erroneous  information would not be effective unless consumers also corrected the  information at the sources from which it had been drawn.", "Some of the most publicized debate related to privacy and new  technologies has been on the issue of consumers\u2019 ability to control the  tracking of their web activity.

The Digital Advertising Alliance maintains a website  (http://aboutads.info/choices) that allows consumers to opt out of  behavioral advertising by its participating companies.

Additionally, industry  representatives have noted that the Internet has become an increasingly  important part of the U.S. economy\u2014for example, retail e-commerce  sales totaled about $225 billion in 2012, according to Commerce\u2014and  data-driven marketing helped facilitate this activity. According to a study  by the Network Advertising Initiative, behaviorally targeted advertising  generated almost three times more revenue and was twice as effective at  converting browsers into buyers than nontargeted online advertising.  According to a study commissioned by the Interactive Advertising  Bureau\u2014an organization of media and technology companies engaging  in online advertising\u2014advertising-supported Internet activity that uses  consumer data has significant economic benefits, including job  creation.", "In addition, representatives of the information reseller industry have said  that the use of consumer information for data-driven marketing helps to  foster competition online and ensures that large and small businesses  can reach consumers across the Internet. According to a 2011 study by a  global consulting firm, the availability of consumer data has enabled much  of recent economic innovation and growth. For example, the study cited the emergence of real-time location data as creating an entirely new  set of location-based services, from navigation applications to people  tracking. In a 2013 congressional hearing, representatives of two industry  associations stated that stricter privacy controls would increase  compliance costs for businesses, particularly smaller businesses.", "However, privacy and consumer groups generally have argued that even  with restrictions on the use of consumer data, industries that use such  data would find a way to expand their businesses and remain profitable.  They noted that the industry\u2019s claims that increased privacy protections  would be too burdensome and stifle innovation have not been  accompanied by convincing evidence. Moreover, some privacy and  consumer groups have stated that effective privacy regulations actually  can have positive effects on the economy and innovation. They noted that  privacy-enhancing technology, such as data encryption, that safeguards  personal information online has led to greater consumer participation  online, including more e-commerce. privacy protections may encourage companies to develop innovative  services that rely less on personal information. The White House privacy  framework noted that consumers who feel protected from misuse of their  personal information likely would be more open to engaging in commerce  and various online technologies. Privacy advocates have cited the  example of encryption technology to enable secure online payments as  increasing consumers\u2019 willingness to engage in online financial  transactions. In addition, one privacy organization noted that  competition among companies to address consumers\u2019 privacy concerns  could encourage innovations.", "See letter of consumer and privacy organizations. Industry representatives also have  talked about the importance of consumer trust. For example, in A Status Update on the  Development of Voluntary Do-Not-Track Standards, April 24, 2013; see testimony of  Harvey Anderson, Senior Vice President Business and Legal Affairs, Mozilla.", "Similarly, the Federal Communications Commission stated in a 2012  report that companies that could demonstrate clear and consistent  transparency in collection and use of personal information could be  competitive and more attractive to consumers. In public comments  solicited by Commerce in 2010 on information privacy and innovation in  the Internet economy, online businesses and advertisers noted the  importance of respecting customers\u2019 privacy if they wanted to retain their  business, and information and communications technology companies  stated that privacy protections were necessary to encourage individuals  to adopt new devices and services. According to a representative of  one privacy organization, even in those cases in which privacy  regulations served to inhibit one line of marketing\u2014as with the effect on  telemarketers of regulation creating the National Do Not Call Registry\u2014 advertisers and marketers have been able to rapidly shift to other  profitable marketing avenues.", "Department of Commerce, Internet Policy Task Force, Commercial Data Privacy and  Innovation in the Internet Economy: A Dynamic Policy Framework (Washington, D.C.:  2010). to track and comply with data protection laws in each country.  Specifically, some who commented noted gaps in protection for  consumers whose data were transferred across borders, because it was  not always clear who had jurisdiction over data and what protections  existed for foreign consumers. To overcome these obstacles, they  recommended a number of options, with the majority advocating for  greater harmonization and the ability to work together across systems  (interoperability). The Administration\u2019s 2012 privacy framework echoed  these concerns and noted that creating interoperability between different  nations\u2019 privacy regimes was critical to the continued growth of the digital  economy. Underlying the approach to achieving international  interoperability, it said, were mutual recognition of commercial data  privacy frameworks, cooperation in enforcing these frameworks, and  mechanisms that allow companies to demonstrate accountability.", "As noted previously, the European Union\u2019s 1995 Data Protection  Directive provides a comprehensive privacy framework and states that  the personal information of European Union citizens may not be  transmitted to nations not deemed to have \u201cadequate\u201d data protection  laws. The United States does not have an adequacy finding from the  European Commission (the executive body of the European Union).  However, companies that participate in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor  Framework are deemed to provide adequate data protections and may  transfer personal data from the European Union. observers have warned against enacting a strict privacy regime like the  one in the European Union. For example, according to a representative of  an information reseller, moving to a strict privacy regime similar to that of  the European Union would hinder commerce and innovation and have a  strongly detrimental effect on certain industries and the overall U.S.  economy. A representative of another information reseller said that the  U.S. privacy regime has worked well and agreed that making it more like  that of the European Union would have detrimental, unintended  consequences, such as harming economic growth and innovation.", "FTC has the authority to enforce the substantive privacy requirements of the U.S.-EU  Safe Harbor Framework."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The advent of new and more advanced technologies and changes in the  marketplace for consumer information have vastly increased the amount  and nature of personal information collected and the number of parties  that use or share this information. While the views of stakeholders differ,  based on our review, we found that gaps exist in the current statutory  privacy framework. In particular, the current framework does not fully  address changes in technology and marketplace practices that  fundamentally have altered the nature and extent to which personal  information is being shared with third parties. Moreover, while current  laws protect privacy interests in specific sectors and for specific uses,  consumers have little control over how their information is collected, used,  and shared with third parties for marketing purposes. As a result, current  privacy law is not always aligned with the Fair Information Practice  Principles, which Commerce and others have said should serve as the  foundation for commercial data privacy.", "Thus, the current privacy framework warrants reconsideration in relation  to a number of issues, including consumers\u2019 ability to access, correct, and  control their personal information used for marketing; the types of  personal information collected and the sources and methods for collecting  it; and privacy controls related to relatively new technologies, such as  web tracking and mobile devices. At the same time, different legislative  approaches to improving privacy\u2014including comprehensive or sector- specific\u2014involve trade-offs and have advantages and disadvantages.  The challenge will be providing appropriate privacy protections without  unduly inhibiting the benefits to consumers, commerce, and innovation  that data sharing can accord."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider strengthening the current consumer privacy  framework to reflect the effects of changes in technology and the  marketplace\u2014particularly in relation to consumer data used for marketing  purposes\u2014while also ensuring that any limitations on data collection and  sharing do not unduly inhibit the economic and other benefits to industry  and consumers that data sharing can accord. Among the issues that  should be considered are  the adequacy of consumers\u2019 ability to access, correct, and control  their personal information in circumstances beyond those currently  accorded under FCRA; whether there should be additional controls on the types of personal  or sensitive information that may or may not be collected and shared;  changes needed, if any, in the permitted sources and methods for  data collection; and privacy controls related to new technologies, such as web tracking  and mobile devices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission.

For the purposes of this report, we defined  information resellers as companies with a primary line of business of  collecting, aggregating, and selling publicly available and private personal  information to third parties. This report focuses primarily on privacy issues  related to consumer information used for marketing and for individual  reference services\u2014sometimes called look-up or people-search services.  We generally excluded from our review privacy issues related to  consumer data collected and used by information resellers for purposes  such as fraud prevention, eligibility determination for credit or  employment, and legal compliance.", "To determine laws that relate to the privacy and safeguarding of  consumer information held by information resellers, we reviewed relevant  federal and selected state laws and determined their applicability to  information resellers\u2019 collection and use of consumer information used for  marketing and individual reference services. Specifically, we reviewed  various law review and legal journal articles, conducted searches of the  Westlaw database, and reviewed and analyzed a legal treatise compiling  laws relating to data privacy, including any laws applicable to government  records, electronic surveillance, medical data, financial information,  commercial transactions, and online activity. We reviewed laws in terms  of their general purpose, applicability to resellers or the collection and use  of consumer information, as well as applicable agency regulations.", "In conducting our analyses, we determined that privacy laws are  applicable for specific purposes, in certain situations, to certain sectors, to  certain types of entities, or to certain types of records; and categorized  our findings into two major groups that included (1) primary federal  privacy laws, and (2) other federal privacy laws that also may apply to  information resellers\u2019 practices and products, consumer services, or types  of records. We also reviewed and analyzed relevant state laws governing  consumer privacy and data security, and identified those states that also  enacted privacy legislation beyond data breach notification. We reviewed  selected Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement actions related to  its deception and unfairness authority. To determine whether gaps may  exist in the current privacy framework, we analyzed these federal laws  and related regulations to assess the extent of privacy protections under  federal law and any limitations in their scope, including the adequacy of  consumers\u2019 ability to access, correct, opt out, or request deletion of  information.", "To obtain views on approaches to improving consumer data privacy\u2014as  well as gather additional information on potential gaps in the privacy  framework for consumer privacy\u2014we identified and analyzed relevant  studies and reports, Congressional testimony, legislative and regulatory  proposals, position papers, and other documents from governmental and  nongovernmental stakeholders. We solicited views on these issues from  representatives of various organizations that represent the interests of  information resellers, advertisers, and consumers, as well as federal  agencies. We reviewed the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), a  set of internationally recognized principles for protecting the privacy and  security of personal information, and the framework for consumer data  privacy issued by the White House in February 2012. We also reviewed  relevant public comments that the Department of Commerce (Commerce)  and FTC received from notices soliciting such comments. In addition, we  reviewed correspondence from information resellers in response to the  Bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus\u2019s inquiry into nine resellers\u2019 use  of consumer information.", "To address all three objectives, we also used Internet search techniques  and keyword search terms to identify sources and types of available  information about the reseller industry, including the definition of  information resellers; number and nature of companies that serve as  information resellers; industry revenues; product offerings; internal  controls and practices; extent of consumer information collected and  maintained; and who is buying information resellers\u2019 products and for  what purposes. In doing so, we generally obtained information from  various online research sources such as LexisNexis, Proquest, and  Gartner, which consisted of company dossiers, journals, trade  publications, periodicals, studies, white papers, and aggregated  databases relevant to the reseller industry. We also analyzed U.S.", "Census Bureau data to obtain information on business classification  codes (including Standard Industrial Classification and North American  Classification System codes) assigned to reseller companies to classify  their main industry and line of business.

In addition, we interviewed (in some cases, receiving  written responses to questions we provided) six information resellers\u2014 Acxiom, Epsilon, Experian Marketing, Intelius, LexisNexis (Reed  Elsevier), and Spokeo. These companies were selected because, based  on our analyses, they constituted a mix of the largest and most widely  recognized resellers that maintain a range of products and services that  collect and sell consumer information for purposes including marketing,  individual reference services, or both. The information resellers we  included and the products they offer do not necessarily represent the full  scope of the industry. We reviewed marketing materials and other  documentation from these companies. Additionally, we reviewed our 2006  and 2008 reports on information resellers as well as recent work on  issues related to consumer and data privacy, and other related subjects.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through  September 2013, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
