However, these efforts have not been fully successful in reducing redundancies in geospatial investments for several reasons. First, a complete and up-to-date strategic plan for doing so has not been in place. Second, agencies have not consistently complied with OMB guidance that seeks to identify and reduce duplication. Finally, OMB's oversight of federal geospatial activities has not been effective because its methods--the annual budget review process, the federal enterprise architecture effort, and the Federal Geographic Data Committee's reporting process--are insufficiently developed and have not produced consistent and complete information. As a result of these shortcomings, federal agencies are still independently acquiring and maintaining potentially duplicative and costly data sets and systems.

For  example, entities such as houses, rivers, road intersections, power plants,  and national parks can all be identified by their locations. In addition,  phenomena such as wildfires, the spread of the West Nile virus, and the  thinning of trees due to acid rain, can also be identified by their geographic  locations.", "A geographic information system (GIS) is a system of computer software,  hardware, and data used to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and  graphically present a potentially wide array of geospatial information. A  GIS combines the disciplines of geography, cartography, computer science, and mathematics to permit users to query and analyze the attributes of any  entity or phenomenon that has been identified by its geographic location,  providing a powerful ability to integrate different kinds of location-based  information. A fully functional GIS includes hardware and software to  support data input, output, storage, retrieval, display, and analysis. A  variety of platforms support GIS processing, ranging from large mainframe  computers and minicomputers to scientific workstations and personal  computers. In many cases, hardware used to support other applications  (e.g., payroll, accounting, and digital image processing) can also be used.", "A variety of technologies, including remote sensing systems and the Global  Positioning System (GPS), are used to collect the geospatial data in a GIS.  Remote sensing systems collect data that are either emitted or reflected by  the Earth and the atmosphere from a distance\u2014such as from a satellite,  airplane, or balloon. The GPS is a constellation of orbiting satellites that  provides navigational data to military and civilian users around the world.  With the proper equipment, users can receive signals from these satellites  to calculate time, location, and velocity. GPS equipment is now being used  on aircraft, ships, and land-based vehicles, and mobile hand-held units  provide individuals with these capabilities as well.", "The primary function of a GIS is to link multiple sets of geospatial data and  display the combined information as maps with many different layers of  information. Assuming that all of the information is at the same scale and  has been formatted according to the same standards, users can potentially  overlay spatial information about any number of specific topics to examine  how the layers interrelate. Each layer of a GIS map represents a particular  \u201ctheme\u201d or feature, and one layer could be derived from a data source  completely different from the others. For example, one theme could  represent all of the streets in a specific area. Another theme could  correspond to all of the buildings in the same area, and others could show  vegetation or water resources. As long as standard processes and formats  have been used to facilitate integration, each of these themes could be  based on data originally collected and maintained by a separate  organization. Analyzing this layered information as an integrated whole can  significantly aid decision makers in considering complex choices, such as  where to locate a new department of motor vehicles building to best serve  the greatest number of citizens.", "Typical geospatial data layers (or themes) include cadastral\u2014describing  location, ownership, and other information about real property; digital   orthoimagery\u2014containing images of the Earth\u2019s surface that have the  geometric characteristics of a map and image qualities of a photograph;  and hydrography\u2014describing water features such as lakes, ponds, streams  and rivers, canals, oceans, and coastlines.

For example, local fire  departments can use geographic information systems to determine the  quickest and most efficient route from a firehouse to a specific location,  taking into account changing traffic patterns that occur at various times of  day. Highway departments use geographic information systems to identify  intersections that have had a significant number of personal injury  accidents to determine needs for improved traffic signaling or signage.", "The usefulness of a GIS in disaster response situations was also  demonstrated in connection with the Space Shuttle Columbia recovery  effort. After the loss of Columbia on February 1, 2003, debris was spread  over at least 41 counties in Texas and Louisiana (see fig. 2). Analysis of GIS  data was critical to the efficient recovery and documentation of that debris.  The Texas state GIS program provided authorities with precise maps and  search grids to guide field reconnaissance and collection crews. Officials in  charge of the effort used maps of debris fields, combined with GIS data  about the physical terrain, to carefully track every piece of debris found.", "A GIS can also be an invaluable tool in helping to ensure homeland security  by facilitating preparedness, prevention, detection, and recovery and  response to terrorist attacks. For example, according to a March 2002 Gartner report, New York City\u2019s GIS system was pivotal in the rescue,  response, and recovery efforts after the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks. The city\u2019s GIS provided real-time data on the area around the  World Trade Center, so that the mayor, governor, federal officials, and  emergency response agencies could implement critical rescue, response,  and recovery efforts. Specifically, daily flyovers were performed to monitor  changes in the elevation of the site to detect weaknesses in the  underground structure. In addition, thermal imagery was compared with  underground infrastructure maps to determine the locations where fires  were still smoldering and to help the New York City Fire Department and  emergency crews in detecting potential new explosion sites from nearby  flammable substances. Further, maps generated by geospatial information  systems were used to transmit critical information to the public and  emergency personnel and provided the Army and Police Department with  critical data on other potential terrorist targets such as bridges, tunnels,  and reservoirs.", "Another use for GIS is in the tracking and responding to natural disasters  such as hurricanes. For example, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) used its GIS capabilities and those of the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to generate maps to track  hurricane Isabel in September 2003. FEMA officials generated maps that  estimated Isabel\u2019s track, and used a hurricane wind model to produce maps  of projected damage-prone areas in affected states. These officials also  produced wind damage estimates for structures and infrastructures, such  as sewage treatment plants, nursing homes, schools, and hospitals. Further,  the officials performed various demographic analyses that estimated the  population and number of housing units in affected counties or other areas.  Figure 3 shows an example of a hurricane-tracking map.", "Similarly, many other federal departments and agencies use GIS technology  to help carry out their primary missions. Examples include the following:  The Department of Housing and Urban Development worked with the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop an enterprise  geographic information system, which combines information on  community development and housing programs with other types of  data, including environmental and transportation data. The program  provides homeowners and prospective home buyers with ready access  to detailed local information about environmental hazards and other  information that otherwise would likely be difficult to obtain.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) uses GIS  technology for a variety of public health functions, such as reporting the  results of national health surveys. In addition, there are a variety of  GIS-based atlases of national mortality from causes such as injury,  cardiovascular disease, cancer, and reproductive health problems. Other  GIS activities focus on disease surveillance and prevention of infectious  diseases that are caused by environmental exposure. A variety of  mapping tools are published on the Web to facilitate citizen access to  public health resources and other information.", "The Census Bureau maintains the Topologically Integrated Geographic  Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database to support its mission to  conduct the decennial census and other censuses and surveys by  spatially locating all habitations within the United States and reporting  the resulting census estimates and counts.

In  1953, the Bureau of the Budget first issued its Circular A-16, encouraging  expeditious surveying and mapping activities across all levels of  government and avoidance of duplicative efforts. In 1990, OMB revised  Circular A-16 to, among other things, establish FGDC within the  Department of the Interior, to promote the coordinated use, sharing, and  dissemination of geospatial data nationwide.", "Building on that guidance, the President in 1994 issued Executive Order  12906, assigning to FGDC the responsibility to coordinate the development  of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to address redundancy  and incompatibility of geospatial information. The infrastructure is defined  by FGDC as the technologies, policies, and people necessary to promote  sharing of geospatial data throughout all levels of government, the private  and nonprofit sectors, and the academic community. The NSDI\u2019s goals are  to reduce duplication of effort among agencies; to improve quality and  reduce costs related to geographic information; to make the benefits of  geographic data more accessible to the public; and to establish key  partnerships with states, counties, cities, tribal nations, academia, and the  private sector to increase data availability.", "Further, in August 2002, OMB again revised Circular A-16 to reflect changes  in geographic information management and technology and to more clearly  define agency and FGDC roles and responsibilities. In addition to the  responsibilities identified for FGDC, Circular A-16 outlines responsibilities  and reporting requirements for individual federal agencies to help ensure  that geospatial resources are used efficiently and contribute to building the  NSDI. Among other things, the circular requires that agencies prepare  geographic information strategies, use FGDC data standards, and  coordinate and work in partnership with federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector. These responsibilities are assigned to  all agencies that collect, use, or disseminate geographic information or  carry out spatial data activities.", "More recently, in December 2002, the E-Government Act of 2002 was  signed into law, requiring OMB to coordinate with state, local, and tribal  governments as well as public-private partnerships and other interested  persons on the development of standard protocols for sharing geographic  information to reduce redundant data collection and promote collaboration  and the use of standards.", "In addition to its responsibilities for geospatial information under the  E-Government Act, OMB has specific oversight responsibilities regarding  federal information technology (IT) systems and acquisition  activities\u2014including GIS\u2014to help ensure their efficient and effective use.  For example, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires the Director of OMB  to promote and be responsible for improving the acquisition, use, and  disposal of information technology by the federal government to improve  the productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness of federal programs. These  requirements help to advance OMB\u2019s federal IT management  responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which has a  similar but more general requirement that the Director of OMB oversee the  use of information resources to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  government operations to serve agency missions. Appendix III provides  brief descriptions of key federal legislation, policies, and guidance that  apply to IT and geospatial information and systems investments.", "To help carry out its investment oversight role, OMB established  requirements for the acquisition and management of IT resources in its  Circular A-11. The circular establishes policies for planning, budgeting,  acquisition, and management of federal capital assets. Specifically, it  requires agencies to submit business cases to OMB for planned or ongoing  major IT investments. These business cases require agencies to answer  questions to help OMB determine if the investment should be funded.", "Agency business case submissions must also include (1) the type of data  used by the IT investment, including geospatial data; (2) whether the data  needed for the investment already exist at the federal, state, or local level,  and plans to gain access to that data; (3) potential legal reasons why  existing data cannot be transferred; and (4) compliance with FGDC  standards. According to Circular A-11, agency responses to these questions  are reviewed as part of OMB\u2019s evaluation of the overall business case.", "In addition to activities associated with Circulars A-11 and A-16, in a June  2003 congressional hearing, OMB\u2019s Administrator, Office of Electronic  Government and Information Technology, stated that the strategic  management of geospatial assets would be accomplished, in part, through  development of a robust and mature federal enterprise architecture. In  2001, the lack of a Federal Enterprise Architecture was cited by OMB\u2019s  E-Government Task Force as a barrier to the success of the  administration\u2019s e-government initiatives. In response, OMB began  developing the FEA, and over the last two years it has released various  versions of all but one of the five FEA reference models. According to  OMB, the purpose of the FEA, among other things, is to provide a common  frame of reference or taxonomy for agencies\u2019 individual enterprise  architecture efforts and their planned and ongoing investment activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Government and Private-Sector Geospatial Information and GIS Activities", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments and the private sector independently provide  information and services apart from those provided by the federal  government, including maintaining land records for nonfederal lands,  property taxation, local planning, subdivision control and zoning, and  direct delivery of many other public services.

In  fact, local governments often possess more recent and higher resolution  geospatial data than the federal government, and in many cases  private-sector companies collect these data under contract to local  government agencies.", "For example, the state of New York hosts a Web site to provide citizens  with a gateway to state government services at  http://www.nysegov.com/map-NY.cfm. Using this Web site, citizens can  access information about state agencies and their services, and locate  county boundaries, services, and major state highways. New York also  developed a clearinghouse (http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/) to disseminate  information about statewide GIS programs and provide information and  services including state maps, aerial photographs, and a help desk to  provide support for both general questions and specific questions regarding  the use of GIS software.

A 2003 survey sponsored by Interior showed that GIS technology is  recognized as an essential tool by many local governments. For example,  Fairfax County in Virginia developed GIS applications to provide online  products and services to the public that include  a digital map viewer to see and download property, zoning, topography,   an aerial orthoimagery photo viewer to access aerial photographs of  specific parcels, areas of interest, or addresses;  a department of tax administration parcel finder to locate detailed  information about a specific property and to view that parcel with the  parcel viewer; and   a map gallery that contains many common maps produced by the  Fairfax County GIS and Mapping Department.

FEMA officials indicated that they  obtained much of their data from state and local partners or purchased  them from the private sector because data from those sources better fit  their accuracy and resolution requirements than elevation data available  from USGS. Similarly, according to one Army official, available USGS  elevation data sets generally do not include military installations, and even  when such data are available for specific installations, they are typically  not accurate enough for DOD\u2019s purposes. As a result, DOD collects its own  elevation data for its installations.
