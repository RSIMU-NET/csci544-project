To address the need  for physicians in underserved areas, states and federal agencies have  turned to foreign physicians who have just completed their graduate  medical education in the United States. Many of these foreign physicians  entered the United States on temporary visas, called J-1 visas. Once they  have completed their graduate medical education, these physicians are  required to return to their home country or country of last legal residence  for at least 2 years before they may apply to stay permanently in the  United States or for certain temporary work visas. This foreign residence  requirement can, however, be waived in certain circumstances, including  at the request of a state or federal agency if the physician agrees to  practice in an underserved area for at least 3 years. J-1 visa waivers are  granted by the Department of Homeland Security at the recommendation  of the Department of State.", "In 1996, we reported that the number of J-1 visa waivers requested by  states and federal agencies for physicians to work in underserved areas  had risen dramatically\u2014from 70 in 1990 to more than 1,300 in 1995\u2014and  that requesting waivers had become a major means of placing physicians  in underserved areas. We estimated that in 1995, the number of waiver  physicians practicing in underserved areas exceeded the number of  physicians practicing in such areas through National Health Service Corps  (NHSC) programs\u2014the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  primary mechanism for addressing shortages of physicians and other  primary care health professionals. We reported that slightly over half of  these waiver physicians practiced internal medicine and that nearly   40 percent of them practiced in nonprofit community or migrant health  centers. Further, we noted that controls for ensuring that these physicians  met the terms of their waiver agreements were somewhat weak, and we  found cases in which physicians were not meeting their waiver  agreements, such as not practicing at the facilities or in the underserved  areas for which the physicians\u2019 waivers were granted. Finally, we reported  that the use of waivers was not effectively coordinated with HHS  programs addressing underservice, such as NHSC programs. As a result,  some states had more physicians than HHS identified as needed to  alleviate shortages, while other states were still experiencing shortages.", "You expressed an interest in how J-1 visa waivers are being used to place  physicians in underserved areas. In May 2006, we testified on preliminary  findings from our work, focusing primarily on states\u2019 requests for J-1 visa  waivers. This report provides information on both states\u2019 and federal  agencies\u2019 J-1 visa waiver requests and addresses (1) the number of waivers  requested by states and federal agencies in fiscal years 2003 through 2005;  (2) the practice specialties, settings, and locations in which waiver  physicians work; (3) the activities states and federal agencies undertake to  help ensure that physicians are meeting their agreements to work in  underserved areas; and (4) the extent to which waiver physicians are  accounted for in HHS\u2019s efforts to address physician shortages.", "To address these issues, we administered a Web-based survey to the  entities eligible to request J-1 visa waivers under the authority granted to  the states: the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and  the U.S. Virgin Islands (hereafter referred to as \u201cstates\u201d). We also  surveyed the three federal agencies that requested waivers for physicians  to practice in underserved areas in fiscal years 2003 through 2005\u2014the  Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Delta Regional Authority  (DRA), and HHS\u2014using a structured data collection instrument. We sent  the surveys to the officials in each state or federal agency authorized to  sign waiver requests or to his or her designee. The surveys asked each  state and federal agency to provide information on the number of waivers  requested in each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005; the practice  specialties, settings, and locations of physicians for whom waivers were  requested; the state\u2019s or federal agency\u2019s policies for requesting waivers;  activities undertaken to help ensure that waiver physicians are meeting  their agreements to work in underserved areas; and incidents in which  physicians were not meeting their waiver agreements. The response rate  to both surveys was 100 percent. We reviewed the survey responses for  internal consistency and for outliers, and we followed up with respondents  to resolve discrepancies and clarify responses; we did not, however, verify  the accuracy of the responses. Regarding federal agencies\u2019 J-1 visa waiver  programs, we interviewed officials from ARC, DRA, and HHS and obtained  from them data on their waiver requests by state. We reviewed states\u2019 and  federal agencies\u2019 policies and guidelines pertaining to their J-1 visa waiver  programs as of September 30, 2005; reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and documents; and interviewed officials involved in recommending and  granting waivers at the Department of State and the Department of  Homeland Security.", "To examine how the use of J-1 visa waivers is accounted for in HHS\u2019s  efforts to address physician shortages, we interviewed officials from  HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services Administration and obtained from  them data on the number of NHSC physicians practicing in each state and  the number of physicians needed to remove shortage designations in each  state as of September 30, 2005. We estimated the number of waiver  physicians practicing primary care in each state as of September 2005,  using states\u2019 and federal agencies\u2019 responses to our survey. (See app. I for  detailed information on this analysis.) In addition, we interviewed officials  at the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG),  the organization that sponsors foreign physicians as exchange visitors for  graduate medical education. We conducted our work from August 2005  through November 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Many foreign physicians who enter U.S. graduate medical education  programs do so as participants in the Department of State\u2019s Exchange  Visitor Program\u2014an educational and cultural exchange program aimed at  increasing mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States  and other countries. Participants in the Exchange Visitor Program enter  the United States with J-1 visas. Nearly 6,200 foreign physicians with J-1  visas took part in U.S. graduate medical education programs during  academic year 2004\u201305.", "Physicians participating in graduate medical education on J-1 visas are  required to return to their home country or country of last legal residence  for at least 2 years before they may apply for an immigrant visa, permanent  residence, or certain nonimmigrant work visas. They may, however,  obtain a waiver of this requirement from the Department of Homeland  Security at the request of a state or federal agency if they have agreed to  practice in an underserved area for at least 3 years. States were first  authorized to request J-1 visa waivers on behalf of foreign physicians in  October 1994. Federal agencies were first authorized to request J-1 visa  waivers for physicians in graduate medical education in September 1961.", "In general, waiver physicians must practice in areas that HHS has  designated as underserved. HHS has specified that waiver physicians may  practice in HPSAs or medically underserved areas or populations  (MUA/P). HPSAs are geographic areas, population groups within areas,  or facilities that HHS has designated as having a shortage of health  professionals; HPSAs for primary care are generally identified on the basis  of the ratio of population to primary care physicians and other factors.", "MUA/Ps are areas or populations that HHS has designated as having  shortages of health care services; these are identified using several factors  in addition to the ratio of population to primary care physicians. HPSAs  and MUA/Ps can overlap; as a result, a facility can be located in both a  HPSA and an MUA/P.", "States and federal agencies have some discretion in shaping their J-1 visa  waiver programs to address particular needs or priorities. For example,  while states and federal agencies can request waivers for physicians to  work in both primary care and nonprimary care specialties and in a variety  of practice settings, they may choose to limit the number of waivers they  request for physicians to practice nonprimary care or require that waiver  physicians work in certain practice settings. States and federal agencies  may also choose to conduct monitoring activities to help ensure that  physicians are meeting their waiver agreements\u2014for example, that they  are working at the facilities for which their waivers were granted.", "Although states and federal agencies are generally subject to the same  statutory provisions regarding requests for J-1 visa waivers for physicians,  there are two notable distinctions. First, states are limited in the number  of waivers that may be granted in response to their requests each year.  Initially, states were authorized to request waivers for up to 20 physicians  each fiscal year; in 2002, the limit was increased to 30 waivers per state per  year. Federal agencies are not statutorily limited in the number of waivers  that may be granted in response to their requests each year. Second, while  federal agencies\u2019 waiver requests must be for physicians to practice in  underserved areas, Congress gave states the flexibility, in December 2004,  to use up to 5 of their 30 waiver allotments each year for physicians to  work in facilities located outside of HHS-designated undeserved areas,  provided that the facilities treat patients who reside in underserved areas.  We refer to these waivers as \u201cflexible waivers.\u201d", "Obtaining a J-1 visa waiver at the request of a state or federal agency to  practice in an underserved area involves multiple steps (see fig. 1). A  physician must submit an application to obtain a case number from the  Department of State and must secure a bona fide offer of employment  from a health care facility that is located in an underserved area or, in the  case of flexible waivers, from a health care facility that treats residents of  an underserved area. The physician, the prospective employer, or both  apply to a state or federal agency to request a waiver on the physician\u2019s  behalf. If, after reviewing the application, the state or federal agency  decides to request a waiver, the state or federal agency submits a letter of  request to the Department of State affirming that it is in the public interest  for the physician to remain in the United States. If the Department of State  decides to recommend the waiver, it forwards its recommendation to the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services (USCIS). USCIS is responsible for making the final determination  and notifying the physician when the waiver is granted. According to  officials involved in recommending and approving waivers at the  Department of State and USCIS, after a review for compliance with  statutory requirements and security issues, nearly all waiver requests are  recommended and granted. Once the physician is granted the waiver, the  employer petitions USCIS for the physician to obtain H-1B status (a  nonimmigrant classification used by foreign nationals employed  temporarily in a specialty occupation). The physician must work at the  facility specified in the waiver application for a minimum of 3 years, unless  the physician obtains approval from USCIS to transfer to another facility.  USCIS considers transfer requests only in extenuating circumstances, such  as closure of the physician\u2019s assigned facility. Once the physician fulfills  the employment contract, the physician may apply for permanent  residence, continued H-1B status, or other nonimmigrant status, if the  physician wishes to remain in the United States.", "No single federal agency is responsible for managing or tracking the use of  J-1 visa waivers for physicians to practice in underserved areas. HHS is the  primary federal agency responsible for addressing physician shortages,  both in terms of administering NHSC programs that place physicians and  other providers in areas experiencing shortages of health professionals  and in designating areas as underserved. HHS\u2019s oversight of waiver  physicians practicing in underserved areas, however, has generally been  limited to the few physicians for whom it has requested J-1 visa waivers.  USCIS and the Department of State process J-1 visa waiver requests but do  not maintain comprehensive information about waiver physicians\u2019  numbers, practice locations, and practice specialties. States and federal  agencies that request waivers maintain such information for the physicians  for whom they request waivers, but this information is not centrally  collected and maintained by any federal agency.", "Although the use of J-1 visa waivers has not been systematically tracked,  available data indicate that the pool of physicians who could seek  waivers\u2014that is, the number of foreign physicians in graduate medical  education with J-1 visas\u2014has declined in recent years. In academic year  1996\u201397, a little more than 11,600 foreign physicians took part in U.S.  graduate medical education programs with J-1 visas; by academic year  2004\u201305 this number had decreased more than 45 percent to slightly less  than 6,200. The reasons for this decrease are not completely understood."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waivers Remain a Major Means for Providing Physicians to Underserved Areas", "paragraphs": ["States and federal agencies reported requesting more than 1,000 J-1 visa  waivers in each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 (see fig. 2).

States varied, however, in the number of waivers they  requested in fiscal years 2003 through 2005.

These activities included  actions to help determine, for example, whether physicians were working  in the locations for which their waivers were requested or whether they  were treating the intended patients, such as those who were uninsured or  covered by Medicaid. The most common monitoring activity\u2014reported by  40 states, ARC, and DRA\u2014was to require periodic reports from physicians  or employers (see fig. 8). For example, some states and federal agencies  required written reports submitted once or twice a year that included  information such as the number of hours waiver physicians worked or the  number of patients for whom Medicaid claims were submitted. States and  federal agencies that requested waivers also reported that they monitored  waiver physicians through regular communications with employers and  physicians, such as through phone calls, and through site visits to waiver  physicians\u2019 practice locations. In addition, a small number of states  reported conducting other monitoring activities. For example, one state  official said the state\u2019s J-1 visa waiver program used Medicaid data to  confirm that waiver physicians were treating patients covered by  Medicaid.", "Although most states and federal agencies reported conducting at least  one monitoring activity, the number of monitoring activities varied. Ten  states and DRA reported conducting at least four different activities, while  six states and HHS\u2014together accounting for about 13 percent of waiver  requests in fiscal year 2005\u2014reported that they did not conduct any  monitoring activities in fiscal year 2005.

These incidents included cases in which the  physician was not working in the practice specialty or at the facility  specified in his or her waiver agreement, was not seeing the intended  patients, or did not serve the entire 3-year employment contract. The most  common issue cited was physicians\u2019 transferring to another location or  employer without the approval of the state or federal agency that  requested their waivers. In addition, several states reported that they had  identified cases in which waiver physicians never reported to work.  Officials from these states cited examples in which physicians simply  failed to appear at the practice sites and did not contact the state that had  made the waiver requests on the physicians\u2019 behalf. According to states  and federal agencies that reported identifying any incidents, physicians  were not solely responsible in all cases in which they did not meet their  waiver agreements. Some state officials provided examples of employers  who directed physicians to work in locations other than those for which  their waivers were requested, including locations outside of underserved  areas.", "States and federal agencies that requested waivers reported that they use a  variety of practices to prevent or respond to cases of physicians\u2019 not  meeting their waiver agreements (see fig. 9). For example, 38 states and  HHS reported that it is their practice to bar employers who are responsible  for problems involving waiver physicians from consideration for future J-1  visa waiver physician placements, either temporarily or permanently.  Forty states and two federal agencies reported that it is their practice to  inform USCIS if they identify physicians who are not meeting their waiver  agreements. Physicians not meeting their waiver agreements would again  be subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement and would need to  return to their home country or country of last legal residence before they  could apply for an immigrant visa, permanent residence, or certain  nonimmigrant work visas. USCIS officials said that reports of physicians  not meeting their waiver agreements have been relatively rare. Some  states and federal agencies that requested waivers also reported that they  require physicians\u2019 contracts to stipulate fees to be imposed if the  physicians fail to meet their waiver agreements. These requirements  include, for example, liquidated damages clauses, which set a particular  amount that physicians agree to pay employers if the physicians break  their employment contracts. Other practices that states reported included  reporting problems with waiver physicians to state medical boards.", "States cited a number of factors affecting their ability to monitor or take  other actions that they believed could help them ensure that physicians  meet their waiver agreements. More than one-quarter of the states  reported that funding and staffing constraints limited their ability to carry  out monitoring activities. For example, four states commented that time  and staff constraints limited their ability to conduct visits to physicians\u2019  practice sites. Several states noted that they have little or no authority to  take actions that would help ensure that physicians meet their waiver  agreements. For example, one state commented that beyond reporting  physicians who do not meet their waiver agreements to USCIS, it has no  authority over waiver physicians. In addition, a few states noted that their  ability to effectively monitor physicians is limited by the fact that they are  not notified when USCIS grants waivers or approves transfers.  Consequently, states may not know with certainty which physicians USCIS  has authorized to work in, or move to or from, their states. One federal  agency (ARC) cited two factors that positively affected its ability to help  ensure that physicians meet their waiver agreements: the liquidated  damages clauses for violating employment agreements that ARC requires  to be in physicians\u2019 employment contracts, and site visits by staff of ARC\u2019s  Office of Inspector General. According to a senior ARC official, these  unannounced visits have occasionally resulted in the discovery of  physicians working at sites other than those at which the physicians were  authorized to work.

Our analysis indicates that some states could have had  more waiver and NHSC physicians practicing primary care in HPSAs than  HHS identified as needed, while other states were below HHS\u2019s identified  need. Although data were not available to determine the number of waiver  physicians practicing primary care specifically in HPSAs, our analysis  showed that in seven states the estimated number of waiver physicians  practicing primary care in all locations (including HPSAs, MUA/Ps, and  nondesignated areas), combined with the number of NHSC physicians  practicing primary care in HPSAs at the end of fiscal year 2005, exceeded  the number of physicians HHS identified as needed to remove the primary  care HPSA designations in the state. In six of these seven states, the  estimated number of primary care waiver and NHSC physicians exceeded  by at least 20 percent the number needed to remove primary care HPSA  designations.

We received written comments on the draft report  from HHS (see app. III). HHS concurred with our recommendation that  data should be collected and maintained to track waiver physicians. HHS  noted that the department had also discussed, internally, tracking other  physicians who are working under H-1B visas, stating that this would  allow a more complete accounting of the actual number of physicians  providing care in underserved areas. HHS commented that the  department\u2019s goal is to assure that the limited resources of the J-1 visa  waiver program and other programs addressing areas and populations  with limited access to health care professionals are targeted most  effectively and that the availability of complete data on these additional  providers would enhance the data used to identify such shortage areas.", "HHS also commented that the draft report may have overstated, to a  degree, the \u201coversupply\u201d of physicians in some states. HHS acknowledged  that we made important adjustments in our analysis for physicians  practicing nonprimary care and psychiatry. The department, however,  expressed concern that our calculations did not address the fact that some  J-1 visa waiver placements are not in HPSAs, referring to our finding that   23 percent of waivers requested in fiscal year 2005 were for physicians to  practice outside of HPSAs. We believe that applying this percentage to our  analysis would be inappropriate for several reasons. First, this percentage  pertained to waiver physicians practicing all specialties, including primary  care, nonprimary care, and psychiatry, while our analysis focused on  physicians practicing primary care. Further, the 23 percent figure  represents waivers requested in only one fiscal year (fiscal year 2005),  while our analysis covered waivers requested in 3 fiscal years. In addition,  fiscal year 2005 was the only year in our analysis in which states could  request waivers for physicians to practice in nondesignated areas. In our  draft report, we did not use the term \u201coversupply,\u201d but we acknowledge  that our report should clearly specify the limitations in the data used in  our analysis. To do so, we clarified the text describing our methodology  and results.", "We also received technical comments from HHS and the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s USCIS, which we incorporated as appropriate. Three  agencies\u2014ARC, DRA, and Department of State\u2014said that they did not  have comments on the draft report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the  Federal Co-chair of ARC, the Federal Co-chairman of DRA, and  appropriate congressional committees.

Specifically, we used summary data from HHS\u2019s  Health Resources and Services Administration on the number of additional  full-time equivalent (FTE) primary care physicians needed to remove  primary care HPSA designations in the state as of September 30, 2005.  HHS determines the number of additional full-time primary care  physicians needed to remove primary care HPSA designations for  geographic areas, population groups, and facilities. For geographic areas,  HHS\u2019s threshold for the ratio of population to primary care physicians is  3,500 to 1 (or 3,000 to 1 under special circumstances); for population  groups, it is 3,000 to 1; for facilities that are state or federal correctional  institutions, it is 1,000 to 1. In calculating the ratio of population to  primary care physicians, HHS does not take into account waiver  physicians and most NHSC physicians. In addition to HPSAs, waiver  physicians may also practice in designated medically underserved areas or  populations (MUA/P). HHS does not, however, have a similar measure of  the number of physicians needed in MUA/Ps.", "To determine the number of NHSC physicians practicing primary care in  HPSAs in each state as of September 30, 2005, we used data obtained from  the Health Resources and Services Administration on the number of  primary care physicians practicing through the NHSC Scholarship, NHSC  Loan Repayment, and NHSC Ready Responder programs. NHSC  physicians are required to practice in HPSAs.", "Although data are not available on the number of physicians granted J-1  visa waivers and practicing primary care in underserved areas at any given  time, we estimated this number using data on waivers requested by states  and by three federal agencies\u2014the Appalachian Regional Commission  (ARC), the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), and HHS. We estimated the  number of waiver physicians practicing primary care in each state as of   September 30, 2005, by using the number of waivers requested in fiscal  years 2003 through 2005 for such physicians. This number represents the  number of primary care physicians expected to be fulfilling the minimum  3-year employment contract at the end of fiscal year 2005 or who had  waivers in process to do so.
