The prior structure was initiated under two different authorities and lacked clear leadership and permanence, hampering its effectiveness and long-term viability. In 1999, Congress created the National Intellectual Property Law Enforcement Coordination Council (NIPLECC) as a mechanism to coordinate U.S. efforts in the United States and overseas. In 2004, the Bush Administration announced the Strategy Targeting Organized Piracy (STOP), which included a similar group of U.S. agencies under a Presidential Initiative. In our reporting, we described how NIPLECC had struggled to define its purpose and retained an image of inactivity within the private sector. In a report undertaken for this Committee in 2004, we noted that NIPLECC had little discernible impact and had not undertaken any independent activities since it was created, according to interviews with agency officials and its own reports. Congress subsequently made enhancements to NIPLECC in December 2004 to strengthen its role, but we reported, in 2006, that it continued to have leadership problems. In contrast, the presidential initiative called STOP had a positive image compared to NIPLECC, but lacked permanence, since there was no assurance that its authority and influence would continue in successive administrations. Unlike NIPLECC, STOP from its beginning was characterized by a high level of active coordination and visibility. Many agency officials said that STOP has increased attention to IP issues within their agencies and the private sector, as well as abroad, and attributed that to the fact that STOP came out of the White House, thereby lending it more authority and influence. STOP was also a first step toward an integrated strategy to protect and enforce U.S. IP rights. However, we found that STOP's potential as a national strategy was limited because it did not fully address important characteristics of an effective strategy. For example, its performance measures lacked targets to assess how well the activities were being implemented. In addition, the strategy lacked a risk management framework and a discussion of current or future costs--important elements to effectively balance the threats from counterfeit products with the resources available. Although STOP identified organizational roles and responsibilities with respect to individual agencies' STOP activities, it did not specify who would provide oversight and accountability among the agencies carrying out the strategy. An additional theme of the PRO-IP Act is the emphasis on federal efforts to strengthen the capacity of foreign governments to protect and enforce IP rights. In September 2009, we reported that the USPTO IP attaches were generally effective in collaborating with other agencies at the four posts we visited, primarily by adopting practices, such as acting as effective focal points, establishing working groups and leveraging resources through joint activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to appear again before the Committee to  discuss our work on U.S. efforts to protect intellectual property (IP) rights.

At one post, the IP attach\u00e9 had worked with other  agencies to develop a joint work plan for the post.", "U.S. government officials in our three case study countries face a range of  challenges in their efforts to promote the protection and enforcement of IP  rights. The U.S. government has identified weak enforcement as a key IP  issue in the three case study countries; however, weaknesses also persist  in their IP laws and regulations. The U.S. government describes  enforcement of existing IP laws and regulations and adjudication of  suspected infringements as limited and inconsistent, and penalties are not  typically sufficient to serve as an effective deterrent. Several factors  contribute to this limited and inconsistent enforcement, including flawed  enforcement procedures; a lack of technical skills and knowledge of IP  among police, prosecutors, and judges; a lack of resources dedicated to IP  enforcement efforts; and the absence of broad-based domestic support for  strong IP enforcement.", "We found that the USPTO IP attach\u00e9s have adopted several practices that  enhanced collaboration on federal IP efforts overseas, such as    Acting as effective focal points: Agreement on agency roles and  responsibilities of the IP attach\u00e9s, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the State economic  section and post leadership, while challenging, was achieved in most  posts. Prior to the creation of the IP attach\u00e9 position at the four posts,  State economic officers had primary responsibility for IP; now, they are  the most involved in IP issues after the IP attach\u00e9s. IP attach\u00e9s also  imparted their subject matter expertise, which enhanced their  effectiveness as focal points. In addition, IP attach\u00e9s have the advantage of  working full time on IP, influencing agency officials at the posts to  increase attention to IP issues despite other competing demands. Several  agency officials from all four posts said that they had multiple  responsibilities required by their broad portfolios, and some officials in  some posts said they spent relatively little time on IP.", "Establishing IP working groups: The IP attach\u00e9s played a key role in  creating inter-agency IP working groups at the embassies in New Delhi  and Beijing soon after their arrival. Several agency officials at these posts  said that the working groups provided several benefits, such as increasing  awareness of IP issues and trends, exchanging information on respective  IP activities, and increasing coordination on training and other activities.  The importance of the IP working group and the role of the attach\u00e9 in  Beijing was demonstrated when the working group became inactive after  the attach\u00e9 left the post in August 2008 and the position became vacant.  Two agency officials at the post said that, without these meetings, there  was less focus on IP at the post and that it was more difficult to ensure  that the embassy spoke with one voice on IP.", "Leveraging resources through joint activities: The IP attach\u00e9s  complemented the efforts of other agencies to enhance IP protection and  enforcement at all four posts by leveraging resources through joint IP  activities. For example, the IP attach\u00e9s helped the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Foreign Commercial Service efforts to assist and encourage  individuals to do business in the country by providing advice on how to  avoid IP problems and answering IP-related questions.", "Economic officers in two posts provided several examples of IP attach\u00e9s\u2019  expertise enhancing the officers\u2019 relationship with host country officials.  For instance, the economic officer in New Delhi said that the IP attach\u00e9  had used his expertise to build rapport with the host government on IP  issues and complement the economic officer\u2019s diplomacy with details on  potential solutions. A public affairs officer in Guangzhou said that the IP  attach\u00e9 had met with stakeholders such as academics, students, and  industry groups on IP that provided the public affairs officer new contacts  for his work.", "Developing joint strategies: The IP attach\u00e9 in New Delhi led an effort to  develop a joint strategy in the form of an interagency IP work plan. The  plan established specific IP objectives and helped agencies at the working  level identify and implement IP activities that address the key issues  identified by the United States. For example, the work plan listed the  implementation of an optical disk law and a meaningful system for  protecting undisclosed data against unfair commercial use as key goals. In  addition, the plan identified day-to-day activities, such as meetings that the  post intended to hold with various Indian ministries, outreach it planned  to perform with the private sector, IP training it planned to provide, and  data it planned to collect to bolster the U.S. position on certain IP issues.  In general, we found that other existing post-level guidance  was too high- level and did not guide agencies\u2019 day-to-day efforts to reach IP goals.", "Joint strategies can help agencies maintain focus on IP given numerous  competing issues and periodic changes in key IP personnel at the posts.  Some agency officials noted that the long-term nature of many IP efforts\u2014 such as implementing optical disk laws, developing public outreach to  convince consumers of the importance of IP rights, or building the  relationships with foreign law enforcement officials necessary to conduct  joint IP investigations\u2014require sustained and focused attention over time.  In the absence of such sustained attention, the impacts of U.S. efforts can  be diminished. For instance, one official noted that he had observed a  cycle in which the post would exert pressure on the host country\u2019s police  to more aggressively enforce IP laws, and enforcement would increase;  however, after a time, pressure would ease and previous enforcement  levels would return. In our 2009 report, we recommended that the  Secretary of State direct post leadership to work with USPTO IP attach\u00e9s  in countries with such attach\u00e9s to develop annual IP interagency post  work plans with input from relevant agencies. The Department of State  and USPTO agreed with our recommendation.", "While our observations on USPTO\u2019s IP attach\u00e9s overseas are largely  positive, our prior work has also demonstrated that the long-term success  of operations abroad requires attention to human capital planning. In  particular, we observed that other agencies attempting to establish a  presence abroad had to make additional efforts to ensure that they could  recruit and retain sufficient personnel with the technical and cultural  expertise that is important in those posts. These considerations may be  important as USPTO makes decisions about the scale and permanence of  this program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Madam Chairwoman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the  Committee to summarize our work on IP protection. GAO has performed a  number of studies on both domestic and international efforts to protect IP  since my last testimony on this subject before this Committee in 2004.

Our most recent report also suggests that efforts such as those of  the USPTO to place specialist attach\u00e9s abroad has had a positive impact in  the posts we visited because of their expertise and focus on this issue.
