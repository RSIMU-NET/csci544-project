A key factor inhibiting this coordination is the concern over how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or another federal court might rule on the primary purpose of the surveillance or search in light of such coordination. In addition, the FBI and the Criminal Division differ on the interpretations of DOJ's 1995 procedures concerning counterintelligence investigations. In January 2000, the Attorney General issued additional procedures to address these coordination concerns. These procedures, among other things, required the FBI to submit case summaries to the Criminal Division and established a protocol for briefing Criminal Division officials about those investigations. In addition, the FBI established two mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Attorney General's 1995 procedures. These mechanisms include (1) requiring the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review to notify the FBI and the Criminal Division of investigations it believes meets the requirements of the 1995 procedures and (2) establishing a core group of high-level officials to oversee coordination issues. However, these efforts have not been institutionalized in management directives or written administrative policies or procedures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intelligence investigations identifying possible significant criminal violations have brought to light serious problems that have limited whether and when the FBI coordinates its investigations with the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Criminal Division. These investigations involved allegations that the Peoples Republic of China was seeking to influence the 1996 Presidential election in the United States and that nuclear weapons design secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory had been compromised. Timely coordinationon such intelligence investigations can be important because the Criminal Division may be able to advise the FBI on ways to (1) preserve its intelligence sources so that they would not be compromised in the event of subsequent prosecution and (2) enhance the evidence needed to prosecute the alleged crimes. In addition, prosecutors need sufficient time to familiarize themselves with a case in order to address any court proceedings emanating from the perpetrators\u2019 arrests.", "Most of the coordination problems have arisen in the context of foreign counterintelligence investigations that involve or anticipate the use of electronic surveillance or physical searches under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended. The act was designed to strike a balance between the government\u2019s need for intelligence information to protect the national security and the protection of individual privacy rights. The act provided the first legislative authorization for wiretapping and other forms of electronic surveillance for intelligence investigation purposes of foreign powers and their agents in the United States. The act, among other things, established (1) requirements and a process for seeking electronic surveillance and physical search authority in national security investigations seeking to obtain foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information within the United States and (2) a special court\u2014the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\u2014with jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surveillance and searches. Because the standards for obtaining a foreign intelligence surveillance order are different than those required to obtain authorization for a search or a surveillance in a criminal investigation, there will often be situations in which it is possible to obtain a foreign intelligence surveillance order that would not satisfy the standards for a criminal search warrant or electronic surveillance order.", "At your request, we reviewed the current policies, procedures, and processes for coordinating FBI intelligence investigations within DOJ, as well as DOJ\u2019s efforts to resolve problems that were identified in recent internal reviews of this issue. Specifically, we agreed to determine the following: 1.  The key factors that have affected coordination. 2.  The DOJ and FBI policies, procedures, and processes that are in place for coordinating with appropriate DOJ units foreign counterintelligence investigations that indicate possible criminal violations. 3.

At the same time, however, many of the foreign powers\u2019 clandestine efforts may involve a violation of U.S. criminal law, usually espionage or international terrorism, which falls within the federal law enforcement community\u2019s mandate to investigate and prosecute. As a result, foreign counterintelligence investigations often overlap with law enforcement interests.", "To provide a statutory framework for electronic surveillance conducted within the United States for foreign intelligence purposes, the Congress, in 1978, enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The legislative effort emerged, in part, from the turmoil that surrounded government intelligence agencies\u2019 efforts to apply national security tools to domestic organizations during the 1970s. For example, congressional hearings identified surveillance abuses within the United States by intelligence agencies that were carried out in the name of national security. FISA was designed to strike a balance between the government\u2019s need for intelligence information to protect the national security and the protection of individual privacy rights. In 1994, the Congress amended the 1978 act to include physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes under the FISA warrant procedures.", "Within DOJ, various components have responsibilities related to the investigation and prosecution of foreign intelligence, espionage, and terrorism crimes. The Criminal Division has responsibility for developing, enforcing, and supervising the application of all federal criminal laws, except those specifically assigned to other divisions. Within the Criminal Division, the Internal Security Section and the Terrorism and Violent Crime Section have responsibility for supervising the investigation and prosecution of crimes involving national security. Among such crimes are espionage, sabotage, and terrorism.", "The Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) is, among other things, to assist the Attorney General by providing legal advice and recommendations regarding national security matters and is to approve the seeking of certain intelligence-gathering activities. OIPR represents the United States before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (hereinafter, the FISA Court). OIPR prepares applications to the FISA Court for orders authorizing surveillance and physical searches by U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI, for foreign intelligence purposes in investigations involving espionage and international terrorism and presents them for FISA Court review. When evidence obtained under FISA is proposed for use in criminal proceedings, OIPR is to obtain the FISA- required advance authorization from the Attorney General. In addition, in coordination with the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorneys, OIPR has the responsibility of preparing motions and briefs required in U.S. district courts when surveillance authorized under FISA is challenged.", "The FBI is DOJ\u2019s principal investigative arm with jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes, including espionage, sabotage, assassination, and terrorism. To carry out its mission, the FBI has over 11,000 agents located primarily in 56 field offices and its headquarters in Washington, D.C. Among its many responsibilities, within the United States, the FBI is the lead federal agency for protecting the United States from foreign intelligence, espionage, and terrorist threats. The FBI\u2019s National Security and Counterterrorism Divisions are the units responsible for countering these threats. To accomplish their task, the National Security and Counterterrorism Divisions engage in foreign intelligence and foreign counterintelligence investigations.", "Within the Judicial Branch, FISA established a special court (the FISA Court). The FISA Court, as noted previously, has jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving FISA surveillance and searches. The FISA Court is comprised of seven district court judges from seven different districts who are appointed by the Chief Justice of the U.S.", "Supreme Court to serve rotating terms of no longer than 7 years. The Chief Justice also designates three federal judges from the district or appeals courts to serve on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Review Court. The Foreign Intelligence Review Court was established to rule on the government\u2019s appeals of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court denials of government-requested surveillance and search orders.", "As noted previously, foreign counterintelligence and law enforcement investigations often overlap, but at the same time different legal requirements apply to each type of investigation. For intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, electronic surveillance and physical searches against foreign powers and agents of foreign powers in the United States are governed by FISA, as amended. FISA, among other things, contains requirements and a process for seeking electronic surveillance and physical search authority in investigations seeking to obtain foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information within the United States. For example, FISA permits surveillance only when the purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information. FISA also requires prior judicial approval by the FISA Court for surveillance and searches. With respect to FBI foreign counterintelligence investigations, the FBI Director must certify, among other things, to the FISA Court that the purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information and that such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques. However, FISA also contains provisions permitting intelligence agencies to share with law enforcement intelligence information that they have gathered that implicates federal criminal violations. For federal criminal investigations, the issuance and execution of search warrants, for example, is generally governed by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In addition, electronic surveillance or wiretapping in criminal investigations is, in general, governed by title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended.", "The differing standards and requirements applicable to criminal investigations and intelligence investigations are evident with respect to electronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons where the requisite probable cause standard under FISA differs from that required in a criminal investigation. In criminal investigations, the issuance of court orders authorizing electronic surveillance must, in general, be supported by a judicial finding of probable cause to believe that an individual has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a particular predicate offense. In contrast, FISA, in general, requires that a FISA Court judge find probable cause to believe that the suspect target is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, and that the places at which the surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine what key factors affected coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division, we interviewed DOJ officials, including officials from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, OIPR, the Criminal Division, the Division\u2019s Internal Security and Terrorism and Violent Crime Sections, the Office of Inspector General, and the FBI\u2019s National Security and Counterterrorism Divisions and Office of General Counsel. We also reviewed congressional committee reports and hearing transcripts regarding intelligence coordination issues and the DOJ Inspector General\u2019s July 1999 unclassified report on intelligence coordination problems related to DOJ\u2019s campaign finance investigation.

Specifically, FBI and OIPR were concerned over the consequences should a court find that the primary purpose of the surveillance or search had shifted from intelligence gathering to collecting evidence for criminal prosecution. While these concerns inhibited coordination, Criminal Division officials questioned their reasonableness and believe that they had an adverse effect on the strength of subsequent prosecutions.

As noted earlier, FISA provides that evidence of criminal violations gathered during an intelligence investigation may be shared with law enforcement and, for example, used in a criminal prosecution. Under the primary purpose test, most courts have held that information gathered using the FISA tools may be used in subsequent criminal prosecutions only so long as the primary purpose of the FISA surveillance or search was to obtain foreign intelligence information. According to Criminal Division officials, since FISA\u2019s enactment, no court using the primary purpose test has upheld a challenge to the government\u2019s use of FISA-obtained intelligence information for criminal prosecution purposes.  However, OIPR and FBI officials expressed concern that a federal court could determine that the primary purpose of the surveillance or search was for a criminal investigation, and, could potentially suppress any FISA evidence gathered subsequent to that time.", "According to Criminal Division officials, the FBI\u2019s and OIPR\u2019s more restrictive interpretation of what could be shared with the Criminal Division stemmed from the application of the judicially created primary purpose test, articulated prior to the enactment of FISA. Most federal courts have adopted the primary purpose test in post-FISA cases. Under this test, most federal courts have held that foreign intelligence information gathered using FISA tools may be used in subsequent criminal proceedings so long as the primary purpose of the FISA surveillance or search was to obtain foreign intelligence information.", "These officials suggested that the application of the primary purpose test had not raised potential coordination problems between the FBI and the Criminal Division until the Aldrich Ames case. In 1994, Aldrich H. Ames, a Central Intelligence Agency official, was arrested on espionage charges of spying for the former Soviet Union and subsequently Russian intelligence. The FISA Court authorized an electronic surveillance of the computer and software within the Ames\u2019 residence. In addition, the Attorney General had authorized a warrantless physical search of the residence. At that time, FISA did not apply to physical searches. DOJ obtained a guilty plea from Ames who was sentenced to life in prison without parole.", "Criminal Division and FBI officials said that some in DOJ were concerned that, had the Ames case proceeded to trial, early and close coordination between the FBI and the Criminal Division might have raised a question as to whether the primary purpose of the surveillance and searches of Ames\u2019 residence had been a criminal investigation and not intelligence gathering. According to these officials, had this question been raised, a court might have ruled that information gathered using the FISA surveillance and/or the warrantless search be suppressed, thereby possibly jeopardizing Ames\u2019 prosecution. To date, this issue remains a matter of concern to the FBI and OIPR. OIPR officials indicated that while such a loss had not occurred because Ames had pleaded guilty, the fear of such a loss, nonetheless, was real."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal Division Believes OIPR and FBI Concerns Are Overly Cautious", "paragraphs": ["Criminal Division officials consider OIPR\u2019s and FBI\u2019s concern in the Ames case to be overly cautious.

As noted earlier, the primary purpose test was articulated prior to FISA. Division officials cited the opinion of the Attorney General\u2019s Review Team, which stated, in general, that FISA was not a codification of the primary purpose test and that FISA, itself, with all its attendant procedures and safeguards, was to be the measure by which such surveillance and searches were to be judged. While recognizing that the FBI\u2019s and OIPR\u2019s concerns were well-intentioned, Criminal Division officials said that as a result of these concerns the primary purpose test had been, in effect, interpreted by the FBI and OIPR to mean \u201cexclusive\u201d purpose.", "OIPR officials did not dispute this characterization of OIPR\u2019s historical concerns relative to primary purpose. However, these officials said that OIPR\u2019s current position regarding FBI and Criminal Division coordination was based on their understanding of the FISA Court\u2019s position on the primary purpose issue relating to such coordination. As a result, Division officials contend that they have been unable to provide advice that could have helped the FBI preserve and enhance the criminal prosecution option. For example, the Division could advise the FBI on ways to preserve its intelligence sources against compromise during a subsequent criminal trial.

If the intelligence source or method is deemed to be of great value, DOJ may have to decide whether protection of the source or method outweighs the seriousness of the crime and, accordingly, decline prosecution.", "As discussed previously, the primary legislation governing intelligence investigations of foreign powers and their agents in the United States is FISA. FISA also provides, however, that intelligence information implicating criminal violations may be shared with law enforcement. FISA further contains provisions to help maintain the secrecy of lawful counterintelligence sources and methods where such information is used in a criminal proceeding. Specifically, the act provided that where FISA information is used, introduced, or disclosed in a trial and the Attorney General asserts that disclosure of such information in an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States, the Attorney General may seek court review, without the presence of defense counsel, as to whether the surveillance or search was lawfully authorized and conducted. OIPR officials emphasized that while the act may provide for such a review, a judge may decide that the presence of defense counsel was necessary. Furthermore, officials asserted that, as a result, the presence of the defendant\u2019s attorney raised the risk that classified information reviewed during the proceeding could be subsequently revealed, despite these proceedings being subject to security procedures and protective orders.

Those problems stemmed from concerns FBI and OIPR officials had over the possible legal consequences, discussed above, should the FISA Court or another federal court rule that the primary purpose of the surveillance or search was for criminal investigation purposes rather than intelligence gathering. According to Criminal Division officials, coordination of foreign counterintelligence investigations dropped off significantly following the implementation of the 1995 procedures.

According to the official, after the FBI contacted OIPR about an investigation that needed to be coordinated with the Criminal Division, OIPR would determine whether and when such coordination should occur. Moreover, according to OIPR and FBI officials, when OIPR did permit coordination to take place, it participated in the meetings to help ensure that the contacts between the agents and the prosecutors did not jeopardize the primary intelligence purpose of the FISA\u2019s search and surveillance tools.

In January 2000, the Attorney General approved these procedures. These procedures, in part, required the FBI to provide the Criminal Division copies of certain types of foreign counterintelligence case summary memorandums involving U.S. persons. In addition, the procedures established a briefing protocol whereby, monthly, FBI National Security Division and Counterterrorism Division officials judgmentally were to select cases that they believed to be their most critical and brief the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General and the OIPR Counsel on them.

According to FBI officials, one criterion used to decide which cases to include in the critical-case briefings was whether a suspected felony violation was involved. The briefing protocol also established procedures for subsequent briefings of pertinent Criminal Division section chiefs and allowed for the Criminal Division to follow up with the FBI in those critical cases that the Division believed it needed more information.

For example, these officials said that the group had agreed to recommend that for clarity the reference to the phrase \u201csignificant federal crime\u201d in the 1995 procedures be changed to \u201cfederal felony,\u201d since they believed that the term \u201csignificant\u201d was too ambiguous and that the term \u201cfelony\u201d would be open to less interpretation as the particular elements comprising any particular felony violation are set out in statute.", "The working group officials told us that on issues on which the group could not reach consensus, the memorandum presented options, including an option advocated by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

Although the working group agreed that the Criminal Division should play an active role in foreign counterintelligence investigations employing FISA tools, it could not agree on the type of advice the Criminal Division should be allowed to provide. For example, OIPR officials indicated that they believed that the FISA Court held a restrictive view on the issue of notification and advice and that this view would affect the FISA Court\u2019s decisions to authorize a FISA surveillance or search. In contrast, a working group official said that the Criminal Division and Attorney General\u2019s Review Team held less restrictive views on the notification and advice issues. Criminal Division officials said that FISA did not prohibit contact between investigators and prosecutors. They said that it was inconceivable that the Division should be left in the dark in these cases, which they characterized as being of extraordinary importance. They argued that in these cases effective coordination was important to develop the best case possible to bring to prosecution.

Specifically, the issue revolved around the officials\u2019 different perceptions of how restrictively the FISA Court might interpret Criminal Division notification or any subsequent advice the Division may provide. Working group officials indicated that the pertinent parties continued to disagree on procedural issues, such as the type of the advice that the Criminal Division should be allowed to give. For example, a working group official suggested that numerous categories of the types of advice the Criminal Division can provide could be created. However, such distinctions made it difficult to determine what advice under which circumstances could be provided without risking the loss of FISA authority. According to working group officials, these differences were left unresolved in the December 2000 decision memorandum.", "In addition, the language indicating when the Criminal Division is to be notified remained an issue.

OIPR officials said that the coordination working- group members had agreed to the proposed change in language in order to make it clearer when the Criminal Division was to be notified. Although the working group members agreed, our interviews with some FBI officials, responsible for recommending that the Criminal Division be notified, indicated that they continued to use the significant threshold and that there were still disagreements as to its meaning. For example, FBI Counterterrorism Division officials told us that there still were disagreements over what constituted significant, and, therefore, differences of opinion as to when the Criminal Division should be notified.

They said that while it is relatively easy to discern from some FBI case summary memorandums whether criminal violations have been committed, in others it is not. OIPR officials also noted that FBI case summary memorandums were not always clear from the way they were written as to whether intelligence investigators had reason to believe that the criteria established by the Attorney General\u2019s 1995 guidelines for notification had been triggered. According to the Criminal Division and OIPR officials, the case summary memorandum format does not require agents to address whether or not a possible criminal violation was implicated or contain a specific section for doing so.", "Criminal Division officials also asserted that for their purposes the case summary memorandums were not always timely. Criminal Division officials indicated that there could be a significant time lag between the time when a significant criminal violation was revealed or investigative actions in a case occurred and when the memorandums were provided to the Division. They added that the timeliness of the memorandums could be a problem, because events can often overtake an investigation. For example, the officials said that should an investigative target be planning to go overseas, the Criminal Division would like to have information in a timely manner so that it can assess its prosecutorial equities against the risk that the target may flee the country. Division officials said that the Division only receives the initial memorandums within 90 days after the investigation had been opened and, subsequently, annually thereafter. Thus, the memorandums the Criminal Division receives may not be timely enough to protect its prosecutorial equities in a case.", "No matter what impediments remain, the question exists as to how and how often has the lack of timely coordination adversely affected DOJ prosecutions.

These interpretations resulted in less coordination. Additional procedures implemented in January 2000, requiring the sharing of certain FBI investigative case summaries, creating a core group, and instituting the core group critical-case briefing protocol helped to improve the situation by making the Criminal Division aware of more intelligence investigations with possible criminal implications. Subsequently, the core group and the critical-case briefing protocol were discontinued. However, in April 2001, a revised core group was created with a broader coordination role. It is too early to tell how effective a mechanism the new core group process will be for overseeing the requirement for notification.

Intelligence investigators fear that the FISA Court or another federal court could find that the Criminal Division\u2019s advice to the investigators altered the primary intelligence purpose of the FISA surveillance or search. Such a finding could lead to adverse consequences for the intelligence investigation or the criminal prosecution. As such cases involve highly sensitive national security issues, this is no small matter and caution is warranted. However, this longstanding issue has been reviewed at high-levels within DOJ on multiple occasions and Criminal Division officials believe the concerns, while well intentioned, are overly cautious given the procedural safeguards FISA provides. While the problems underlying the lack of coordination have been identified, the solutions to these problems are complex and involve risk. These solutions require balancing legitimate but competing national security and law enforcement interests. On the one hand, some risk and uncertainty will likely remain regarding how the FISA Court or another federal court might upon review interpret the primary purpose of a particular surveillance or search in light of notification of the Criminal Division and the subsequent advice it provided.  On the other hand, by not ensuring timely coordination on these cases, DOJ may place at risk the government\u2019s ability to bring the strongest possible criminal prosecution.

Thus, we made no change regarding this matter. Moreover, while the Department wrote that all relevant Department components agree that information sharing is usually appropriate for all felonies, we found and our report notes that the timing of the information sharing has been an issue.
