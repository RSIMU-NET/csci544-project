However, as GAO has reported, this federal financial assistance has not been guided by a clear risk-based strategic plan that fully applies risk management principles. This testimony discusses the extent to which DHS has taken steps to apply risk management principles to target federal funding for homeland security investments (1) in making grant allocations, (2) in funding transportation and port security enhancements, (3) in other DHS mission areas, and (4) at a strategic level across DHS. This testimony summarizes previous GAO work in these areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Risk management, a strategy for helping policymakers make decisions about assessing risk, allocating resources, and taking actions under conditions of uncertainty, has been endorsed by Congress, the President, and the Secretary of DHS as a way to strengthen the nation against possible terrorist attacks. DHS has used risk management principles to invest millions of dollars at the state and local level as part of its Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grants. For fiscal year 2006, DHS adopted a risk management approach to determine which UASI areas were eligible for funding. For the fiscal year 2007 grant process, DHS made substantial changes to its 2006 risk assessment model, simplifying its structure, reducing the number of variables considered, and incorporating the intelligence community's assessment of threats in candidate urban areas. The fiscal year 2007 model considers most areas of the country equally vulnerable to attack; its analysis focuses on the expected impact and consequences of successful attacks occurring in specific areas. DHS and the components of DHS responsible for transportation and port security have taken steps to apply risk management principles with varying degrees of progress. The Transportation Security Administration has not completed a methodology for assessing risk, and until the overall risk to the entire transportation sector is identified, it will be difficult to determine where and how to target limited resources to achieve the greatest security gains. The progress of each of DHS's three components responsible for port security varies according to organizational maturity and the complexity of its risk management task. The Coast Guard, created in 1915, was the most advanced in implementing a risk-based approach. Meanwhile, the Office for Domestic Preparedness (responsible for grants) and the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate (responsible for all sectors of the nation's critical infrastructure) were brought to or established with DHS in 2003 and lagged behind the Coast Guard in applying risk management to port security. Other DHS mission areas GAO has assessed include border security, immigration enforcement, immigration services, critical infrastructure protection, and science and technology; the extent to which a risk management approach has been implemented in each area varies. While DHS has called for using risk-based approaches to prioritize its resource investments, and for developing plans and allocating resources in a way that balances security and freedom, DHS has not comprehensively implemented a risk management approach--a difficult task. However, adoption of a comprehensive risk management framework is essential for DHS to assess risk by determining which elements of risk should be addressed in what ways within available resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) efforts to apply risk  management principles to its investments in homeland security. The  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, introduced our nation to threats  posed by enemies very different from those the nation has faced before\u2014 terrorists such as al Qaeda, willing and able to attack us in our cities and  homes. These new enemies used tactics designed to take advantage of our  nation\u2019s vulnerabilities, many of which reflect our relatively open society  and individual freedoms. The consequences of those attacks have been far  reaching and unprecedented. In addition, events such as the tsunami that  struck Indonesia and Sri Lanka, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reminded  our nation of the need to consider all potential risks\u2014natural, accidental,  and man-made. Assessing and responding to these threats, vulnerabilities,  and consequences are the fundamental elements of a risk management  approach. While simple to state in principal, applying risk management is  difficult in practice, in part because assessing threats is an uncertain  process due to limited historical data on which to assess the probability of  various types of risk. A risk management approach entails a continuous  process of mitigating risk through a series of actions, including setting  strategic goals and objectives, assessing risk, evaluating alternatives,  selecting initiatives to undertake, and implementing and monitoring those  initiatives.", "In the years since the 9/11 attacks, the nation has begun confronting the  nation\u2019s risks at the federal, state, local, and private levels. At home, the  Congress enacted legislation creating DHS and strengthening other  security measures in law enforcement and border and transportation  security. Since September 11, 2001, and the subsequent creation of DHS,  the federal government has provided the department with more than   $130 billion in budget authority to make investments in homeland security.  However, as we have reported, these investments have not been guided by  a clear risk-based strategic plan that applies risk management principles.", "As the Comptroller General and the Secretary of DHS have previously  testified, we cannot afford to protect everything against all threats\u2014 choices must be made about how best to allocate available resources  given the risks we face. While risk-based allocation decisionmaking is still  evolving, GAO has proposed a systematic risk management approach for  allocating resources that reflects an assessment of threats, vulnerabilities,  and the potential consequences of terrorist attacks and other risks. In  assessing the challenges faced by the nation for the 21st Century, the  Comptroller General has asked the question, \u201cWhat criteria should be used  to target federal funding for homeland security in order to maximize  results and mitigate risk within available resource levels?\u201d", "Today, I am here to discuss the extent to which DHS has taken steps to  apply risk management principles to target federal funding for homeland  security investments (1) in making homeland security grant allocations,  (2) in funding transportation security enhancements, (3) in funding port  security enhancements, (4) in other DHS mission areas, and (5) at a  strategic level across the department.", "My comments are based on GAO\u2019s historical body of work on risk  management principles, including:    Strategic Budgeting: Risk Management Principles Can Help DHS  Allocate Resources to Highest Priorities, GAO-05-357T, February  15, 2005; and    Homeland Security: A Risk Management Approach Can Guide  Preparedness Efforts, GAO-02-208T, October 31, 2001.", "In addition, my testimony draws on issued GAO reports and testimonies  addressing DHS\u2019s use of risk management to make homeland security  investments in specific mission areas, for example:    Homeland Security Grants: Observations on Process DHS Used to  Allocate Funds to Selected Urban Areas, GAO-07-381R, February 7,  2007;    Passenger Rail Security Enhanced Federal Leadership Needed to  Prioritize and Guide Security Efforts, GAO-07-225T, January 18,  2007; and    Risk Management: Further Refinements Needed to Assess Risks  and Prioritize Protective Measures at Ports and Other Critical  Infrastructure, GAO-06-91, December 15, 2005.", "This work was conducted according to generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Risk management has been widely practiced for years in areas such as  insurance, construction, and finance. By comparison, its application in  homeland security is relatively new\u2014much of it coming in the wake of the  terrorist attacks of September 11\u2014and it is a difficult task with little  precedent. The goals for using it in homeland security include informing  decisions on ways to reduce the likelihood that an adverse event will  occur, and mitigate the negative impact of and ensure a speedy recovery  from those that do. Achieving these goals involves making decisions about  what the nation\u2019s homeland security priorities should be\u2014for example,  what the relative security priorities should be among seaports, airports,  and rail\u2014and basing spending decisions on where scarce resources will  do the most good at narrowing gaps in security.", "Homeland security is a broad term with connotations resulting from the  September 11 attacks and other connotations resonating from the disaster  created by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Risk management has  applications for deliberate attacks of terror and natural disasters, such as  hurricanes and earthquakes. My statement today examines the approach  used by DHS to deal with both of these areas.", "Risk management has received widespread support as a tool that can help  inform decisions on how to protect the homeland. The Homeland Security  Act of 2002 requires DHS to carry out a comprehensive assessment of risk  related to vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure and key resources,  notably (1) the risk posed by different forms of terrorist attacks, (2) the  probability that different forms of an attack might succeed, and (3) the  feasibility and efficacy of countermeasures to deter or prevent such  attacks. Two congressionally chartered commissions\u2014the 9/11  Commission and the Gilmore Commission\u2014support the use of data on  risks to help inform resource allocation decisions. The President has  issued policies directing the heads of seven major departments or agencies  to assess risks. These policies have made DHS responsible for the national  effort at protecting critical infrastructure and they call on DHS to establish  uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and methodologies for  integrating risk management within and across federal departments and  agencies. In addition, risk management is one of the target capabilities  DHS has established to measure state and local emergency preparedness  and make homeland security investments in achieving the National  Preparedness Goal. DHS's \u201cTarget Capabilities List\u201d identifies risk  management as one of four common capabilities for incident  management\u2014prevention, protection, response and recovery\u2014for major  events.", "While there is widespread support for the use of risk management in  homeland security programs, doing so is a complex task that has few  precedents and until recently, little specific guidance. To provide a basis  for examining efforts at carrying out risk management, we developed a  framework for risk management based on best practices and other  criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1) setting strategic  goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2) assessing the risks;  (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks; (4) selecting the  appropriate alternatives; and (5) implementing the alternatives and  monitoring the progress made and the results achieved (see figure 1). We  used this framework to examine many of the programs that I discuss later  in this statement. The application of risk management to homeland  security is relatively new and the framework will likely evolve as  processes mature and lessons are learned.", "Guidance is also important when agencies integrate a concern for risk into  the annual cycle of program and budget review. Doing so within an agency  is a difficult task in that traditional ways of reviewing budgets and  programs often rely on program data that call for continuing or expanding  a program without examining the relative risks that are addressed with the  funds that are expended. Shifting organizations toward this nexus of using  risk-based data as part of annual management review cycles will take time,  attention, and leadership. Even in agencies where much progress has been  made in developing risk management techniques, integrating disparate  systems such as risk management with budget and program management  remains a long-term challenge.", "Risk management approaches have been applied to DHS\u2019s investments in  state and local homeland security through the Homeland Security Grant  Program (HSGP). The HSGP includes the Urban Area Security Initiative  (UASI), the State Homeland Security Program, Law Enforcement  Terrorism Prevention Program, and Citizen Corps Program. In fiscal year  2007, DHS has been appropriated funds to provide over $1.6 billion in  federal funding to states, localities, and territories through the HSGP to  prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism or  other catastrophic events.", "DHS components also use risk management principles to varying degrees  to allocate funding to implement their homeland security missions.

Under the statutorily mandated FEMA  reorganization that is to take effect by March 31, 2007, FEMA is to  include the Office of Grants and Training, which is responsible for  allocating homeland security grants to states and localities,  including the UASI and State Homeland Security grants. In addition,  FEMA will be the responsible for implementing the National  Preparedness Goal and other programs that are designed to  enhance the nation\u2019s prevention, protection, response and recovery  capabilities.", "Transportation Security: The Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) is responsible for security for all modes of  transportation and, while TSA\u2019s efforts have historically focused on  aviation security due to the events of 9/11, increasing attention has  been paid to surface transportation security as a result of more  recent international terrorist attacks.", "Maritime security: The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the  lead federal agency for maritime homeland security.

For fiscal years 2006 and  2007, DHS has used risk assessments to identify urban areas that faced the  greatest potential risk, and were therefore eligible to apply for the UASI  grant, and based the amount of awards to all eligible areas primarily on the  outcomes of the risk assessment and a new effectiveness assessment.  Starting in fiscal year 2006, DHS made several changes to the grant  allocation process, including modifying its risk assessment methodology,  and introducing an assessment of the anticipated effectiveness of  investments. DHS combined the outcomes of these two assessments to  make funding decisions (see fig. 2.)", "DHS used different risk assessment methodologies for the 2006 and 2007  UASI grant process, reflecting the evolving nature of its risk assessment  approach.

DHS assessed  risk from two perspectives, based on specific locations (asset-based) and  based on areas of the country (geographic risk). To estimate asset risk,  DHS assessed the intent and capabilities of an adversary to successfully  attack an asset type, such as a chemical plant, dam, or commercial airport,  using different attack scenarios (e.g., nuclear explosion or vehicle-borne  improvised explosive device). DHS assessed geographic risk by  approximating the threat, vulnerability, and consequences considering  general geographic characteristics\u2014mostly independent of the area\u2019s  assets\u2014using counts of data, such as reports of suspicious incidents, the  number of visitors from countries of interest, and population. In DHS\u2019s  view, the estimates of asset-based risk and geographic risk are  complementary and provided a \u201cmicro- and macro-\u201d perspective of risk,  respectively.", "Because of data limitations and the inherent uncertainties in risk  assessment, DHS officials had to apply policy and analytic judgments. For  example, DHS made judgments about how to weight asset and geographic  risk, how to identify the urban boundaries it used to estimate risk, and  what data were sufficient to use in its risk estimates. DHS used this risk  assessment to identify the eligibility cut point, which determined the  number of urban areas that could apply for UASI funding in fiscal year  2006 and defined high-risk urban areas. According to DHS officials, the  DHS Secretary selected a point that resulted in 35 eligible urban areas,  which accounted for 85 percent of total related risk.", "DHS also implemented a competitive process to evaluate the anticipated  effectiveness of proposed homeland security investments by using peer  reviewers--homeland security professionals from fields such as law  enforcement and fire service. The peer reviewers scored the investments  using criteria, such as regionalization, sustainability, and impact. For fiscal  year 2006, DHS required urban areas to submit investment justifications as  part of their grant application to assess the anticipated effectiveness of the  various risk mitigation investments urban areas proposed. Reviewers on  each panel assigned scores for six investment justifications, which were  averaged to determine a final effectiveness score for each urban area. The  criteria reviewers used to score the investment justifications included:   relevance to the interim National Preparedness Goal,  relevance to state and local homeland security plans,     anticipated impact,     sustainability, and    regionalism.", "The risk and effectiveness scores did not automatically translate into  funding amounts, but rather, the scores were used in conjunction with  final decisions on allocation amounts made by the Secretary of Homeland  Security. To prioritize the allocation of funds DHS used the combined  scores to assign eligible urban areas into four categories: Category I\u2014 higher risk, higher effectiveness; Category II\u2014higher risk, lower  effectiveness; Category III\u2014lower risk, higher effectiveness; and Category  IV\u2014lower risk, lower effectiveness. DHS officials gave Category I the  highest funding priority and Category IV the lowest funding priority. For  fiscal year 2006, once the amounts for each category were decided, DHS  used a formula to determine the grant award for each urban area, giving  the risk score a weight of 2/3 and the effectiveness score a weight of 1/3.  The final funding decision resulted in 70 percent of UASI funding going to  \u201chigher risk\u201d candidates in Categories I and II. DHS extended eligibility to  an additional 11 \u201csustainment\u201d urban areas that participated in the  program in fiscal year 2005, but did not make the eligibility threshold in  the 2006 risk assessment process.", "One concern we identified during our review was that DHS had limited  knowledge of how changes to its risk assessment methods, such as adding  asset types and using additional or different data sources, affected its risk  estimates. As a result, DHS had a limited understanding of the effects of  the judgments made in estimating risk that influenced eligibility and  allocation outcomes in fiscal year 2006. DHS leadership could make more  informed policy decisions if provided with alternative risk estimates and  funding allocations resulting from analyses of varying data, judgments, and  assumptions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) offers  guidelines for treatment of uncertainty in a number of applications,  including the analysis of government investments and programs. These  guidelines call for the use of sensitivity analysis to gauge what effects key  sources of uncertainty have on outcomes. According to OMB, assumptions  should be varied and outcomes recomputed to determine how sensitive  analytical results are to such changes. By applying these guidelines  decisionmakers are better informed about how sensitive outcomes are to  key sources of uncertainty. While DHS has indicated that it has performed  some analyses, at this date it has not provided us with details on the extent  of these analyses, how they were used, or how much they cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Year 2007 Process", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2007 process, as described by DHS officials, represents a  continuing evolution in DHS's approach to its risk methodology for grant  allocation. DHS officials said they will to continue to use the risk and  effectiveness assessments to inform final funding decisions. For fiscal year  2007, DHS officials described changes that simplified the risk  methodology, integrated the separate analyses for asset-based and  geographic-based risk, and included more sensitivity analysis in  determining what the final results of its risk analysis should be. DHS  officials said the primary goal was to make the process more transparent  and more easily understood, focusing on key variables and incorporating  comments from a variety of stakeholders regarding the fiscal year 2006  process. For the 2007 grant cycle, DHS no longer estimated asset-based  and geographic risk separately, considered most areas of the country  equally vulnerable to a terrorist attack, given freedom of movement within  the nation, and focused on the seriousness of the consequences of a  successful terrorist attack.  As shown in figure 3, the maximum risk score  possible for a given area was 100. Threat to people and places accounted  for a maximum 20 points, and vulnerability and consequences for a  maximum 80 points. In the fiscal year 2007 process the intelligence  community for the first time assessed threat information for multiple years  (generally, from September 11, 2001, forward) for all candidate urban  areas and gave the Office of Grants and Training a list that grouped these  areas into one of four tiers. Tier I included those at highest threat, relative  to the other areas, and tier IV included those at lowest threat relative to  the others.", "According to DHS officials, the greatest concern was the impact of an  attack on people, including the economic and health impacts of an attack.  Also of concern was the quantity and nature of nationally critical  infrastructure within each of the 168 urban areas assessed. In assessing  threat, vulnerability and consequences, DHS specifically wanted to  capture key land and sea points of entry into the United States, and the  location of defense industrial base facilities and nationally critical  infrastructure facilities. The approximately 2,100 critical infrastructure  assets included in the risk assessment were selected on the basis of  analysis by DHS infrastructure protection analysts, sector specific  agencies, and the states. These assets included some 129 defense  industrial base assets. Assets were grouped into two tiers: (1) those that if  attacked could cause major national or regional impacts similar to those  from Hurricane Katrina or 9/11, and (2) highly consequential assets with  potential national or regional impacts if attacked. Tier II included about  660 assets identified by state partners and validated by sector specific  agencies. On the basis of Office of Infrastructure Protection analysis, Tier I  assets were weighted using an average value three times as great as Tier II  assets.", "Throughout this process, a number of policy judgments were necessary,  including what variables to include in the assessment, the points to be  assigned to each major variable (e.g., threat, the population index,  economic index, national infrastructure index, and the national security  index) with an eye toward how these judgments affected outcomes. DHS  officials noted that such judgments were the subject of extensive  discussions, including among high-level officials. In addition, DHS officials  said that they conducted more sensitivity analyses than was possible in the  fiscal year 2006 process. DHS officials noted that because expert judgment  was applied to the data and fewer variables were used in the current  model, it was possible to track the effect of different assumptions and  values on the ranking of individual urban areas. However, we have limited  understanding of the sensitivity analyses that DHS conducted for the fiscal  year 2006 and 2007 risk assessments because DHS has not provided us  documentation on what analyses were conducted, how they were  conducted, how they were used, and how they affected the final risk  assessment scores and relative rankings.", "Finally, DHS officials said that the effectiveness assessment process will  be consistent with last year's process, although enhancements will be  made based on feedback received; however, no final decision has been  made on the weights to be given to risk and effectiveness for the allocation  of the fiscal year 2007 grants. One modification to the effectiveness  assessment will provide urban areas the opportunity to include  investments that involve multiple regions. This can potentially earn an  extra 5 percent to 8 percent on their final score. In addition, DHS may  convene separate peer review panels to assess proposed investments for  these multi-regional investments. DHS has also offered applicants a mid- year review where applicants can submit their draft applications to DHS to  obtain comments, guidance, or address questions that the grant may pose  (such as little or unclear information on the anticipated impact of the  investment on preparedness). As in the 2006 process, DHS officials have  said that they cannot assess how effective these investments, once made,  are in mitigating risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Use of a Risk Management Approach for Transportation Security Investments Can Be Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["Our past work examining TSA found that this DHS component has  undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen transportation security,  particularly in aviation, and their efforts should be commended.

For example, we found  that TSA has not always conducted needed assessments of threats,  vulnerabilities, and criticality in allocating its resources, and has not fully  assessed alternatives that could be pursued to achieve efficiencies and  potentially enhance security.

TSA had conducted limited  vulnerability assessments at selected general aviation airports  based on specific security concerns or requests by airport officials.  TSA reported its intentions to implement a risk management  approach to better assess threats and vulnerabilities of general  aviation aircraft and airports and, as part of this approach, was  developing an outline vulnerability self-assessment tool to be  completed by individual airport managers. However, we noted  limitations to the use of the self-assessment tool, and TSA had not  yet developed a plan with specific milestones to implement the  assessment, thereby making it difficult to monitor the progress of  its efforts.", "Commercial Airport Access Control and Perimeter Security: In  June 2004, we reported that TSA had not yet developed a plan to  prioritize expenditures to ensure that funds provided have the  greatest impact in improving the security of the commercial airport  system. Through funding of a limited number of security  enhancements, TSA had helped to improve perimeter and access  control security at some airports. However, we concluded that,  without a plan to consider airports\u2019 security needs systematically,  TSA could not ensure that the most critical security needs of the  commercial airport system were identified and addressed in a  priority order.

While TSA has  begun to establish a methodology for determining how to analyze  and characterize the risks identified, the agency has not completed  a comprehensive risk assessment of the U.S. passenger rail system.  Until TSA completes this effort, the agency will be limited in its  ability to prioritize passenger rail assets and help guide security  investment decisions about protecting them.

The Coast Guard, which was furthest along, is the  component of longest standing, being created in 1915, while IAIP had  came into being with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security  in 2003.

Those DHS  components that had a relatively robust methodology in place for  assessing risks at ports were the Coast Guard and, what was at the time  the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP), who awarded grants for port  security projects. IAIP was still developing its methodology and had  several setbacks in completing the task. We found that all three  components had much left to do. In particular, each component was  limited in its ability to compare and prioritize risks. The Coast Guard and  ODP were able to do so within a port but not between ports, and at that  time, IAIP did not demonstrate that it could compare and prioritize risks  either within or between all infrastructure sectors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Progress Reflects Historical Focus on Risk Management Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard was furthest along among the three components,  reflecting in part where it stood in relationship to all three of these factors.  It had been at the task the longest of the three components, having begun  work on implementing risk management in its port security efforts  immediately after the September 11 attacks. The Coast Guard  implemented a port security risk assessment tool in November 2001, and  by August 2002 (prior to the creation of DHS and the port security  framework called for under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of  2002), it had begun security assessments at major U.S. ports. To a degree,  these early efforts were learning experiences that required changes, but  the Coast Guard was able to build on its early start. The Coast Guard also  had the greatest organizational stability of the three components. It moved  into DHS as an already established entity with an organizational culture  spanning decades, and its organization and mission were not significantly  altered by moving into DHS. Finally, with regard to the scope of its risk  management activities, the Coast Guard\u2019s work is specific to port  locations, where it has direct and primary responsibility for carrying out  security responsibilities. With its focus on ports, the Coast Guard does not  have to address a number of the critical infrastructure sectors laid out in  national preparedness policy, such as banking and finance, information  and technology, and public health. Even so, the Coast Guard\u2019s experience  to date shows that as the scope of activity widens, even within a single  sector, complexities develop. For example, the Coast Guard has  prioritized risks within individual ports, and it has actions under way to  assess risks across ports, but using this information to strategically inform  the annual program review and budget process will require further  attention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ODP\u2019s Progress in Risk Management Reflected Its More Recent Initiation of Efforts and Organizational Role", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, ODP had made somewhat less progress than the  Coast Guard. Relative to the Coast Guard\u2019s progress, its progress reflected  a later start, an organization with much less institutional maturity, and a  different role from the Coast Guard\u2019s in that ODP provided grant money  rather than directly setting security policy. ODP was transferred from the  Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.  While ODP\u2019s early grant approval efforts had some risk management  features in place, its main strides in risk management had come in the  procedures recently adopted for the fiscal year 2005 grants. In moving  toward risk management, ODP had found ways to allow information from  the Coast Guard and IAIP to inform its decision making. This is an  encouraging and important sign, because the success of risk management  efforts depends in part on the ability of agencies with security  responsibilities to share and use each others\u2019 data and expertise. Although  both the Coast Guard and the port security grant program administered by  ODP had port security as their focus, ODP\u2019s more limited scope of  responsibility also had an effect on its risk management efforts. First,  because ODP\u2019s role was to award grants that support federal priorities in  port security, its progress in risk management depended to a degree on the  progress made by other federal agencies in determining what their own  port security performance measures should be. Second, ODP\u2019s funding  priorities were subject to criteria other than risk, as the fiscal year 2004  grant awards demonstrated. That year, after creating an initial list of  awardees based in part on risk, and without regard to ability to pay, ODP  extensively revised the list and awarded grants to entities considered to  have fewer funding alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of IAIP Progress in Risk Management Reflects In Part Its Broader Focus", "paragraphs": ["Of the three components, IAIP was the least far along in its risk  management efforts. All three factors have had an effect on this progress:  IAIP had been at its task for a relatively short time; it was a new  component; and relative to the Coast Guard and ODP, the scope of its  efforts was much broader and more difficult. IAIP was created under the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, giving the directorate little time to acquire  institutional maturity. In addition to taking on difficult tasks like risk  management, IAIP faced other institutional challenges, such as  establishing new management systems, developing sound human capital  practices, and integrating its efforts with those of the rest of DHS. Further,  the scope of its risk management activities extended well beyond the port- focused activities of the Coast Guard or ODP. (At the time, IAIP was  responsible for conducting risk assessments for every critical  infrastructure segment in the nation.) As demonstrated by the experience  of its Risk Analysis and Management for Critical Asset Protection  (RAMCAP) methodology for comparing risk across sectors, IAIP remained  challenged in meeting that responsibility. Its lack of progress reflected the  same lesson that emerges from the Coast Guard\u2019s experience in trying to  expand the focus of risk assessments beyond a single port: the complexity  of risk management appears to grow exponentially as the focus expands  beyond a single location or single type of infrastructure. This complexity  may help explain IAIP\u2019s lack of progress, but IAIP was unable at that time  to provide adequate assurance to Congress or the country that the federal  government was in a position to effectively manage risk in national  security efforts. Steps have been small; by far, the biggest work is still yet  to come."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Use of Risk Management in Making Investments in Other Mission Areas Varies by Degree and Application", "paragraphs": ["We have assessed DHS\u2019s risk management efforts across a number of  other mission areas in the 4 years since the department was established-- including border security, immigration enforcement, immigration services,  critical infrastructure protection, and science and technology\u2014and found  varying degrees of consideration and application of risk management  principles in DHS\u2019s investments in homeland security.", "Border Security: In 2006, as part of our work on border security, we  issued a report assessing how DHS manages the risks of the Visa Waiver  Program. The Visa Waiver Program enables citizens of 27 countries to  travel to the United States for tourism or business for 90 days or less  without obtaining a visa. While there are benefits to the program in terms  of facilitating travel for millions of people, inherent risks include barriers  to border inspectors conducting in-depth interviews of travelers and the  use of stolen passports from visa waiver countries. DHS had taken some  action to mitigate the program\u2019s risks. For example, it had established a  unit to conduct biennial reviews of the Visa Waiver Program as mandated  by Congress in 2002. Yet stakeholders were not consulted during portions  of the process, preparation for in-country site visits was not consistent,  and the final reports were untimely. Further, the department had not  established time frames and operating procedures regarding timely stolen  passport reporting\u2014a program requirement since 2002. DHS also had not  issued clear reporting guidelines to the program\u2019s participating countries  about reporting lost and stolen passport data.", "Immigration Enforcement: In the area of immigration enforcement, we  reported in 2006 that, while ICE had taken some initial steps to introduce  principles of risk management into its operations, it had not conducted a  comprehensive risk assessment of the customs and immigration systems  to determine the greatest risks for exploitation, nor analyzed all relevant  data to inform the evaluation of alternatives and allow officials to make  risk-based resource allocation decisions. We recommended that ICE  conduct comprehensive risk assessments, including consideration of  threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, of the customs and immigration  systems to identify the types of violations with the highest probability of  occurrence and most significant consequences in order to guide resource  allocation.", "Immigration Services: In 2006, we reported that USCIS had not yet  developed a comprehensive risk management approach to identify the  types of immigration benefits that are most vulnerable to fraud and the  consequences of their exploitation, monitored ongoing efforts to  determine needed policy and procedural changes to reduce immigration  benefit fraud, or sanctioned those who commit immigration benefit fraud  to help deter them from committing future fraudulent acts. We  recommended that USCIS implement additional internal controls and best  practices to strengthen its fraud control environment and that DHS  develop a strategy for implementing a sanctions program.", "Critical Infrastructure: As we reported in October 2006, DHS issued a  National Infrastructure Protection Plan in June 2006 to serve as a road  map for how DHS and other relevant stakeholders should use risk  management principles to prioritize protection activities within and across  sectors in an integrated, coordinated fashion. However, we concluded  that DHS guidance does not require the plans to address how the sectors  are actually assessing risk and protecting their most critical assets. In  September 2006, we reported that DHS had initiated efforts to address its  responsibilities for enhancing the cybersecurity of information systems  that are a part of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure but had not fully  addressed all 13 of its key responsibilities. For example, while DHS had  begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility to develop an  integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, these efforts were not  complete or comprehensive. Many of DHS\u2019s efforts lacked time frames for  completion and the relationships among its various initiatives were not  evident. We recommended that DHS (1) conduct threat and vulnerability  assessments, (2) develop a strategic analysis and warning capability for  identifying potential cyber attacks, (3) protect infrastructure control  systems, (4) enhance public/private information sharing, and (5) facilitate  recovery planning, including recovery of the Internet in case of a major  disruption.", "Science and Technology: In the area of science and technology, we  reported in 2004 that DHS had not yet completed a strategic plan to  identify priorities, goals, objectives, and policies for the research and  development (R&D) of homeland security technologies. We  recommended that DHS complete a strategic R&D plan and ensure that  this plan is integrated with homeland security R&D efforts of other federal  agencies; complete strategic plans for transportation security research;  and develop programs and conduct risks assessments for all modes of  transportation to guide research and development investment decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Provided Guidance for a Coordinated Risk Management Approach and More Work Remains to be done in Carrying Out Such an Approach", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Has Identified the Need for a Risk-based Approach, but Efforts to Develop Guidance to Coordinate Such an Approach Have Been Hampered by Organizational Restructuring", "paragraphs": ["The need for and difficulties associated with creating a coordinated,  coherent risk management approach to the nation\u2019s homeland security  have been widely acknowledged since the events of September 11, 2001,  and the creation of DHS. Yet, this general acknowledgment has not been  accompanied by the guidance necessary to make consistent use of risk  management across DHS. The National Strategy for Homeland Security  and DHS\u2019s strategic plan called for the use of risk-based decisions to  prioritize DHS\u2019s resource investments regarding homeland security related  programs. Although the Homeland Security Act and subsequent strategies  call for the use of risk management to protect the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure and key resources, they did not define how this was to be  accomplished. In addition, Homeland Security Presidential Directive   7 (HSPD-7) directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) to establish uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and  methodologies integrating federal infrastructure protection and risk  management activities. However, no further direction or guidance as to the  course of action has been forthcoming. As our 2006 report on risk  management at ports and other critical infrastructure concluded, as DHS\u2019s  individual components begin to mature in their risk management efforts,  the need for consistency and coherence becomes even greater. Without it,  the prospects increase for efforts to fragment, clash, and work at cross  purposes.", "Efforts to establish guidance to coordinate a risk-based approach across  DHS components has been hampered by organizational restructuring. At  the time we conducted our 2005 review of risk management for ports and  other critical infrastructure, risk management was the responsibility of the  Infrastructure Protection Office. The Infrastructure Protection Office\u2019s  risk management efforts were focused mainly on assessing and reducing  the vulnerabilities that exist in and around specific facilities or assets. But  DHS\u2019s responsibility is broader than this: besides assessing and reducing  vulnerabilities at specific facilities, it also includes preventing attacks from  occurring (and in the process protecting people and critical infrastructure)  and responding to and recovering from natural disasters and acts of  terrorism. This initial focus on vulnerabilities at specific assets had the  potential of limiting DHS\u2019s ability to achieve the broader goal of using risk- based data as a tool to inform management decisions on all aspects of its  missions.", "In July 2005, the Secretary of DHS announced the department\u2019s Second  Stage Review and reorganization, which had moved risk management to a  new Preparedness Directorate. At the time of our work, we determined it  was unclear how such a move could affect DHS\u2019s ability to carry out its  risk management responsibilities, and were concerned that the new focus  on preparedness could result in an emphasis that may go too far the other  way\u2014that is an emphasis on protection of specific assets and response  and recovery at the expense of prevention. To comply with certain  requirements in the fiscal year 2007 DHS appropriation act, particularly  with regard to FEMA, DHS is reorganizing, with some of the  responsibilities of the Preparedness Directorate moving to FEMA. The  Undersecretary for Preparedness is to become the Undersecretary for  National Protection and Programs, retaining responsibility for risk  management and analysis. The new structure is to take effect by March 31,  2007. As we noted in our past work, the office responsible for risk  management should have a broad perspective across the department\u2019s  entire mission as well as the necessary authority to hold DHS component  agencies responsible for carrying out risk management activities in a  coordinated and consistent manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Over the Long-Term, More Work Remains to Be Done in Carrying Out a Risk- Based Approach", "paragraphs": ["DHS has centered much attention on implementing risk management, but  much more work remains to be done than has been accomplished so far.

The challenges that  remain, however, are substantial and will take time, leadership, and  attention to resolve. This is particularly true when risk management is  viewed strategically\u2014that is with a view that goes beyond what assessing  the risks are and integrating a consideration for risk into annual budget  and program review cycles. In this way, DHS faces challenges in the  following areas:    Developing a way to compare and set priorities across different  types of key infrastructure the Department is responsible for  overseeing. While DHS components, such as TSA and the Coast  Guard, have made progress in applying risk management to airports  and seaports, challenges remain in making comparisons across  assets and infrastructure within the transportation sector and in  setting relative priorities. DHS has been challenged in establishing  uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and methodologies for  integrating federal infrastructure protection within the department,  including metrics and criteria. While coordination occurs among  the various components in the department, our work shows that  components apply risk management in ways that are neither  consistent nor comparable. The degree to which DHS uses common  metrics, criteria, and approaches remains a management challenge.", "Coordinating efforts across the federal government. DHS plays a  central role in guiding risk management activities across the federal  government and much more work remains in offering policies,  guidelines, and methodologies, including metrics and criteria, for  the array of programs covered by Homeland Security Presidential  Directives. Seven major departments or agencies are covered by  the Directives, including the Departments of Defense, Energy, and  Agriculture. DHS is developing a methodology to do this, but in the  absence of this, these departments will use approaches that may  not be compatible or may not be able to inform one another. Until  such a methodology is in place, it will be impossible for DHS to  make a determination of relative risks that could inform spending  decisions.", "Integrating a concern for risk into other management systems, such  as the annual cycle of budget and program review. A key aim of risk  management is to inform decisions on setting relative priorities and  on spending and ultimately to improve the quality of decisions  made. Doing so, however, is difficult in that the traditional ways of  reviewing budgets and programs often rely on program data that  call for continuing or expanding a program without examining the  relative risks that are addressed. Additionally, DHS is challenged  because it must depend on others to follow risk management  principles at other federal departments or agencies that have also  been called on to implement risk management.", "Translating the concept of risk management into applications that are  consistent and useful represents a major challenge for DHS as it moves  from an organization that is in its early stages to one that is more  organizationally mature. The Secretary of DHS has said that operations  and budgets of its agencies will be reviewed through the prism of risk, but  doing this is made difficult by the level of guidance and coordination that  has been provided so far. Failure to address the strategic challenges in risk  management could have serious consequences for homeland security.

But the basic  goal across DHS homeland security programs is similar\u2014to identify,  prevent where possible, and protect the nation from risks of all types to  people, property, and the economy. DHS has taken the first step in  confronting this challenge by acknowledging the need for such an  approach. It has taken further steps by incorporating risk management  principles to at least some degree into making homeland security grant  allocations, funding transportation and port security enhancements, and  targeting federal funding across other DHS mission areas. However, much  work remains to be done to implement a comprehensive risk management  approach across DHS. We do not underestimate the challenge involved.  Nevertheless, such a comprehensive implementation would place DHS in a  better position to identify the threats that can and should be offset by  limited resources. So that policymakers can make informed spending  decisions, it is essential that policymakers fully understand the the  assumptions and policy judgments that inform the risk analyses used for  these decisions. A more comprehensive approach to risk management  would also help the DHS components responsible for emergency  preparedness, transportation, port security, and other mission areas to  better protect our nation\u2019s assets. Without further attempts to address this  incomplete work, DHS cannot assure the Congress or the public that  federal funding is targeting the most critical risks.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared  statement.
