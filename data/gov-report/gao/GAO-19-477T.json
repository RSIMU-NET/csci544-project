DHS also has certain responsibilities for strengthening the security of the visa process. In 2017, the President issued executive actions directing agencies to improve visa screening and vetting, and establishing nationality-based visa entry restrictions, which the Supreme Court upheld in June 2018.", "This statement addresses (1) data and information on NIV adjudications and (2) CBP programs aimed at preventing high-risk travelers from boarding U.S.-bound flights.

NIVs are issued to foreign nationals, such as tourists, business visitors, and students, seeking temporary admission into the United States. The number of adjudications peaked at about 13.4 million in fiscal year 2016, and decreased by about 880,000 adjudications in fiscal year 2017. State refused about 18 percent of adjudicated applications during this time period, of which more than 90 percent were because the applicant did not qualify for the visa sought and 0.05 percent were due to terrorism and security-related concerns. In 2017, two executive orders and a proclamation issued by the President required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for nationals of certain listed countries of concern. GAO's analysis indicates that, out of the nearly 2.8 million NIV applications refused in fiscal year 2017, 1,338 applications were refused specifically due to visa entry restrictions implemented per the executive actions.", "In January 2017, GAO reported that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates predeparture programs to help identify and interdict high-risk travelers before they board U.S.- bound flights. CBP officers inspect all U.S.-bound travelers on those flights that are precleared at the 15 Preclearance locations at foreign airports\u2014which serve as U.S. ports of entry\u2014and, if deemed inadmissible, a traveler will not be permitted to board the aircraft. CBP also operates nine Immigration Advisory Program and two Joint Security Program locations, as well as three Regional Carrier Liaison Groups, through which CBP may recommend that air carriers not permit identified high-risk travelers to board U.S.-bound flights. CBP data showed that it identified and interdicted over 22,000 high-risk air travelers through these programs in fiscal year 2015 (the most recent data available at the time of GAO's report). While CBP tracked some data, such as the number of travelers deemed inadmissible, it had not fully evaluated the overall effectiveness of these programs. GAO recommended that CBP develop a system of performance measures and baselines to better position CBP to assess program performance. As of December 2018, CBP set preliminary performance targets for fiscal year 2019, and plans to set targets for future fiscal years by October 31, 2019. GAO will continue to review CBP's actions to address this recommendation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously recommended that CBP evaluate the effectiveness of its predeparture programs.

Foreign  nationals who wish to come to the United States on a temporary basis  must generally obtain a NIV authorizing their travel to the United States.  In particular, from fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the Department of  State (State) issued more than 52 million visas for business travel,  pleasure, or for foreign student and cultural exchange programs, among  other things.", "Previous attempted and successful terrorist attacks against the United  States have raised questions about the security of the U.S. government\u2019s  screening and vetting processes for NIVs. For example, the December  2015 shootings in San Bernardino, California, led to concerns about NIV  screening and vetting processes because one of the attackers was  admitted into the United States under a NIV. Beginning in calendar year  2017, the President issued executive actions aimed at improving the  screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa  issuance process, including the imposition of visa entry restrictions for  certain categories of foreign nationals from designated countries.  Specifically, the President issued two executive orders and a presidential  proclamation that required, among other actions, visa entry restrictions for  nationals of certain countries of concern, a review of information needed  for visa adjudication, and changes to visa (including NIV) screening and  vetting protocols and procedures.", "State is responsible for visa adjudication and issuance for foreign  nationals and is responsible for managing the consular officer corps and  its functions at over 220 visa-issuing posts overseas. The process for  determining who will be issued or refused a visa contains several steps,  including completing an online visa application and appearing for an in- person interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, as shown in figure 1.", "The various security checks NIV applicants undergo generally screen the  applicant\u2019s information (biographic and biometric) against multiple U.S.  government databases to identify potential matches with records of  individuals who are known threats to the United States or other  derogatory information that could make the applicant ineligible. In  addition, biometric checks include running an applicant\u2019s fingerprints and  full-face photograph against multiple government systems. Further, at  some locations overseas, Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Visa  Security Program uses the Pre-Adjudicated Threat Recognition and  Intelligence Operations Team check to identify national security, public  safety, and other eligibility concerns related to visa applicants. Prior to  adjudicating the visa application, consular officers must review all such  security check results. DHS also vets individuals with NIVs on a  recurrent basis, which has resulted in State revoking visas after they have  been issued when information was later discovered that rendered the  individual inadmissible to the United States or otherwise ineligible for the  visa.", "In addition, DHS seeks to identify and interdict travelers who are potential  security threats to the United States, such as foreign fighters and  potential terrorists, human traffickers, drug smugglers, and otherwise  inadmissible persons, at the earliest possible point in the travel lifecycle.  In particular, DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is tasked  with, among other duties, processing all travelers on U.S.-bound flights  and inspecting all people entering or applying for admission to the United  States. CBP\u2019s National Targeting Center (NTC) conducts traveler data  matching, which assesses whether travelers are high-risk by matching  their information against U.S. government databases and lists, and rules- based targeting, which enables CBP to identify unknown high-risk  individuals. CBP operates multiple predeparture programs that use the  results of NTC\u2019s analyses to help identify and interdict high-risk travelers  before they board U.S.-bound flights.", "My testimony discusses: (1) data and information on NIV adjudications  and (2) CBP air predeparture programs. This testimony is based on our  prior reports, in particular, those published in January 2017 and August  2018.

Among other things, EO-2 suspended entry of certain foreign  nationals for a 90-day period, subject to exceptions and waivers. In  September 2017, as a result of the reviews undertaken pursuant to EO-2,  the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing Vetting  Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United  States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats (Proclamation), which  imposes certain conditional restrictions and limitations on the entry of  nationals of eight countries\u2014Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia,  Syria, Venezuela and Yemen\u2014into the United States for an indefinite  period.

Traveler data  matching focuses on identifying known high-risk individuals\u2014that is,  individuals who may be inadmissible to the United States under U.S.  immigration law or who may otherwise pose a threat to homeland or  national security. CBP\u2019s primary tool for vetting and targeting travelers  is the Automated Targeting System (ATS), which is a computer-based  enforcement and support system that compares traveler information  against intelligence and law enforcement data to identify high-risk  travelers. Traveler data matching occurs throughout the travel process  and, upon a positive or possible match, CBP officers can select these  individuals for further vetting, interviewing, and inspection.", "CBP\u2019s rules-based targeting efforts seek to identify unknown high-risk  travelers\u2014that is, travelers for whom U.S. government entities do not  have available derogatory information directly linking them to terrorist  activities or any other actions that would make them potentially  inadmissible to the United States but who may present a threat and  thus warrant additional scrutiny. CBP identifies unknown high-risk  individuals by comparing their information against a set of targeting  rules based on intelligence, law enforcement, and other information.  NTC officials stated that these rules have identified potential high-risk  travelers, including potential foreign fighters. Rules-based targeting  evaluates travelers during the travel process and, in some cases, in  advance of the travel process. If a traveler is a rule \u201chit,\u201d this individual  can be selected for further vetting, interviewing, and inspection.", "CBP supports its traveler data matching and rules-based targeting  efforts through the use of recurrent vetting. NTC\u2019s vetting, targeting,  and traveler data matching activities in ATS run 24 hours a day and 7  days a week and automatically scan updated traveler information,  when available. This process is to ensure that new information that  affects a traveler\u2019s admissibility is identified in near real time.  Recurrent vetting occurs throughout the travel process and continues  until a traveler arrives at a domestic port of entry. For example, after  checking into a foreign airport, a traveler may have his or her visa  revoked for a security or immigration-related violation. Due to  recurrent vetting, CBP would be alerted to this through ATS and could  take action, as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP\u2019s Air Predeparture Programs Interdict High- Risk Travelers on U.S.- Bound Flights, but CBP Has Not Fully Evaluated Overall Effectiveness of These Programs", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in January 2017, throughout the travel process, CBP\u2019s  predeparture programs use the results of NTC\u2019s efforts to identify and  interdict high-risk individuals destined for the United States while they are  still overseas; however, we found that CBP had not evaluated the  effectiveness of its predeparture programs as a whole, including  implementing a system of performance measures and baselines to  assess whether the programs are achieving their stated goals.", "CBP operates three air predeparture programs that are responsible for all  U.S.-bound air travelers\u2014(1) Preclearance; (2) the Immigration Advisory  Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program (JSP); and (3) the regional  carrier liaison groups (RCLG). As we reported in January 2017, CBP data  indicated that these programs identified and ultimately interdicted  approximately 22,000 high-risk air travelers in fiscal year 2015, the most  recent data available at the time of our review. Information on individuals  who the NTC identifies through traveler data matching or rules-based  targeting, including recurrent vetting, is compiled automatically through  ATS into a daily high-priority list (or, traveler referral list). CBP officers at  the NTC review the traveler referral list for accuracy and to remove, if  possible, any automatically generated matches determined to not be  potential high-risk individuals. After this review, CBP officers at the NTC  use ATS to send the traveler referral list to officers at each Preclearance,  IAP, JSP, and RCLG location, as shown in figure 4.", "Preclearance. Preclearance locations operate at foreign airports and  serve as U.S. ports of entry. Preclearance operations began in 1952 in  Toronto to facilitate trade and travel between the United States and  Canada. As of March 2018, CBP operated 15 air Preclearance locations  in six countries. Through the Preclearance program, uniformed CBP  officers at a foreign airport exercise U.S. legal authorities to inspect  travelers and luggage and make admissibility determinations prior to an  individual boarding a plane to the United States. According to CBP  officials, an inspection at a Preclearance location is the same inspection  as an individual would undergo at a domestic port of entry, and officers  conducting Preclearance inspections exercise the same authority as  officers at domestic ports of entry to approve or deny admission into the  United States. As a result, travelers arriving at domestic air ports of  entry from Preclearance locations do not have to be re-inspected upon  entry. According to CBP data, in fiscal year 2015, CBP officers at  Preclearance locations determined that 10,648 air travelers were  inadmissible out of the approximately 16 million air travelers seeking  admission to the United States through a Preclearance location. In addition to requiring that all travelers undergo a primary inspection, CBP  officers in these locations also referred almost 290,000 individuals for  secondary inspection.", "Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) and Joint Security Program  (JSP). IAP and JSP operated at nine and two foreign airports,  respectively, as of January 2017. According to CBP officials, under this  program, unarmed, plainclothes CBP officers posted at foreign airports  partner with air carriers and host country government officials to help  prevent terrorists and other high-risk individuals from boarding U.S.- bound flights by vetting and interviewing them before travel. According  to CBP program documentation, CBP established IAP in 2004 to prevent  terrorists, high- risk travelers, and improperly documented travelers from  boarding airlines destined to the United States. Building on the IAP  concept, CBP established JSP in 2009 to partner with host country law  enforcement officials to identify high-risk travelers. CBP officers at IAP  and JSP locations have the ability to question travelers and review their  travel documents. They are to act in an advisory manner to the air  carriers and host governments and do not have authority to deny  boarding to individuals on U.S.-bound flights or fully inspect travelers or  their belongings. IAP and JSP officers are authorized by CBP to make  recommendations to airlines as to whether to board or deny boarding  (known as a no-board recommendation) to selected travelers based on  their likely admissibility status upon arrival to the United States. The final  decision to board travelers, however, lies with the carriers. According to  CBP data, CBP officers at IAP and JSP locations made 3,925 no-board  recommendations in fiscal year 2015 for the approximately 29 million air  travelers bound for the United States from such locations. During this  same time period, CBP data indicated 1,154 confirmed encounters with  individuals in the TSDB, including 106 on the No Fly List.", "Regional Carrier Liaison Groups (RCLG). RCLGs are located and  operate at three domestic airports\u2014Miami International Airport, John F.  Kennedy International Airport, and Honolulu International Airport. CBP  established RCLGs in 2006 to assist air carriers with questions regarding  U.S. admissibility requirements and travel document authenticity.  According to CBP officials, RCLGs are responsible for coordinating with  air carriers on all actionable referrals from NTC on U.S.-bound travelers  departing from an airport without an IAP, JSP, or Preclearance presence.  Each RCLG is assigned responsibility for travelers departing out of a  specific geographic location. Similar to IAP and JSP, CBP officers in  RCLGs also make no-board recommendations, as appropriate, to air  carriers. CBP officers at RCLGs do not have authority to make  admissibility determinations about U.S.-bound air travelers, and the final  decision to board or not board a traveler lies with the carrier. We reported  in January 2017 that CBP officers working at the three RCLGs made  7,664 no-board recommendations in fiscal year 2015 for the  approximately 59 million travelers bound for the United States from  locations within the RCLGs\u2019 spheres of responsibility. During this time  period, CBP data indicated that RCLGs also reported 1,634 confirmed  encounters with individuals in the TSDB, including 119 on the No Fly List.", "In January 2017, we reported that CBP had not evaluated the  effectiveness of its predeparture programs as a whole, including  implementing a system of performance measures and baselines to  assess whether the programs were achieving their stated goals. We  reported that CBP had taken some initial steps to measure the  performance of these programs. Specifically, CBP officials told us that  they had collected a large quantity of data and statistics regarding the  actions of their predeparture programs and had done so since program  inception for all programs. However, due to changes in operational focus,  technology updates, and the use of separate data systems at program  locations, CBP had not collected consistent data across all of its  predeparture programs. As a result, CBP did not have baseline data on  which to measure program performance. Therefore, we recommended  that CBP develop and implement a system of performance measures and  baselines for each program to help ensure that these programs achieve  their intended goals. In response, as of March 2018, CBP has developed  three performance measures for its predeparture programs. On the basis  of our review of CBP documentation, as of December 2018, CBP has  collected the fiscal year 2018 data relevant to these measures, used  those data to set preliminary targets for fiscal year 2019, and plans to  analyze the fiscal year 2019 results and set targets for future fiscal years  by October 31, 2019.
