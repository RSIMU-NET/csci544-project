To do so, GAO analyzed contractor and program data and interviewed officials from NOAA, NASA, and other federal agencies that rely on GOES data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NOAA has made progress on the GOES-R acquisition, but key instruments have experienced challenges and important milestones have been delayed. The GOES-R program awarded key contracts for its flight and ground projects, and these are in development. However, two instruments have experienced technical issues that led to contract cost increases, and significant work remains on other development efforts. In addition, since 2006, the launch dates of the first two satellites in the series have been delayed by about 3 years. As a result, NOAA may not be able to meet its policy of having a backup satellite in orbit at all times, which could lead to a gap in coverage if GOES-14 or GOES-15 fails prematurely. Even though there may be a gap in backup coverage, NOAA has not established adequate continuity plans for its geostationary satellites. To its credit, NOAA has established a policy to always have a backup satellite available and high-level plans if that policy is not met. Specifically, in the event of a satellite failure with no backup available, NOAA plans to reduce to a single satellite and, if available, rely on a satellite from an international partner. However, NOAA does not have plans that include processes, procedures, and resources needed to transition to a single or an international satellite. Without such plans, NOAA faces an increased risk that users will lose access to critical data. While NOAA has identified GOES data users and involved internal users in developing and prioritizing the GOES-R requirements, it has not adequately involved other federal users that rely on GOES data. Specifically, NOAA's processes for developing and prioritizing satellite requirements do not include documented input from other federal agencies. Further, since 2006, the GOES-R program has undergone significant changes (such as the removal of certain satellite data products), but these have not been communicated to federal agencies. Until improvements are made in NOAA's processes for involving key federal users, these users may not be able to meet mission requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that NOAA address weaknesses in its continuity plans and improve its processes for involving other federal agencies.

NOAA  operates GOES as a two-satellite system that is primarily focused on the  United States (see fig. 1). These satellites are uniquely positioned to  provide timely environmental data about the earth\u2019s atmosphere, surface,  cloud cover, and the space environment to meteorologists and their  audiences. They also observe the development of hazardous weather, such  as hurricanes and severe thunderstorms, and track their movement and  intensity to reduce or avoid major losses of property and life.  Furthermore, the satellites\u2019 ability to provide broad, continuously updated  coverage of atmospheric conditions over land and oceans is important to  NOAA\u2019s weather forecasting operations.", "To provide continuous satellite coverage, NOAA acquires several satellites  at a time as part of a series and launches new satellites every few years  (see table 1). NOAA\u2019s policy is to have two operational satellites and one  backup satellite in orbit at all times.", "Five GOES satellites\u2014GOES-11, GOES-12, GOES-13, GOES-14, and GOES- 15\u2014are currently in orbit. Both GOES-11 and GOES-13 are operational  satellites, with GOES-11 covering the west and GOES-13 the east. GOES-14  is currently a backup for the other two satellites should they experience  any degradation in service. The final satellite in the series, GOES-15, is  undergoing a post-launch test period until October 2010, at which time it  will also be put in on-orbit storage mode. GOES-12 is at the end of its  service life, but is being used to provide coverage of South America. The  GOES-R series is the next generation of satellites that NOAA is planning;  the satellites are planned for launch beginning in 2015.", "Each of the operational geostationary satellites continuously transmits  raw environmental data to NOAA ground stations. The data are processed  at these ground stations and transmitted back to the satellite for broadcast  to primary weather services and the global research community in the  United States and abroad. Raw and processed data are also distributed to  users via ground stations through other communication channels, such as  dedicated private communication lines and the Internet.

The  system improvements are expected to fulfill more demanding user  requirements by updating the satellite data more often and providing  satellite products to users more quickly. The instrument improvements are  expected to significantly increase the clarity and precision of the observed  environmental data. NOAA originally planned to acquire six different types  of instruments. Furthermore, two of these instruments\u2014the Advanced  Baseline Imager and the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite\u2014were  considered to be the most critical because they would provide data for key  weather products. Table 2 summarizes the originally planned instruments  and their expected capabilities.", "However, in September 2006, NOAA decided to reduce the scope and  technical complexity of the GOES-R program because of expectations that  total costs, which were originally estimated to be $6.2 billion, could reach  $11.4 billion. Specifically, NOAA reduced the minimum number of  satellites from four to two, cancelled plans for developing the  Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (which reduced the number of planned  satellite products from 81 to 68), and divided the Solar Imaging Suite into  two separate acquisitions. In light of the cancellation of the Hyperspectral  Environmental Suite, NOAA decided to use the planned Advanced  Baseline Imager to develop certain satellite data products that were  originally to be produced by this instrument. The agency estimated that  the revised program would cost $7 billion.", "Subsequently, NOAA made several other important decisions about the  cost and scope of the GOES-R program. In May 2007, NOAA had an  independent cost estimate completed for the GOES-R program. After  reconciling the program office\u2019s cost estimate of $7 billion with the  independent cost estimate of about $9 billion, the agency established a  new program cost estimate of $7.67 billion. This was an increase of $670  million from the previous estimate. Further, in November 2007, to mitigate  the risk that costs would rise, program officials decided to remove  selected program requirements from the baseline program and treat them  as contract options that could be exercised if funds allow. These  requirements include the number of products to be distributed, the time to  deliver the remaining products (product latency), and how often these  products are updated with new satellite data (refresh rate). For example,  program officials eliminated the requirement to develop and distribute 34  of the 68 envisioned products, including aircraft icing threat, turbulence,  and visibility. Program officials included the restoration of the products,  latency, and refresh rates as options in the ground system contract that  could be acquired at a later time. Program officials later reduced the  number of products that could be restored as a contract option (called  option 2) from 34 to 31 because they determined that two products were  no longer feasible and two others could be combined into a single product.  See table 3 below for an overview of key changes to the GOES-R program.", "NOAA\u2019s original acquisition strategy was to award contracts for concept  development of the GOES-R system to several vendors who would  subsequently compete to be the single prime contractor responsible for  overall system development and production. In keeping with this strategy,  NOAA awarded contracts for concept development of the overall GOES-R  system to three vendors in October 2005. However, in March 2007, NOAA  revised its acquisition strategy for the development contract. In response  to recommendations by independent advisors, the agency decided to  separate the overall system development and production contract into two  separate contracts\u2014the spacecraft and ground system contracts.", "In addition, to reduce the risks associated with developing technically  advanced instruments, NASA awarded contracts for concept development  for five of the planned instruments. NASA subsequently awarded  development contracts for five instruments and, upon completion and  approval by NASA, these instruments will be provided to the prime  contractor responsible for the spacecraft of the GOES-R program.

The Advanced Baseline Imager  program has experienced technical issues primarily related to  underestimating the design and development complexity of two  components\u2014the focal planes and telescope, which led to cost increases  and delays in developing the prototype model. As a result, in September  2009, the program office rebaselined the cost and schedule targets of the  Advanced Baseline Imager program. This increased contract costs from  the most recent estimate of $375 million to $537 million, an increase of  $162 million, and delayed the completion of the prototype model from  March 2010 to December 2010. Program officials reported that the  rebaseline did not affect the instrument\u2019s completion date and that they  have sufficient contingency reserves to address the cost overruns  experienced to date, meaning that these system-specific cost overruns will  not affect the overall GOES-R program\u2019s cost. The program is currently  testing the prototype model and plans to conduct an updated critical  design review in January 2011 to validate any required design changes as a  result of testing.", "The Geostationary Lightning Mapper experienced technical issues  primarily related to underestimating the design complexity of the  instrument, as well as an architecture change that significantly increased  the electronics design and fabrication cost. As a result, in March 2010, the  program office rebaselined the cost and schedule targets of the  Geostationary Lightning Mapper program, which increased contract costs  from $71 million to $157 million, an increase of about $86 million, and  delayed the contract completion from June 2012 to September 2012\u2014a 3- month delay. According to GOES-R program officials, contingency funds  are available to cover these changes and they will not affect the overall  cost or schedule of the GOES-R program. In addition, the program  replaced the development of a prototype model with an engineering  development unit, which requires less rigorous development procedures  and testing requirements. For example, the planned engineering  development unit is not required to undergo comprehensive  environmental testing to validate that the instrument will meet mission  objectives in the launch and space environment. According to GOES-R  program officials, this decision was made to reduce program risk because  the schedule for development of the prototype model and production  model would have otherwise overlapped\u2014thus reducing the inherent  benefits of a prototype model. However, the lack of a prototype model  increases the risk that design issues that would have been identified  during more comprehensive testing will surface in the production model,  when it is too late to make changes.", "The status and program-identified risk level of each of the components of  the flight project is described in table 6.", "Our analysis of contractor-provided earned value management data  showed that most components of the flight project were on track between  May 2009 and April 2010.

These delays were due, in part, to delays in  releasing the requests for proposals for the spacecraft and Core Ground  System and additional time needed to evaluate the contract proposals.  Since our last report, NOAA further delayed key GOES-R program  milestones by 6 months, including the dates when the first two satellites in  the series would be available for launch. These recent delays were due to  bid protests of the award of the spacecraft contract in December 2008,  which delayed the start of work until August 2009.

This policy  proved useful in December 2008, when NOAA experienced problems with  GOES-12, but was able to use GOES-13 as an operational satellite until the  problems were resolved. However, beginning in April 2015, NOAA expects  to have two operational satellites in orbit (GOES-14 and GOES-15), but it  will not have a backup satellite in place until GOES-R is launched and  completes an estimated 6-month post-launch test period\u2014resulting in a 12- month gap during which time a backup satellite would not be available.  Figure 5 below depicts this gap in backup coverage.", "If NOAA experiences a problem with either of its operational satellites  before GOES-R is in orbit and operating, it will need to rely on older  satellites that are beyond their expected operational lives and therefore  may not be fully functional.

Planning for the continuity of operations facilitates the  performance of an organization\u2019s essential functions during emergency  events or other situations that disrupt normal operations. Federal policy  requires agencies to develop and document continuity of operations plans  for essential functions that provide, among other things, a description of  the resources, staff roles, procedures, and timetables needed for the plan\u2019s  implementation. NOAA has defined providing satellite imagery in support  of weather forecasting as one of its essential functions.", "NOAA has developed continuity plans for the ground systems used to  operate and process data from geostationary satellites. Specifically,  NOAA\u2019s continuity plans for its Satellite Operation Control Center and its  Environmental Data Processing Center describe plans to transfer critical  functions to a backup facility during an emergency. Both of these  continuity plans contain, among other things, descriptions of the alternate  locations for performing key functions, resources, and implementation  procedures.", "In addition to planning for the continuity of its ground systems, NOAA has  established a policy to ensure the continuity of its geostationary  satellites\u2014and high-level plans if that policy is not met. As previously  mentioned, NOAA\u2019s policy is to have two operational satellites and one  backup satellite in orbit at all times. That way, if an operational satellite  fails, the backup satellite would be moved into place to pick up  operations. However, if there is no backup satellite in orbit\u2014as is  expected to be the case during the year leading up to when GOES-R  becomes operational\u2014NOAA officials stated that they would move the  single remaining operational satellite to the middle of the continental  United States. According to NOAA officials, this would provide sufficient  coverage of the continental United States, but would provide limited  coverage of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (see fig. 6). In addition, NOAA  would contact other nations to request that a spare geostationary satellite,  if available, be positioned to provide temporary coverage of the coastal  regions, as well as the oceans.", "However, NOAA has not established continuity plans for its geostationary  satellites that describe the resources, staff roles, procedures, and  timetables needed for the plan\u2019s implementation. This is important  because there are many procedures and coordinating activities that NOAA  would need to perform to ensure the continuity of geostationary satellite  data in the event of a satellite failure with no backup available. For  example, the transition to a single satellite would require NOAA, at a  minimum, to inform users of changes to the in-orbit configuration through  various methods, including users groups and Web site postings.  Alternatively, the transition to an international satellite would require  modifications to the software code of several processing systems to  account for expected differences in spectral channels, refresh rate,  resolution, and coverage areas due to the repositioning of the satellites.  Further, all geostationary satellite data products would need to be  reverified and validated to account for differences in product coverage.  Lastly, NOAA would have to notify GOES data users of differences in  satellite capabilities, such as the loss of space weather instruments and  data, and changes to viewing angles caused by satellite positions that are  different from current GOES locations. For example, the orbital location  of an international satellite positioned in a backup configuration may  provide a less comprehensive view due to the more severe observing angle  over the United States.", "In addition, NOAA\u2019s lack of continuity plans has precluded the agency  from documenting and communicating the operational impact of its plans  to reduce to a single satellite and rely on an international satellite. For  example, a single satellite configuration would reduce coverage of the  Atlantic and Pacific Oceans where satellite data provide critical warnings  of approaching severe weather, such as tropical cyclone and hurricane  activity. According to air traffic officials from the Federal Aviation  Administration, the reduction to a single satellite would have a significant  impact on the agency\u2019s ability to make informed aviation planning  decisions over the ocean areas surrounding the continental United States.  In addition, transitioning to an international satellite would be dependent  on the availability of foreign satellites and it could take several months to  reposition an international satellite to provide backup coverage.  Furthermore, foreign satellites lack capabilities currently available to  GOES users, such as instruments that provide space weather information.  For example, the National Weather Service\u2019s (NWS) Space Weather  Prediction Center relies solely on space weather data from GOES for two- thirds of its data products, which are critical to providing warnings of  severe space weather that may impact airline and maritime  communication, satellite operations, and astronaut safety.", "According to the Deputy Director of the Office of Satellite Operations,  continuity plans for geostationary satellites have not been established  because the transition to single satellite and to an international satellite  has been done previously. Specifically, in 1989, after the failure of GOES-6,  NOAA repositioned GOES-7 to the middle of the continental United States.  Subsequently, in 1991, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of  Meteorological Satellites and the European Space Agency repositioned the  Meteosat-3 satellite to backup NOAA\u2019s aging GOES-7 satellite in order to  provide coverage of the Atlantic Ocean in case GOES-7 failed before a  replacement could be launched and placed into operation. While this  accomplishment has merit, current GOES and their related ground  processing systems are increasingly complex and have enhanced  capabilities as compared to earlier satellites, such as ability to capture and  process higher resolution images of weather patterns and atmospheric  measurements. In addition, there are likely new staff who will not be able  to rely on the 1989 and 1991 experiences. Establishing continuity plans  that describe the resources, staff roles, procedures, and timetables needed  for the plans\u2019 implementation (as required by federal policy) would better  ensure that NOAA can continue to provide these critical capabilities in the  event of a satellite failure.", "Without continuity plans, NOAA may not be able to fully meet its mission- essential function of providing satellite imagery in support of weather  forecasting. This could have a devastating affect on the ability of  meteorologists to observe the development of severe storm conditions,  such as hurricanes and tornados, and track their movement and intensity  to reduce or avoid major losses of property and life. In addition, the loss of  a single satellite could affect many satellite data users outside NOAA,  including the Federal Aviation Administration, which use satellite- provided weather data for air traffic management, and the U.S. Forest  Service (within the U.S. Department of Agriculture), which uses satellite- provided weather data to predict and prevent wildfires and mitigate their  damage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA\u2019s Efforts to Involve External GOES Data Users, Prioritize Their Data Needs, and Communicate Program Status Have Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["NOAA has identified key GOES data users and involved internal users in  defining and prioritizing the GOES-R program requirements, but lacks a  comprehensive approach for eliciting and prioritizing the satellite data  needs of external users.

Prioritized requirements should serve as the basis for  determining project scope and can help to ensure that requirements  critical to key users are addressed quickly.", "Key GOES data users can be categorized into three tiers. The first tier  includes internal NOAA users that depend on GOES data for their primary  mission, such as NWS. The second tier includes other federal agencies that  depend on GOES data for their primary mission, such as the Department  of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration. The third tier includes  all other users that receive GOES data, including private industry and  universities. See table 9 below for descriptions and examples of each tier  of GOES data users.", "In formulating the GOES-R program, NOAA primarily involved internal  NOAA users (tier 1) in requirements definition activities, but did receive  input from one other federal agency, the Department of Defense.  Beginning in 1998, NOAA collected high-level system requirements from  NWS. Over the next few years, NOAA continued to collect and refine these  requirements by including input from other NOAA offices, including  NESDIS, NOAA Ocean Service, NOAA Research, NOAA Fisheries, and  NOAA Marine and Aviation Operations. Also, in February 2003, the  Department of Commerce requested that the Department of Defense  provide a consolidated list of its environmental information needs,  including those data needs that could be met by geostationary satellites.  This input, combined with that of NOAA\u2019s offices, served as the basis for  the 2004 GOES-R Program Requirements Document, which represented a  preliminary set of GOES-R requirements.", "In June 2007, prior to entering the development phase of the GOES-R  program lifecycle, the Deputy Undersecretary for Commerce Oceans and  Atmosphere approved a baseline set of prioritized GOES-R requirements  (known as the Level 1 Requirements). Efforts to prioritize the Level 1  Requirements were led by a working group of representatives from  various NOAA organizations. This working group categorized the  requirements into four priority levels according to the importance of each  requirement to NOAA, as well as the requirements contribution to the  GOES-R series.", "However, other than the Department of Defense\u2019s input into the 2004  version of the requirements, external users that rely on GOES data were  not adequately involved in the GOES-R requirements definition or  prioritization process. According to NOAA officials, input to the  requirements from other federal agencies (tier 2) and other interested  users (tier 3) was collected via casual conversations between NOAA  offices and these users, as well as during GOES User Conferences, which  were held to educate and obtain input from prospective GOES-R users.  While these methods are reasonable for eliciting input from tier 3 users,  federal agencies that rely on GOES data to meet unique mission  requirements warrant documented input to the GOES-R requirements. For  example, the U.S. Forest Service relies on GOES for fire monitoring and  detection capabilities to sustain an estimated 193 million acres of the  nation\u2019s forests and grasslands. According to U.S. Forest Service officials,  the lack of a structured process for their agency to provide input into the  requirements definition process has made it difficult to ensure that its  requirements have been and will be implemented.", "Further, NOAA did not account for the priority data needs of other federal  users in prioritizing the Level 1 requirements. As previously mentioned,  the priorities of the requirements were established by the GOES-R  requirements working group. However, this group only includes  membership from NOAA offices, such as NWS and NESDIS, and does not  include membership from other federal agencies. According to GOES-R  program officials, the Level 1 Requirements are intended to reflect the  priorities of NOAA users, primarily those of NWS, and the assumption is  that other users will adapt to the data provided by NOAA. However, given  the unique missions of other federal agencies and their reliance on GOES  data to meet their missions, input into the prioritization of GOES-R  requirements is critical to ensure that GOES-R will meet the needs of their  organizations.", "The lack of involvement by federal agencies in GOES-R requirements  definition and prioritization is due to weaknesses in NOAA\u2019s processes for  defining and prioritizing satellite data requirements. Specifically, the lack  of a structured process for eliciting the data needs of key operational users  inhibits NOAA\u2019s ability to produce prioritized requirements that reflect the  needs of other federal agencies that depend on these satellites. Without  improvements in these processes, NOAA\u2019s satellite acquisitions may not  fully meet the needs of important GOES data users."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Has Not Effectively Communicated with Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["While NOAA has taken steps to communicate program status and changes  to internal and external GOES data users, important changes to currently  available GOES data products have not been communicated to key  external users.

Moreover, best practices call for identifying and documenting deviations  from plans and communicating significant issues to relevant operational  users.", "NOAA has taken steps to communicate program status and changes to  GOES data users. For example, the GOES-R requirements working group  was established to identify and represent NOAA user requirements and  serves as a forum for communication of GOES-R requirements status and  changes with internal NOAA users. Another initiative, known as the GOES- R Proving Ground, engages the NWS forecast and warning community in  preoperational demonstrations of selected capabilities anticipated from  GOES-R. Through this program, NWS users are given the ability to test and  evaluate expected GOES-R capabilities, such as lightning detection, before  the satellites are operational. Lastly, GOES User Conferences are held to  educate and obtain input from any prospective GOES users, including  other agencies, universities, and industry.", "However, the GOES-R program has undergone significant changes over  the course of its acquisition lifecycle, and these changes have not been  communicated to GOES data users outside of NOAA. As previously  mentioned, in 2007, program officials removed requirements from the  baseline program to treat them as a contract option that could be  exercised if funds allow (known as Option 2). These changes resulted in a  baseline program of 34 satellite data products and 31 Option 2 products.  However, NOAA did not communicate the removal of these products to  external federal agencies. In addition, 9 Option 2 products are currently  available to GOES data users, which means that users may lose access to  these products if the contract option is not exercised. These 9 products  are critical to measuring cloud properties, infrared radiation, and sulfur  dioxide in the atmosphere. However, NOAA did not inform external  federal agencies about the potential loss of these products. See figure 7 for  a description of the 9 currently available products removed from the  GOES-R program baseline.", "According to GOES-R program officials, the decision to make these  products part of the contract option was based on NOAA\u2019s input and was  approved by the requirements working group. However, key GOES data  users at other federal agencies that currently rely on these products have  not been involved in, nor told of, these changes. For example, the U.S.  Department of Agriculture uses cloud-based products (such as cloud liquid  water) to develop weather forecasts used by farmers and radiation-based  products (such as upward longwave radiation) for streamflow simulation  modeling. In addition, the Department of Defense relies on the cloud- based products (such as cloud type and cloud heights) as input into  weather prediction models for forecasting of high-altitude winds, which  are used to navigate ships and planes.", "If the contract option is not exercised, these agencies will not have access  to these GOES data products that they currently utilize. If this occurs,  GOES-R program officials stated that GOES data users may be able to get  these products via the Internet from NESDIS, but added that the details for  this alternative have not been determined because the program expects to  receive approval from NESDIS to exercise this contract option by  December 2010. Given that these products are currently available to GOES  data users, any significant changes to these products should be  communicated to these users to ensure that they have sufficient time to  implement workarounds or determine other sources for the data. Without  communicating significant changes, other federal agencies may lose  access to critical data products needed to meet mission requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the last few years, the GOES-R program has continued to make  progress on key development efforts, but much work remains to be  completed. While the GOES-R program has awarded most development  contracts, two instruments have experienced technical challenges that led  to contract cost increases, and significant work remains on the program\u2019s  flight and ground projects. In addition, continued delays in the launch date  of the first two satellites in the GOES-R series have endangered satellite  continuity because these delays extend the time in which there will not be a  backup satellite in orbit. Any further delays in the launch of the first satellite  in the GOES-R program increases the risk of a gap in satellite coverage.", "The risk of a gap in coverage is further exacerbated because NOAA has not  established adequate continuity plans. While NOAA plans to reduce to a  single satellite and, if available, rely on an international satellite, these plans  have weaknesses, including a lack of continuity plans needed to support  geostationary satellite operations during an emergency. Until these  weaknesses are addressed, NOAA faces a potential 12-month gap where it  may not be able to provide critical geostationary data needed for predicting  global and local weather events in the event of a satellite failure.", "Finally, NOAA has taken steps to identify GOES data users, prioritize their  data needs, and communicate program changes, but has not adequately  involved or communicated with key external users. For example, while  NOAA involved internal users in its process for defining and prioritizing  the GOES-R requirements, improvements are needed in these processes to  ensure that other federal agencies that rely on GOES data have a means to  provide documented input to the requirements and the prioritization of  those requirements. Further, while NOAA has taken steps to communicate  with GOES data users, it has not established processes to notify other  federal agencies of GOES-R program status and significant changes.
