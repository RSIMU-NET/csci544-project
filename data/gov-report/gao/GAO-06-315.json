While JIF projects experienced challenges because of delays resulting from the initial absence of funding mechanisms and, in some cases, the need for additional acquisition and construction approvals, as of December 2005, 7 of 11 selected 2004 projects were operational. The DSS program also experienced challenges as some sites reported difficulty putting together project submission packages, noting confusion over the timelines and approval process as well as frustration with the amount of paperwork and rework required. Nonetheless, as of December 2005, 7 of the 8 DSS projects were operational. However, the Joint Executive Council (JEC) and Health Executive Council (HEC), VA and DOD entities established to facilitate collaboration and health care resource sharing between the departments, have not established a plan to measure and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of DSS projects--information that will be useful for determining if projects that produce cost savings or enhance health care delivery efficiencies can be replicated systemwide. VA and DOD are creating mechanisms that support the potential to increase collaboration, sharing, and coordination of management and oversight of health care resources and services. The departments have taken steps to create interagency councils and workgroups to facilitate collaboration and sharing of information, establish working relationships among their leaders, and develop communication channels to further health care resource sharing. In addition, the departments developed a Joint Strategic Plan outlining six goals. However, JEC and HEC have not seized upon a number of opportunities to further collaboration and coordination. For example, JEC and HEC have not developed a system for collecting and monitoring information on the health care services that each department contracts for from the private sector--such as individual VA medical center or military treatment facility contracts for dialysis, laboratory services, or magnetic resonance imaging. If such a system were in place, the departments could use it to identify services that could be exchanged from one another or possibly obtain better contract pricing through joint purchasing of services, thus promoting systemwide cost savings and efficiencies. Furthermore, JEC and HEC have not directed that a joint nationwide market analysis be conducted to obtain information on what their combined future workloads will be in the areas of services, facilities, and patient needs. VA and DOD lack performance measures that would be useful for evaluating how well they are achieving their health care resource-sharing goals. For example, of the 30 measures contained in the departments' joint strategic plan, 5 were not developed at the time the plan was issued and 11 lacked longitudinal information. For the remaining 14 that require periodic measurement, there was variation in the rigor or specificity in the types of data to be collected or the analysis to be performed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Combined, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of  Defense (DOD) provided health care services to about 13.5 million  beneficiaries in fiscal year 2004 at a cost of about $57 billion\u2014$26.8 billion  for VA and $30.4 billion for DOD.

DOD  health care is provided at more than 530 Army, Navy, and Air Force MTFs  worldwide and is supplemented by TRICARE\u2019s network of civilian  providers. Through its TRICARE contracts, DOD uses civilian managed  health care support contractors to develop networks of primary and  specialty care providers and to provide other customer service functions,  such as claims processing.

VA\u2019s  expenditures have grown\u2014from about $12 billion in fiscal year 1990 to  about $26.8 billion in fiscal year 2004\u2014as an increasing number of  veterans look to VA to meet their health care needs. DOD\u2019s health care  spending has gone from about $12 billion in fiscal year 1990 to about  $30.4 billion in fiscal year 2004\u2014in part, to meet additional demand  resulting from congressional actions to expand program eligibility for  military retirees, reservists, members of the National Guard, and their  dependents, along with the increased needs of active duty personnel  involved in conflicts in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) and in  Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). Today, VA and DOD officials are reporting  that many of their facilities are at capacity or exceeding capacity. The  nature of sharing has shifted from one of utilizing untapped resources to  one of partnering and gaining efficiencies by leveraging resources or  buying power jointly. For example, VA and DOD have achieved  efficiencies and cost avoidance through a concerted effort to jointly  procure pharmaceuticals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Initiatives to Increase Health Care Resource Sharing", "paragraphs": ["The Congress has had a long-standing interest in expanding VA and DOD  health care resource sharing. In 1982, the Congress passed the Veterans\u2019  Administration and Department of Defense Health Resources Sharing and  Emergency Operations Act (Sharing Act). The act authorizes VA and  DOD to enter into sharing agreements to buy, sell, and barter health care  resources to better utilize excess capacity. The head of each VA and DOD  medical facility can enter into local sharing agreements. However, VA and  DOD headquarters officials review and approve agreements that involve  national commitments, such as joint purchasing of pharmaceuticals. VA  and DOD sharing activities have typically fallen into three categories.", "Local sharing agreements allow VA and DOD to take advantage of their  facilities\u2019 capacity to provide health care by being providers of health  services, receivers of health services, or both. Health services shared  under these agreements can include inpatient and outpatient care;  ancillary services, such as diagnostic and therapeutic radiology; dental  care; and specialty care services, such as treatment for spinal cord  injuries. Other examples of services shared under these agreements  include support services, such as administration and management;  research; education and training; patient transportation; and laundry. The  goals of local sharing agreements are to allow VAMCs and MTFs to  capitalize on their combined purchasing power, exchange health services  to maximize use of resources, and provide beneficiaries with greater  access to care.", "Joint venture sharing agreements, as distinguished from local sharing  agreements, aim to avoid costs by pooling resources to build a new facility  or jointly use an existing facility. Joint ventures require an integrated  approach, as two separate health care systems must develop multiple  sharing agreements that allow them to operate as one system at one  location.", "National sharing initiatives are designed to achieve greater efficiencies,  that is, to lower cost and improve access to goods and services when they  are acquired on a national level rather than by individual facilities\u2014for  example, VA and DOD\u2019s efforts to jointly purchase pharmaceuticals and  surgical instruments for nationwide distribution.", "Later, in January 2002, the Congress passed legislation requiring VA and  DOD to conduct a comprehensive assessment that would identify and  evaluate changes to their health care delivery policies, methods, practices,  and procedures in order to provide improved health care services at  reduced cost to the taxpayer. To facilitate this, VA and DOD hired a  contractor (at a cost of $2.5 million) to conduct the Joint Assessment  Study that was completed on December 31, 2003. Unlike previous studies  conducted by VA and DOD, the Joint Assessment Study combined VA and  DOD beneficiary populations into a single market by geographic site. The  contractor examined collaboration and sharing opportunities in three VA  and DOD market areas: Hawaii; the Gulf Coast (Mississippi to Florida);  and Puget Sound, Washington. Specifically, the study included a detailed  independent review of options to colocate or share facilities and care  providers in areas where duplication and some excess capacity may exist;  optimize economies of scale through joint procurement of supplies and  services; and partially or fully integrate VA and DOD systems to provide  tele-health services, provider credentialing, cardiac surgical programs,  rehabilitation services, and administrative services.", "The NDAA, passed in December 2002, required that VA and DOD  implement two programs\u2014JIF and DSS\u2014to increase the amount of health  care resource sharing taking place between VA and DOD.

Under  DSS, the departments are to select projects to serve as a test for evaluating  the feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of programs designed to  improve the sharing and coordination of health care resources. The NDAA  also required VA and DOD jointly to develop and implement guidelines for  a standardized, uniform payment and reimbursement schedule for selected  health care services. In response, the departments established a  standardized reimbursement methodology effective October 2003,  between VA and DOD medical facilities through a memorandum of  agreement implementing standardized outpatient billing rates based on the  discounted Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed  Services (CHAMPUS) Maximum Allowable Charges (CMAC) schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance Related to Strategic Planning and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["The NDAA also required VA and DOD to develop and publish a joint  strategic plan to shape, focus, and prioritize the coordination and sharing  efforts within the departments and incorporate the goals and requirements  of the joint strategic plan into the strategic plan of each department.

Managers can use the data that  performance measures provide to help them manage in three basic ways:  to account for past activities, to manage current operations, or to assess  progress toward achieving planned goals and objectives. When used to  look at past activities, performance measures can show the accountability  of processes and procedures used to complete a task, as well as program  results. When used to manage current operations, performance measures  can show how efficiently resources, such as dollars and staff, are being  used.

Further, the Deployment  Health Workgroup has developed a roster identifying Operation Enduring  Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans who are separating or  who have separated from active duty military service. VA is using this  roster to mail letters to individuals thanking them for their service and  advising them of their VA benefits based on their service in a combat  theater. VA is also using this roster to determine postdeployment VA  health care utilization by this population of veterans. Other efforts include  the Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines Workgroup\u2019s development of  standardized guidelines to improve patient outcomes for both VA and  DOD beneficiaries. In fiscal year 2005, the workgroup began revising four  of its guidelines, including rehabilitation for servicemembers with  amputations.

For instance, the site jointly leased a magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) unit. The unit eliminated the need for  beneficiaries to travel to more distant sources of care.

Hawaii VA officials told us it does  this because the cost of care is borne by Palo Alto and not by the Hawaii  VA medical center, which would have to reimburse Tripler for the care.  Under this scenario, the federal government is paying for underutilized  resources and providers at Tripler. We believe HEC has an opportunity to  step in and ensure that Tripler resources are fully maximized\u2014an initiative  that would ultimately result in overall savings to the government.

By fully  maximizing resources at Tripler, HEC would be helping to ensure that  initial treatments are provided closer to a beneficiary\u2019s home and that  continuity of care is maintained.  In San Antonio, Texas, we found that VA contracts out approximately   $1.5 million for diagnostic services to various private sector laboratories  even though local MTFs have the capacity to provide these services.  According to VA, it contracts out to the private sector because the costs  are less than what DOD facilities charge.
