Specifically, representation of African-Americans at various management levels decreased while representation of other minorities increased during this period. Overall representation of women was generally unchanged during this period. Representation of women among first- and mid-level managers remained around 48 percent and senior-level managers remained about 29 percent from 2007 through 2015.", "Potential employees for the financial services industry, including those that could become managers, come from external and internal pools. For example, the external pool includes those with undergraduate or graduate degrees, such as a Master of Business Administration. In 2015, about 33 percent of the external pool included minorities and around 60 percent were women. The internal talent pool for potential managers in financial services includes those already in professional positions. In 2015, nearly 28 percent of professional positions in financial services were held by minorities and just over 51 percent were held by women.", "Research, financial services firm representatives, and financial industry stakeholders described challenges to recruiting and retaining members of racial/ethnic minority groups and women and practices that could help address these challenges, including recruiting from a wider variety of schools. Firm representatives said that it is important for firms to assess firm-level data on diversity and inclusiveness. However, firm representatives and other stakeholders differed in their views on whether firm-level diversity data should be made public. For example, one stakeholder stated that sharing diversity data publicly would create incentives for improvement.

Data for 2015 were the most current data available at  the time of our review. EEO-1 data were obtained for each job category in  the finance and insurance industry by gender, race/ethnicity, firm size,  and industry sectors. Management job categories include two groupings,  (1) senior-level managers and (2) first- and mid-level managers.

We analyzed educational attainment data available  from the Department of Education\u2019s Integrated Postsecondary Education  Data System (IPEDS). Through a review of documentation and electronic  testing, we found the IPEDS data to be sufficiently reliable for our use in  describing trends in educational attainment. To describe recent trends in  diversity among potential internal talent pools for management positions, we first identified the nonmanagement positions that were most likely to  feed into management by reviewing an EEOC report on diversity in  financial services.

More specifically, employers were required to report  data for senior-level management positions rather than combining data on  senior-level managers with data for first- and mid-level management  positions as had been the practice prior to 2007. Since 2007, employers  are to review EEOC guidance describing the two management positions  and determine how their firm\u2019s job positions fit into these classifications.  Senior-level managers include, for example, chief executive officers, chief  financial officers, and managing partners. The first- and mid-level  management category includes (1) middle managers that report to senior  managers and typically lead major business units and (2) managers who  report to middle managers and oversee day-to-day operations, such as  team or branch managers.", "Additionally, EEOC changed its practices for collecting certain  racial/ethnicity information. The EEO-1 form was changed in 2007 to  divide \u201cAsian or Pacific Islander\u201d into two separate categories, \u201cAsian\u201d  and \u201cNative Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.\u201d Also, EEOC adopted a  two-question format for collecting ethnicity data.

The Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) approved the revision in September 2016. In August 2017, OMB  issued a memorandum suspending the pay-related data collection  aspects of the EEO-1 form.

For example, a 2012  consulting firm report on women in senior management notes that at the  entry-level businesses viewed as male-dominated tend to attract fewer  women. This report also states that sometimes companies have a view that positions requiring long hours will not suit women. A 2012 study on  women\u2019s job choices found that in financial services, women are  significantly less likely than men to apply for financial advisory and trading  jobs and more likely to apply for jobs in general management\u2014most  notably internal finance and marketing. A 2014 consulting firm report on  diversity in the leadership of companies in the United Kingdom, Canada,  Latin America, and the United States found a number of barriers to the  recruitment of all diversity groups (including women as well as  racial/ethnic groups). These barriers include the lack of visible support  from leadership and inadequate collection and use of data on the  advantages of more diverse organizations. Additionally, a 2016 consulting  firm report on women in financial services in 32 countries noted that a  majority of asset managers who were interviewed held the view that  certain jobs in financial services, such as asset management, may deter  qualified women from applying, as may a lack of knowledge about the  industry among graduate students.", "Financial firm representatives and other stakeholders we spoke with, and  research we reviewed described a variety of practices that they believe or  have found to be effective for recruiting women and racial/ethnic  minorities. These practices include the following.", "Engaging in broad-based recruiting. Representatives from three  firms stated that they are increasingly hiring and interested in  recruiting students from a variety of academic disciplines, such as  liberal arts or science and technology. For example, representatives  from one firm explained that they are interested in candidates with  critical thinking skills, and that technical skills can be taught to new  employees. Additionally, representatives from several firms noted the  importance of recruiting at a broad group of schools, not just a small  number of elite universities.", "Establishing relationships with student and professional  organizations. Most financial firm representatives told us that an  effective strategy for recruiting diverse students is to establish  relationships with student organizations representing diverse groups.  Representatives from one firm explained that working with student  groups helps expose diverse students to careers in financial services.  Additionally, to help recruit women and minorities who may already  have graduated from college or graduate school, representatives of  most financial firms and two trade groups described establishing  relationships with professional organizations that represent women  and minorities.", "Intentionally recruiting diverse candidates. Representatives from  two financial services firms and two organizations that advocate for  the financial services industry noted that firms should intentionally  seek out diverse candidates.

Additionally, two former  employees of large financial services firms, both racial/ethnic minorities,  told us that there are fewer mentors or role models for women and  racial/ethnic minorities in firms that have fewer women and minorities in  leadership positions. A 2012 consulting firm report on women in senior  management reported that women can lack a network or sponsor to help  them advance. Some financial firm representatives noted that employee  resistance, particularly from middle-managers, poses a challenge to  diversity and inclusion efforts.", "Additionally, some organizations that advocate for women and minorities  noted that unconscious bias is an issue that can negatively affect women  and minorities. As an example, managers may give hiring or promotion  preferences to persons who have hobbies or educational backgrounds  similar to theirs. Also, the authors of a 2014 report on women in senior  management at financial and nonfinancial organizations across 40  countries suggested that unconscious bias against women can result in a  reluctance to promote women in the expectation that they will eventually  put family first. The report stated that this bias can trigger a self-fulfilling  prophecy, as lack of promotion is one of the top reasons cited by women  for leaving their jobs.", "Reports on diversity, representatives from financial services firms, and  other stakeholders described a variety of practices that may be helpful in  retaining women and racial/ethnic minorities. These practices include the  following.", "Establishing affinity groups. Representatives from four financial  services firms stated that having affinity groups helps promote both  diversity and inclusion. Affinity groups\u2014sometimes referred to as  employee resource groups or networking programs\u2014provide forums  for employees to gather socially and share ideas outside of their  particular work unit. Representatives from two firms emphasized  that it is important for affinity groups to have meetings with firm  leadership. A 2007 study reported that networking programs have  stronger effects on some demographic groups than others.", "Training managers and employees on inclusion and  unconscious bias. Several financial firm representatives emphasized  the importance of offering training to foster an inclusive work  environment. As previously noted, an inclusive work environment is  one that encourages employees to feel valued for their unique  qualities and experience a sense of belonging. Training on  inclusiveness, emotional intelligence, and unconscious bias were  specifically noted by two financial firm representatives as being helpful  for both managers and staff.", "Establishing management-level accountability. Representatives  from three financial firms told us that firm management should be held  accountable for the firm\u2019s workforce diversity goals. Managers\u2019  performance in maintaining a diverse workforce can be evaluated a  variety of ways. For example, two firm representatives discussed the  use of \u201cdiversity scorecards.\u201d A diversity scorecard is a set of  objectives and measures derived from an organization\u2019s overall  business strategy and linked to its diversity strategy. Additionally, one  firm representative noted that tying senior managers\u2019 compensation to  diversity goals has been an effective practice for retaining women and  minorities. Researchers have noted that efforts to establish  organizational responsibility for diversity lead to the broadest  increases in managerial diversity.", "Offering staff mentors and sponsors. Representatives from three  financial firms and two organizations that advocate for the financial  services industry told us that providing staff with mentors or sponsors  helps retain and promote women and racial/ethnic minorities. In  general, a mentor provides advice and guidance to more junior staff  (prot\u00e9g\u00e9s) and a sponsor nominates or supports a prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s  promotion.

For example, a  2015 consulting firm report found that the approach of many companies  to cover all groups (racial/ethnic, gender, and sexual orientation) using a  single diversity program is insufficient. The report found that diversity- related practices should be tailored to specific groups.

All  of the financial services firms with whom we met agreed on the  importance of analyzing employee data. Some firm representatives noted  that by assessing employee data they can analyze the gender and  racial/ethnic diversity of new hires, employees leaving the organization,  and newly promoted staff and managers. Representatives from several  firms stated that it is important for organizations to be self-aware of how  they are doing with workforce diversity. Also, representatives from an  investment bank told us that they analyze employee data over time to  determine whether certain demographic groups tend to leave the firm  after a certain number of years. With this information, the representatives  told us, the organization can proactively take steps to help retain these  staff, such as providing staff with mentors. Additionally, representatives  from a large bank explained that by analyzing demographic data of  employees, the organization can identify \u201cleaks\u201d in their internal pipeline.  That is, they can determine when and potentially why women and  racial/ethnic minorities leave before progressing into management  positions. Several financial firm representatives told us that when they  identify data trends that indicate problems, such as retention issues, they  then take steps to address them.", "Several financial firm representatives stated it is important to know the  demographic make-up of employees, because firms should look like their  customers. As an example, a representative of an investment banking  institution told us that over half of the firm\u2019s customers were women;  therefore it was a priority for the organization to know how to serve them  as well as other diverse groups. Also, a firm representative told us that  some potential clients call inquiring about racial and gender diversity  before doing business. The representative added that clients are  interested in receiving advice and information from advisors to whom they  can relate. Additionally, representatives from a large financial services  firm stated workforce diversity helps the firm better understand its diverse  customers.", "Representatives of three financial services firms with whom we met also  described the importance of obtaining employees\u2019 views about the  organization, including employees\u2019 feelings about diversity and inclusion.  For example, a financial services firm representative told us that in order  to be successful at fostering workforce diversity firms must obtain  employees\u2019 views on work/life balance, opportunities for advancement,  and inclusiveness. He noted that while quantitative data on employees\u2019  demographic characteristics may indicate that the workforce has become  more diverse, employees may not feel like the workplace has become  more diverse. Three of the organizations with whom we met (two that  advocate for the financial services industry and one that advocates for  diversity) agreed on the importance of surveying employees about  diversity and inclusion. For example, representatives from a financial  services industry trade group told us that employee surveys can be used  to detect issues that minority employees face. Research points out that  having diversity management practices alone is insufficient for improving  workplace performance. This research finds that productive workplaces  exist when inclusion is promoted and employees are encouraged to  express their opinions and their input is sought before making important  organizational decisions.", "Representatives of financial services firms and organizations that  advocate for diversity varied in their views on whether data on the  demographic characteristics of employees at specific financial services  firms should be shared publicly, for example through diversity indexes or  on the company\u2019s website. Representatives from two financial firms told  us that publicly disclosing firm-level employee characteristics would not  benefit the company. More specifically, representatives from two financial  services firms indicated that diversity indexes are of limited value  because they do not indicate whether a firm has made progress on  diversity. One representative noted the reputation of firms that are not  diverse could be damaged, which could make improvement of workforce  diversity more difficult. As discussed earlier, potential candidates\u2019  negative perceptions of the financial services industry\u2019s reputation can  make it difficult for firms to recruit diverse employees.", "In contrast, representatives from one of the financial services firms and  two organizations that advocate for diversity told us that making data on  the diversity of firms\u2019 workforce publicly available was beneficial because  it highlighted firms\u2019 diversity efforts. As an example, representatives from  a large financial services firm told us that the firm regularly participates in  a number of surveys on diversity, which third-parties use to create various  diversity indexes. The indexes highlight this firm\u2019s progress on employee  diversity.
