These factors include the government's role in developing and integrating key technologies, the availability of government personnel to provide the skills needed, and whether the program was managed as part of a portfolio of related programs or as a stand-alone program. For example, programs that assumed more responsibility for developing and integrating key technologies generally had a larger workforce, which was primarily composed of engineering and technical personnel. Program officials GAO met with stated that they generally prefer to use government personnel, but use contractor support when the number of government personnel allocated to the program is not sufficient to meet their needs, the technical skills are not available or are limited within the government, or to fulfill short-term tasks that are too brief to justify hiring government personnel. GAO also found that DOD structured the 11 programs to allow them to leverage available personnel with the necessary skills. Two programs were structured as standalone programs because they were new, high priority, and complex. The other nine programs were managed as a part of a portfolio of related programs. For example, the Air Force's F-15 program office manages a number of programs that add capabilities to the existing system.", "DOD's Financial Management Regulation, which governs the formulation and presentation of DOD's budget request, gives DOD flexibility in how it submits program personnel costs. Consequently, the personnel costs for the 11 programs GAO reviewed were not separately and distinctly identified from other costs. For example, costs for civilian and military personnel are often centrally funded through appropriations categories that support many DOD activities and do not provide information on specific program personnel costs. GAO also found that costs for contractor support are often combined with other costs in individual program budget exhibits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year the Department of Defense (DOD) spends billions of dollars to  develop, produce, and field its weapon systems.

Programs typically  complete a series of milestone reviews and other key decision points that  authorize entry into a new acquisition phase.", "DOD Instruction 5000.02 delegates responsibility for developing and  procuring weapon systems to the military departments and other defense  agencies. This policy does not specify a standard organizational  structure\u2014or program structure\u2014to manage acquisition programs, but  rather states that programs are to be tailored as much as possible to the  characteristics of the product being acquired, and to the totality of  circumstances associated with the program including operational urgency  and risk factors. In addition, DOD\u2019s guidance for managing its workforce  states that the approach should be flexible, adaptive to program changes,  and responsive to new management strategies.", "DOD decides how many personnel and how much program funding to  request for each military department through the Planning, Programming,  Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process. DOD programming policy  requires the military departments and defense agencies to develop a  program objective memorandum that identifies and prioritizes  requirements and total funding needs for the current budget year and 4  additional years into the future. As a part of this process, the  departments also estimate the personnel requirements and program  funding needed to execute their mission, including support for the  commands and PEOs that are responsible for managing acquisition  programs. The results of the PPBE process, including proposed funding  levels for programs, are captured in the President\u2019s annual budget  request to Congress. For example, in its budget request, DOD identifies  and requests the total number of civilian full-time equivalent personnel,  among other things. Congress then authorizes and appropriates the  funding to pay for civilian personnel for each military department. When  budgeting for contracted services, DOD estimates the cost of the tasks to  be performed but not the number of individuals that may perform those  tasks. The military departments, commands and PEOs then distribute  approved funding (which, in part, is used to pay for civilian personnel and  contractor support) to the various organizations including the programs  that are responsible for managing and supporting defense acquisitions.", "Each military department has a different approach to developing its  budget request, and program budgets may be spread across multiple  types of appropriations that are organized into various categories based  on their purpose such as research, development, testing and evaluation,  or procurement. Similarly, the military departments fund their personnel  through several different types of appropriations, including (1) operation  and maintenance; (2) military personnel; and (3) research, development,  test, and evaluation. Requests for funding are included in different  documents and often presented in multiple volumes that can be hundreds  of pages long. DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation provides  instructions for the formulation and presentation of the budget request to  Congress, including general categories of costs that might be included in  program specific budgets.

As shown in  figure 1, the total number of personnel supporting the 11 selected  programs ranged from 30 to 397, and the composition of those personnel  varied based on the needs of the program.", "While program officials cited a number of factors that influenced the  selected programs\u2019 workforce size and composition, including department  priority and complexity, we identified two overarching factors\u2014(1) the  level of program responsibility for technical development and integration,  and (2) the stage of the acquisition life cycle.", "First, we found programs that assume more responsibility for technical  development and integration have more personnel\u2014primarily those that  perform engineering as well as test and evaluation functions. The two  largest of the selected programs we reviewed, the Navy\u2019s Next- Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ Mid-Band) and Columbia Class  Ballistic Missile Submarine (Columbia), assumed significant responsibility  for system development and integration, activities a prime contractor  often undertook for the other programs we reviewed. For example,", "NGJ Mid-Band officials explained that the program is responsible for  overseeing software integration and other efforts directly. In this case,  in addition to personnel assigned to the program office, the Navy  relies on personnel from other organizations such as the Naval Air  Warfare Center Aircraft Division instead of a prime contractor to  develop the software needed to operate the system, conduct system  testing, and manage integration into the platform.", "Similarly, the Columbia program maintains responsibility for many  aspects of development and integration of the submarine including  most hull, mechanical, and electrical components. As a result, about  two-thirds of the 309 personnel supporting the program are  performing engineering and technical tasks.", "In contrast, two programs with fewer personnel, the Air Force\u2019s B-2  Defensive Management System Modernization program (DMS-M) and  Navy\u2019s John Lewis Class Fleet Replenishment Oiler (T-AO), assigned  significant responsibility for development and integration to their  respective prime contractors. The Defensive Management System  Modernization program reported to us that it has a total of 11 engineering  and technical personnel, and T-AO reported that it has 35 engineering  and technical personnel.", "Secondly, we found that program workforce size and composition  changed in response to the amount and nature of the work programs  perform at different stages of the acquisition life cycle. For example,  officials from our selected programs stated they generally planned to  increase in size as they progressed from concept development to system  development and also planned to concurrently increase the proportion of  engineering and technical personnel. Program officials stated that as the  program progresses into the logistics support stage, the number of  personnel supporting the program generally decreases as programs  release some personnel to other assignments while retaining enough  personnel to manage the logistics support stage. Figure 2 shows how the  size and composition of Army\u2019s Joint-Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM)  program changed from concept development into production.", "A program\u2019s total development and procurement cost was not necessarily  related to the number of personnel supporting the program for the 11  programs we reviewed. All 11 selected programs are classified as major  defense acquisition programs and ranged in total acquisitions cost from  $1.5 billion to $103.2 billion. Our analysis, shown in table 1 below,  indicates that total cost did not significantly influence the number of  personnel supporting these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Programs Used Contractor Support to Help Meet Workload Requirements", "paragraphs": ["All 11 selected programs used contractors to help meet workload  requirements, but the level of contractor support varied from  approximately 5 percent to 72 percent of total program personnel, as  shown in figure 3.", "Program officials told us that while they generally try to use civilian or  military personnel to meet workload requirements, they use contractor  support when the number of government personnel allocated to the  program is not sufficient to meet their needs, the technical skills are not  available or are limited within the government, or to fulfill short-term tasks  that are too brief to justify hiring government personnel.", "Program officials stated the extent to which their programs use  contractor support often depends on the number civilians allocated to  the program by the command or PEO. In the case of the three  selected programs with the fewest personnel, the officials stated that  the number of personnel authorizations allocated to the program by  their respective command or PEO did not meet their estimated  workload requirements. For example, the B-2 Defensive Management  System Modernization program estimated it needed 82 personnel in  fiscal year 2018, but was only allocated 13 personnel. As a result,  program officials stated that they used program funds to pay for  contractor support personnel to partially offset the government civilian  staffing shortfalls. Officials at the Air Force Life Cycle Management  Center, the organization that allocated personnel to the B-2 program  office, told us that civilian personnel are allocated based on the risk  associated with each program.", "Program officials told us that contractor support personnel are used to  augment civilian and military personnel by providing skills or technical  expertise that are limited or not available in the government. We found  that over two-thirds of the contractors that supported the 11 selected  programs we reviewed were performing engineering and technical  functions. For example, the John Lewis Class Fleet Replenishment  Oiler (T-AO) is a commercially-derived ship design. As such, program  officials stated that the required engineering expertise resides in the  commercial sector, which resulted in contracted engineers comprising  about 77 percent of the program\u2019s total engineering personnel.", "Program officials also stated that it is more effective to use contractor  support personnel to perform tasks that are relatively short in duration  than to go through the lengthy process of hiring government  personnel. Contracting for support allows the program to grow and  shrink to meet personnel requirements as they change. For example,  Joint Air-to-Ground Missile program officials stated they contracted for  support to execute tasks that are not recurring, such as developing  the required documents to get approval to start production.", "Among the 11 programs we reviewed, the Air Force\u2019s Military Global  Positioning System User Equipment (MGUE) program has a unique  workforce mix. Twenty-four percent of MGUE\u2019s program personnel were  military, and MGUE was the only one of the 11 selected programs that  had FFRDC personnel. Program officials stated that the challenge of  obtaining civilian personnel with the required technical skills in a high  cost-of-living area around Los Angeles, California required the program to  rely more heavily on military personnel and contractors to support the  program. Program officials stated this is in part because it is easier to  assign military personnel in high cost-of-living areas than it is to hire  civilian personnel. In addition, programs in the Air Force\u2019s Space and  Missile Systems Center often rely on FFRDC personnel from Aerospace  Corporation, which is located in the Los Angeles area and provides  technical expertise that is specific to space systems.

For these portfolio-based programs, personnel were  shared across the related programs to help meet fluctuating workload  requirements and maximize personnel resources.", "Figure 4 compares the structure of a standalone program to the structure  of a portfolio-based program with multiple acquisition programs managed  under it. The figure also illustrates how the Air Force\u2019s MGUE program  was situated within the Air Force\u2019s Global Positioning Systems portfolio of  programs.", "In both types of organizational structures illustrated above, the PEO and  the program office have personnel that oversee and support the  programs. These personnel may be dedicated to one program or may  split time between multiple portfolio-based programs. For example, the Air  Force PEO for Space has more than 5,000 military, civilian, and  contractor personnel and is responsible for managing 41 programs, the  responsibility for which is distributed among multiple program offices. One  of these program offices, the Global Positioning Systems program office,  has 628 personnel. This program office is responsible for overseeing and  supplementing the staff of several programs, including the Military Global  Positioning System User Equipment Program, which has about 70  personnel.", "According to PEO and program officials, acquisition programs may be  managed within portfolios for several different reasons:", "Programs are part of the same weapon system platform. The B-2  Defensive Management System Modernization program and the F-15  Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System program are  examples of upgrades to existing systems on mature aircraft and are  managed within a portfolio of programs within the B-2 and F-15  system program offices, respectively.", "Programs have interrelated technologies. The Air Force\u2019s MGUE  program is managed within the GPS program office, which also  manages other GPS satellite and ground system programs.", "Programs have related acquisition strategies. The Navy\u2019s John  Lewis Class Fleet Replenishment Oiler (T-AO) program is managed  within a portfolio of commercially designed and developed ships. This  program is managed within a program office that oversees  approximately 85 types of commercially derived auxiliary ships, boats,  service craft, and special mission ships.", "Regardless of how the acquisition program is structured, other DOD  organizations also provide personnel to support a program\u2019s workload  requirements. There are various specialized DOD organizations that  support programs and provide specific acquisition functions or skill sets,  such as contracting, cost estimating, and engineering. For the 11 selected  programs we reviewed, these organizations supported multiple programs  and were either structured (1) within the PEO that was responsible for the  programs we reviewed or (2) external to the PEO. These external support  organizations include contracting commands, warfare centers, and  engineering organizations that are intended to provide the program  specialized technical expertise from across the military department.  Program officials stated that these organizations may share personnel  with a program on a full or part-time basis, and the shared personnel may  or may not be co-located with the program. Figure 5 is a notional  representation of the way that programs are supported by different  organizations.", "The major defense acquisition programs we reviewed used different  approaches to organizing and leveraging support organizations. For  example:", "The Navy programs we reviewed relied on naval warfare centers to  provide the engineering expertise necessary to design, build,  maintain, and repair the Navy\u2019s aircraft, ships, and submarines. For  example, the Navy\u2019s NGJ Mid-Band relies heavily on warfare centers,  including the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division and the  Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, to support the program.  We found that about 60 percent of the total number of personnel  supporting the program office were from these organizations.", "The Army programs we reviewed relied on support organizations such  as the Army Contracting Command for contracting functions, the  Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center  for engineering expertise, and others to provide life cycle  management support.", "The Air Force programs we reviewed relied on support organizations  established within their command. For example, Air Force\u2019s Life Cycle  Management Center has organizations dedicated to supporting all of  its programs. These organizations provide support, such as  contracting and cost estimating expertise, to programs managed  under the Air Force\u2019s Life Cycle Management Center.

The DOD Financial Management Regulation gives the military  departments flexibility in how they submit program personnel costs. For  example, it suggests the use of \u201ctypical\u201d personnel cost categories for  research, development, test, and evaluation programs to include in their  individual program budget exhibits, but it also allows the departments to  use the personnel cost categories they deem to be the most appropriate  when formulating the budget request. In reviewing DOD\u2019s budget  requests for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 associated with the 11 selected  programs, we found that personnel costs are budgeted for in two main  ways\uf8e7centrally by the military department, or by an individual  program\uf8e7depending on whether the requests are for military, civilian, or  contractor support services. Personnel costs that are program-funded are  included in individual program budget justification requests, whereas  personnel costs that are centrally funded by the military departments are  aggregated into one or more line items in the military department\u2019s  specific appropriation request. Table 2 shows how each military  department funds military and civilian personnel and contractor support  services for major defense acquisition programs.", "Each military department centrally budgets for military personnel through  its respective Military Personnel appropriation requests, which aggregate  personnel funding. These requests include funding for pay, travel, and  other personnel-related costs. As these costs are combined and not  associated with a specific program, we could not determine the costs of  the military personnel supporting the 11 selected programs by reviewing  DOD\u2019s budget justification documentation. In contrast, support contractor  costs were included in each program\u2019s individual budget request.", "The military departments also centrally budget for some civilian  personnel, but there are differences between the departments regarding  which appropriations categories they use to request these funds.  Regardless of the appropriation, we found that the budget requests do not  identify civilian personnel costs by specific program; therefore, we could  not determine the costs of the centrally funded civilian personnel  supporting the 11 programs we selected. For example, in fiscal year  2019, the Air Force requested funding for the civilian personnel  supporting its acquisition programs in development through the Research,  Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation. It grouped the costs  into eight categories that represent various missions such as Cyber,  Network, and Business Systems; Global Battle Management; and Nuclear  Systems. The Air Force budget request indicates the total amount of  funds requested, but does not identify the estimated number of personnel  that these funds will support. Figure 6 illustrates how the Air Force  requested funds for its civilian acquisition workforce in fiscal year 2019.", "The Navy and Army request funds for civilian personnel primarily through  their respective operation and maintenance appropriations. This  appropriation is used to fund a wide range of costs necessary to manage,  operate and maintain worldwide facilities and military operations. These  operation and maintenance budgets are divided into numerous categories  related to various missions, functions, or activities. For example, the  Navy\u2019s Operation and Maintenance budget requests funding for civilian  personnel in several categories, such as \u201cShip Operational Support and  Training\u201d and \u201cAdministration.\u201d The Army Operation and Maintenance  budget requests funding for civilian acquisition personnel in one  combined category labeled as \u201cOther Service Support.\u201d", "Apart from the portions of the budget described above, certain DOD  programs have specific budget exhibits that identify its funding  requirements. In reviewing the exhibits for the 11 selected programs, we  found that individual program requests include personnel costs that are  not funded centrally such as contractor support services costs, but these  costs are generally not specifically identified as personnel costs. For  example, according to program officials, the Air Force\u2019s B-2 Defensive  Management Modernization program requested funds in its exhibit  accompanying the fiscal year 2019 Research Development, Test, and  Evaluation budget request labeled \u201cPMA,\u201d which stands for Program  Management Administration.
