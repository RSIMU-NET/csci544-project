Similar to many small island  economies, Palau\u2019s public sector spending represents a significant  percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP).", "U.S. relations with Palau began when American forces liberated the  islands near the end of World War II. In 1947, the United Nations  assigned the United States administering authority over the Trust  Territory of the Pacific Islands, which included what are now the  Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau.
