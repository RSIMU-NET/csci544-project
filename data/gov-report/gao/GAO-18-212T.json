GAO found that several factors, to include the decline in the fleet of the Navy's amphibious ships from 62 in 1990 to 31 today limited the ability of Marine Corps units to conduct training for other priorities, such as recurring training for home-station units (see figure). As a result, training completion for amphibious operations was low for some but not all Marine Corps units from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. The services have taken steps to address amphibious training shortfalls, such as more comprehensively determining units that require training. However, these efforts are incomplete because the services do not have an approach to prioritize available training resources, evaluate training resource alternatives, and monitor progress towards achieving priorities. Thus, the services are not well positioned to mitigate any training shortfalls.", "The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve coordination between the two services, but have not fully incorporated leading collaboration practices to improve integration of the two services\u2014naval integration\u2014for amphibious operations.

GAO found that for selected virtual training devices, the Marine Corps did not conduct front-end analysis that considered key factors, such as the specific training tasks that a device would accomplish; consider device usage data to support its investment decisions; or evaluate the effectiveness of existing virtual training devices because of weaknesses in the service's guidance. As a result, the Marine Corps risks investing in devices that are not cost-effective and whose value to operational training is undetermined."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss our recent  report on Navy and Marine Corps training for amphibious operations. As  you know, the Navy and the Marine Corps (collectively referred to as U.S.  naval forces) maintain forces that are capable of conducting an  amphibious operation\u2014a military operation that is launched from the sea  by an amphibious force, embarked in ships or craft, with the primary  purpose of introducing a landing force ashore to accomplish the assigned  mission. Training forces for amphibious operations requires extensive  coordination and integration between the Navy and Marine Corps. For  example, the services must schedule amphibious ships to be used for  training, develop operational concepts, and design and execute  exercises. This training also requires significant resources, including  access to Navy ships, and an adequate amount of range space to  realistically conduct live-fire training exercises. The Marine Corps, as well  as the other military services, has stated that the use of virtual training\u2014 including simulators or computer-generated simulations\u2014could help  overcome some of the difficulties associated with training in a live-only  environment.", "According to the Department of Defense (DOD), the future security  environment will require forces to train across the full range of military  operations\u2014including types of operations that have not been prioritized in  recent years, such as amphibious operations. However, over the last 15  years, continued operational deployments have required U.S. naval  forces to focus training for stability and counterinsurgency operations,  while limiting training in amphibious operations, among other areas. The  Navy has stated that the high demand for presence has put pressure on a  fleet that is stretched thin across the globe. Our recent testimony on Navy  readiness highlighted that the Navy has increased deployment lengths,  shortened training periods, and reduced or deferred maintenance to meet  high operational demands, which has resulted in declining ship conditions  and a worsening trend in overall readiness.", "In this context, my testimony today discusses the findings from our recent  September 2017 report on Navy and Marine Corps training for  amphibious operations. Accordingly, this testimony addresses (1) the  Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 ability to complete training for amphibious  operations priorities and factors limiting that training; (2) steps taken by  the Navy and Marine Corps to mitigate any training shortfalls, including  the Marine Corps\u2019 use of selected virtual training devices; and (3) efforts  to improve naval integration for amphibious operations. In addition, I will  highlight several key actions that we recommended in our report that the  Navy and Marine Corps could take to help mitigate training shortfalls and  improve the integration between these services for amphibious  operations.", "To conduct this work, we analyzed unit-level readiness data from fiscal  year 2014 through 2016 and deployment certification reports and  compared those data against the services\u2019 training requirements;  reviewed service training initiatives; interviewed a nongeneralizable  sample of officials from 23 Marine Corps units that were selected based  on their training plans; and selected a nongeneralizable sample of six  Marine Corps virtual training devices to review based on factors such as  target audience. Our September 2017 report includes a detailed  explanation of the methods used to conduct our work. We conducted the  work on which this testimony is based in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, Navy and Marine Corps units completed training for certain  amphibious operations priorities but not others due to several factors. The  most prevalent factor we found that hampered training completion was a  lack of available amphibious ships on which to train. The Navy and  Marine Corps have taken some steps to identify and address amphibious  operations training shortfalls, but these efforts are incomplete.  Specifically, the services\u2019 current approach does not incorporate strategic  training and leading risk management practices. Further, the Marine  Corps has not fully integrated virtual training devices into operational  training. The Navy and Marine Corps have taken some steps to improve  coordination, but the services have not fully incorporated leading  collaboration practices that would help drive efforts to improve naval  integration. We made recommendations to address these issues and  DOD concurred with them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["An amphibious force is comprised of an (1) amphibious task force and a  (2) landing force together with other forces that are trained, organized,  and equipped for amphibious operations. The amphibious task force is a  group of Navy amphibious ships, most frequently deployed as an  Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). The landing force is a Marine Air- Ground Task Force\u2014which includes certain elements, such as command,  aviation, ground, and logistics\u2014embarked aboard the Navy amphibious  ships. A Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the most-commonly  deployed Marine Air-Ground Task Force. Together, this amphibious force  is referred to as an ARG-MEU.", "An ARG consists of a minimum of three amphibious ships, typically an  amphibious assault ship, an amphibious transport dock ship, and an  amphibious dock landing ship. Navy ships train to a list of mission- essential tasks that are assigned based on the ship\u2019s required operational  capabilities and projected operational environments. Most surface  combatants, including cruisers, destroyers, and all amphibious ships,  have mission-essential tasks related to amphibious operations. Figure 1  shows the current number of amphibious ships by class and a description  of their capabilities.", "An MEU consists of around 2,000 Marines, their aircraft, their landing  craft, their combat equipment, and about 15 days\u2019 worth of supplies. The  MEU includes a standing command element; a ground element consisting  of a battalion landing team; an aviation element consisting of a composite  aviation squadron of multiple types of aircraft; and a logistics element  consisting of a combat logistics battalion. Marine Corps units also train to  accomplish a set of mission-essential tasks for the designed capabilities  of the unit. Many Marine Corps units within the command, aviation,  ground, and logistics elements have an amphibious-related mission- essential task. To be certified in the mission-essential task of amphibious  operations, Marine Corps units must train to a standard that may require  the use of amphibious ships.", "The Marine Corps\u2019 use of virtual training devices has increased over time,  and advances in technology have resulted in the acquisition of simulators  and simulations with additional capabilities designed to help individual  Marines and units acquire and refine skills through more concentrated  and repetitive training. For example, the Marine Corps utilizes a  constructive simulation that provides commanders with training for  amphibious operations, among other missions. The Marine Corps has  introduced other virtual training devices to prepare Marines for  operational conditions and for emerging threats, such as devices to  replicate a variety of vehicles for driver training and egress trainers,  among others. The Navy stated it does not utilize virtual training devices  that simulate amphibious operations, including ship-to-shore movement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy and Marine Corps Units Completed Training for Certain Amphibious Operations Priorities but Not Others Due to Several Factors", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2017 report, we found that Navy and Marine Corps  units deploying as part of ARG-MEUs completed required training for  amphibious operations, but the Marine Corps has been unable to  consistently accomplish training for other service amphibious operations  priorities. Specifically, based on our review of deployment certification  messages from 2014 through 2016, we found that each deploying Navy  ARG completed training for the amphibious operations mission in  accordance with training standards. Similarly, we found that each MEU  completed all of its mission-essential tasks that are required during the  predeployment training program. These mission-essential tasks cover  areas such as amphibious raid, amphibious assault, and noncombatant  evacuation operations, among other operations.", "However, we also reported that based on our review of unit-level  readiness data from fiscal year 2014 through 2016, Marine Corps units  were unable to fully accomplish training for other amphibious operations  priorities. These shortfalls include home-station unit training to support  contingency requirements, service-level exercises, and experimentation  and concept development for amphibious operations. For example,  Marine Corps officials cited shortfalls in their ability to conduct service- level exercises that train individuals and units on amphibious operations- related skills, as well as provide opportunities to conduct experimentation  and concept development for amphibious operations.", "In our September 2017 report, we identified several factors that created  shortfalls in training for amphibious operations priorities. Based on our  analysis of interviews with 23 Marine Corps units, we found that all 23 units cited the lack of available amphibious ships as the primary factor  limiting training for home-station units. The Navy\u2019s fleet of amphibious  ships has declined by half in the last 25 years, from 62 in 1990 to 31  today, with current shipbuilding plans calling for four additional  amphibious ships to be added by fiscal year 2024, increasing the total  number of amphibious ships to 35 (see fig. 2).", "Marine Corps officials from the 23 units we interviewed also cited other  factors that limit opportunities for amphibious operations training,  including the following:", "Access to range space. Seventeen of 23 Marine Corps units we  interviewed identified access to range space as a factor that can limit  their ability to conduct amphibious operations training. Unit officials  told us that priority for training resources, including range access, is  given to units that will be part of a MEU deployment, leaving little  range time available for other units.", "Maintenance delays, bad weather, and transit time. Ten of 23  Marine Corps units told us that changes to an amphibious ship\u2019s  schedule resulting from maintenance overruns or bad weather have  also reduced the time available for a ship to be used for training. The  transit time a ship needs to reach Marine Corps units has further  reduced the time available for training.", "High pace of deployments. Five of 23 Marine Corps units told us  that the high pace of deployments and need to prepare for upcoming  deployments limited their opportunity to conduct training for  amphibious operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy and Marine Corps Have Taken Some Steps to Identify and Address Amphibious Training Shortfalls, but These Efforts Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Services\u2019 Approach Does Not Incorporate Strategic Training and Leading Risk Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2017 report, we identified some steps that the Navy  and Marine Corps have taken to mitigate the training shortfall for their  amphibious operations priorities, such as by better defining the amount of  amphibious operations capabilities and capacity needed to achieve the  services\u2019 wartime requirements.

These  alternatives could include utilizing additional training opportunities  during an amphibious ship\u2019s basic phase of training; using alternative  platforms for training, such as Marine Prepositioning Force ships;  utilizing smaller Navy craft or pier-side ships to meet training  requirements; and leveraging developmental and operational test  events.", "The Navy and Marine Corps have not developed a process or set  of metrics to monitor progress toward achieving its amphibious  operations training priorities and mitigating existing shortfalls.  Current reporting systems do not allow officials to assess the services\u2019  progress in achieving amphibious operations priorities or to monitor  efforts to establish comprehensive amphibious operations training  programs. For example, we found that the Marine Corps does not  capture complete data on the full demand for training time with Navy  amphibious ships that could be used for such assessments.", "In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Navy and  Marine Corps develop an approach to prioritize available training  resources, systematically evaluate among training resource alternatives  to achieve amphibious operations priorities, and monitor progress toward  achieving them.
