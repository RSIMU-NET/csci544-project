Some agencies have independent authorities that allow them to provide property to non-federal recipients, such as universities, before or during the GSA disposal process.", "GAO was asked to review how federal agencies provide property to non-federal recipients. This report examines (1) how selected agencies manage unneeded and excess property provided to non-federal recipients and (2) what is known about benefits, effects, and data on property provided to these recipients. GAO analyzed GSA non-federal recipients' reports from fiscal years 2013 to 2017, the most current available at the start of our review, and selected three agencies\u2014USDA, DOE, and DOL\u2014to obtain variety on the methods used to provide property to non-federal recipients. GAO reviewed relevant processes and interviewed officials from GSA, selected agencies, and non-federal recipients."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Labor (DOL) established a process for providing property to non-federal recipients but had limited insight into how these recipients used this property. Officials told GAO that some of the property was disposed of prematurely or not used at all. Such outcomes are inconsistent with agency policy. Whether these instances are widespread or uncommon is unknown due to a lack of consistent monitoring and oversight. For example, DOE officials said they were not monitoring property provided by one of their programs, because they thought the authorization had expired. Without consistent monitoring or oversight, agencies cannot be assured that property is being used as required or achieving intended objectives.", "Selected agencies identified benefits of providing unneeded and excess property to non-federal recipients, but the larger effect of these efforts is unclear due to a lack of reported reliable data. Agency officials said providing property to these recipients saves costs and enhances their mission. However, other sources, including a General Services Administration (GSA) study, reported that using these authorities has reduced the amount of property that would otherwise be available to federal agencies or other recipients. While data on property provided to non-federal recipients are key to understanding the effects of the program, GAO found the government-wide data on property provided to non-federal recipients were unreliable. For example, GAO found that agencies reported incorrect authorities for transactions and underreported excess property provided to such recipients. GSA's current reporting tool and guidance are unclear on how agencies should report these items, and GSA does not have definite plans on what changes it will make to address these government-wide data issues. Until these changes are made, it will be hard to understand the scope of property provided to non-federal recipients and assess the effects on the federal government's disposal process, such as whether federal agencies and other recipients may be missing opportunities to obtain property."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including one to DOL and two apiece to USDA, DOE, and GSA concerning improving oversight, monitoring, and data quality for property provided to non-federal recipients.

In fiscal year 2018, federal agencies reported  holding nearly $1.7 trillion in these assets. Agencies are responsible for  acquiring and managing this property, including identifying when the  property is no longer needed for their mission. When that circumstance  happens, agencies generally declare the property as excess  and report  the property to the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) online  property system, known as GSAXcess. Once in this system, the property  is made available to other federal agencies for their own use or for use by  an eligible non-federal recipient, such as a grantee (for example, public  agencies or non-profit organizations). Property not provided to another  federal agency or an eligible non-federal recipient becomes \u201csurplus\u201d and  then becomes available for transfer to state agencies (which can then  donate it to non-federal entities within their state), or sale to the general  public.

For example, the  Department of Energy (DOE) provides energy-related laboratory  equipment to colleges and universities for educational programs.", "We have previously reported on issues related to managing excess  property and providing property to non-federal recipients. In 2016, we  reported that the Department of Defense prioritized providing excess  property to non-federal recipients over potential federal recipients, and as  a result, federal agencies could be spending federal funds on property  that they might have been able to obtain for free through the disposal  process. More broadly, in 2018, we reported that selected federal  agencies did not have procedures in place to effectively manage, identify,  and dispose of excess property. In each of these reports we made a  recommendation, but agencies have not yet taken action to implement  them.", "Due to congressional interest in how non-federal recipients obtain  property, you asked us to review how federal agencies distribute and  manage property provided to non-federal recipients, and the effect on  federal agencies and other stakeholders in the disposal process.

For each of these agencies, we interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials and reviewed their programs and policies  for providing property to non-federal recipients, and compared selected  agencies\u2019 policies and practices to relevant property-management  regulations and federal internal control standards on monitoring and  oversight. Due to the decentralized nature of property management, our  findings are not generalizable, but illustrate how some federal agencies  provide property to non-federal recipients.", "To assess what is known about the benefits, effects, and reported data on  property provided to non-federal recipients, we reviewed GSA\u2019s property  management regulations, briefings, and a 2003 GSA property utilization  and donation study.

Once an  agency has determined that it no longer has an internal agency need for  its property during agency internal screening, it generally declares and  reports the property as excess. Subsequently, the agency places  information on the property in GSAXcess and then other federal agencies  can screen, request, and, if approved by GSA, obtain the excess property  for their own use or can then provide it to an authorized non-federal  recipient free of charge, minus transportation costs. If no federal agency  (for its own use or use by its eligible non-federal recipient) requests the  excess property from GSAXcess, it then becomes surplus to the federal  government, and a State Agency for Surplus Property can request it and  provide it to eligible non-federal entities in their state, such as local  governments and non-profits. Property not claimed by a State Agency  for Surplus Property can then be sold to the general public typically  through a GSA auction or an approved sales center. Finally, unsold  property may be abandoned and destroyed by the reporting agency.", "Agencies can provide property to non-federal recipients in various ways.  Some agencies, such as USDA and DOE, have been granted their own  independent authorities that allow them to provide their unneeded or  excess property to eligible non-federal recipients, such as public entities  and colleges or universities. Eligible recipients are determined by  program requirements. Other agencies, such as DOL, predominately  provide excess property to non-federal recipients through a grant,  contract, or cooperative agreement. For our three selected agencies, we  focused on how USDA and DOE provided property to non-federal  recipients using their independent authorities and how DOL provided  property to non-federal recipients through contracts. Table 1 describes  these agencies\u2019 programs that provide property to eligible non-federal  recipients. More detail on the independent authorities used by USDA and  DOE can be found in appendix II. Additional information about excess  property previously provided by DOL through cooperative agreements to  apprenticeship programs can be found in appendix III.", "Agencies with independent authorities and programs differ in when they  are able to provide property to non-federal recipients. Such agencies can  allow eligible non-federal recipients, as determined by their agency\u2019s  independent authority, to screen for and request unneeded property  during agency internal screening; in other words, before the property is  declared excess and available to other agencies and entities. For  example, USDA is authorized to provide certain equipment to its  contractors or recipients when doing so would further agricultural  research or teaching objectives. Currently, USDA allows eligible non- federal recipients to screen for all USDA unneeded property through an  USDA internal module in GSAXcess at the same time as its sub- agencies, and before the property is made available to federal agencies  in GSAXcess. If there is no demand for the property by an eligible non- federal recipient during internal screening, it is then made available in  GSAXcess, where other agencies screen for and request property for  their own use or for use by associated non-federal recipients.", "Regardless of how agencies provide property to non-federal recipients,  they are required to annually report to GSA on property they provided.

According to  DOE Office of Asset Management officials, they mistakenly believed  the Economic Development Property authority had expired, and thus  believed they were relieved of their monitoring responsibilities of the  property provided to non-federal recipients. According to officials, they  determined during the course of our review that the authority had not  expired, but stated DOE regulations currently do not reference  Economic Development Property. Officials stated that they did not  know when they had last monitored the program and were not  informed of its activities, even though between fiscal years 2013 and  2017, DOE reported to GSA\u2019s Non-Federal Recipient Report that the  program provided over $154 million in property to non-federal  recipients. According to DOE Office of Asset Management officials,  they were unaware of the DOE sites that reported this data to GSA.

According to  three Laboratory Donation Equipment Program recipients we spoke  with, they had never provided information to DOE, and DOE had not  requested information on property they received. According to Office  of Science officials, they had not regularly contacted Laboratory  Donation Equipment Program recipients because the process for  doing so had been manual, and therefore was unsustainable and led  to poor record-keeping. In March 2019, Office of Science officials  established a new platform that will generate automatic email  notifications to non-federal recipients of Laboratory Equipment  Donation Program property within 11 months of receipt.

They do not expect  to hire a full-time National Property Officer before the end of calendar  year 2019. It is unclear to what extent monitoring activities have been  conducted within the National Office in the absence of a full-time  National Property Officer. We identified discrepancies between the  data provided to us by Job Corps Program officials on the excess  property provided to Job Corps centers, and the data maintained by  the Job Corps centers we visited. For example, we identified items  that had been provided to Job Corps centers that were not tracked in  DOL\u2019s internal property-management system. According to DOL  officials, property under a certain dollar threshold is not tracked  internally, a practice that might account for the discrepancies.  However, we identified several items that were obtained by Job Corps  centers that were over the dollar threshold set by DOL. For example,  one Job Corps center we visited obtained two walk-through metal  detectors that exceeded the dollar threshold but are missing from  DOL\u2019s Job Corps Program data.", "Offices within our selected agencies also did not fully carry out their  oversight responsibilities.

Specifically, effective oversight and communication with key  stakeholders are essential in ensuring that management is held  accountable for carrying out their internal control responsibilities and  meeting agency objectives.

For example, until USDA  established an inventory-compliance metric, sub-agencies did not  regularly conduct required property inventories, and Office of Property  and Fleet Management officials lacked the ability to require them to do  so. As another example, officials said they requested that an office  within USDA reconcile its non-federal recipient reporting data and  make changes to the report to be provided to GSA. However, the  office did not respond to their request, and the Office of Property and  Fleet Management did not have the ability to enforce any corrective  actions not taken. These experiences signaled to the Office of  Property and Fleet Management that this area was not an agency  priority and limited the ability to conduct oversight. However, USDA\u2019s  Office of Property and Fleet Management officials conceded that more  consistent and robust agency-wide oversight of property provided to  non-federal recipients would provide them with a better understanding  of the effectiveness of their property-management controls.", "At DOE, communication problems have interfered with oversight. The  Office of Asset Management is responsible for communicating  information and providing guidance on the agency\u2019s property  management regulations to ensure that program offices are carrying  out their property programs in accordance with those regulations.  However, according to Office of Science officials, they were unaware  that the Laboratory Equipment Donation Program was included in  DOE\u2019s property management regulations, though they had seen  manuals about the program referenced in other DOE guidance.", "In addition, according to Office of Science officials, in the absence of  information about the Economic Development Program in DOE  regulations, they were using DOE guidance that reflected DOE policy  to provide property to non-federal recipients. However, the guidance  used by Office of Science was discontinued in 2011 and, as  mentioned above, is currently under review, according to Office of  Asset Management officials. Office of Asset Management officials  stated that not having official guidance that can be communicated to  the sites about the use of this program is problematic and said they  recognized the need for improved guidance and communication  between the offices going forward.", "In addition to these issues, we have reported in the past that managing  property in general has been a low priority for federal agencies.  Consistent with this report, officials from our three selected agencies  stated that it was not always cost-effective to prioritize the monitoring and  oversight of property programs for various reasons. Some also reported  that, given limited resources, they prioritized high-risk or high-dollar value  property that was still in the federal government\u2019s possession rather than  low-risk or low-dollar valued property within or divested from federal  agency possession. We recognize that higher value property still being  used may require more robust monitoring. However, as described above,  there are good reasons to pay attention to whether the property provided  to non-federal recipients, such as schools and state foresters, is being  used according to regulations and guidance\u2014not the least of which, it  collectively represents millions of dollars in federal resources. As we  described above, our three selected agencies alone provided about $76  million in property to non-federal recipients in fiscal year 2017.", "Furthermore, agencies may consider the property low value, because  they are no longer using it, but if that property, for example an old fire  truck, keeps a federal or non-federal entity from purchasing expensive  new parts, then it is not as clear that the value of the property is actually  low. Finally, no matter the value of the property, agencies without  effective oversight of the authorities and programs they are responsible  for cannot be assured that they are adhering to federal regulations and  meeting program requirements, including whether property is being used  as intended or to its fullest extent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Property Were Reported by Agencies and Non- Federal Recipients but Effect on Government Is Unclear due to Lack of Reliable Data", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Programs Reportedly Benefit Selected Agencies and Non-Federal Recipients but May Reduce Others Agencies\u2019 Access to Property", "paragraphs": ["Officials\u2019 at the three agencies we reviewed told us that providing  unneeded or excess property to non-federal recipients was cost-effective  for them or the federal government. For example, DOE officials reported  that being able to dispose of property during internal screening helped  them dispose of property more quickly than they would be able to do  through GSAXcess and also reduced warehousing costs. USDA officials  told us that being able to provide property to non-federal recipients  potentially saves USDA on warehouse costs, but there are also likely  additional savings since many of their non-federal recipients also obtain  excess property from other federal agencies. DOL officials told us they  save on contracting costs, as the Job Corps centers are able to obtain  federal property for free, versus having to purchase similar property,  whose costs could be built into contracts with federal agencies and paid  for with federal funds.", "Officials at our selected agencies told us that distributing unneeded and  excess property to non-federal recipients also enhances their mission.  For example, a USDA official told us a goal of the Federal Excess  Property Program under NIFA\u2014as managed by the Agricultural Research  Service\u2014was to provide property to non-federal recipients to establish  relationships between USDA and state agricultural schools and programs.  The official told us there is also increased value to USDA from the  partnerships in the program, including an increase in agricultural  experimental work and cooperative educational programs that assist  USDA. DOE Office of Science officials told us that providing the scientific  equipment through the Laboratory Equipment Donation Program  encourages colleges and universities to develop energy-related  programs. In addition, officials told us the program encourages future  scientists to potentially work for DOE in the future. DOL officials told us  that providing property to Job Corps center contractors helps DOL  provide job training for at-risk youth.", "All 17 non-federal recipients we spoke with told us that federal property  received from the selected agencies was beneficial for their program or  department as well. For example, one DOE Laboratory Equipment  Donation Program recipient told us that the equipment received was used  to furnish a teaching laboratory, which the recipient would not have  otherwise been able to purchase due to a limited budget. A state forester  told us that property received from the Forest Service\u2019s Federal Excess  Property Program (such as fire trucks, gloves, and electronics) has had a  real positive effect on rural fire departments because they would  otherwise have been unable to purchase these items due to limited  budgets. Officials from a DOL Job Corps center told us that the property  they obtained as excess from GSAXcess is a lifeline for their operations,  as they were able to obtain a lot of dorm and kitchen equipment to assist  with their operations. See figure 3 below for examples of equipment  obtained by non-federal recipients.", "While the selected agencies and non-federal recipients report benefits,  the agency-specific disposal programs and agreements used at our  selected agencies and other agencies may not benefit all federal  agencies or even non-federal recipients. As we describe in more detail  later in this report, GSA does not have reliable data on the scope of  property provided to non-federal recipients across the federal  government. However, based on our discussions with GSA officials and  other stakeholders, as well as our review of 2003 property utilization and  donation study, when agencies use their independent authority, in some  instances, other stakeholders may not be eligible to acquire the  property.", "First, non-federal recipients can obtain property at multiple points in the  disposal process, a factor that could mean potential recipients get several  chances to obtain property. For example, when agencies, such as USDA  and DOE, provide unneeded property to non-federal recipients, the  property does not enter GSAXcess. Additionally, other federal agencies  and State Agencies for Surplus Property may not be eligible recipients to  obtain unneeded property. According to the GSA property utilization and  donation study, the increase in laws providing agencies with independent  authority to give property to non-federal recipients has reduced the  remaining pool of assets that would have otherwise entered the  government-wide property disposal cycle. Additionally, when property  does enter GSAXcess, an agency may obtain the property and provide it  to a non-federal recipient. While GSA officials said they prioritize giving  the property to the federal agency that plans to use it for its own needs  over a federal agency that plans to provide it to a non-federal recipient,  GSA officials said they are not always aware of how federal agencies  plan to use the property. In this respect, a federal agency may acquire the  excess property for use by a non-federal recipient instead of a federal  agency acquiring the property for its own use. GSA officials also told us  that they did not have data on the amount of property that is provided to  non-federal recipients at the various points of the disposal process. Thus,  it is unknown how often non-federal recipients obtain excess property  from a federal agency, and whether or how often other recipients that  may want excess and surplus property are missing out on property.  Figure 4 illustrates the reduction in property that can occur when non- federal recipients obtain property at various points in the disposal cycle.", "Second, because of the decentralized nature of disposal, some non- federal recipients could benefit more than others. For example, a rural fire  department eligible to receive property under the USDA Forest Service\u2019s  Federal Excess Property Program could potentially obtain property: (1)  during USDA internal screening, (2) from USDA as excess, or (3) through  their State Agency for Surplus Property once the property is deemed  surplus to federal government. Officials from four out of five State  Agencies for Surplus Property told us that they have some recipients that  are eligible to receive property through multiple points in the disposal  process. In contrast, other non-federal entities, such as non-profit  groups, may only be able to obtain property through their State Agency  for Surplus Property because they are not eligible to receive property  under a federal agency-specific program. As a result, these non-federal  entities may have less property available to them and would have to pay  a fee to the State Agency for Surplus Property to obtain the property. In  addition, DOE and USDA officials said they do not advertise their agency- specific property programs, so a smaller pool of eligible recipients may be  competing for and benefiting from the property over those that are  unaware of those programs.

As  previously discussed, DOE reported providing $154 million in unneeded  property to non-federal recipients through the Economic Development  Property program, but DOE officials stated that they do not know if the  data were accurate or complete, in part, because the officials were not  aware the Economic Development Program existed and thus were not  conducting any oversight at the time.

GSA Office of Government-wide Policy officials told us that  they provide a definition sheet, and offer training to each agency on how  to enter data, but they are not sure if agencies are using their guidance.  Even if those inputting data did refer to the sheet, GSA officials told us  that since these are agency-specific programs, they are not aware of all  the ways in which agencies are able to provide property to non-federal  recipients and that the reporting tool may not reflect all the current  authorities and programs used. A DOE official told us that the categories  are not mutually exclusive, a situation that is confusing and can lead to  inconsistent reporting even among offices within DOE.

To address both objectives, we reviewed applicable  federal statutes and regulations pertaining to property disposal, including  General Services Administration (GSA) property management  regulations, and agencies\u2019 independent authorities for providing property  to non-federal recipients.
