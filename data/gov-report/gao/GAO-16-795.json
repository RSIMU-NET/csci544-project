Based on GAO's review of selected physicians, GAO found that the contractors almost always verified and documented the credentials of physicians in the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3) program consistent with the requirements of the contract. In contrast, the contractors did not always verify credentials of the physicians in the Veterans Choice Program (Choice) in a timely manner; and for many physicians, contractors could not produce documentation to support verification consistent with the requirements of the contract. For example, Health Net did not document verification of six Choice physicians' certification to prescribe controlled substances, and TriWest provided insufficient documentation for GAO to determine whether it verified most of the selected Choice physicians' credentials. Both contractors shared plans to address the identified deficiencies.", "VHA lacked a comprehensive strategy for overseeing Health Net's and TriWest's compliance with contract requirements for verifying the credentials of PC3 and Choice physicians. VA's contracts with Health Net and TriWest specify that VHA will review the contractors' credentialing periodically to determine whether the contractors are in full compliance with the terms of the contract. In addition, federal internal control standards call for monitoring, and corresponding guidance suggests that agencies consider having a strategy to ensure that monitoring is effective. However, GAO found that VHA's monitoring is primarily limited to independent reviews of physicians' credentials using primary source databases, rather than oversight of the contractors' processes for verifying physicians' credentials. VHA has evaluated TriWest's documentation of verifying physicians' credentials for PC3 physicians, but not Health Net's, and has not evaluated either contractor for Choice physicians. Additionally, VHA officials provided conflicting information about the scope, frequency, and interpretation of the results of the oversight they do conduct. Without a comprehensive oversight strategy, VHA cannot ensure that Health Net and TriWest are in compliance with the terms of the contract and that veterans are treated by qualified physicians.", "In February 2016, VHA began entering into Choice provider agreements with community physicians to provide Choice care to veterans in certain situations. Under these agreements, VHA staff at each medical facility\u2014rather than the contractors\u2014review Choice physicians' credentials. GAO found that VHA did not require its staff to verify licenses submitted by physicians against the issuing source; rather, they review copies of the licenses. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify potential risk factors, such as opportunities for fraud, due to the absence of controls. Without assessing the risk of not verifying physicians' licenses against the issuing source, VHA does not know if a policy change is needed. Furthermore, VHA lacked plans for overseeing staff across each of its medical facilities with the new responsibility of verifying Choice physicians' credentials under the recently implemented VHA Choice provider agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["VHA should develop a comprehensive oversight strategy that includes monitoring and evaluations of the contractors' verification of PC3 and Choice physicians' credentials, as well as VHA staff's review of Choice physicians; and assess the risk of not verifying Choice physicians' licenses under VHA Choice provider agreements.

To help ensure that veterans are provided timely and accessible  care, the department has purchased health care services from non-VA  community physicians through its community care programs since 1945.  In 2015, VA obligated $10.5 billion for community care. Two more recent  community care programs\u2014Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3)  and the Veterans Choice Program (Choice)\u2014are the first to include  credentials requirements, such as an unrestricted state medical license  and a lack of sanctions that would prevent participation in federally  funded health care programs, in order to demonstrate that physicians are  qualified to provide care to veterans. Credentials verification is an  important means by which health care organizations gain assurance that  patients receive safe, high quality care.", "VA awarded PC3 contracts in September 2013 to Health Net Federal  Services (Health Net) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest). These  contracts require that Health Net and TriWest each develop a regional  network of providers, including physicians, to deliver care to veterans  when care cannot be delivered at a VHA medical facility.

To improve veterans\u2019 access to medical services, Congress enacted the  Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice Act),  which provided, among other things, temporary authority and additional  VA funding to allow veterans who meet expanded eligibility requirements  to obtain health care services from community physicians. The Choice  Act included credentials requirements for physicians to be eligible to  furnish care or services to veterans under the program. In implementing  the Choice Act, VA modified its existing PC3 contracts to include Choice  and required Health Net and TriWest to ensure that participating Choice  physicians possess a specific set of credentials. In addition to Health  Net\u2019s and TriWest\u2019s responsibilities for administering Choice, VHA  recently began entering into agreements with community physicians to  provide Choice care to veterans in situations when the contractors are  unable to do so.

For example,  VHA officials responsible for conducting the reviews were including both  PC3 and Choice physicians in the monthly samples. However, the  officials responsible for overseeing the contracts and reporting the results  to the contractors via the QASPs were reporting the results as specific to  Choice. An analysis of the samples from the monthly reports we reviewed  revealed that 22 percent of physicians sampled were Choice physicians  and the remainder were PC3 physicians. In addition, while federal entities  such as VHA have the discretion to determine appropriate oversight  methods based on an assessment of their own risk and resources, VHA  officials we interviewed disagreed about the needed frequency of these  audits. Specifically, the VHA officials responsible for overseeing the  contracts believe that the officials responsible for auditing VHA programs  should be conducting further audits of credentials verification; however,  the auditing officials told us that they did not have plans to conduct any  additional audits related to credentials verification in fiscal year 2016, for  either PC3 or Choice, due to competing priorities.", "Without a comprehensive oversight strategy, VHA cannot ensure the  contractors are in compliance, and VHA officials may be missing an  opportunity to assess current monitoring activities for effectiveness and  make any changes to their methods. As a result, VHA risks sending  veterans to physicians who do not meet PC3 and Choice credentials  requirements, which could call into question the quality of care provided  to veterans through these two community care programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Did Not Require Its Staff to Verify Licenses and Lacked Specific Plans for Oversight of VHA Choice Provider Agreements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VHA Did Not Require Its Staff to Verify Choice Physicians\u2019 Licenses under Choice Provider Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Under VHA Choice provider agreements, staff at VHA medical facilities  are not required to verify physicians\u2019 licenses. Specifically, staff at the  five VHA medical facilities that participated in the initial implementation  phase of VHA Choice provider agreements told us that they review a  copy of the license submitted by the physician, but they do not verify its  status at the time of review or determine whether the license has any  negative actions taken against it.", "VHA officials told us that they do not consider this process to be  traditional credentialing because VHA staff rely on the physicians to attest  to the accuracy of the information that they submit with their provider  agreement, including that they hold an unrestricted license. However,  they also told us they designed the credentials requirements for VHA  Choice provider agreements to be similar to the Choice contractors\u2019  requirements to avoid any advantages or disadvantages of participation  through VHA. Federal internal control standards state that management  should define risk tolerances and identify potential risk factors, such as  the opportunity for fraud due to the absence of controls. In the absence  of verifying a license against the issuing source under the VHA Choice  provider agreement, VHA may not be able to determine whether a  physician has submitted a copy of a license that was revoked by the state  licensing board before it was due to expire. This could have the  unintended consequence of physicians with licensing problems migrating  to Choice provider agreements with VHA medical facilities where their  licenses are not verified.

Under VHA Choice provider agreements,  which the agency began implementing in February 2016, staff at each of  VHA\u2019s approximately 170 medical facilities have the new responsibility of  reviewing community physicians\u2019 credentials. Specifically, VHA policy on  Choice provider agreements requires medical facility staff to verify that  Choice physicians are not excluded from participation in federally funded  health care programs, to review documented evidence of DEA numbers  and medical licensure, and to conduct annual reverification of these  credentials. At the time of our review, VHA officials did not have any  specific plans for conducting oversight to determine whether medical  facility staff are complying with these requirements.", "VHA\u2019s lack of oversight of medical facility staff reviewing credentials for  physicians involved in VHA Choice provider agreements is inconsistent  with federal standards for internal control, which call for agencies to  establish monitoring activities, and with GAO guidance for internal  controls, which calls for management to have a strategy to ensure that  ongoing monitoring is effective. VHA officials told us they had ideas for  oversight activities, but they had not determined any specific details that a  comprehensive strategy might include, such as the scope, frequency, or  start date for implementing these activities. For example, VHA officials  also told us they are maintaining a temporary database of physicians with  VHA Choice provider agreements, to which staff upload electronic copies  of a physician\u2019s credentials along with the signed agreement. VHA  officials said that in the future, they may conduct periodic audits to check  that facility staff are uploading all of the required documents regarding  physician credentials, but they did not have plans for when such audits  would start or how frequently they might conduct them. In addition, VHA  staff said they have plans to develop a permanent electronic database  that would include a feature to allow individual VHA medical facilities to  conduct their own oversight. However, VHA did not have a timeline for  when this permanent database would be operational.", "Although VHA\u2019s use of VHA Choice provider agreements was in its early  stages at the time of our review, developing a specific plan before results  are expected is important to ensure that the agency can make program  adjustments as needed to achieve desired results. Without conducting  oversight, VHA cannot ensure that staff at each of its medical facilities are  verifying Choice physicians\u2019 credentials consistent with the requirements  of the program.

VHA\u2019s oversight of its  contractors generally does not include the review of credentials file  documentation, and VHA has conducted only one evaluation of the  contractors\u2019 documentation of verifying credentials and has no  documented plans for additional reviews in the future.
