For example, some evaluation criteria contained input or process factors, such as program planning and organizational management. Moreover, some contracts included numerous supporting subfactors that may dilute emphasis on any specific criteria. Although the Federal Acquisition Regulation and NASA guidance require considering the costs and benefits of choosing a CPAF contract, NASA did not perform such analyses. In some cases there appears to be a significant disconnect between program results and fees paid. For example, NASA paid the contractor for the Earth Observing System Data and Information System Core System 97 percent of the available award fee despite a delay in the completion of the contract by over 2 years and an increase in the cost of the contract of more than 50 percent. NASA officials expressed satisfaction with the results of the contracts we reviewed, and this was further evidenced by the extent of fee paid. NASA's satisfaction was based on its evaluations of contractor performance against criteria established in the award-fee plan.

Much of the guidance on award-fee contracting was issued in  response to weaknesses in CPAF contracting practices identified by NASA  internal reviews and NASA\u2019s Office of Inspector General in the early  1990s. Those weaknesses included the awarding of excessive fees with  limited emphasis on acquisition outcomes (end results, product  performance, and cost control); rollover of unearned fee; use of base fee;  and the failure to use both positive and negative incentives. NASA updated  its award-fee guide in 1994, 1997, and 2001 to explain and elaborate on its  award-fee policy. The 2001 revision also reflects the FAR\u2019s additional  emphasis on using performance-based contracts.", "NASA\u2019s award-fee guide emphasizes tying fees to outcome factors. The  guide states that outcome-based factors are the least administratively  burdensome type of evaluation factor and should provide the best  indicator of overall success. The award-fee guide warns against  micromanaging performance and diluting the emphasis of criteria by  spreading the potential award fee over a large number of performance  evaluation factors. Instead, the guide recommends selecting broad  performance evaluation factors, such as technical factors, project  management, and cost control supplemented by a limited number of  subfactors under these factors.", "Cost control is required to be a key performance evaluation factor in  award-fee performance evaluation plans, largely because of past  performance issues in which contractors were paid millions of dollars in  fees on contracts that were experiencing hundreds of millions of dollars in  cost overruns. The NASA FAR Supplement states that cost control shall  be no less than 25 percent of the total weighted evaluation factors when  explicit evaluation factor weightings are used. The NASA FAR Supplement  states that emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other  performance requirement objectives, and the contractor should not be  incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall performance is  significantly degraded.", "NASA\u2019s regulations prohibit rolling over unearned fee to subsequent  evaluation periods for service contracts. For such contracts, each interim  evaluation and the last evaluation are final. Another key element of the  current award-fee regulations is an increased emphasis on overall  contractor performance and the end product, rather than on incremental  progress. NASA requires conducting interim evaluations on end item  contracts until final product delivery to monitor performance prior to  contract completion and establish the basis for making interim payments.  At the end of the contract, a final evaluation is conducted and the  contractor\u2019s total performance is evaluated against the award-fee plan to  determine total earned award fee. For example, the contractor may be  evaluated and paid an interim fee once every 6 months until the product is  delivered. During the final evaluation, the contractor\u2019s performance is  evaluated to determine total earned award fee. The final evaluation may  result in the contractor retaining the fee previously awarded or receiving  additional or less fee than previously awarded and thus refunding a  portion of the fee to the government. The final evaluation provides NASA  the opportunity to make an award-fee decision based on actual quality,  total cost, and ability to meet the contract schedule at the point the final  product is delivered.", "Further, under the award-fee policy in effect prior to the 1994 and  subsequent revisions to the guidance, base fee was allowed on all CPAF  contracts. NASA\u2019s current regulations prohibit the use of base fee on  service contracts and restrict the use of base fee on end item contracts,  such as for hardware. When base fee is used, it is not to exceed 3 percent  of estimated contract costs and it should only be paid if the final award-fee  evaluation is satisfactory or better. We note that base fee, which was paid  on two of the three end item contracts we reviewed, did not exceed 3  percent, and none of the seven service contracts included base fee.", "Another issue addressed by NASA\u2019s regulations is the use of both positive  and negative performance incentives in its CPAF contracts. The NASA  FAR Supplement provides that award-fee contracts with primary  deliverables of hardware and with a total estimated cost and fee of greater  than $25 million require both kinds of incentives based on measurements  of hardware performance against objective criteria. Performance  incentives are separate and distinct from award fee and measure  contractor performance up to delivery and acceptance. Performance  incentives are designed to reward contractors when performance of  delivered hardware is above minimum contract requirements. For  example, if the government establishes a specified level of objective  performance for a product that the contractor exceeds, the contractor can  be paid a performance incentive in addition to the award fee already paid.  If the contractor just meets this measure, it cannot receive an additional  performance incentive and keeps the award fee already paid. If the  contractor fails to meet the measure, however, it must pay a negative  performance incentive fee that reduces or eliminates the entire award fee.", "To address inconsistencies among NASA centers in how they evaluate  contractor performance, the current award-fee regulations also provide a  uniform rating system to be used for all NASA award-fee contracts. It  includes adjectival ratings as well as a numerical scoring system of 0-100.  Scores of 61-70 percent are considered satisfactory, and the regulations  specify that contractors receiving a rating of less than 61 percent will not  receive any fee. A contractor is not to be paid any base fee or award fee  for less than satisfactory overall performance.", "NASA\u2019s award-fee guide encourages the use of performance-based  contracts for the procurement of services and supplies. The guide states  that constructing performance-based contracts that clearly define  performance requirements, include easily understood performance  standards, and have an objective incentive mechanism will result in  contractors having a clearer understanding of the government\u2019s  expectations and will ultimately facilitate enhanced contractor  performance.", "Finally, because of the cost and administrative burden associated with  administering award-fee contracts, the FAR and NASA\u2019s award-fee guide  specify consideration of the costs and benefits of using a CPAF contract  before committing to this contract type. Through an evaluation of the  administrative costs versus the expected benefits, the contracting officer  should be able to assess whether the benefits the government gains  through a CPAF contract will outweigh the additional costs of overseeing  and administering the contract.

Technical performance  and program management were grouped together in one primary  performance evaluation factor, and business management and cost  performance were grouped together in the other primary performance  evaluation factor. There were 9 subfactors under technical performance  and 12 subfactors under program management, including quality and  effectiveness of the contractor\u2019s scheduling system. Under business  management and cost performance, 17 evaluation subfactors and elements  were to be considered, including compliance with general contract  provisions and clauses and weekly scheduling of teleconferences to  determine schedule status.
