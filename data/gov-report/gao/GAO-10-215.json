In response to a congressional request, GAO, in 2008, reviewed Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Coast Guard sexual assault prevention and response programs and recommended a number of improvements. GAO was subsequently asked to evaluate the extent to which (1) DOD has addressed GAO's 2008 recommendations and further developed its programs, (2) DOD has established a sexual assault database, and (3) the Coast Guard has addressed GAO's 2008 recommendations and further developed its programs. To do so, GAO analyzed legislative requirements and program guidance, interviewed officials, and compared database implementation efforts to key information technology best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has addressed four of GAO's nine recommendations from 2008 regarding the oversight and implementation of its sexual assault prevention and response programs. For example, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) evaluated department program guidance for joint and deployed environments, and it evaluated factors that may hinder access to health care following a sexual assault. But DOD's efforts to address the other recommendations reflect less progress. For example, GAO recommended that DOD develop an oversight framework, to include long-term goals and milestones, performance goals and strategies, and criteria for measuring progress. However, GAO found that the draft framework lacks key elements needed for comprehensive oversight of DOD's programs, such as criteria for measuring progress and an indication of how it will use the information derived from such measurement to improve its programs. Until OSD incorporates all key elements into its draft oversight framework, it will remain limited in its ability to effectively manage program development to help prevent and respond to sexual assault incidents. DOD acknowledges that more work remains in order to fully develop its oversight framework. DOD has taken steps to begin acquiring a centralized sexual assault database. However, it did not meet a legislative requirement to establish the database by January 2010, and it is unclear when the database will be established because DOD does not yet have a reliable schedule to guide its efforts. Also, key system acquisition best practices associated with successfully acquiring and deploying information technology systems, such as economically justifying the proposed system solution and effectively developing and managing requirements, have largely not been performed. OSD officials said they intend to employ these acquisition best practices. Until this is accomplished the program will be at increased risk of not delivering promised mission capabilities and benefits on time and within budget. While the Coast Guard has partially implemented one of GAO's two recommendations for further developing its sexual assault prevention and response program, it has not implemented the other. In June 2009, the Coast Guard began assessing its program staff's workload, which represents progress in addressing GAO's recommendation to evaluate its processes for staffing key installation-level positions in its program. However, it has not addressed GAO's recommendation to develop an oversight framework. Further, the Coast Guard lacks a systematic process for assembling, documenting, and maintaining sexual assault incident data, and lacks quality control procedures to ensure that the program data being collected are reliable. In fiscal year 2008, for example, different Coast Guard offices documented conflicting numbers of sexual assault reports: the Coast Guard Program Office documented 30, while the Investigative Office documented 78. The Coast Guard had to resolve this significant discrepancy before it could provide its data to DOD. Without a systematic process for tracking its data, the Coast Guard lacks reliable knowledge on the occurrence of sexual assaults."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Sexual assault is a crime that has a far-reaching negative impact on  communities, families, and individuals and has additional implications for  the military services because it undermines their core values, degrades  mission readiness and esprit de corps, subverts strategic goodwill, and  raises financial costs. Since we reported on these implications in 2008,  incidents of sexual assault have continued to occur; in fiscal year 2008, the  Department of Defense (DOD) reported nearly 3,000 alleged sexual assault  cases, and the U.S. Coast Guard reported about 80. However, it is  impossible to accurately analyze trends or to draw conclusions from these  data about the incidence of sexual assault in the military services because,  as we have previously reported, DOD and the Coast Guard have not been  using standardized reporting requirements.", "Since 2004, Congress has repeatedly taken steps to address sexual assault  in the military, including passing legislation that directs the Secretary of  Defense to develop a comprehensive policy for DOD on the prevention of  and response to sexual assaults involving members of the Armed Forces.  The comprehensive policy is to include procedures for confidentially  reporting sexual assault incidents. Further, the Secretary of Defense is  required to submit an annual report to Congress on reported sexual  assault incidents involving servicemembers. In 2008, we issued two  reports that have helped inform congressional deliberations on sexual  assault in the military; the first, in January 2008, addressed sexual assault  at the DOD and Coast Guard academies, while the second, in August 2008,  addressed sexual assault in the military and Coast Guard services. Our  August 2008 report found that while DOD and the Coast Guard have taken  positive steps to prevent and respond to sexual assault, program  implementation was hindered by several issues, such as the lack of an  oversight framework\u2014that is, a plan to improve the Office of the Secretary  of Defense\u2019s (OSD) oversight of the programs; limited support from some  commanders; and training that was not consistently effective.  Accordingly, we made a number of recommendations to improve DOD and  Coast Guard programs, including recommending the development of an  oversight framework to assess program effectiveness and the evaluation of  program guidance, training, and installation-level staffing processes to  enhance program implementation. We also raised as a matter for  congressional consideration that the Coast Guard be required to annually  submit to Congress sexual assault incident and program data that are  methodologically comparable to those required of DOD. DOD and the  Coast Guard concurred with all of the recommendations in our August  2008 report, which are reprinted in the Background section of this report.  In addition, we testified twice before your Subcommittee: in July 2008, to  discuss our preliminary observations on DOD\u2019s and the Coast Guard\u2019s  sexual assault prevention and response programs, and in September 2008,  to discuss the findings and recommendations included in our August 2008  report.", "In November 2008, you requested that we continue to monitor DOD and  Coast Guard efforts to strengthen the implementation and oversight of  their respective sexual assault prevention and response programs.

DOD\u2019s directive defines sexual assault as  follows:  \u201cintentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, threats,  intimidation, abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or  cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape, forcible sodomy  (oral or anal sex), and other unwanted sexual contact that is  aggravated, abusive or wrongful (to include unwanted and  inappropriate sexual contact), or attempts to commit these acts.  \u201cConsent\u201d means words or overt acts indicating a freely given  agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person.  An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means  there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or  submission resulting from the accused\u2019s use of force, threat of  force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute  consent. A current or previous dating relationship by itself or the  manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the  sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent.\u201d", "In October 2008, Congress passed the Duncan Hunter National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, which includes a provision  requiring the Secretary of Defense to implement a centralized, case-level  database for the collection and maintenance of information regarding  sexual assaults involving members of the Armed Forces. The law  specifies that the database include information, if available, about the  nature of the assault, the victim, the offender, and the outcome of any legal  proceedings associated with the assault, and requires DOD to implement  the database by January 2010\u2014which is 15 months from the day of its  enactment.", "In OSD, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has  the responsibility for developing the overall policy and guidance for the  department\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response program.

First, OSD established a  working group to address our recommendation to review and evaluate the  adequacy of DOD policies for implementing its sexual assault prevention  and response program in joint and deployed environments. Based on the  working group\u2019s findings, OSD submitted a memorandum to the Joint Staff  in April 2009 detailing its suggested revisions to joint policy, which a Joint  Staff official told us they are using to modify related publications.  Additionally, according to a Joint Staff official, the Joint Staff has issued  interim guidance to support the implementation of sexual assault  prevention and response programs in joint and deployed environments  until the new joint publications are approved.", "Second, the military service secretaries have taken a variety of steps to  address our recommendation to emphasize responsibility for program  support to all levels of command. For example, the military services\u2019 top  leadership spoke at their respective services\u2019 sexual assault prevention  summits, during which they emphasized the need for \u201cownership\u201d of the  programs and commitment to the prevention of and response to sexual  assault. Specifically, in the spring of 2009, the Secretary of the Army spoke  to noncommissioned officers\u2014the personnel responsible for program  implementation\u2014on the importance of modifying the Army\u2019s culture to  actively reject sexual assault and other inappropriate behavior. In the fall  of 2009, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy and the Commandant of  the Marine Corps gave similar presentations to their personnel, during  which they stressed their commitment to eradicating sexual assault in the  military services. The military services have taken even more far-reaching  steps to relay their support for and to commit resources to sexual assault  prevention and response programs. For example, the Secretary of the  Navy recently established the Navy\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office that reports directly to the Secretary, which Navy officials  assert will foster additional support and accountability for its sexual  assault program initiatives. The Marine Corps, following a review of its  program staffing, established full-time Sexual Assault Response  Coordinator positions at four installations with the highest troop  concentrations and is in the process of establishing full-time coordinator  positions at installations with at least 1,000 troops as a way to better  manage its sexual assault prevention and response programs. Additionally,  the Army has incorporated an assessment of sexual assault program  awareness into promotional boards for noncommissioned officers to  promote accountability for the implementation of prevention and response  initiatives.", "DOD has also taken a variety of steps to emphasize support for and to  further develop its sexual assault prevention and response programs. For  example, in fiscal year 2008, representatives from OSD and the military  services visited selected military installations to assess, among other  things, the extent to which commanders\u2014company and field grade  officers\u2014support sexual assault prevention and response programs. OSD  found that while most program personnel had demonstrable support from  their command, command support of sexual assault prevention and  response programs varied from installation to installation, and stronger  command support of the program was required. OSD further reported that  it is working with its stakeholders to address its findings. Additionally,  each of the military services has incorporated interactive, scenario-based  training programs to promote increased involvement by participants and  to enhance the retention of the material being presented. For example, the  Army contracts with a company that offers a nationally recognized  presentation called \u201cSex Signals\u201d\u2014a 90-minute program that uses  interactive skits to address the topics of dating, rape, consent, and  intervention. The Air Force has implemented bystander intervention  training that incorporates techniques such as role-playing to motivate  servicemembers to take actions if they see, hear, or otherwise recognize  signs of an inappropriate or unsafe situation. The Marine Corps has  implemented and the Navy is in the process of adopting a program called  Mentors in Violence Prevention training. Like the Air Force\u2019s program, this  consists of role-playing exercises that allow students to construct and  practice ways to respond or intervene in incidents of harassment, abuse,  or violence.", "Third, OSD chartered the Health Affairs Sexual Assault Task Force to  address our recommendation to evaluate and develop an action plan to  address factors that may prevent or discourage servicemembers from  seeking health services. In March 2009, the task force made a number of  recommendations intended to improve the availability of health care, such  as (1) chartering a military health system Sexual Assault Health Care  Integrated Policy Team to review department-level policies regarding  clinical practice guidelines, standards of care, research gaps and  opportunities, personnel and staffing, training requirements and  responsibilities, continuity of care, and in-theater equipment and supplies;  (2) drafting model memorandums of understanding for use by all service  military treatment facilities as they establish continuity of care  relationships with local community providers; and (3) reviewing DOD  policy, including performing peer reviews of sexual assault cases to ensure  that they are aligned with civilian practices.", "Fourth, in August 2008, the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the  Military Services began its examination of matters relating to sexual  assault, as we recommended.

Associated  with this progression, DOD has taken steps to begin employing a number  of key information technology acquisition management disciplines that are  provided for in DOD and related guidance.

Within DOD, the means for avoiding business system  duplication and overlap is the department\u2019s process for assessing  compliance with DOD\u2019s business enterprise architecture and its  associated investment review and decision-making processes. DOD  officials told us that the database was assessed for compliance with  the business enterprise architecture and received investment review  board approval as compliant in July 2009. However, a complete set of  system-level architecture products needed to perform a thorough and  meaningful compliance assessment are not yet available. As we have  previously reported, architecture compliance is not a onetime event  but rather a determination that needs to be made at key junctures in a  system\u2019s acquisition life cycle.

Further, according to Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) guidance, justifications for an investment should  include an analysis of the investment\u2019s total life cycle cost. DOD  developed a business case for the database in June 2009 that provides  the department\u2019s proposal and justification for its database (i.e.,  system solution), and this business case includes a program cost  estimate of $12.6 million. While the cost estimate was derived in  accordance with some best practices identified in relevant cost  estimating guidance, such as estimating software costs with a  parametric tool that incorporates GAO cost estimating best practices  and relying on the costs of analogous existing systems, it was not done  in accordance with others. For example, it does not include all costs  over the system\u2019s life cycle, and it has not been adjusted to account for  program risks. More specifically, program officials stated that the $12.6  million does not include program office and management costs,  relevant development costs (e.g., testing), or sustainment costs (i.e.,  operations and maintenance). OSD officials told us that they intend to  develop a reliable cost estimate once the development contract is  awarded.

While the business case includes an explanation of  why the database is needed, it does not address the costs and benefits  associated with each of the four database alternatives that were  considered (i.e., commercial-off-the-shelf case management system  software product, custom-built system, enhancement of an existing  military service system, or maintenance of the status quo). Moreover,  the four alternatives were not assessed on the basis of net present  value, including using the proper discount rate to account for inflation.  Instead, only the selected alternative was evaluated quantitatively.  Without a meaningful analysis of alternatives, DOD lacks sufficient  assurance that it has selected the most cost-effective system solution.", "Requirements development and management: Well-defined and  well-managed requirements are the cornerstone of effective system  development and acquisition. Effective requirements development  and management includes, among other things, (1) effectively eliciting  user needs early and continuously in the system life cycle process, (2)  establishing a stable baseline set of requirements and placing the  baseline under configuration management, (3) ensuring that system- level requirements can be traced back to higher-level business or  operational requirements (e.g., concept of operations) and forward to  system design documents (e.g., software requirements specification)  and test plans, and (4) controlling changes to baseline requirements.  DOD has begun to take steps to engage users in the development of  requirements. For example, it formed a working group composed of  representatives from each of the military services and the National  Guard to develop high-level system requirements. Further, program  officials stated that additional actions are planned or under way to  reach agreement on system interfaces, which is important given that  the database is to draw data from multiple systems to satisfy statutory  requirements. They also said that users will be further involved in  developing requirements. For example, DOD is working with the Air  Force and National Guard to define more specific functional,  performance, and data requirements, and has initiated discussions  with the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to do the same. In addition,  program officials stated that once the high-level system requirements  are baselined, the Change Control Board, comprising representatives  from DOD and the user community, will be established to control  changes to the baseline requirements. While these ongoing and  planned actions are positive, they represent only the beginning of a  series of actions that are associated with effectively defining and  managing requirements over a system\u2019s acquisition life cycle. To the  extent that this series of actions is not well detailed and implemented,  the risk of the database not performing as intended, and costing more  and taking longer to implement than necessary, is increased.", "Test management: According to DOD and other relevant guidance,  system testing should be progressive, meaning that it should consist of  a series of test events that first focus on the performance of individual  system components, then on the performance of integrated system  components, followed by system-level tests that focus on whether the  system (or major system increments) are acceptable, interoperable  with related systems, and operationally suitable to users. Among  other things, effective testing should ensure that (1) all test events are  governed by a well-defined test management structure, (2) each test  event is executed in accordance with well-defined plans, and (3) the  results of each test event are captured and used to ensure that  problems discovered are disclosed and corrected. Program officials  stated that they plan to work with the development contractor to  establish an effective test management structure, develop test plans,  and capture and resolve problems found during testing. In addition,  they plan to engage an independent test organization.

Relevant guidance, including DOD\u2019s Risk  Management Guide for DOD Acquisition, recognizes the importance  of conducting effective risk management. Among other things,  effective risk management includes (1) establishing and implementing  a written plan and defined process for risk identification, analysis, and  mitigation; (2) assigning responsibility for managing risks to key  stakeholders; (3) encouraging programwide participation in risk  management; and (4) examining the status of identified risks during  program milestone reviews.

While such progress is noteworthy, DOD\u2019s  efforts have not fully established a sound management framework, which  must build upon the foundation of a comprehensive strategic framework  that guides program development and implementation. Without such a  foundation, DOD\u2019s programs lack the institutional support, long-term  perspective, and clear lines of accountability that are needed to withstand  the administrative, fiscal, and political pressures that confront federal  programs on a daily basis. Until OSD finalizes and fully implements its  oversight framework and strategic plans, it will continue to lack the ability  to synergize its prevention and response initiatives, and it may not be able  to effect the change in military culture that is needed to ensure that  programs are institutionalized. Additionally, successful implementation of  the oversight framework will require the personal involvement of top DOD  leadership to maintain the long-term focus on and accountability for  program objectives.", "While the Coast Guard is not generally subject to the departmental  program direction or statutory requirements that apply to DOD, it  continues to proactively develop its sexual assault prevention and  response program. The Coast Guard has, however, experienced challenges  similar to those of DOD because it lacks the long-term strategic  perspective needed to structure its program development and  implementation. Until the Coast Guard develops an oversight framework  that includes specific management improvement steps, key milestones,  and performance measures, it will be unable to accurately demonstrate  that its programs are achieving its goals of establishing a culture of  prevention, sensitive response, and accountability. Further, the Coast  Guard may not be able to demonstrate that program elements, such as its  sexual assault prevention and response training, are being implemented in  a manner that most effectively ensures its achievement of program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following 10  actions:    To improve the management, strategic planning, and  comprehensiveness of OSD\u2019s oversight of the department\u2019s sexual  assault prevention and response programs, direct the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to strengthen OSD\u2019s oversight  framework by  identifying how the results of performance assessments  will be used to guide the development of future program  initiatives,  identifying how OSD\u2019s program resources correlate to its  achievement of strategic program objectives, and  correlating its oversight framework to the program\u2019s two  strategic plans so that program objectives, timelines, and  strategies for achieving objectives are synchronized.", "To enhance visibility over the incidence of sexual assaults involving  DOD servicemembers, the department\u2019s sexual assault prevention and  response programs, and the pending implementation of the Defense  Sexual Assault Incident Database, direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to standardize the type, amount,  and format of the data in the military services\u2019 annual report  submissions.", "To enhance the oversight of the sexual assault prevention and  response program in DOD, direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness to ensure that the development and  implementation of the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database  includes adherence to the following key system development and  acquisition management processes and controls developing a reliable integrated master schedule that  addresses the nine key practices discussed in this report,  adequately assessing the program\u2019s overlap with and  duplication of related programs through architecture  compliance,  adequately justifying investment in the proposed approach  on the basis of reliable estimates of life cycle costs and  benefits,  effectively developing and managing system requirements,  adequately testing system capabilities, and  effectively managing program risks.", "We are recommending that the Commandant of the Coast Guard take the  following three actions:    To improve the oversight and accountability of the Coast Guard\u2019s  sexual assault prevention and response program  establish a systematic process for collecting, documenting,  and maintaining sexual assault incidence data, and  establish quality control processes to ensure that program  information collected is valid and reliable.", "To improve execution of sexual assault prevention and response  programs, we recommend that the Commandant of the Coast Guard  establish and administer a curriculum for all key program personnel to  ensure that they can provide proper advice to Coast Guard personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, both DOD and the Coast  Guard concurred with all of our recommendations. DOD noted in its  comments that our report contained technical inaccuracies, which we  addressed where appropriate, based on the technical comments received  from both DOD and the Coast Guard. Further, DOD asserted that the  report also contained misstatements that improperly diminished the  department\u2019s efforts to address our recommendations. We believe that our  report accurately represents DOD\u2019s progress to address our  recommendations from 2008. DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix  II, and the Coast Guard\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "In concurring with our recommendations aimed at improving the  management, strategic planning, and comprehensiveness of OSD\u2019s  oversight of the department\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response  programs\u2014including that OSD should strengthen its oversight framework  by (1) identifying how the results of performance assessments will be used  to guide the development of future program initiatives, (2) identifying how  OSD\u2019s program resources correlate with its achievement of strategic  program objectives, and (3) correlating its oversight framework with the  program\u2019s two strategic plans\u2014DOD commented that several efforts are  underway or are planned to address these issues. For example, DOD  stated that in the early part of 2010, it will have a plan in place that details  how it will track its progress toward the performance objectives laid out in  the DOD-wide strategic plan, and it will develop a procedure to report  back on progress toward objectives and any needed corrective steps. DOD  also stated that starting with the 2012 budget cycle, OSD plans to align its  budget categories with specific performance objectives laid out in its  strategic plan. Further, DOD noted that the process it plans to use to track  its progress toward performance objectives will also allow the department  to synchronize the objectives, timelines, and strategies of its two strategic  plans. We commend DOD for taking immediate steps in response to our  recommendations, and encourage the department to continue taking  positive actions toward fully implementing them.", "In its concurrence with our recommendation that the department  standardize the type, amount, and format of the data in the military  services\u2019 annual report submissions, DOD acknowledged that achieving  uniformity among the military services for all required data elements will  greatly enhance its oversight capabilities. DOD added that it recently  established definitions for case disposition data and developed a  standardized program report template, and that both are being used by the  military services to compile their respective data for the department\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 report on sexual assault in the military services. DOD  stated that the comprehensive process of linking all of its data elements  will ultimately be accomplished through its development of the Defense  Sexual Assault Incident Database. Our report credits DOD with taking  initial steps toward developing standardized data elements and definitions,  and acknowledges the data template it developed and is using to collect a  more standardized set of data from the military services for the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2009 annual report to Congress. However, as we  noted in our report, OSD officials stated that full standardization of data  elements and definitions will not be achieved until it implements the  Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database\u2014for which DOD does not  currently have a reliable implementation schedule. While we recognize  that this will be a complex and time-consuming task, we continue to assert  that the full establishment and implementation of standardized data  elements and definitions will facilitate a more comprehensive  understanding of DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response programs.", "In concurring with our recommendation to develop a reliable integrated  master schedule for the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database, DOD  stated that it will give priority to doing so, and will follow GAO schedule  estimating guidance. However, it added that while the department has thus  far developed schedules that it characterized as capturing broader scope  key activities, it would not be able to capture key schedule activities or  estimate a timeframe for identifying key activities that are fundamental to  developing a reliable schedule until it acquired the assistance of the  system development contractor. DOD noted that this is because only the  contractor will know the steps and time required to adopt proprietary  materials to DOD\u2019s requirements for the database. We understand the role  that the development contractor plays in developing a reliable integrated  master schedule, which is why our recommendation does not specify a  timeframe for developing the schedule, and thus allows DOD to first  acquire a contractor\u2019s services. Further, while we agree with the  department\u2019s comment that our report does not include an assessment of  the viability of a 15-month deadline contained in statute for the  database\u2019s design, acquisition, and implementation, we note that we told  program officials during the course of our review that such an assessment  was not part of the scope of our work because the 15-month deadline was  a statutory requirement rather than a DOD schedule-driven milestone.", "In concurring with our recommendation to adequately assess the  program\u2019s overlap with related programs through architecture compliance,  the department stated that it acknowledges the benefits derived from  doing so. It added, however, that our report inaccurately asserts that DOD  has not complied with DOD guidance governing architecture compliance  by stating that a complete set of system-level architecture products are not  yet available to perform a thorough architecture compliance assessment.  In this regard, it stated that DOD guidance does not call for the  development of system-level architecture products until the Technology  Development Phase in the Defense Acquisition System. We agree with the  department\u2019s comment as to the timing of system-level architecture  products, which is why we do not conclude that DOD has not assessed  architecture compliance. As stated in this report, architecture compliance  is not a onetime event but rather a determination that needs to be made at  key junctures in a system\u2019s acquisition life cycle. Thus, the intent of our  statement and our recommendation is to emphasize the importance of  conducting compliance activities once a complete set of system-level  architecture products is available.", "In concurring with our recommendation to adequately justify investment  in the proposed database approach on the basis of reliable estimates of life  cycle costs and benefits, the department stated that it agreed that the cost  estimate in the existing business case does not account for all life cycle  costs and risks. However, it added that DOD guidance does not require  comprehensive cost estimates in the business case and that the cost  estimate in the business case was derived using cost estimating best  practices. While we agree that DOD guidance does not explicitly state that  business case cost estimates must be comprehensive, both DOD guidance  and OMB guidance state that these cost estimates should include all costs  over the system\u2019s life cycle, which is a recognized best practice. Further,  while the cost estimate was derived in accordance with some cost  estimating best practices, such as estimating software costs with a  parametric tool and relying on the costs of analogous existing systems, it  was not done in accordance with others. For example, it was not risk  adjusted. Further the business case did not include a comparison of  alternatives on the basis of net present value.", "In concurring with our recommendation to effectively develop and manage  system requirements, DOD noted that it has continued to work with the  military services in developing system requirements and that its progress  in doing so is much greater than our report states. It also noted that since  the database was legislated, Congress expanded its annual sexual assault  reporting requirements, which in turn necessitated additional  requirements development work with stakeholders. Further, it stated that  it will institute a Change Control Board, which is a key requirements  management control mechanism, and is using a range of system life cycle  management tools that support requirements development and  management. We support DOD\u2019s continued efforts to work with  stakeholders to further develop requirements and capture them in a range  of requirements documents, as such efforts are consistent with our  recommendation. Also consistent with our recommendation are its plans  to institute a Change Control Board and use relevant requirements-related  tools.", "In concurring with our recommendation to adequately test system  capabilities, DOD stated that our report does not sufficiently describe its  efforts to develop a detailed test plan defining the program\u2019s testing  approach and strategy, including the entrance and exit criteria for each  testing phase. We agree that our report does not cite the development of  this plan because no such plan was provided to us as part of the  documentation set submitted for the database\u2019s milestone acquisition  approval, nor were we made aware of the existence of such a plan.  Moreover, program officials told us that a test plan would be developed  after the contractor was hired, and DOD\u2019s comments on our draft report  acknowledge that a final test plan has yet to be created.", "In concurring with our recommendation to effectively manage program  risks, DOD noted that our statement that risk management has yet to begin  is incorrect because key risks have been identified. We agree that risk  identification, which is the first step in risk management, has begun, as our  report recognizes. We also agree that the statement in our draft report that  risk management has yet to begin is not consistent with its recognition of  these risk identification efforts. As a result, we have modified the report to  note that many aspects of risk management have yet to begin, which DOD  also states in its comments on our draft report.", "The Coast Guard also concurred with our recommendations aimed at  improving the oversight, accountability, and execution of its sexual assault  prevention and response programs, including (1) establishing a systematic  process for collecting, documenting, and maintaining sexual assault  incidence data; (2) establishing quality control processes to ensure that  program information collected is valid and reliable; and (3) establishing  and administering a curriculum for all key program personnel to ensure  that they can provide proper advice to Coast Guard personnel. In  commenting on our draft report, the Coast Guard noted that it has several  initiatives underway to continue developing its sexual assault prevention  and response program. For example, the Coast Guard stated that an  electronic database to track sexual assault reports is in the prototype  development phase, and based on current progress, it expects to complete  the database in 2010. Further, the Coast Guard noted that it has completed  an assessment of workload requirements and resource allocations for its  Sexual Assault Response Coordinators, and upon release of the final  report, the Coast Guard plans to review and analyze the recommendations  and, as appropriate, incorporate additional resource requirements into its  annual budget process.
