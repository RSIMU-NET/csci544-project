CFPB monitors consumer complaints, analyzes market data, and gathers market intelligence from external groups (see figure for sources of CFPB\u2019s monitoring). CFPB has used risk-monitoring findings to inform its rulemakings, supervision, and other functions. In 2015, CFPB initiated a bureau-wide process for using market data and other information to set policy priorities related to addressing risks to consumers. However, CFPB has not yet decided whether it will continue to use this process to set priorities. CFPB currently lacks a systematic, bureau-wide process for prioritizing financial risks to consumers and considering how it will use its tools\u2014such as rulemaking, supervision, and consumer education\u2014to address them. Federal internal control standards state that management should use quality information to achieve agency objectives and that it should also identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving those objectives. Implementing a bureau-wide prioritization process could help to ensure that CFPB effectively focuses its resources on the most significant financial risks to consumers and enhances its ability to meet its statutory consumer protection objectives.", "CFPB has taken steps to retrospectively assess its significant rules within 5 years of these rules becoming effective, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. CFPB developed and applied criteria to identify three rules as significant and requiring a retrospective assessment. For these three rules, CFPB created assessment plans, issued public requests for comment and information, and reached out to external parties for additional data and evidence. In October 2018, CFPB issued its first assessment report on a rule related to cross-border money transfers. Among other things, the report found that certain trends, such as increasing volume of these transfers, continued after the rule took effect.

This provision states that CFPB may consider a number of  factors in allocating its resources for risk-monitoring efforts with regard to  consumer financial products and the markets for those products, such as  consumers\u2019 understanding of a type of product\u2019s risks, the extent to which  existing law is likely to protect consumers, and any disproportionate  effects on traditionally underserved consumers. Further, the Dodd-Frank  Act gives CFPB authority in connection with such monitoring to gather  information from time to time regarding the organization, business  conduct, markets, and activities of covered persons or service providers  from a variety of sources, including several sources specified in the act.  Finally, this provision requires CFPB to issue at least one report of  significant findings from its risk monitoring each calendar year.", "The Office of Research has led CFPB\u2019s efforts to address the Dodd-Frank  Act requirement that CFPB conduct assessments of each significant final  rule or order it adopts and publish a report of the assessment no later  than 5 years after the rule or order\u2019s effective date. Before publishing a  report of its assessment, CFPB must invite public comment on whether  the rule or order should be modified, expanded, or eliminated. In addition,  the Dodd-Frank Act provides CFPB authority to require covered persons  or service providers to provide information to help support these  assessments, as well as to support its risk-monitoring activities.", "In addition to the Research, Markets, and Regulations Division, other  CFPB divisions and offices conduct outreach to help inform CFPB policy  making. For example, CFPB\u2019s External Affairs Division facilitates  conversation with stakeholders, such as Congress, financial institutions,  state governments, and the public. In addition, in the Consumer  Education and Engagement Division, the Office of Consumer Response  manages the intake of and response to complaints about consumer  financial products and services.

This tool is based on a nationally  representative sample of commercially available, anonymized credit  records. Markets Offices staff use this tool to monitor conditions and  outcomes for specific groups of consumers in markets for mortgages,  credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. For example, CFPB  monthly auto market trend reports cited the tool as a source for  information on changes in the volume of auto loans by neighborhood  income.", "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. CFPB maintains loan-level  data that mortgage lenders report pursuant to the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act. According to CFPB, Markets Offices staff use the  data for their market monitoring, which can include analysis to  determine whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their  communities and to identify potentially discriminatory lending patterns.", "External data and research. In addition to its internal databases, CFPB  obtains external market data from a number of public and proprietary data  sources. The market intelligence reports we reviewed included the  following commonly cited external sources, among others:  federal databases and research, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York\u2019s Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit; publicly available information from sources such as industry websites,  mainstream news publications, and publicly traded companies\u2019  financial statements. proprietary data from sources such as data analytics services and  credit reporting agencies.", "Engagement with industry representatives. CFPB also gathers market  intelligence from engagement with industry representatives. Market  intelligence reports we reviewed cited several meetings with industry  representatives and regular CFPB attendance at industry conferences.  Representatives of two trade groups we interviewed told us that CFPB  had sometimes proactively reached out to them regarding areas of  potential risk. According to CFPB, in fiscal year 2018, Markets Offices  staff conducted an average of about 50 meetings with industry per month  and held intelligence-gathering meetings across various consumer  financial markets throughout the year.", "Engagement with consumer organizations. CFPB\u2019s External Affairs  Division, which is responsible for engagement with the nonprofit sector,  facilitates most communication between Markets Offices staff and  consumer organizations to help inform staff\u2019s risk monitoring efforts.  According to CFPB, between January and September 2018, staff from the  External Affairs and Research, Markets, and Regulation divisions held an  average of about four meetings per month with consumer organizations  and nonprofit stakeholders, and Markets Offices staff said these meetings  provided information useful in monitoring markets. Two of the three  consumer organizations we interviewed noted that their communication  with CFPB had decreased since late 2017.

CFPB obtains  information on consumer financial issues and emerging market trends  from various advisory groups and other formal outreach. In 2012, CFPB  established a consumer advisory board, in accordance with a Dodd-Frank  Act requirement.

The Research, Markets, and Regulations  Division has a formal information-sharing agreement with CFPB\u2019s  Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending Division. Under this  agreement, staff in the Office of Small Business Lending Markets used  supervisory information on common data terminology used by business  lenders to inform recommendations on data elements that should be  included in a potential small business data collection rule. In addition, as  discussed below, Markets Offices staff reviewed aggregated and  anonymized supervisory information from CFPB\u2019s examinations of  payday lenders for research that informed the November 2017 Payday,  Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans Rule, also referred  to as the Payday Rule.", "In addition to rulemaking, CFPB has conducted targeted risk-monitoring  activities to support certain statutory reporting requirements. For its  mandated biennial credit card study, CFPB used its data-collection  authorities under the Dodd-Frank Act to make four mandatory information  requests to a total of 15 credit card issuers. According to CFPB officials,  this study and other statutory reporting efforts\u2014such as the bureau\u2019s  annual report on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\u2014also support  their market-monitoring efforts under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Since July 2016, CFPB\u2019s market-monitoring efforts have  informed certain rulemaking efforts. For example, Markets Offices  analysis of the small-dollar lending market informed CFPB\u2019s November  2017 Payday Rule, according to staff and the proposed and final rules.  Staff said they had found that some borrowers were caught in a cycle of  using payday loan products without the ability to repay the loans. Under  the final rule, lenders for certain loans must reasonably determine up front  that borrowers can afford to make the payments on their loans without  needing to re-borrow within 30 days, while still meeting their basic living  and other expenses. In addition, CFPB\u2019s November 2016 Prepaid  Accounts Rule reflected market-monitoring information and other  research that staff helped collect on prepaid accounts. The rule  incorporated findings from CFPB\u2019s 2014 analysis of prepaid account  agreements, which CFPB conducted to understand the potential costs  and benefits of extending existing regulatory provisions\u2014such as error  resolution protections\u2014to such agreements. Further, CFPB\u2019s market  intelligence reports we reviewed from 2017 and 2018 reflected Markets  Offices staff\u2019s communication with industry regarding a debt-collection  rule\u2014a topic that has been on CFPB\u2019s public rulemaking agenda since  2013, based in part on market-monitoring findings.", "Industry supervision and policy positions. Markets Offices staff\u2019s  market-monitoring findings have informed CFPB\u2019s efforts to supervise  institutions and communicate policy positions to industry participants.  Staff assist the Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending Division in its  annual risk-based prioritization process. In 2018, for example, staff  provided information on market size and risk for more than a dozen  market areas, which helped the supervision division prioritize its coverage  of those market areas in its examination schedule. Markets Offices staff  told us they also have met frequently with supervision staff to share  issues identified through monitoring and determine whether supervisory  guidance or related actions would be appropriate to address them.

CFPB\u2019s risk monitoring has informed its broader  consumer education efforts. CFPB\u2019s Consumer Education and  Engagement Division provides financial education tools, including blogs  and print and online guides on financial topics such as buying a home,  choosing a bank or credit union, or responding to debt collectors.

As noted earlier, the Dodd-Frank Act requires CFPB  to issue at least one report annually of significant findings from its  monitoring of risks to consumers in the offering or provision of consumer  financial products or services. CFPB officials stated that this requirement  is addressed by the first section of CFPB\u2019s semiannual reports to  Congress, which discusses significant problems consumers face in  shopping for or obtaining consumer financial products and services.  CFPB officials further noted that other public CFPB reports include  information related to risks to consumers and may also respond to the  annual Dodd-Frank Act reporting requirement. For example, CFPB\u2019s  December 2017 biennial report on the consumer credit card market  discussed credit card debt collection and persistent indebtedness faced  by some consumers, among other consumer financial risks.

As required by  the Dodd-Frank Act, these requests solicited comments on modifying,  expanding, or eliminating the rules. In addition, CFPB requested  comments on the assessment plans and invited suggestions on other  data that might be useful for evaluating the rules\u2019 effects. In a document  provided to us, CFPB described its preliminary plan to summarize  comments received from the public and use the information received.  CFPB staff told us they adjusted their research questions and data  sources on all three assessments in response to comments. For example,  based on comments, they added a question to an industry survey about a  provision of the Remittance Rule and incorporated a new data source into  the ATR/QM Rule and RESPA Servicing Rule assessments.", "Other data sources used for the assessments include federal and state  agencies, voluntary surveys of providers of consumer financial products,  and loan data from servicers. For example, for the Remittance Rule  assessment, CFPB sent a voluntary industry survey to 600 money  transmitters, banks, and credit unions on how the rule has affected their  business practices and costs, as well as potential problems in specific  market segments. For the RESPA Servicing Rule assessment, CFPB  conducted qualitative structured interviews with mortgage servicers to  learn about changes servicers had to make in response to the rule.", "CFPB published its Remittance Rule Assessment Report in October  2018. The report analyzed trends in the volume of remittance transfers,  the number of providers, and the price of transfers. For example, CFPB  found that declining remittance prices and an increase in the volume of  remittances\u2014trends that had begun before the rule\u2019s effective date\u2014 continued afterward. However, CFPB was unable to conclude whether  these trends would have changed without the rule. In addition, the report  noted that new technology has increased access to remittances but has  also complicated CFPB\u2019s attempts to measure the effects of the  Remittance Rule on consumers. The report also estimated the rule\u2019s  initial and continued compliance costs for businesses, estimating that  they added between 30 and 33 cents for the one-time cost in 2014 and  between 7 and 37 cents in continuing costs per remittance in 2017.

In 2016 and 2017, CFPB\u2019s One Bureau process  allowed it to consider the market information it collected to prioritize the  most important risks to consumers and determine how to most effectively  address those risks on a bureau-wide basis. However, CFPB has not yet  decided whether to use the One Bureau process to reexamine its  priorities and has instead relied on prioritization mechanisms that focus  on its use of individual policy tools, such as its processes for setting  rulemaking and supervision priorities. Putting a systematic bureau-wide  prioritization process in place could help CFPB ensure that it focuses on  the most significant risks to consumers and effectively meets its statutory  consumer protection objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Director of CFPB should implement a systematic process for  prioritizing risks to consumers and considering how to use the bureau\u2019s  available policy tools\u2014such as rulemaking, supervision, enforcement,  and consumer education\u2014to address these risks.

The officials noted that CFPB had not yet determined whether to  engage in another round of the One Bureau priority-setting process.

CFPB cited  examples of existing processes\u2014such as its processes for setting its  rulemaking agenda and supervisory priorities\u2014that were designed to  ensure that its risk monitoring informs its work. In the oral comments,  CFPB officials expressed concern that the draft report\u2019s characterization  of a lack of a systematic process for prioritizing risks to consumers might  suggest that CFPB entirely lacks processes in this regard. We note that  the draft report described CFPB\u2019s existing processes for setting  rulemaking and supervisory priorities. While we agree that these  processes help CFPB to prioritize work in these areas, we maintain that  these processes do not reflect a systematic, bureau-wide process for  prioritizing risks to consumers and determining how to most effectively  address them. We made minor edits to the report to clarify that the  process CFPB lacks is a bureau-wide process that considers how it will  use its full set of tools to address risks to consumers.
