With regard to research, the most commonly cited gaps were inadequate research on treatment of prenatal opioid use and the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on children. Reasons cited for these research gaps included difficulties in conducting research, such as identifying and retaining pregnant women with substance use disorders for studies, and prenatal opioid use and NAS not being as high a priority as other research areas. With regards to programs, agency officials and experts most commonly cited the lack of available treatment programs for pregnant women and newborns with NAS, including the availability of comprehensive care and enabling services, such as transportation and child care. Reasons cited for these program gaps included the stigmatization and criminalization of pregnant women who use drugs.

Specifically, we  found that federal agencies fund research projects focused primarily on  NAS; administer programs or have health systems that make direct  services available to women who use opioids and newborns with NAS;  and engage in other efforts, such as provider education and knowledge- sharing groups. However, federal agency officials and experts we  interviewed cited several gaps in efforts to address prenatal opioid use  and NAS, most commonly gaps related to treatment, as well as lack of  guidance to states and health care providers. While ONDCP is  coordinating with federal agencies to develop action items to address  prenatal opioid use and NAS, improved documentation could help make  the process more systematic and effective. Further, HHS does not have a  focal point to lead planning and coordination of efforts across its nine  agencies that address these issues. These limitations in planning and  coordination by ONDCP and HHS may limit the effectiveness of federal  efforts to reduce prenatal opioid use among pregnant women and rates of  NAS. Additionally, there is a risk that efforts may be duplicated,  overlapping, or fragmented. Given the increasing use of heroin and abuse  of opioids prescribed for pain management, as well as the increased rate  of NAS in the United States, it is important to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of planning and coordination of federal efforts on prenatal  opioid use and NAS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure that efforts to address prenatal opioid use and NAS are  systematically and effectively planned and coordinated across the federal  government, the Director of ONDCP should document the process,  including discussions held and information considered, of developing  action items on prenatal opioid use and NAS.

To  identify these agencies, we created a list of preliminary agencies based  on a review of our recent work, as well as a review of the 2013 Catalog of  Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) and discussion with officials from  the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), which is responsible  for coordinating federal drug control efforts. We then screened these  agencies to identify those with research, programs, or other agency  efforts related to prenatal opioid use or NAS. Based on our screening, we  identified 15 relevant agencies that we included in our review. (See   table 4.)", "To examine federally funded research, each of the 15 agencies in our  review identified whether they had conducted or funded research on  prenatal opioid use or NAS during fiscal years 2008 through 2014 through  our initial screening. We selected these timeframes in order to provide  information on the body of research funded in recent years. Three of the  15 agencies in our review\u2014the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of  Health\u2014reported that they had funded or conducted relevant research  during this time period. Using a data collection instrument, we collected  information from these three agencies on the details of this research\u2014 such as the target populations, focus of the research, and funding  obligations data by fiscal year. We received completed responses from  the three agencies and followed up to clarify the agencies\u2019 responses if  their responses were unclear or incomplete. In addition, to assess the  reliability of the obligations data, we requested information on the  agencies\u2019 data systems and if there were any limitations to reporting the  data. We also conducted internal checks to identify any outliers, and  followed up with agency officials as appropriate. We determined that the  research data provided by the agencies were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To examine federal programs that addressed prenatal opioid use or NAS,  we took a two-part approach. We first identified potentially relevant  federal programs by reviewing the 2013 CFDA and the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) Federal Program Inventory for fiscal  year 2013, the latest available data at the time of our review, and by  interviewing federal agency officials. We then requested that each of the  15 agencies in our review confirm if the programs that we initially  identified addressed prenatal opioid use or NAS, and if they were in  operation in fiscal years 2013 or 2014. We selected these time frames to  provide information on current programs that address these issues, and  we included fiscal year 2013 because it was the most recent fiscal year  for which complete program data were available. We also asked each  agency to identify any additional programs that we had not identified that  were relevant to prenatal opioid use or NAS. As a result, seven federal  agencies identified a total of 22 federal programs that addressed prenatal  opioid use or NAS in fiscal years 2013 or 2014.", "We then developed and administered a Web-based questionnaire to  collect information on each of these 22 programs\u2014such as types of direct  services made available and other activities conducted related to prenatal  opioid use or NAS\u2014and used the information provided to determine if  each of the programs met our definition for addressing prenatal opioid  use or NAS. We defined a program as addressing prenatal opioid use or  NAS if (1) the program made relevant direct services available\u2014 regardless if these services were actually provided\u2014or (2) the program  conducted other activities that were relevant to prenatal opioid use or  NAS. We also collected other types of information on each program,  such as the program description and objectives, number of years in  operation, funding mechanisms, funding obligations, and whether  available services and activities were required to be evidence-based.  During the development of our questionnaire, we pretested it with federal  agency officials representing four programs across three agencies to  ensure that our questions and response choices were clear, appropriate,  and answerable. To obtain a variety of perspectives on our questionnaire,  we selected the four programs for pretesting based on the types of  services offered or activities conducted, funding mechanisms, and federal  agency responsible for program administration. We then made changes  to the content of the questionnaire based on feedback obtained from the  pretests. We administered the questionnaire from June 2014 through  October 2014. Officials from all 22 programs completed the  questionnaire.", "The results from our questionnaire are not subject to sampling error  because we sent the questionnaire to the universe of potential  respondents. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  questionnaire may introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question  was interpreted, in the sources of information that were available to  respondents, or in how the data were entered into a database or were  analyzed could introduce unwanted variability into the questionnaire  results. We encountered instances of nonsampling error in analyzing the  questionnaire responses, such as respondents providing conflicting,  vague, or incomplete information. We generally addressed these errors  by performing automated checks to identify inappropriate answers, and  also contacted agency officials for clarification and to request additional  documentation as appropriate. However, we did not independently verify  all of the information and data provided by the questionnaire respondents.  In addition, to assess the reliability of obligations data reported in the  questionnaire, we requested supporting documentation, and incorporated  questions about the programs\u2019 data systems and if there were any  limitations to reporting the data. On the basis of our application of  recognized survey design practices and follow-up procedures, we  determined that the data provided by the agencies on programs were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine other agency efforts that addressed prenatal opioid use or  NAS in recent years outside of research and programs, we used a data  collection form through which the 15 agencies in our review identified any other agency efforts that took place from fiscal years 2008 through 2014.We received completed responses from all 15 agencies. In some  instances, respondents provided conflicting, vague, or incomplete  information. We generally addressed these errors by contacting agency  officials for clarification and requesting additional information or  documentation as appropriate. However, we did not independently verify  all of the information provided by the respondents. We determined that  the data provided by the agencies on other agency efforts were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine gaps in efforts to address prenatal opioid use or NAS, we  obtained testimonial evidence from federal agency officials and experts  on any research, program, and other gaps that exist in efforts to address  prenatal opioid use or NAS. Specifically, we requested information from  federal officials representing the agencies that had funded or conducted  research in fiscal years 2008 through 2014, the agencies with relevant  programs in fiscal years 2013 or 2014, and ONDCP. In addition, we  selected experts (comprising expert organizations as well as individual  researchers and clinicians) in order to include perspectives from health  care professionals, advocates, and researchers with expertise in women\u2019s  health, pediatric health, and addiction. We obtained testimonial evidence  from officials representing nine federal agencies and six experts from  which we requested information. We then conducted preliminary content  analyses of the information provided by agency officials and experts on:  (1) research, program, and other gaps; (2) the reasons for these gaps;  and (3) the effects of these gaps. We created preliminary categories  based on these analyses. Two GAO analysts then independently  conducted formal analyses, reviewed each other\u2019s work, and discussed  any discrepancies to ensure that both agreed on the assigned  categorization of all information provided by agency officials and experts.  For reporting purposes, we counted each federal agency and each expert  (whether an individual or an expert organization) as one unit in our  analysis.
