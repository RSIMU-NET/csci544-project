This act contains specific provisions to ensure that workers are paid the federal minimum wage and for overtime, and that youth are protected from working too many hours and from hazardous conditions. The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing employer compliance with FLSA. To secure compliance, WHD uses enforcement actions, partnerships with external groups, and outreach activities. In response to a congressional request, we examined (1) the trends in FLSA compliance activities from fiscal years 1997 to 2007, (2) the effectiveness of WHD's efforts to plan and conduct these activities, and (3) the extent to which these activities have improved FLSA compliance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 1997 to 2007, the number of WHD's enforcement actions decreased by more than a third, from approximately 47,000 in 1997 to just under 30,000 in 2007. According to WHD, the total number of actions decreased over this period because of three factors: the increased use of more time-consuming comprehensive investigations, a decrease in the number of investigators, and screening of complaints to eliminate those that may not result in violations. Most of these actions (72 percent) were initiated from 1997 to 2007 in response to complaints from workers. The remaining enforcement actions, which were initiated by WHD, were concentrated in four industry groups: agriculture, accommodation and food services, manufacturing, and health care and social services. WHD's other two types of compliance activities--partnerships and outreach--constituted about 19 percent of WHD's staff time based on available data from 2000 to 2007. WHD did not effectively take advantage of available information and tools in planning and conducting its compliance activities. In planning these activities, WHD did not use available information, including key data on complaints and input from external groups such as employer and worker advocacy organizations, to inform its planning process. Also, in targeting businesses for investigation, WHD focused on the same industries from 1997 to 2007 despite information from its commissioned studies on low wage industries in which FLSA violations are likely to occur. As a result, WHD may not be addressing the needs of workers most vulnerable to FLSA violations. Finally, the agency does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools, such as tracking the use and collection of penalties and back wages, or using its hotlines and partnerships, to encourage employers to comply with FLSA and reach potential complainants. The extent to which WHD's activities have improved FLSA compliance is unknown because WHD frequently changes both how it measures and how it reports on its performance. When agencies provide trend data in their performance reports, decision makers can compare current and past progress in meeting long-term goals. While WHD's long-term goals and strategies generally remained the same from 1997 to 2007, WHD often changed how it measured its progress, keeping about 90 percent of its measures for 2 years or less. Moreover, WHD established a total of 131 performance measures throughout this period, but reported on 6 of these measures for more than 1 year. This lack of consistent information on WHD's progress in meeting its goals makes it difficult to assess how well WHD's efforts are improving compliance with FLSA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Labor\u2019s  (Labor) Wage and Hour Division\u2019s (WHD) efforts to enforce compliance  with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as amended, which protects  over 130 million eligible workers from substandard wages and working  conditions.

In 2007, about 2 million workers were  earning at or below the federal minimum wage. FLSA also limits the  normal work week to 40 hours and requires that most employers pay 1\u00bd  times normal wages, or overtime pay, to eligible employees who work  longer hours.

For many years, WHD officials have considered low  wage workers to be most vulnerable to FLSA violations. In 2007, about 54  million workers were among this population. Furthermore, WHD officials,  researchers, and employee advocates have expressed concerns that  foreign born workers, although generally protected by FLSA to the same  extent as other workers, may be less likely than others to complain  because they may be unaware of federal laws or fear deportation if they  are undocumented. About 19 percent of low wage workers, as defined by  researchers in studies commissioned by WHD, were foreign born in 2007.", "When WHD finds violations during enforcement actions, it computes and  attempts to collect back wages owed to workers and, where permitted by  law, imposes penalties and other remedies. Other remedies pertaining to  FLSA include the hot goods provision, which allows WHD to seize goods  created in violation of FLSA, and liquidated damages, which permit  workers to receive additional damages as a result of minimum wage or  overtime violations.

From 2000 to 2007, more than half  of these enforcement actions\u2014approximately 52 percent\u2014were  conciliations, which WHD conducted over the phone. Conciliations were  also the quickest type of enforcement action\u2014taking 2\u00bd hours, on  average, compared to nearly 35 hours, on average, for other types of  enforcement actions. However, conciliations are generally limited to a  complaint about a single violation involving only one worker. Although  this enforcement action allows initial complaints to be quickly closed, a  WHD-commissioned study found conciliations to be associated with an  increased probability of detecting violations in subsequent investigations  of a specific employer. Further information on complaints handled via  conciliations can be found in a companion GAO testimony being released  today for this hearing. Nearly all of the remaining enforcement actions  initiated by complaints from workers were comprehensive investigations  (38 percent) or limited investigations (7 percent).

Although WHD\u2019s Field Operations Handbook provides  guidelines for recording complaints, and there is a complaint intake screen  in the agency\u2019s WHISARD database, the handbook also states that, even if  a complaint indicates probable violations, it may be rejected by district  office managers based on factors such as the office\u2019s workload or  available travel funds. Therefore, WHD staff usually enter a complaint into  the database only when it is likely to result in finding of violations. In  addition, although one office we visited maintained separate logs of all  complaints received, WHD does not require all complaints, including the  actions taken, to be recorded.

However,  headquarters officials said that they do not track the regional or district  offices\u2019 backlogs, nor do they know how they are measured. Therefore,  WHD cannot consider these backlogs in its planning efforts, including its  allocation of staff resources to its regional and district offices.", "Input from external groups such as employer and worker  advocacy organizations with an interest in WHD\u2019s activities. In  the past, WHD held meetings with external stakeholders\u2014organizations  with an interest in the agency\u2019s activities\u2014at a national level, but more  recently, the agency has relied on second-hand information from its  district offices to identify the concerns of these groups. GAO has reported  that it is important to involve external stakeholders in the planning  process, such as developing goals and performance measures. Agencies  that have involved these external groups report that this cooperation has  allowed them to more effectively use their resources. According to agency  headquarters officials, prior to 2000, WHD held meetings at a national level  with external organizations such as industry groups, advocates, unions,  and state officials. Around 2000, WHD began relying instead on its district  office staff to gather input on external stakeholders\u2019 concerns and provide  this information at WHD\u2019s annual planning meetings. However, these  planning meetings are not held until after the agency\u2019s national and  regional priorities are set, thereby limiting external stakeholder input in  the early phases of the process. In addition, WHD headquarters officials  said its district offices report input from external stakeholders as part of  annual performance reports submitted to the regional offices.

According to GPRA guidance, understanding the external environment in  which its offices operate should be a key part of WHD\u2019s strategic planning  process. Because WHD offices in states with weaker labor laws or  enforcement may receive more complaints, these factors may directly  affect the workload of WHD\u2019s district offices. For example, according to  WHD officials, because the state of Georgia does not conduct  investigations of overtime or minimum wage violations, the Atlanta WHD  district office has a heavy workload of complaints regarding these issues.

Individual employers within these  industries are often selected for these WHD-initiated investigations in one  of two ways. WHD either obtains a statistical sample of employers or  selects them using the judgment of its staff\u2014for example, by looking  through a telephone directory of local businesses.", "Over this period, WHD considered low wage workers to be most  vulnerable to FLSA violations, but it did not clearly define who these  workers were or identify the industries in which they were concentrated  until 2004. Instead, according to WHD officials, the agency relied primarily  on its historical enforcement data\u2014the majority of which consisted of  actions initiated by complaints\u2014and observations from regional and  district officials to focus its compliance activities. WHD centered its work  on nine industries, and based many of its performance indicators on  garment manufacturing, nursing homes, and agriculture. However, district  officials told us that it was difficult to contribute to all of these national  goals because few of WHD\u2019s offices are located in areas that have a  substantial number of employers in the garment manufacturing industry to  investigate.", "To ensure that all of its offices could contribute to its national goals, and  that industries in which workers are less likely to complain were included  in its plans, WHD changed its focus to include more low wage industries.  In 2002, the agency commissioned a series of studies to define the  population of low wage workers, and to determine in which industries  these workers were most likely to experience minimum wage and  overtime violations. Researchers used data from the Bureau of Labor  Statistics to estimate how common and severe minimum wage and  overtime violations were throughout all industries. They found that 33  industries had a high potential for violations of the minimum wage and  overtime provisions of FLSA, including 9 that ranked highest nationally for  violation potential. However, since the completion of the studies in 2004,  WHD has not used this information to substantially refocus its efforts or  target its investigations. The proportion of WHD-initiated investigations  targeting these top 9 industries has risen by approximately 2 percent since  2004. Therefore, the investigations initiated by WHD may not have  addressed the needs of low wage workers most vulnerable to FLSA  violations.", "Local WHD officials also told us that despite the results of these studies,  the focus of their investigations has not substantially changed. For  example, the agriculture industry, which is not on the national list of 33  priority industries, was the focus of 16 percent of WHD-initiated  investigations from 2005 to 2007. In addition, WHD headquarters officials  told us that the agency cannot regularly measure its progress in improving  compliance in the 33 industries because it does not have the resources  needed to conduct the investigations it uses to evaluate whether  compliance has improved. Finally, most district-level WHD officials told us  they were not aware of the specifics of these commissioned studies. For  example, at one WHD district office, the managers told us brief  presentations on some of the studies were provided at management  meetings, but copies of the full studies were not provided, and  investigators we spoke with at this office said they were not aware of the  studies and therefore could not incorporate the results of these studies  into planning their work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WHD Does Not Sufficiently Leverage Existing Tools to Increase Compliance", "paragraphs": ["WHD does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools to increase  compliance. These include the following:  Use of penalties for willful and repeat violations. WHD does not  know the extent to which it has leveraged its statutory penalty authority  because it does not track how often willful or repeat violations are found.  WHD can assess penalties when employers willfully or repeatedly violate  FLSA but WHD does not track how often it finds repeated or willful  violations or when penalties are not assessed for such violations. In  addition, a study commissioned by WHD showed that, when employers are  assessed penalties, they are more likely to comply in the future and other  employers in the same region\u2014regardless of industry\u2014are also more  likely to comply. Although the agency has occasionally addressed the use  of penalties in its performance plans\u2014for example, by including a  measure for increasing the use of penalties and other remedies in its 2007  plan\u2013WHD managers did not emphasize the importance of these tools by  including them in the agency\u2019s performance reports, which are used by  external groups to hold the agency accountable. Furthermore, there was  no quantifiable goal associated with the measure in the 2007 plan, and  officials told us that it was intended only as a reminder to staff that  penalties were one tool they could use to encourage compliance.", "Collection of back wages and penalties. WHD began collecting more  data on its enforcement actions in 2000 with the introduction of its  WHISARD database. However, the agency does not use information on  whether back wages and penalties assessed are collected to determine  whether it is fulfilling its mission of ensuring that workers receive the  wages they are owed or verify that employers are being penalized for  violating FLSA, respectively. WHD headquarters officials in charge of  strategic planning told us they do not know whether back wages or  penalties are collected from employers, although this information is  tracked in its financial accounting systems. They also could not provide  information on how long it takes the agency to collect back wages or  penalties.", "Hotlines and office telephone lines. WHD is not fully utilizing its  hotlines or its regular office telephone lines to reach potential  complainants. WHD has set up some hotlines through partnerships, but  these hotlines are not always effective.

One member of the partnership said that she tested the hotline  repeatedly over 6-month period but the phone was never answered. When  we made test calls to this hotline asking about wage-related issues, staff  either did not refer us to WHD or other government agencies or did not  return our calls. Phone systems also vary among WHD\u2019s offices, and only  some have the capacity to take messages outside of office hours, when  workers with complaints may be more likely to call. For example, at one  district office, we were told that they did not have an answering machine  on which callers could leave messages after hours because they had no  one to return these calls during the day. In addition, state officials and  advocates said that some local WHD offices are not always available by  phone to help callers with detailed questions. At one district office we  visited, investigators said that calls went straight to a voice mail system,  where callers were instructed to leave a message and wait for a return call  from WHD staff.", "Partnerships. Although partnerships can help WHD leverage resources  and reach potential complainants, some of WHD\u2019s partners, including state  labor agency officials, told us that WHD does not always provide adequate  support to its partnerships. First, some state officials said that WHD does  not notify them of the status of complaints or of actions taken. For  example, one state official told us about a case in which an employer  violated state and federal labor laws, but WHD settled with the employer  without consulting state officials. The state officials said they were  unhappy with the settlement, mainly because it resulted in the employer  paying less in back wages. Second, WHD has not allowed its investigators  to take part in some joint investigations with state labor agencies or send  investigators to events intended to help educate the worker community.  Third, several of WHD\u2019s partners told us that the agency has not provided  adequate financial support for outreach events, leaving the funding to  nonprofit organizations. For example, WHD officials in Houston told us  that, although one of its partnership\u2019s billboards advertising a hotline for  Latino workers needed to be replaced, the office was unable to provide  any funding to replace them because WHD headquarters had not approved  the funds. In California, WHD officials told us they do not support  expanding the agency\u2019s Employment, Education, and Outreach (EMPLEO)  partnership\u2014which received an award from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy  School of Government for successful innovation\u2014to other areas of the  state or hold certain outreach events because these efforts would generate  more referrals than the agency could handle."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which WHD\u2019s Activities Have Improved FLSA Compliance Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which WHD\u2019s activities have improved FLSA compliance is  unknown, because WHD frequently changes both how it measures and  how it reports on its performance. When agencies provide trend data in  their performance reports, decision makers can compare current and past  progress in meeting long-term goals. While WHD\u2019s long-term goals and  strategies have generally remained the same since 1997, WHD often  changes how it measures its progress, keeping about 90 percent of its  measures for 2 years or less. According to WHD officials, the agency  decided to discontinue some of its measures either because they had been  met or because WHD realized they were not appropriate. In addition, while  WHD specified a number of performance measures each year in its  planning documents, it included less than one-third of them in its annual  performance reports. Moreover, although WHD established a total of 131  performance measures throughout the period from 1997 to 2007, it  reported on 6 of them for more than 1 year. This lack of consistent  information on WHD\u2019s progress in meeting its goals makes it difficult to  assess how well WHD\u2019s efforts are improving compliance with FLSA.", "Since the first time Labor was required to report on it performance in  1999, WHD has included similar performance goals and strategies related  to its FLSA compliance activities in its annual performance reports. For  1999 to 2006, WHD had the general outcome goal of increasing compliance  with worker protection laws and, by 2002, also had a more program- specific goal of ensuring that American workplaces legally, fairly, and  safely employed and compensated their workers. For 2007, the agency  reported on the program-specific goal of ensuring workers received the  wages due. Also, from 1999 to 2007, the agency reported on how it used its  three types of compliance activities\u2014enforcement, outreach, and  partnerships\u2014to reach its goals.", "While its goals and strategies did not change, WHD often changed how it  measured its progress. From 1997 to 2007, WHD included 131 FLSA-related  performance measures in its plans but kept about 90 percent of these for 2  years or less. A majority of these measures\u201467 percent\u2014were reported  for only 1 year. Furthermore, for most of the period from 1997 to 2007,  WHD had strategic initiatives for improving compliance in its targeted  industries\u2014agriculture, garment, and health care\u2014as well as a strategic  initiative designed to measure and reduce recidivism by re-investigating  employers it had previously investigated and found in violation of FLSA.  However, the agency also frequently changed how it measured progress in  both of these areas. For example, although WHD had 10 performance  measures for improving compliance in agriculture from 1997 to 2007, it  kept only 1 of them for more than a year. These frequent changes to its  performance measures have affected the ability of agency officials and  outside observers to understand WHD\u2019s progress and for agency officials  to make decisions for future strategic planning. In a recently issued study  WHD commissioned to obtain recommendations for future performance  measures for reducing recidivism, researchers found that they could not  assess the agency\u2019s progress to date because of the frequent changes in its  measures.", "According to WHD officials, the agency discontinued some of its  performance measures because they had been met or were not  appropriate. Specifically, WHD officials stated that during their annual  planning process, they make ongoing refinements to their performance  measures. Throughout the years, the agency has decided to discontinue  measures for several reasons, including (1) the agency data it used to  assess its progress in meeting the measure were not reliable; (2) agency  staff did not understand how the measures related to their work; (3) staff  did not believe the agency could influence the measure through its work;  (4) the issue the measure was attempting to address was no longer  relevant; and (5) the agency had met the targets for the measure  repeatedly. For example, although growers typically rotate their crops  annually, WHD\u2019s performance measures for the agriculture industry  focused on compliance among growers of specific crops, such as lettuce  and tomatoes. After 4 years of using various performance measures based  on crops, WHD realized that because growers often change crops, this  approach was not measuring compliance for the same group of growers  over time and discontinued using these measures.", "In addition to frequently changing its performance measures, WHD does  not report on many of the measures. While WHD specified a number of  performance measures each year in its planning documents, it included  less than one-third of them in its annual performance reports. Of the 131  FLSA-related performance measures, WHD reported on 40 of them (29  percent) in its annual performance reports. WHD officials attributed this  lack of reporting to departmental space limitations in annual reports.", "Moreover, although WHD reported on 40 of its performance measures  from 1999 to 2007, it reported on only 6 of them for more than 1 year. The  agency met 30 of its goals (75 percent) for the measures on which it  reported, and meeting the goals was among the reasons WHD officials  cited for discontinuing the use of some measures. However, nearly half of  the measures WHD met were designed to establish baselines for  understanding the current state of compliance or an agency process; they  were not meant to measure agency progress. Overall, the lack of  consistent reporting further complicates the ability of those within and  outside the agency to assess how well WHD\u2019s efforts have improved  compliance with FLSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While WHD is responsible for protecting some of the basic rights of U.S.  workers by enforcing FLSA, it does not know how effectively it is doing  so. As with all government agencies, WHD must determine how to  strategically manage its limited resources to help ensure the most efficient  and effective outcomes. Although WHD has been challenged by reductions  in its investigative staff, it has not used all available information to  promote compliance, such as the studies in which it has invested that  could inform how it targets employers for WHD-initiated investigations. In  addition, it has not fully leveraged available tools, such as hotlines, office  phone lines, and partnerships, that could extend its reach or tracked  penalties and collection of back wages to know their impact on  compliance. Furthermore, by not consistently measuring and reporting its  progress in meeting the unchanging goal of ensuring FLSA compliance, the  agency is unable to account for its progress more than a decade after  GPRA implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To more effectively plan and conduct its compliance activities, we  recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Administrator of WHD  to    enter all complaints and actions taken in response to complaints in its  WHISARD database, and use this information as part of its resource  allocation process;    establish a process to help ensure that input from external  stakeholders, such as employer associations and worker advocacy  groups, is obtained and incorporated as appropriate into its planning  process;  incorporate information from its commissioned studies in its strategic  planning process to improve targeting of employers for investigation;  and  identify ways to leverage its existing tools by improving services  provided through hotlines, office phone lines, and partnerships, and  improving its tracking of whether penalties are assessed when repeat  or willful violations are found and whether back wages and penalties  assessed are collected.", "To provide better accountability in meeting its goal of improving employer  compliance, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the  Administrator of WHD to establish, consistently maintain, and report on its  performance measures for FLSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We held a meeting with WHD officials on June 20, 2008, in which we  discussed our findings and recommendations in detail.

The data included information on WHD\u2019s enforcement  actions, back wages, penalties, partnerships, and outreach activities. All  data we reported were assessed for reliability and determined to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this statement. In addition, we  gathered quantitative and qualitative information from agency officials on  factors that may have influenced these trends, including staff resources.  To assess the effectiveness of WHD\u2019s planning and implementation of  compliance activities and whether these activities led to improvements in  FLSA compliance, we analyzed WHD\u2019s annual performance plans and  reports in light of GAO\u2019s work and guidance on strategic planning and  performance management for regulatory agencies. In addition, we  examined performance assessments conducted by outside experts at  WHD\u2019s request.", "Finally, for all of these research objectives, we interviewed WHD officials  at the national and regional level and external organizations representing  employers and employees affected by WHD\u2019s compliance activities and  visited WHD and state offices in California, Georgia, New Hampshire,  Texas, and Wisconsin. We selected these states using several criteria that  would provide a mix of characteristics, including the concentration of  hourly workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage in each  state; the number of formal agreements between WHD and state or local  organizations; and geographic diversity. We also made test calls to WHD\u2019s  local and national hotlines. In addition, we reviewed all relevant laws and  regulations.
