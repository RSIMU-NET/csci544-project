RHS  makes a significant investment in affordable housing for low-income rural  Americans through a variety of direct and guaranteed loan and grant  programs. RHS manages a single-family and multifamily direct loan  portfolio of about $28 billion, oversees a program that guarantees about $3  billion in single-family mortgages annually, and administers over $500  million in rental assistance payments each year. However, the rural  America of 2005 is different from the rural America of the 1930s, when the  federal government first began to provide housing assistance to rural  residents. Advances in transportation, computer technology, and  telecommunications, along with the spread of suburbia, have linked many  rural to urban areas and blurred distinctions between them. Yet the need  for decent, safe, and affordable low-income housing remains strong in  rural areas. The changing face of rural America, advances in technology  affecting program administration, and new fiscal and budget realities raise  questions about how RHS programs could most effectively and efficiently  serve rural Americans.", "Thus, my principle objective today is to present an overview of issues you  may want to consider as you deliberate on how to best improve housing  services for rural Americans.", "This statement is primarily based on reports we did for this Subcommittee  as well as for the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies, Senate Committee  on Appropriations: a December 2004 report on how RHS determines which areas are eligible  for rural housing programs; three previous reports on RHS\u2019s rental assistance budgeting and  distribution processes; and   a report we are releasing today addressed to the RHS Administrator that  describes errors in, and internal control issues for, RHS\u2019s loans and grants  databases.", "Finally, I will provide a few comments addressing the recently completed  Comprehensive Property Assessment, which RHS initiated in response to  our May 2002 study on long-term needs in the Section 515 multifamily  housing program.", "In summary, while RHS has significantly improved the housing stock in  rural America and RHS management has made progress in addressing  problems we have identified in the past, several issues still prevent the  agency from making the best use of its resources.", "Statutory requirements for program eligibility may not reflect changes in  rural areas or best determine which areas qualify for RHS housing  programs. Specifically, we found the statutory requirements relating to  metropolitan statistical areas (MSA), the ability to \u201cgrandfather\u201d eligibility,  and demonstration of a serious lack of mortgage credit for low- and  moderate-income families to be of marginal utility. Changes to these  requirements, such as using density measures rather than the currently  used MSA criterion, might allow RHS to better differentiate urban and  rural areas. Also, phasing out the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of communities that  experience changes in eligibility because of inclusion in an MSA could  better ensure that RHS more consistently makes eligibility determinations  for rural housing programs. Finally, \u201clack of credit\u201d does not appear to be  as great a challenge to rural Americans gaining access to affordable  housing as lack of income or the inability to repay loans. RHS already  targets its programs and services, based on income, to areas and  populations of greatest need. As a result, the \u201clack of credit\u201d requirement  does not appear necessary to appropriately determine program eligibility.", "Weaknesses in RHS\u2019s budget estimation and oversight of rental assistance  funds increase the risk that the agency is not efficiently or appropriately  allocating resources. We found that RHS had consistently overestimated  its budget needs for rental assistance contracts in its Section 521 program  by using higher inflation rates than recommended and incorrectly applying  those rates. Using and correctly applying the inflation rates provided by  the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) would help the agency more  accurately estimate its rental assistance needs. Additionally, RHS lacked  sufficient internal controls to adequately monitor the use of rental  assistance funds, particularly in its funds transfer processes, methodology  for supervisory reviews, and tenant income verification processes.  Establishing centralized guidance on transferring unused rental assistance,  improving sampling methods in the tenant file review process, and  improving processes for verifying tenant information could help ensure  that these funds are being effectively administered and used. Also, making  a statutory change to give RHS access to the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 National Directory of New Hires, which provides recent  nationwide data on wages, could help the agency verify tenant income  information. RHS has recently moved on a number of fronts to correct the  many rental assistance program shortcomings identified in our reports.  While it is too early for us to fully review the impact of these changes, we  believe that changes in how rental assistance budgets are estimated and  the application or strengthening of internal controls, consistent with our  recommendations, would result in greater efficiency and resource savings  in this pivotal program.", "Although RHS has worked to improve its management information  systems, we found incorrect, incomplete, and inconsistent entries in its  loans and grants databases, and the system \u201cedit\u201d functions do not appear  to flag or correct these errors. Further, RHS does not have a process to  review these databases for accuracy. Additional internal control measures  could ensure more accurate data entry and reporting, particularly at the  field office level, and such an effort could ensure that RHS\u2019 investment in  system upgrades would provide more meaningful and useful information  to the agency itself, Congress, and the public.", "RHS recently contracted for a study called the Comprehensive Property  Assessment. The study was done to develop a baseline for assessing the  portfolio\u2019s physical and financial condition.

The statutory definition generally identifies eligible  rural areas as those with populations up to 20,000 and defines \u201crural\u201d and  \u201crural areas\u201d as any open country or any place, town, village, or city that is  not part of or associated with an urban area.", "Specifically, there are several population levels at which communities may  be determined eligible, but as a community\u2019s population increases, the  statute imposes additional requirements that include being \u201crural in  character\u201d (a concept that is not defined in the statute), having a serious  lack of mortgage credit, or not being located within an MSA.

For instance, field staff in Maryland told us that  in response to December 2002 national guidance, they stopped using  natural features such as rivers or mountains as eligibility boundaries for  communities. Maryland now uses only roads. Figure 1 shows a new  boundary, a road that divides the eligible area on the left from the  ineligible area on the right. RHS local office officials told us that the \u201croad  only\u201d criteria forced them to find the nearest public road to a populated  section of Hagerstown, which happens to go through farmland. The result  is that apparently similar rural areas received different designations.", "Figure 2 shows an area in Brookside, Ohio, where the city line divides the  eligible from the ineligible area.

Although it is across the Ohio River from  Parkersburg, bridges have connected Belpre and Parkersburg for decades  and, according to a Belpre city employee, many people from Belpre work  in Parkersburg. Furthermore, most of Belpre has a population density of  1,000 people or more per square mile, which the Census Bureau considers  \u201cdensely settled\u201d and a measure of urbanization.

To illustrate, we  found rural communities with populations exceeding 10,000 that were  directly impacted by the MSA and \u201cgrandfather\u201d restrictions. Because  MSAs are county-based and may contain both urban and rural areas, the  MSA restriction and the grandfathering of certain communities resulted in  some communities being eligible while others with similar demographic  profiles were ineligible.", "We looked at two communities within the Bakersfield, California, MSA,  which is basically rural outside the environs of Bakersfield (see fig. 4).

Taft would be in its own  urban cluster outside of the Bakersfield urbanized area, which happens to  include Lamont. Based on our visit, we believe this scenario, where the  more rural community would be the one eligible, is more in line with the  overall purpose of the legislation than the current situation.", "In another example, by eliminating the MSA criterion, RHS could review  the eligibility of Washington Court House and Circleville, Ohio, based on  population and rural character criteria.

Specifically, in estimating needs for its rental assistance  contracts, RHS used higher inflation factors than recommended, did not  apply the inflation rates correctly to each year of the contract, and based  estimates of future spending on recent high usage rather than average  rates.", "First, the agency used inflation factors that were higher than those  recommended by OMB for use in the budget process. Second, RHS did not  apply its inflation rate separately to each year of a 5-year contract, but  instead compounded the rate to reflect the price level in the fifth year and  applied that rate to each contract year. The result was an inflation rate that  was more than five times the rate for the first year. For example, using  these two methods, RHS overestimated its 2003 budget needs by $51  million or 6.5 percent. Third, RHS based its estimates of future  expenditure rates on recent maximum expenditures, rather than on the  average rates at which rental assistance funds were being expended.", "Additionally, our analysis of rental assistance payment data showed that  the agency had overestimated its budget needs almost every year since  1990, the earliest year for which we gathered data.

RHS\u2019s national, state, and local offices share  responsibility for monitoring the rental assistance program, with the local  offices performing the primary supervisory review every 3 years. These  triennial supervisiory reviews are RHS\u2019s primary tool for detecting  misreporting of tenant income, which may result in unauthorized rental  assistance payments. But the shortcomings in the review process increase  the risk that RHS will provide rental assistance to tenants that may not be  eligible.

For example, over 8 percent of the community  names or zip codes were incorrect. Additionally, inconsistent spellings of  community names distorted the number of unique communities in the  database. More than 400 entries lacked sufficient information (street  addresses, community names, and zip codes) needed to identify the  community to which the loan or grant had been made.

However, the agency still faces challenges in areas that include the basic  question of how best to determine what areas are rural, how to best  manage rental assistance (the largest budget item in RHS), and how to  ensure that data entered into management information systems are  accurate. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist to provide more  flexibility and improve existing processes that could better help RHS serve  its clients while responding to the challenges of current fiscal and budget  realities.", "For example, while determining what areas are eligible for rural housing  programs will always require an element of judgment, several changes to  the current eligibility requirements could help RHS make more consistent  eligibility determinations.

Consistently overstating  funding needs for one program also undermines the congressional budget  process by making funds unavailable for other programs. In addition,  RHS\u2019s internal controls had not provided reasonable assurance that rental  assistance resources were being used effectively. We questioned whether  internal control weaknesses were preventing rental assistance funds from  going to properties with the neediest tenants.
