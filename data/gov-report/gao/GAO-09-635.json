The Academy is affiliated with 14 non-appropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI) and two foundations. GAO was asked to determine whether there (1) were any potentially improper or questionable sources and uses of funds by the Academy, including transactions with its affiliated organizations; (2) was an effective control environment with key controls in place over the Academy's sources and uses of funds; and (3) were any actions taken, under way, or planned to improve controls and accountability. GAO analyzed selected transactions from fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008 to identify improper or questionable sources and uses of funds and reviewed documents and interviewed cognizant officials to assess the Academy's internal controls, and identify corrective actions to improve controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified numerous instances of improper and questionable sources and uses of funds by the Academy and its affiliated organizations. These improprieties and questionable payments GAO identified demonstrate that, while MARAD and the Academy have been taking action to improve the Academy's internal controls, the Academy did not have assurance that it complied with applicable fund control requirements, including the Antideficiency Act (ADA). Further, the Academy had numerous breakdowns in its important stewardship responsibilities with respect to maintaining accountability over the receipt and use of funds. For example, GAO identified improper and questionable midshipmen fee transactions related to: (1) fee collections and uses of fees unrelated to goods and services provided to all midshipmen, (2) fee collections that exceeded the actual expense to the Academy for the goods or services, and (3) the use of accumulated excess midshipmen fees for improper and questionable purposes. GAO found that a weak overall control environment and the flawed design and implementation of internal controls were the root causes of the Academy's inability to prevent or effectively detect numerous instances of improper and questionable sources and uses of funds. Specifically, GAO found that there was a lack of awareness or support for strong internal control and accountability across the Academy at all levels and risks, such as those that flow from a lack of clear organizational roles and responsibilities and from significant activities with affiliated organizations. The internal control weaknesses GAO identified were systemic and could have been identified in a timely manner had Academy and MARAD management had a more effective oversight and monitoring regimen. For example, GAO found that the Academy did not routinely prepare financial reports and information for use by internal and external users. GAO found that various actions were taken and in process that were intended to improve the Academy's internal controls, including actions to address issues of accountability with its affiliated organizations. For example, a permanent position of Assistant Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the Academy was established in March 2009 with direct reporting responsibility to the MARAD CFO. This action provides a senior financial official at the Academy with authority to conduct needed oversight and monitoring of financial activities on a real time basis. Further, following discussions GAO had with Department and MARAD officials, the MARAD CFO took steps to secure and protect accumulated reserves held in commercial bank accounts of an affiliated organization. However, even though MARAD and the Academy have taken actions, much more needs to be done, including determining the amount of midshipmen fees that were used to cover official Academy expenses, performing a comprehensive analysis of the risks posed by the Academy's organizational structure and its relationships with its affiliated organizations, and establishing and implementing policies, procedures, and internal controls over many Academy activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (Academy), one of five United States  service academies, is located in Kings Point, New York, and provides 4- year undergraduate educational programs for men and women  (midshipmen) to become shipboard officers and leaders in the  transportation field.

Academy payments to the SP&C for the use of  the Kings Pointer, totaling $217,848 for the 2-year period of our review,  were questionable in that (1) they were determined on a case-by-case basis  by the SP&C management and (2) no supporting documentation was  provided for these payments. We also found that the usage rates for use of  the Academy\u2019s training vessels was not supported and not based on  consideration of current costs of operation.", "Billings to others for the use of government-owned property should be  made by the government agency, in this case the Academy, that owns the  property. The SP&C\u2019s billing to others for the use of Academy-owned  vessels and directing how much of the usage fees the FCO should remit to  the Academy and to itself demonstrates how intertwined the activities and  personnel of the Academy\u2019s Waterfront Department were with those of the  SP&C. Further, these activities, along with the Academy\u2019s payment of  funds to the SP&C without sufficient support for those payments,  illustrates the lack of control over the source and use of the Academy\u2019s  financial resources.", "We were also told that the underlying study and analysis to determine  hourly usage fees charged for Academy marine asset use during fiscal  years 2006 and 2007 was performed in 1996 or 1997. However, we were  told that supporting documentation was not retained either for the initial  rate study or for the rates in the updated 2004 and 2008 rate booklets. We  also found that the hourly rates per the 2008 rate booklet did not change  from those in the 2004 rate booklet and had not changed from those used  in 1996-1997. Consequently, the Academy has no assurance that the usage  fees cover the full cost of operating the Kings Pointer and other Academy- owned boats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Policies and Procedures and Controls Over Use of Athletic Fees", "paragraphs": ["Fees for the use of government-owned property should be the property of  the agency that holds it, in this case the Academy.

Also, for fiscal years 2006 and  2007, approximately half of the Academy\u2019s annual appropriations were  designated for payroll; however, we found that internal controls over  payroll were inadequate and did not reflect consideration of the limits on  annual appropriations or the risks posed by errors or weaknesses in the  administration of payroll activities.", "For example, Academy internal controls did not prevent improper payroll- related transactions that violated the ADA. Specifically, MARAD stated  that challenges in working with MARAD\u2019s own payroll process and  systems contributed to delays in determining actual payroll expenses for  Academy employees. The payroll for these federal employees is processed  by the Academy\u2019s DRM using MARAD\u2019s existing arrangement with another  federal agency as the payroll servicer.", "Further, the Academy used NAFI employees performing work for the  Academy under Academy employees\u2019 supervision to assist in carrying out  Academy mission functions. The FCO and other NAFIs would hire staff as  employees of their own organizations and then contract with the Academy  for a fee, which the NAFIs then used to pay the payroll and related  expenses of the NAFI staff. Annually, the Academy would execute  agreements with the NAFIs to provide the Academy with services using  one of the Department\u2019s standard forms designed for use with external  parties (MA 949, Supply, Equipment or Service Order/Contract). These  expenses were recorded as contracted services in the Academy\u2019s books  and records. There was insufficient consideration by Academy officials of  the legal and internal control ramifications of these personal services  agreements. The Administrator reported to the Deputy Secretary in his  February 2008 report that the relationships between the Academy and  individual employees appeared to constitute one of personal services,  which reflect an employer-employee relationship instead of an  independent contractual one. The expenses for the services provided by  these agreements totaled over $4 million per year, which represented  about 17 percent of the annual Academy appropriation for salaries and  benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions by the Department, MARAD, and the Academy to Address Certain Accountability and Internal Control Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Over the course of our review, we found that various actions were taken,  and were in process, that were intended to improve the Academy\u2019s and its  affiliated organizations\u2019 internal controls. For example, on October 1, 2007,  MARAD established the Academy Fiscal Oversight and Administrative  Review Board (Oversight Board). The Oversight Board is chaired by the  MARAD CFO and is charged with providing fiscal oversight and  administrative management of the Academy in coordination with the  Maritime Administrator and other MARAD and Academy officials. Another  significant action was the creation in July 2008 of the position of Assistant  Chief Financial Officer for the Academy with direct reporting  responsibility to the MARAD CFO. This position was initially temporary,  but made permanent in March 2009. It provides for a senior financial  official at the Academy to conduct oversight and monitoring of Academy  financial activities on a real time basis. This action, combined with much  needed organizational support by MARAD officials, provides an important  signal emphasizing a focus on the importance of financial accountability.", "MARAD also subsequently submitted a legislative proposal to Congress  seeking authority to convert the NAFI positions to civil service  employment positions. In the Duncan Hunter National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, Congress provided the  Administrator with authority to appoint current NAFI employees to  competitive civil service positions for terms of up to 2 years. Further,  MARAD submitted a legislative proposal to Congress seeking statutory  authority to enter into personal services contracts with part-time adjunct  professors. In the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2009, Congress provided the Administrator with temporary  authority for the 2008-2009 academic year to contract with up to 25  individuals to provide personal services as adjunct faculty.", "We also found that the Department and MARAD made a number of  improvements in its controls during the course of our review. For  example, following discussions with the Department\u2019s Chief Financial  Officer, the MARAD CFO, and the Inspector General and staff during  October 2008, the MARAD CFO shortly thereafter took steps to secure and  protect the accumulated prior years\u2019 balances\u2014held in commercial bank  accounts\u2014of midshipmen fees that totaled approximately $1 million as  well as excess funds from the current year\u2019s fees that also may be as much  as $1 million.", "We also found that action has been taken or is under way on a number of  other important issues as well, including:    MARAD directed the Academy to stop facilitating reimbursable contracts  on behalf of GMATS.", "A billing methodology for certain services provided by the Academy to  GMATS is under development.", "The use of FCO to obtain over $4 million a year in illegal personal services  was discontinued in 2008.", "MARAD is working with Academy officials to address the inappropriate  commingling of activities that we describe in this report involving the  Academy athletics and waterfront departments and certain NAFIs.", "In October 2008, the Maritime Administrator announced the selection of a  new Superintendent. We met with the Superintendent, the MARAD CFO,  and the Academy\u2019s Assistant CFO to discuss the Academy\u2019s significant  flaws in controls and the business risks that our work was identifying. We  also communicated our view that the Academy should aggressively move  forward with change efforts and not wait for a formal report from us with  targeted recommendations for action. The Superintendent agreed with our  suggestions.", "On March 9, 2009, the Secretary reported several violations of the ADA at  the Academy to the President, the Congress, and the Comptroller General,  as required by the act. The Secretary estimated that the multiple violations  totaled as much as $20 million. Further, the Secretary reported that  corrective and disciplinary action had been taken with respect to the  officials responsible for the violations and that MARAD and the Academy  had revised internal control procedures and taken actions and had other  actions under way to improve internal controls at the Academy.", "Finally, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, placed certain restrictions  and limitations on the use of appropriations made for the Academy for  fiscal year 2009. For all apportionments made (by the Office of  Management and Budget) of these appropriations for the Academy, the act  required the Secretary to personally make all allotments to the MARAD  Administrator, who must hold all of the allotments. In addition, the act  conditioned the availability of 50 percent of the amount appropriated on  the Secretary\u2019s, in consultation with the MARAD Administrator,  completing and submitting to the congressional appropriations  committees a plan on how the funding will be expended by the Academy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The problems we identified concerning improper or questionable sources  and uses of funds involving the Academy and its affiliated organizations,  including the known and possible violations of the ADA described in this  report, undermines the Academy\u2019s ability to carry out its basic  stewardship responsibilities and to comply with the ADA and other legal  and regulatory requirements, and may also impair its ability to efficiently  achieve its primary mission\u2014to educate midshipmen. These problems can  be attributed to a weak overall control environment and the flawed design  and implementation of internal controls. Revelations of such activities call  into question the stewardship responsibilities of the Academy and signal  failures of oversight and governance responsibilities. Moreover, such  activities reflect unmitigated risks posed by the Academy\u2019s close  organizational and transactional relationships with its NAFIs, including the  lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

Specifically, we  reviewed laws, regulations, policies, and procedures over Academy  operations and activities;  reviewed the MARAD report and discussed the objectives, scope, and  methodology of the internal control review with MARAD officials;  interviewed selected Department, Department\u2014Office of Inspector  General (OIG), MARAD, Academy, and NAFI staff and officials to  obtain an understanding of (1) their roles and responsibilities, (2) the  internal control environment at the Academy, including the Academy\u2019s  organizational structure and relationships to the NAFIs and  management\u2019s attitude towards and knowledge of internal controls;   (3) the internal controls over selected Academy payments and  activities with its affiliated organizations\u2014the 14 NAFIs and 2  foundations; and (4) MARAD and Department practices for overseeing  and monitoring the Academy; and    obtained an understanding of the sources of funding for both the  Academy and the NAFIs, including the appropriated funds of the  Academy.", "We obtained a database of Academy expenses at the transaction level  covering fiscal years 2006 and 2007 and  compared these data to amounts reported for the Academy by MARAD  in the Department\u2019s annual performance and accountability reports;  compared the total amounts\u2014MARAD including the Academy\u2014in the  database provided to us with the amounts in the statements of net cost  that MARAD submitted to the Department;  reconciled the MARAD Statement of Net Cost in the database to the  Department\u2019s audited financial statements by agreeing the net cost  amounts for MARAD including the Academy that were reported in the  audited financial statements and separately identified in consolidating  statements of net cost schedules for the Department;  analyzed Academy and NAFI payments, Academy collections of  midshipmen fees, and funds from the FCO and GMATS to identify  selected payments for further testing; and  reviewed available documentation supporting selected Academy  payment transactions and requested additional support and  explanations from Academy and NAFI officials to justify the purpose  of these transactions and the sources of funds used.", "To review the collection of current year\u2019s fees from midshipmen and use  of those fees for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, as well as prior years\u2019 reserve  activity for fiscal years 2006 to 2008, we  analyzed the collection and payment activity reflected in records  maintained by the FCO;  requested and reviewed available support to justify the amounts  collected from the midshipmen;  interviewed Academy and NAFI officials with responsibility for  midshipmen fee collections;    discussed the results of our analysis with Academy and FCO officials  and as appropriate requested additional information and explanations  from these officials; and  considered the support and responses we received to assess whether  the collection and use of midshipmen fees were questionable.", "We identified numerous improper or questionable activities and uses of  funds. However, the results of our work are not generalizable to the  population of transactions as a whole because we selected transactions on  a nonstatistical basis. We selected transactions that were significant to the  Academy or the NAFIs and appeared to have a higher risk of being  improper. Consequently, there may be other improper or questionable  activities and transactions that our work did not identify. We reviewed the  March 9, 2009, report of the Secretary to the President, the Vice President  (as President of the Senate), the Speaker of the House, and the Acting  Comptroller General to report several violations of the Antideficiency Act  that occurred over several years and that the Department estimated  totaled as much as $20 million.", "To address our third objective, we obtained relevant documentation on  actions taken, under way, or planned, including the MARAD order  establishing the Academy\u2019s Fiscal Oversight and Administrative Review  Board.", "During our review, we visited the Academy in Kings Point, New York, and  MARAD and Department headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The ADA  contains both affirmative requirements and specific prohibitions, as  highlighted below. The ADA:    Prohibits the incurring of obligations or the making of expenditures in  advance or in excess of an appropriation. For example, an agency  officer may not award a contract that obligates the agency to pay for  goods and services before the Congress makes an appropriation for  the cost of such a contract or that exceeds the appropriations  available.", "Requires the apportionment of appropriated funds and other budgetary  resources for all executive branch agencies. An apportionment may  divide amounts available for obligation by specific time periods  (usually quarters), activities, projects, objects, or a combination  thereof. OMB, on delegation from the President, apportions funds for  executive agencies.", "Requires a system of administrative controls within each agency,  established by regulation, that is designed to (1) prevent obligations  and expenditures in excess of apportionments or reapportionments;  (2) fix responsibility for any such obligations or expenditures; and (3)  establish the levels at which the agency may administratively subdivide  apportionments, if it chooses to do so.", "Prohibits the incurring of obligations or the making of expenditures in  excess of amounts apportioned by OMB or amounts of an agency\u2019s  subdivision of apportionments (i.e., \u201callotments\u201d).", "Prohibits the acceptance of voluntary services or the employment of  personal services, except where authorized by law.", "Specifies potential penalties for violations of its prohibitions, such as  suspension from duty without pay or removal from office. In addition,  an officer or employee convicted of willfully and knowingly violating  the prohibitions may be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not  more than 2 years, or both.", "Requires that for violations of the act\u2019s prohibitions, the relevant  agency report immediately to the President and to the Congress all  relevant facts and a statement of actions taken with a copy to the  Comptroller General of the United States.", "The requirements of the ADA and the enforcement of its proscriptions are  reinforced by, among other laws, the Recording Statute, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7  1501(a), which requires agencies to record obligations in their accounting  systems, and the 1982 law commonly known as the Federal Managers\u2019  Financial Integrity Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c), (d), which requires  executive agencies to implement and maintain effective internal controls.  Federal agencies use \u201cobligational accounting\u201d to ensure compliance with  the ADA and other fiscal laws. Obligational accounting involves the  accounting systems, processes, and people involved in collecting financial  information necessary to control, monitor, and report on all funds made  available to federal agencies by legislation\u2014including both permanent,  indefinite appropriations and appropriations enacted in annual and  supplemental appropriations laws that may be available for 1 or multiple  fiscal years. Executive branch agencies use obligational accounting,  sometimes referred to as budgetary accounting, to report on the execution  of the budget. \u201c personal services contract is one that, by its express terms or as administered, makes  the contractor personnel appear, in effect, government employees. FAR \u00a7\u00a7 37.101,  37.104(a). The government is normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under  competitive appointment or other procedures required by the civil service laws. FAR \u00a7  37.104(a). Obtaining personal services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents  those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services by  contract. Id.
