In implementing the remaining four BRAC recommendations, DOD relocated similar training functions run by separate military services into one location, but the services did not consolidate training functions. For example, they do not regularly coordinate or share information on their training goals and curriculums. DOD's justification for numerous 2005 BRAC recommendations included the assumption that realigning military department activities to one location would enhance jointness\u2014defined by DOD as activities, operations, or organizations in which elements of two or more military departments participate. For these four training functions, DOD missed the opportunity to consolidate training to increase jointness, because it provided guidance to move personnel or construct buildings but not to measure progress toward consolidated training. Without additional guidance for consolidating training, the services will not be positioned to take advantage of such an opportunity in these types of recommendations as proposed by DOD and will face challenges encouraging joint training activities and collaboration across services.", "DOD cannot determine if implementing the 2005 BRAC joint training recommendations that GAO reviewed has resulted in savings in operating costs. For three of the recommendations in this review, the services did not develop baseline operating costs before implementing the BRAC recommendations, which would have enabled it to determine whether savings were achieved. Without developing baseline cost data, DOD will be unable to estimate any cost savings resulting from similar recommendations in any future BRAC rounds. Further, costs reported to DOD by the training functions business plan managers for implementation of two of the six recommendations in this review likely did not include all BRAC-related costs funded from outside the BRAC account. A DOD memo requires BRAC business plan managers to submit all BRAC-related expenditures, including those funded from both inside and outside of the BRAC account. GAO identified at least $110 million in implementation costs that likely should have been reported to DOD in accordance with the memo but were not; therefore the $35.1 billion total cost reported for BRAC 2005 is likely somewhat understated. A DOD official stated that it was up to the military departments to ensure that all BRAC implementation costs were accounted for and that the military departments had the flexibility to determine which costs were associated with the BRAC recommendation and which were attributed to other actions. GAO found that this flexibility in determining which costs were to be reported as BRAC costs led to inconsistencies in what kinds of projects had their costs counted as BRAC implementation costs. By clarifying in guidance what is to be included as a BRAC implementation cost, DOD can help ensure that it has an accurate accounting of the final costs for any future BRAC implementation and that DOD and Congress are able to determine how much money is spent on any future BRAC rounds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To help improve the implementation of jointness-focused recommendations in any future BRAC rounds, GAO recommends that DOD provide additional guidance for consolidating training and reporting BRAC costs and require the development of baseline cost data.

DOD has relied on the BRAC process  as a means of reducing excess infrastructure and realigning bases to  meet changing force structure needs. However, in 2005, in a letter to the  chairman of the BRAC Commission, the Secretary of Defense noted that  the decade since the previous BRAC round had been a period of  dramatic change involving new challenges posed by international  terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ungoverned  areas, rogue states, and nonstate actors. The Secretary saw BRAC 2005  as different from previous BRAC rounds, which focused on reducing  excess infrastructure. The Secretary saw it as a unique opportunity to  adjust U.S. base structure to meet these new challenges and to be  positioned to meet further challenges anticipated during the next two  decades, such as where to locate forces returning to the United States  from overseas bases. Therefore, in addition to reducing excess  infrastructure and producing savings, BRAC 2005 provided opportunities  for furthering transformation and fostering jointness.", "In contrast to recommendations from prior rounds, many of the  recommendations that came out of the BRAC 2005 round were aimed at  creating opportunities to develop jointness, such as expanding and  establishing joint military medical centers, creating joint bases, pursuing  opportunities to promote joint training, and consolidating all of the military  services\u2019 medical training for enlisted personnel at one installation. BRAC  2005 included several recommendations that created new joint training  centers of excellence and realigned training functions to, among other  things, provide opportunities to enhance jointness. According to DOD\u2019s  justification for several of the joint training-related recommendations  contained in the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment  Commission Report, one part of the purpose for those recommendations  was to provide a \u201ctrain as we fight: jointly\u201d perspective to training.", "Since 2005, we have issued over 30 reports and testimonies on BRAC  2005 planning, implementation, costs, and savings; this work highlights  information DOD can use to improve the process for developing and  implementing BRAC recommendations. For example, in our March 2013  report on lessons learned from the BRAC 2005 round, we found that  DOD\u2019s process for providing the BRAC Commission with cost and  savings estimates was hindered by underestimating recommendation- specific requirements and that DOD did not fully anticipate information  technology requirements for many of the recommendations. Our report  made several recommendations designed to improve any future BRAC  rounds and also suggested legislative changes that Congress should  consider to enhance its oversight of any future BRAC rounds. DOD  concurred with three and partially concurred with two out of the 10  recommendations in this report but has not taken any actions because,  according to DOD officials, these recommendations can only be  implemented if another round of BRAC is conducted. The Related GAO  Products page at the end of this report provides a list of our BRAC reports  and testimonies. In addition, see appendix I for findings,  recommendations, and DOD\u2019s response and actions from selected  BRAC-related reports.", "House Report 113-446, which accompanied a proposed bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, included a  provision for us to review the status of DOD\u2019s actions to implement the  BRAC 2005 recommendations that were designed to reduce  infrastructure and promote opportunities for jointness. This report  evaluates the extent to which DOD has (1) implemented the BRAC 2005  recommendations requiring the military services to relocate select training  functions to increase opportunities for joint training and (2) determined if  implementing these BRAC 2005 recommendations has achieved cost  savings.", "To address these objectives, we first identified the BRAC 2005  recommendations that were designed to reduce infrastructure and  promote opportunities for jointness. Based on communication with your  staff and language in the report provision that referred to joint centers of  excellence and joint training activities, we focused our review on joint  training functions created by BRAC 2005. We reviewed all 198  recommendations in the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment  Commission Report and identified 13 recommendations that were  designed to (1) merge or consolidate a training function to make it more  joint, (2) reduce infrastructure, and (3) focus on training or developing  centers of excellence. From those 13 recommendations focused on  training or on developing centers of excellence, we identified and selected  six for this review that were directed at multiple services and called for  consolidating infrastructure at one location. Specifically, we identified five  recommendations that met all of our criteria: (1) Joint Center for  Consolidated Transportation Management Training, (2) Joint Center of  Excellence for Culinary Training, (3) Joint Center of Excellence for  Religious Training and Education, (4) Joint Strike Fighter Initial Joint  Training Site, and (5) Undergraduate Pilot and Navigator Training. In  addition, we chose to review the recommendation related to Ft. Bragg,  North Carolina, because one part of this recommendation was to move  the Army\u2019s 7th Special Forces Group to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to  support joint training with the Air Force Special Operations unit located  there. We visited the locations of all six training functions, interviewed  officials, and collected relevant data and information. Appendix II contains  the text of the BRAC recommendations we reviewed, and table 1 shows  the recommendations that we reviewed, the location of the new training  function, and the services involved.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has implemented the BRAC 2005  recommendations requiring the military services to relocate select training  functions to increase opportunities for joint training, we reviewed the 2005  Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission Report and  implementing guidance for each recommendation. We compared this  guidance to leading practices we developed in our prior work on  consolidations. We also reviewed documentary evidence, such as  course listings, and interviewed DOD, service, and installation officials  responsible for the implementation and oversight of these BRAC  recommendations to gain a better understanding of the process used to  implement each recommendation and to determine the extent to which  each training function created by the BRAC recommendation was able to  take advantage of the opportunities provided by the BRAC  recommendation to develop more consolidated training.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has determined whether  implementing these BRAC recommendations has achieved cost savings,  we spoke with relevant program and budget officials with knowledge of  program budgets. We attempted to gather data on operating costs of  these six training functions from before and after BRAC implementation;  however, we found that these data were not consistently available, as  discussed in the report. We assessed practices reported by these officials  against practices identified in our prior work on cost baselines. Any  operating costs presented in this report are estimates included to illustrate  possible cost changes or to highlight inconsistencies in the data. In  addition, we gathered data from the services on the costs of implementing  these six BRAC recommendations and compared it to the data the  services provided to DOD in 2012. We examined the data in light of  DOD\u2019s August 2010 memo requiring BRAC business plan managers to  submit all BRAC-related expenditures, including those funded from both  inside and outside of the BRAC account. We discussed with relevant  service officials differences in and the oversight of the available data.  Specifically, we discussed the reasons for the differences and which  costs were in fact implementation costs. We discuss the limitations of the  data in this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Unlike  prior BRAC rounds, which were implemented during times of declining  defense budgets and in which the focus was on eliminating excess  capacity and realizing cost savings, BRAC 2005 was conducted in a  global security environment characterized by increasing defense budgets  and increasing military end strengths after the events of September 11,  2001 and was conducted concurrently with overseas contingency  operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. At the same time, DOD was  engaged in an initiative to relocate thousands of personnel from overseas  to the continental United States.", "The scale of BRAC 2005 was much larger than the scales of the prior four  rounds. BRAC 2005 generated more than twice the number of BRAC  actions as all prior BRAC rounds combined. Table 2 compares the  number of individual actions embedded in the BRAC 2005  recommendations with the number of individual actions needed to  implement the recommendations in the prior rounds and shows that the  number of individual BRAC actions was larger in BRAC 2005 (813) than  in the four prior BRAC rounds combined (387).", "The scope of BRAC 2005 was broader than the scope of prior BRAC  rounds. In addition to the traditional emphasis on eliminating unneeded  infrastructure to achieve savings, DOD\u2019s goals for the 2005 BRAC round  included transforming the military by correlating base infrastructure to the  force structure and enhancing joint capabilities by improving joint  utilization to meet current and future threats.  As shown in table 2, the  2005 BRAC round had the second lowest number of major closures, the  largest number of major realignments, and the largest number of minor  closures and realignments. Part of this transformation effort included a  focus on providing opportunities to increase jointness, though many of the  BRAC recommendations focused on consolidations and reorganizations  within the military departments rather than across departments. However,  the six recommendations we reviewed, as well as other  recommendations, including creating joint bases, focused on jointness  across multiple services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Implemented BRAC 2005 Recommendations to Relocate Selected Training Functions but Missed Some Opportunities to Consolidate Training to Increase Jointness", "paragraphs": ["DOD implemented the BRAC 2005 recommendations we reviewed by  requiring military services to relocate selected training functions; however  we found that, although DOD\u2019s justifications for collocating each of the six  training functions that we reviewed mentioned jointness or inter-service  training as a potential benefit, two of the six training functions took  advantage of the opportunity provided by BRAC to consolidate training to  increase jointness. Specifically, we found that DOD implemented all six  recommendations by relocating the select training functions\u2014as  recommended by the BRAC Commission\u2014but that opportunities for joint  training were realized in only two locations. Figure 1 shows the  relocations associated with each recommendation.", "Based on our meetings with officials, we found that officials implementing  two of the six training functions created by those recommendations\u2014the  Joint Center of Excellence for Culinary Training and the 7th Special  Forces Group\u2014had found ways to take advantage of being located  together to consolidate training and train jointly. For example, officials at  the Joint Center of Excellence for Culinary Training stated that while the  Air Force conducts its culinary training separately, the Army, Navy, and  Marine Corps have successfully consolidated two of the three phases of  their training and use a joint curriculum to train students. These officials  stated that they were successful at consolidating the culinary training  curricula for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps because the leadership  involved with implementing this recommendation was supportive of  finding a way to train jointly even if that meant changing their curricula.  Additionally,  Army and Air Force Special Operations Forces officials  stated that the relocation of the 7th Special Forces Group to Eglin Air  Force Base allowed for increased joint training operations with the Air  Force Special Operations Forces located at Hurlburt Field, near Eglin Air  Force Base. These officials stated that they were successful at  consolidating training and increasing jointness because they were already  conducting joint training prior to the BRAC 2005 round and that since their  move, being in closer proximity has made it even easier to train jointly.", "The implementation of the remaining four BRAC recommendations that  we reviewed relocated\u2014moved separate functions to one location\u2014but  did not consolidate training functions. According to officials at the  locations that did not consolidate training, they do not regularly coordinate  or share information on their training goals and curricula, despite the fact  that part of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s justification for the moves in the  BRAC 2005 process was that they would bring a \u201ctrain as we fight: jointly\u201d  perspective to the learning process or would otherwise allow for joint  training. Service officials told us that after these recommendations were  proposed by DOD and approved by the BRAC Commission, they  compared each of their original curricula but did not identify many areas  of overlap. Training function officials stated that they had received  minimal guidance related to consolidating training. Therefore, we found,  they did not adjust curricula to take advantage of their proximity to  consolidate training and possibly be more joint and consolidate space.  Training function officials also stated that their four training functions have  very different missions, making consolidation of their training more  difficult. For example, while both the Navy and the Air Force train their  navigators at Pensacola Naval Air Station, they train them to fly in  different scenarios (e.g., over land or over sea) and in different airplanes.", "Although the services may have differences in their training, the 2005  BRAC Commission Report noted that the Secretary of Defense had  described the 2005 BRAC round as an opportunity to promote jointness.  The BRAC Commission Report stated that while the 2005 BRAC  recommendations would \u201cnot move the ball across the jointness goal line,  Commission decisions would help move the ball down the field\u201d toward  more jointness. Table 3 summarizes the status of each of the six BRAC  recommendations that we reviewed.", "We found that four of the six training functions in our review missed the  opportunity to consolidate training to increase jointness, because DOD  provided minimal guidance to direct those implementing the  recommendations. Service officials stated that to direct the  implementation of the six recommendations we reviewed, DOD provided  them with the language from the BRAC Commission report as well as  guidance for developing business plans. Using the guidance provided,  each of the military departments\u2019 headquarters developed a business  plan. This guidance focused on movement of personnel or construction.  In our previous work on consolidation of physical infrastructure and  management functions, we identified key practices, including developing  an implementation plan for the consolidation. Such a plan should include  essential change management practices such as active, engaged  leadership of executives at the highest possible levels; a dedicated  implementation team that can be held accountable for change; and a  strategy measuring progress toward the established goals of the  consolidation. None of the guidance given to the military departments  provided this type of direction. For example, the language from the BRAC  Commission report for each recommendation we selected for review is  generally less than one page long and contains high level summary  information on costs, the action being recommended, DOD\u2019s justification  for the recommendation, community concerns, and the BRAC  Commissions findings and recommendations. The business plans  developed by the military departments included the text of the BRAC  2005 recommendation, a description of costs and savings for each  moving organization, a list of organizations moving, a time table for the  movement of organizations, details on any military construction, and  environmental information.", "According to a September 2005 memorandum issued by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) and related to planning for BRAC 2005  implementation, the business plans were to serve as a foundation for the  complex program management necessary to ensure that the  recommendations were implemented efficiently and effectively.  Additionally,  the memorandum states that the implementation challenges  presented by transformational recommendations\u2014particularly  recommendations to establish joint operations\u2014underscore the utility and  necessity of the plans. However, officials from the Basing Directorate  under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and  Environment, the group that oversaw the implementation of BRAC 2005,  stated that while the business plans do not include the BRAC 2005  language containing DOD\u2019s justification related to consolidating training to  increase jointness, it is the business manager\u2019s responsibility to  implement the recommendation, taking into account the intent of the  recommendation as described in the justification language. During our  review, however, we found that officials responsible for certifying that  these six recommendations had been implemented were not required by  OSD to certify whether or not they had taken advantage of the opportunity  to increase jointness. Rather, the business plan managers were focused  on the completion of the construction of buildings and the movement of  personnel. Further, officials at the four training functions that did not  consolidate training told us that although they had initially compared each  service\u2019s curricula to identify common training, they felt that there was not  enough overlap in the training for it to be consolidated. They also stated  that they had not received direction from OSD or the military services on  how to consolidate curricula in order to foster jointness in the event that  course curricula had few similarities, prepared personnel to perform  different missions, or used different equipment.", "Like the BRAC 2005 recommendations that directed the relocation of  several training functions in order to promote jointness or consolidate  similar training, another BRAC 2005 recommendation directed the  consolidation of 26 service-specific stand-alone installations into 12 joint  bases to take advantage of opportunities for efficiencies and reduce  duplication of similar support services. In order to implement this joint  basing recommendation, the Office of the Secretary of Defense issued  guidance in January 2008 designed to establish a comprehensive  framework to consolidate installation-support functions while meeting  mission requirements. OSD also created an oversight structure for  handling disputes and established a set of common standards for the  installation support to be provided by each joint base. Furthermore, DOD  issued a directive on military training that gives the Undersecretary of  Defense for Personnel & Readiness the responsibility to oversee and  provide policy for individual and functional training programs for military  personnel and the collective training programs of military units and  staffs.", "If DOD and the services believe that the training functions in our review  can still capitalize on the opportunity to promote jointness provided by the  BRAC 2005 recommendations, additional guidance will be an important  first step toward being able to take advantage of this opportunity. Officials  from the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness agreed  that additional guidance would potentially be helpful in providing  opportunities to consolidate training to increase jointness. Further, in the  event of a future BRAC round, such guidance could provide a useful  framework for taking advantage of the opportunities provided by similar  recommendations focused on developing joint training capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Cannot Determine Cost Savings from Implementing BRAC 2005 Joint Training Recommendations, and It Likely Did Not Report All Implementation Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOD cannot determine if implementing the 2005 BRAC joint training  recommendations that we reviewed has resulted in savings in operating  costs.

For two of the training  functions in our review, DOD was able to provide complete baseline cost  data; however, officials for these training functions could not determine  whether cost fluctuations were due to the BRAC moves. For three of the  training functions in our review, DOD was unable to provide complete  baseline operating costs from before it implemented the BRAC  recommendations, but officials representing these training functions  indicated that implementing the recommendations may have increased  some costs. The Joint Strike Fighter training program established by  recommendation #125 was a new program and therefore there were no  operating cost data prior to BRAC implementation.", "In our prior work, we have identified the importance of developing  baseline and trend data. By developing baseline operating costs,  agencies can better evaluate whether they are achieving their cost  savings targets. In addition, in our 1997 report on lessons learned from  the four prior BRAC rounds, we found that initial cost and savings  estimates for prior BRAC rounds were not based on reliable baseline  data, because they were not of budget quality, were not consistently  developed, and were poorly documented. As we also noted in our 1997  report, sound estimates of savings are important, because DOD may rely  on savings from BRAC for other purposes. In 2014 we found that DOD  was unable to determine whether the consolidation of training at the  Medical Education and Training Campus resulted in cost savings,  because it had not developed baseline cost information as part of its  metrics to assess success. We recommended that DOD develop  baseline cost estimates as part of its metrics to assess cost savings for  future consolidation efforts within the Medical Education and Training  Campus, and DOD concurred with this recommendation. To date, DOD  has not taken any actions to implement this recommendation, because,  according to DOD officials, they cannot take action on these  recommendations until another BRAC round is authorized.", "Two of the training functions in our review\u2014Undergraduate Navigator  Training and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina (7th Special Forces Group move  to Eglin Air Force Base)\u2014were able to provide complete baseline cost  data. However, for these two training functions, officials could not  determine whether subsequent cost fluctuations were due to the BRAC  moves, non-BRAC events, or some combination. For example, the  budget officials from the Air Force\u2019s Air Education and Training Command  were able to provide us with detailed operating cost data for their  undergraduate navigator training, going back to 1996. However, even  with these detailed cost data, the budget officials we met with stated that  they could not account for all of the different events that had resulted in  cost fluctuations during that time. Air Force budget officials further stated  that multiple events such as sequestration, maintenance issues, and  changes in how certain expenses are funded that occurred while BRAC  was being implemented made it extremely difficult to determine whether  any savings in the program\u2019s operating costs were due to the  implementation of the BRAC recommendation or to these other factors.", "For the remaining three training functions\u2014Culinary training,  Transportation Management training, and Religious training\u2014 the  programs could not provide complete operating cost information from  prior to the move. For example, according to Army budget personnel,  the Army culinary, transportation management, and chaplain training  programs did not have data for various reasons, including a change in  accounting systems, and because they are not required to keep data that  far back. In addition, according to Air Force officials, because the Air  Force culinary program is part of a larger multidisciplinary training  program that includes subjects such as fitness and mortuary services, it is  not possible to isolate the costs for the culinary portion of the training.", "While these programs either did not have any baseline operating cost  data or detailed operating cost baselines, in some instances officials were  able to provide examples of where they believed operating costs have  increased as a result of the respective BRAC moves. For example:", "Air Force officials estimated that they spend an additional $300,000  annually to operate the department\u2019s Chaplain Corps College at Fort  Jackson, South Carolina than they did to operate the one at Maxwell  Air Force Base, Alabama. Navy officials provided operating cost data  for their chaplain training program showing that they have spent an  average of approximately $182,000 more per year since relocating to  Ft. Jackson. Officials with both services cited increased travel costs  as the primary driver of these increases, because Ft. Jackson does  not have room for the students to stay on base. Therefore, according  to officials, students from both services must stay at hotels in  Columbia, South Carolina, and officials have to provide transportation  to and from the base.", "A Navy culinary official estimated that sending students to Ft. Lee  costs the service an additional $200,000 per year for airfare compared  to what it cost when all training was at Naval Station Great Lakes,  Illinois. This official also estimated that this travel takes about three  days per student, which results in about $400,000 in lost work time  per year. In addition, the official added that there are other costs  related to getting the students to and from airports. Additionally,  the  Navy culinary official added that the training program has incurred  additional administrative costs because the Army and Navy student  tracking systems are not linked. Specifically, because the systems are  not configured to exchange data, all Navy student data must be  manually entered twice, once in each system. The official said that  this equates to thousands of records per year and could take about  $45,000 in labor costs to accomplish.", "For training functions we reviewed, Navy Joint Strike Fighter officials were  able to identify a cost avoidance as a result of implementing the BRAC  recommendation. As part of implementing this recommendation, the Air  Force built a $59 million Academic Training Center at Eglin Air Force  Base to serve the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Navy Joint  Strike Fighter officials stated that if they had not colocated their program  with the Air Force, the Navy would have had to pay to build and operate  its own Academic Training Center.", "It is now likely not possible to determine baseline costs for implementing  the recommendations in our review in order to determine the extent to  which the implementation of these recommendations resulted in cost  savings. Also, subsequent changes to the programs make it difficult to  determine the effect of implementing the BRAC recommendations.  Although it can sometimes be difficult to attribute costs and savings to a  specific event, such as a BRAC change, DOD will not be able to estimate  whether it has achieved annual savings in operating costs if it does not  collect complete baseline cost data with which to measure progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Final Implementation Costs Reported to DOD for Some Joint Training Recommendations Likely Did Not Include All Implementation Costs", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, we reported on DOD\u2019s estimates of its final implementation costs  for the BRAC 2005 recommendations; however, for two of the six  recommendations in this review\u2014the Joint Strike Fighter Initial Training  Site and the 7th Special Forces Group move to Eglin Air Force Base\u2014we  found that at least $110 million in implementation costs funded from  outside of the BRAC account that likely should have been included were  not reported to DOD by the business plan managers. Thus DOD\u2019s  previously reported total cost of $35.1 billion to implement BRAC 2005 is  likely somewhat understated. The statute authorizing BRAC 2005  established a special treasury account for purposes related to  implementing the BRAC 2005 recommendations. During the lifetime of  this account, DOD could also fund certain BRAC-related costs from  outside the BRAC 2005 account to complete actions needed to  implement the recommendations. For example, the services could use  money obtained through their military construction process to renovate  existing space or build new facilities. In 2010, we recommended that DOD  take steps to capture and appropriately report to Congress any BRAC- related implementation costs that were funded from outside the BRAC  account. DOD concurred with the recommendation, and in August 2010  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations and Environment)  issued a memo requiring BRAC business plan managers to submit all  BRAC-related expenditures, including those funded from both inside and  outside of the BRAC account. We reviewed the business plans for all six  recommendations in our review, as well as data reported by the services  to DOD, and found that none of them contained projects funded from  outside of the BRAC account. Army and Air Force officials that we spoke  with stated that there were general criteria for what could be included as a  BRAC cost in the BRAC 2005 round. According to former business plan  managers for some of the training functions in our review, and Army and  Air Force service headquarters officials, some of these criteria included  that the project be related to the physical move, the cost be for moves  within the continental United States, the project not be related to  addressing a deficiency that existed at the time of the BRAC  recommendation, and the project be needed in order to comply with the  original BRAC recommendation and not be used to accommodate  personnel or mission expansion that happened after the BRAC decision.  However, neither service nor OSD officials could provide us with any  written guidance to this effect. Air Force officials also stated that language  in the Form 1391\u2014the DOD document to submit requirements and  justification to Congress for funding for military construction projects\u2014 would indicate whether the project was BRAC-related.", "For three of the recommendations we reviewed, the military construction  implementation costs reported to us were approximately the same as  those reported to DOD in 2012. Business plan managers for  recommendation 124\u2014Joint Center for Excellence for Religious Training  and Education\u2014reported military construction implementation costs of  approximately $11.6 million to DOD in 2012 and approximately $11.8  million to us in the course of this review. For recommendations 122\u2014 Joint Center for Consolidated Transportation Management Training\u2014and  123\u2014Joint Center of Excellence for Culinary Training\u2014business plan  managers reported combined military construction implementation costs  of approximately $87.6 million to DOD in 2012, and approximately $89.4  million to us in the course of this review. For a fourth recommendation\u2014 Undergraduate Pilot and Navigator Training, recommendation #128\u2014we  could not determine what the total military construction implementation  costs reported to DOD in 2012 were, because this was a bundled  recommendation that contained projects on multiple bases, not just at  Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. However, the final Pensacola  military construction costs reported to us\u2014$90.1 million\u2014were close to  the preliminary military construction estimates of $89.5 million for those  projects.", "In the case of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Ft. Bragg, North Carolina  recommendations, some projects that appear to be related to the BRAC  move and were funded with non-BRAC money were not included in what  was reported to DOD as required by DOD\u2019s August 2010 memo.  Examples of some of these projects that were not reported as BRAC  implementation costs are", "Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) Parking Apron. In the official Form 1391  proposing this project and the need for the parking apron, the title of  the project is \u201cBRAC F-35 A/C Parking Apron.\u201d Further, in the  \u201cRequirement\u201d section of the document, the justification provided by  the Air Force states that the build-up for Joint Strike Fighter  operations includes relocating joint military instructor pilots and  operations support personnel from Luke Air Force Base; Sheppard Air  Force Base; Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California; Naval Air  Station Oceana, Virginia;; and the Naval Air Station at Pensacola, the  moves required by this BRAC recommendation. Air Force  headquarters officials stated that they did not include this as a BRAC  implementation cost because they and the Navy headquarters officials  agreed this cost was not related to the move. However, Air Force  officials at Eglin Air Force Base as well as the Navy Business Plan  Manager indicated that the Parking Apron was a necessary  implementation cost. Furthermore, the cost for every other Air Force  project that cited \u201cBRAC\u201d in the Form 1391 project title was counted  as an implementation cost. By including this reference to BRAC in the  1391, this project was presented to Congress as a BRAC-related cost.  The preliminary estimate for this project was $29 million dollars.", "Other Joint Strike Fighter Support Projects. This includes four  projects related to the establishment of the Joint Strike Fighter training  program.  Three of these projects have language identical to that in  the BRAC Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) A/C Parking Apron in the  Requirement section of their Form 1391, which states that the build- up for Joint Strike Fighter operations includes relocating joint military  instructor pilots and operations support personnel from Luke Air Force  Base, Sheppard Air Force Base, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar,  Ca., Naval Air Station Oceana, VA and the Naval Air Station at  Pensacola. The Form 1391 for the fourth project cites the impending  overcrowding as a result of establishing the Joint Strike Fighter  training program as the justification for the project. Air Force  headquarters officials stated that, for these projects, Air Education  and Training Command or Air Force Materiel Command did not  submit the project to the Air Force BRAC office to determine if it was a  BRAC requirement. However, given the requirement language that  cites the BRAC moves and the impending overcrowding, it is not clear  to us that these were not BRAC implementation costs. Furthermore,  Air Force documentation and headquarters officials acknowledged  that one of these projects\u2014the first phase of the Hydrant Refueling  System Station\u2014was a companion project to the BRAC F-35 A/C  Parking Apron. The combined final cost for these projects was  approximately $20.6 million.", "Housing. Neither the Joint Strike Fighter nor the Ft. Bragg business  plan managers included the housing they built for Joint Strike Fighter  pilot trainees or Special Forces Group soldiers as BRAC  implementation costs. Air Force headquarters officials stated that  there was a disagreement between the Air Force and the Navy about  who should pay for the Joint Strike Fighter housing and how it should  be paid for. In order to complete the housing prior to the arrival of  students, the Air Force agreed to pay for the first housing unit and the  Navy agreed to pay for the second unit. Regarding the barracks for  the 7th Special Forces Group, at least one of these housing units was  originally scheduled to be built with BRAC funding. However, Army  headquarters and Special Operations Command officials stated that,  due to construction delays, the Army reconsidered which funding  source to use for some projects. As a result, all of the housing units  ended up being built with regular military construction money as part  of a larger project and no part of that project was counted as BRAC  implementation costs. The decisions not to count the Joint Strike  Fighter housing unit and the 7th Special Forces Group housing unit as  BRAC implementation costs is inconsistent with the fact that housing  for the culinary and transportation students at Ft. Lee, as well as the  housing for navigator students at Pensacola Naval Air Station, were  counted as BRAC implementation costs. The Joint Strike Fighter  housing unit cost was $17.6 million and the cost of the three Army  housing units ranged from $6.5 to 6.7 million each.", "7th Special Forces Group Training Ranges. The Army built several  training ranges on Eglin Air Force Base to support the move of 7th  Special Forces Group from Ft. Bragg to Eglin Air Force Base. Army  headquarters officials told us that the cost of the ranges was initially to  be considered part of the BRAC implementation cost, and  documentation shows that the Army planned to use BRAC funds to  construct these ranges. However, due to the previously mentioned  construction delays and changes to the funding source of projects, the  ranges ended up being funded with Army military construction funds.  When implementation costs were reported to DOD in the final  business plan, the business plan managers did not indicate that there  were any implementation costs funded from outside the BRAC  account. The reasons for not including the ranges as a BRAC  implementation cost are unclear. Both Army and Air Force  headquarters officials stated that this may have been because the Air  Force already had ranges at Eglin Air Force Base that the Army could  have used. Air Force headquarters officials added that it may have  been because the 7th Special Forces Group did not have these  ranges at Ft. Bragg. However, officials with the Army Special  Operations Command and the 7th Special Forces Group stated that  the existing Air Force ranges at Eglin Air Force Base were insufficient  for their training needs, and that they had all of the ranges in question  when they were at Ft. Bragg. Not including the ranges as a BRAC  implementation cost was also inconsistent with the other  implementations of BRAC recommendations we reviewed, where the  training facilities were counted as BRAC implementation costs.  Construction of the ranges at Eglin Air Force Base cost a combined  $39.3 million.", "An official with the Basing Directorate under the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment\u2014the group that  oversaw the implementation of BRAC 2005\u2014stated that the business  plan managers were expected to include costs that were funded from  outside the BRAC account in their final business plans and that, along  with OSD General Counsel, they reviewed and provided comments on  the cost submissions. However, the Basing Directorate official further  stated that it was up to the military departments to ensure that all BRAC  implementation costs were accounted for, and that the military  departments had the flexibility to determine which costs would be  associated with the BRAC recommendation and which would be  attributed to other actions. We found that this flexibility  in determining  which costs were to be reported as BRAC costs led to inconsistencies in  what kinds of projects were counted as BRAC implementation costs. By  clarifying in guidance what is to be included as a BRAC implementation  cost, DOD can help ensure that it has an accurate accounting of the final  costs for any future BRAC implementation and that DOD and Congress  are able to determine how much money is actually spent on any future  BRAC rounds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["BRAC 2005 provided DOD with the opportunity to consolidate  infrastructure and also to become more efficient and effective in its  operations. To that end, the recommendations for consolidating and  developing joint training programs provided DOD with new opportunities  for furthering transformation and promoting jointness to meet the new  challenges DOD faces. However, two of the six recommendations  focused on training have led to joint training rather than colocation,  despite the opportunity to jointly train the force as it fights. All six  recommendations were implemented as approved, but without additional  guidance, DOD cannot ensure that it takes advantage of the opportunities  provided by BRAC. If Congress approves a future BRAC round, DOD will  have another opportunity to promote jointness should the department  choose to propose such recommendations to a future BRAC  Commission. However, without specific guidance that the military services  can use in implementing jointness-focused recommendations\u2014for  instance on responsibility for monitoring implementation and measuring  progress\u2014the department may again face challenges in moving beyond  colocation of functions.", "In implementing the training-focused jointness recommendations we  examined, DOD did not collect baseline cost data for all of the  recommendations as part of its implementation process, and without  these data it could not determine the actual savings, if any, of  implementing the recommendations. Unless DOD develops baseline cost  data for the recommendations in any future BRAC rounds, it will be  unable to determine the budgetary effect of its actions. Given that we  found some implementation costs were paid for from other than the  BRAC 2005-specific accounts, if DOD does not clarify in guidance the  types of costs that are to be included as BRAC implementation costs,  decision makers will lack reasonable assurance that the department\u2019s  cost data for any future BRAC round recommendations are fully reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To make further progress toward taking full advantage of the opportunity  of consolidating training in order to increase jointness following the  implementation of the BRAC 2005 recommendations, for the training  functions that did not consolidate training beyond colocation, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the Secretaries of the military  departments to provide guidance to the program managers on  consolidating training, if DOD decides that taking advantage of an  opportunity to increase jointness is still appropriate.", "To improve the ability of the military departments to take advantage of  any opportunities provided by recommendations to develop joint training  capabilities in a future BRAC round, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness\u2014in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Energy, Installations, and Environment\u2014to develop and provide specific  guidance for the military departments to use in implementing  recommendations designed to consolidate training to increase jointness.", "To improve DOD\u2019s ability to estimate savings, if any, from future  consolidation of training\u2014including any consolidation resulting from a  future BRAC round\u2014we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the military departments to develop baseline cost data.", "To improve the accounting of any future BRAC rounds, we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Energy, Installations, and Environment to issue guidance clarifying  what costs should be included in final BRAC accounting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In  response, DOD non-concurred with three recommendations and partially  concurred with one recommendation.", "In its letter, DOD stated that our report misunderstands DOD\u2019s approach  to joint and common training and does not completely recognize the  unique circumstances of BRAC recommendation development and  implementation. We recognize that there is a difference between joint and  common training; however, these BRAC recommendations, which DOD  proposed and the BRAC Commission approved, emphasized jointness,  not just common training. In fact, for several of these recommendations,  the Secretary of Defense\u2019s justification included \u201cenhancing jointness\u201d as  part of the rationale, or proposed that the recommendation would allow  DOD to \u201ctrain as we fight; jointly.\u201d", "DOD further stated that our report undervalues the importance of  providing DOD components flexibility to determine BRAC costs and has a  misplaced emphasis on estimating savings for transformational  recommendations. We recognize the importance of flexibility  among DOD  components for most military decisions; however, as our report notes,  flexibility  in reporting BRAC costs led to inconsistencies in reporting of  these costs across the department. In addition, cost and savings  estimates are a part of the BRAC process. Both DOD and the  Commission develop such estimates for each recommendation and did  so for these six recommendations. Moreover, DOD emphasized savings  in some of the six recommendations in its justification to the Commission.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s justification for the Joint Center of Excellence for  Culinary Training reads in part \u201cIt is the military judgement of the JCSG  that consolidation at the location with the largest amount of culinary  training produces the greatest overall military value to the Department  through increased training efficiency at lower cost.\u201d Similarly, for the Joint  Center of Excellence for Religious Training and Education, DOD\u2019s  justification to the Commission reads in part \u201cConsolidation at Fort  Jackson, SC creates a synergistic benefit by having each Service\u2019s officer  and enlisted programs conducted in close proximity to operational forces.  Realized savings result from consolidation and alignment of similar officer  and enlisted educational activities and the merging of common support  functions.\u201d Saving money in implementation of any federal program is an  important goal. We continue to believe that it is important for DOD\u2019s goals  to include saving money where possible.", "DOD did not concur with our first recommendation, to provide guidance to  the program managers of the training functions created under BRAC  2005 on consolidating training. In its response, DOD stated that our report  misunderstands the definition of joint training and that DOD and the  services are constantly seeking ways to improve training opportunities by  either consolidating or collocating individual skills training. DOD further  stated that the Interservice Training Review Organization would be the  proper entity to address the issues identified in our report. In our report,  we noted that the training functions were reviewed and these reviews did  not find much overlap in training between services. Several of these  reviews were conducted by the Interservice Training Review  Organization. Further, one of the purposes of several of these  transformational recommendations was to create opportunities to  enhance jointness, as stated by DOD in proposing them to the  Commission. Enhancing jointness would be going a step further than  colocating services and aspiring to consolidate common training. DOD  also states in its comments that the Interservice Training Review  Organization was involved in implementing the Chaplain  recommendation. Still, we found that, even with this involvement, DOD  did not take advantage of opportunities to consolidate training to increase  jointness in the Chaplain recommendation. We also noted that, in the  absence of guidance from DOD, four of the training functions in our  review did not make any further effort to consolidate training. We continue  to believe that if DOD believes the training functions in this review would  benefit from more consolidation of training, it should issue guidance.", "DOD did not concur with our second recommendation to develop and  provide specific guidance for the military departments to use in  implementing recommendations designed to consolidate training to  increase jointness in the event of future BRAC rounds. DOD stated that  while consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment would be required within a future BRAC  round, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  already has the authority to develop this guidance. We recognize that the  Under Secretary has the authority but as our report points out, it has not  exercised it in this instance, and that guidance is needed to ensure that  DOD takes advantage of the opportunities provided by BRAC.", "DOD did not concur with our third recommendation to develop baseline  cost data in the event of any future consolidation of training. DOD stated  that data calls for BRAC must ensure that the questions asked do not  provide the personnel answering the questions insight into the various  scenarios being considered and that all installations must be treated  equally. Moreover, DOD stated that this is critical to maintaining the  fairness and objectivity of the analysis by preventing the supplied data  from being influenced by gaining and losing locations. During BRAC  2005, DOD estimated that it had collected over 25 million pieces of data  from hundreds of defense installations and presumably was able to do so  in a way that maintained fairness and objectivity without inappropriately  disclosing to personnel providing the information something to which they  should not be privy. DOD further stated that collecting baseline cost data  for training activities in advance of an authorized BRAC process is not  effective because the department will not be able to use previously  supplied uncertified data. Nothing in our recommendation requires DOD  to collect data prior to the implementation of a future, authorized BRAC  round. Finally, DOD stated that it is not clear that a future BRAC round  would include joint training. However, baseline cost data is needed for  measuring either increased costs or savings for changes to any program,  not just joint training. Thus, we continue to believe that without sufficient  baseline cost information, DOD will be unable to determine the budgetary  effect of its actions, including demonstrating cost savings.", "DOD partially concurred with our fourth recommendation, to issue  clarifying guidance regarding what costs should be included in final BRAC  accounting. DOD stated that micromanaging every cost decision across  such a vast program would have been unreasonable and that ultimately,  whether or not to fund various requirements from the BRAC account was  a judgment call made by military headquarters officials. However, DOD  agreed that it would be reasonable to consider placing additional  emphasis on accounting for BRAC costs. We agree that managing a  program as large as BRAC is difficult and that guidance on what costs  should be included in the final BRAC accounting would help DOD to more  accurately report the costs of implementing BRAC.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Energy, Installations, and Environment.
