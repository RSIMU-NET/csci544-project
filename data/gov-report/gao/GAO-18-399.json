Section 129a directs the Secretary of  Defense to establish policies and procedures for determining the most  appropriate and cost-efficient mix of military, civilian, and contracted services to perform the mission of the department. Finally, Section 2463  directs the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  devise and implement guidelines and procedures to ensure that  consideration is given to using, on a regular basis, DOD civilian  employees to perform new functions and functions performed by  contractors that could be performed by DOD civilian employees.", "DOD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining  Workforce Mix (April 12, 2010) (Change 1, Dec. 1, 2017) establishes  policy, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for determining  the appropriate workforce mix of the military, civilian, and contracted  services.

For example, we  found in September 2013 that DOD had improved its methodology for  estimating and comparing the full cost of work performed by military and  civilian personnel and contractor support, but the methodology continued  to have certain limitations, such as the lack of guidance for certain cost  elements related to overhead. We made five recommendations,  including for DOD to assess the advantages and disadvantages of  allowing the continued use of different cost-estimation tools across the  department or directing department-wide application of one tool, and  revise its guidance in accordance with the findings of its assessment.

Further, DOD reported that  the day-to-day functions performed by federal civilian employees do  not always directly correlate to the designated occupational series or  the job title for their position. For example, an individual with an  occupational series assigned as an accountant may actually perform  work more consistent with that of a financial analyst. According to  DOD\u2019s Cost-Comparison Report, DOD did not rely on occupational  series names or job titles alone to determine the actual work being  performed by federal civilians. Specifically, DOD conducted site visits  with each organization and relied on local managers\u2019 direct knowledge  of the actual tasks that their federal civilians and service contractor  personnel performed. According to DOD\u2019s Cost-Comparison Report,  DOD determined that personnel need to perform at least 80 percent  common tasks to be able to make a comparison.

Our prior work has  identified, among other issues, that the absence of a complete and  accurate inventory of contracted services hinders DOD\u2019s management  of these services. According to DOD officials, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) has also recognized  the challenges associated with the various taxonomies and lexicons  associated with articulating the size and composition of federal  civilian, military, and contracted services workforces, and has efforts  underway with the goal of better aligning those to enable more holistic  total force management of all sources of labor.

For example, DOD officials told us that they verified that they had pay records  for every pay period in calendar year 2015 by identifying potential errors  and outliers and sharing these with the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service and the selected DOD organizations for review. Officials also  stated that DOD sent its complete calculated data sets to each  organization for review against their own pay records and that all errors  were corrected or outliers were explained. Additionally, according to our  analysis, DOD excluded overtime from its costs related to federal civilians  in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11.  However, DOD included overtime pay in its report separately for context  and noted that overtime pay is a significant part of civilian compensation  for some organizations. Officials noted that those funded via a working  capital fund arrangements, such as depots, use overtime to handle  surges in demand throughout the year.

DOD reported that contracts are  rarely written to address the cost-per-contractor as a full-time equivalent,  and some contracts do not differentiate between labor and non-labor  costs. DOD noted in its report that the negotiated price of the contract  includes direct costs, including labor and non-labor costs, and indirect  costs such as overhead. Further, the contract costs include service  contractor profit.", "Based on our review of DOD\u2019s Cost-Comparison Report, DOD used non- excludable contract costs as a basis in two of its methodologies. These  costs to DOD are associated with labor, and include pay and benefits  provided to service contractor personnel, contractor profit, and overhead  the contractor included in the cost of the contract. When the number of  service contractor full-time equivalents and full costs for a contract was  known, DOD used the first method, dividing contract costs by the number  of service contractor full-time equivalents to arrive at the cost per service  contractor full-time equivalent. When the number of billable hours was  known, DOD used the second method, multiplying the ratio of contract  costs divided by billable hours by a standard number of annual billable  hours. For contracts in which the labor rate was known but costs could  not be disaggregated, DOD multiplied the labor rate by a standard 1,880  annual billable hours unless a contract specified the labor rate as a  number of annual billable hours. For example, Defense Logistics Agency  contractor-labor rates for wage grade equivalent contractor full-time  equivalents are based on 2,080 annual labor hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Excluded Certain Costs that Comprise Full Costs", "paragraphs": ["We assessed DOD\u2019s report as partially addressing the reporting element  to account for the full cost of federal civilian and contractor personnel  because DOD excluded certain non-labor costs from its costs  calculations\u2014(1) direct non-labor costs for government owned facilities  and government provided supplies, (2) indirect costs for general and  administrative and overhead for civilians, and (3) costs to manage  contracts\u2014from its costs calculations.

However, DODI 7041.04 states that the full cost of  personnel should include direct and indirect non-labor costs, such as  those referenced previously. DOD officials stated that they considered  including non-labor costs in their calculations but did not because they  believe these costs would add approximately the same to both federal  civilian and service contractor costs. DODI 7041.04 instructs that if a  function is performed on government property, the costs of goods,  services, and benefits that are common costs may be excluded provided  the number of government and contactor personnel is equivalent. DODI  7041.04 further instructs that when the number of government and  contractor personnel differs, adjustments must be made to the cost  estimates to account for the difference in number of government and  contractor personnel.  While there were some instances where it was the  case that DOD\u2019s cost estimates involved an equal number of civilian and  contractor personnel performing functions on government property, there  were many instances in where the personnel numbers differed  and  common costs should not have been excluded. For example, in DOD\u2019s  comparisons of federal civilians and service contractors at Fort Belvoir  Community Hospital, DOD conducted comparisons of 19 functions where  2 functions had equal numbers of federal civilian and service contractors  and 17 functions had differing numbers of federal civilian and service  contractors. In one comparison, the number of contractors was over three  times the number of civilians. DOD officials also stated that they believe  their methodology is in accordance with DODI 7041.04 because DODI  7041.04 states that the cost elements in the instruction can be modified or  augmented in each specific case as necessary, but DOD components  should be prepared to support such decisions with sufficient justification.

DOD provided facility costs as an  example of non-labor costs accounted for but not calculated in its cost  comparisons. DOD stated that in its report, all of the civilian positions and  contractor functions are performed at government-owned facilities. Thus,  facility costs are common costs and may be excluded. DOD stated that  their report accounted for facility costs by recognizing that such costs  exist and are common costs, thus, DOD properly excluded such costs in  accordance with DODI 7041.04, and their report satisfied the  Congressional mandate.", "We disagree. As mentioned above, the preamble to the mandated  reporting elements and the second reporting element specifically directed  that DOD account for the fully-burdened cost of DOD civilian and  contractor personnel. Because there are multiple costs associated with  civilian and contractor personnel, calculations are necessary in order to  account for the full cost of these workforces. DODI 7041.04 instructs that  if a function is performed on government property, the costs of goods,  services, and benefits that are common costs may be excluded provided  the number of government and contactor personnel is equivalent. While  there were some instances where it was the case that DOD\u2019s cost  estimates involved an equal number of civilian and contractor personnel  performing functions on government property, there were many instances  where the personnel numbers differed and common costs should not  have been excluded. For example, in DOD\u2019s comparisons of federal  civilians and service contractors at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, DOD  conducted comparisons of 19 functions where 2 functions had equal  numbers of federal civilian and service contractors and 17 functions had  differing numbers of federal civilian and service contractors. In one  comparison, the number of contractors was over three times the number  of civilians. DODI 7041.04 further instructs that when the number of  government and contractor personnel differs, adjustments must be made  to the cost estimates to account for the difference in number of  government and contractor personnel. DOD did not make these  adjustments in is calculations and as result non-labor costs should not  have been excluded; therefore, DOD did not account for the fully- burdened costs, as directed by Congress.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees.
