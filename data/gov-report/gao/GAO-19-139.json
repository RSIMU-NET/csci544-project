State is required by statute to serve notice of such suits or default judgments when other means for effecting service are not available, and charges plaintiffs a fee of $2,275 to complete this task. Plaintiffs in such cases may also qualify for compensation from a fund that Congress established called the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.", "In this report, GAO examines (1) how State completes this service and the length of time it takes to complete requests, and (2) whether State has implemented key controls for executing service requests promptly. GAO reviewed State regulations, guidance, case files, and data from 2007 through 2017; and interviewed State officials in Washington, D.C., the Czech Republic, Germany, and Switzerland, which handle the vast majority of cases. GAO assessed State's controls against federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of State (State) notifies sovereign defendants of court proceedings under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) in a four stage process that has taken on average about 5 months to complete. State headquarters has overall responsibility for delivering legal documents but U.S. embassies and foreign governments play key roles as well. From 2007 through 2017, State completed 229 requests for delivery of legal documents in an average of about 5 months, but about 28 percent of the requests took longer than 6 months and 7 requests took more than a year. Slow delivery could adversely affect a plaintiff's ability to obtain compensation from a special victims' fund that Congress set up in 2015.", "State's guidance and federal internal control standards require controls such as accurate and complete record-keeping, continuous monitoring, and analysis of data; however, GAO found that State lacks several key controls to manage its delivery of legal documents. First, State's records are incomplete. For example, for 82 percent of the cases, State had no information about when it received court requests. Second, State did not monitor the progress of cases, resulting in slow service. This slow service led State to waive fees of about $57,000 because checks had expired. Third, State did not analyze case data to identify factors contributing to slow service, or establish timeframes for completing service. As a result, managers lack a sound basis for making decisions on how to improve timeliness. In June 2018, State took some actions based on GAO's review to improve its performance, including preparing step-by-step guidance and developing a new record-keeping system, but further actions could fill the gaps that have impaired program performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to State, including that it update its record-keeping guidance to ensure its records are accurate and complete, monitor the progress of requests, periodically analyze data to identify causes of slow service and take corrective actions, and establish timeframes for completing service. State concurred with all five of GAO's recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Victims and their families can sue a state sponsor of terrorism in a U.S.  court, but may need to rely on the Department of State (State) to deliver  legal documents. While foreign states generally cannot be sued in a U.S.  court, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) does allow private  parties to sue a foreign government in a U.S. court for specified reasons,  including for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture,  extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, or hostage taking if the defendant  government caused or provided material support for that act and is  designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. Service of process (service)  is the procedure by which the defendant is given proper notice of the  initiation of court proceedings. Under FSIA, when plaintiffs bring legal  action against foreign governments and are otherwise unable to achieve  service using the three other methods set forth in the Act, they may  request that the State provide service through diplomatic channels to the  foreign state. In these instances, State is responsible for completing  service on the foreign government on behalf of U.S. courts at the request  of the plaintiffs by transmitting the necessary documents, and for sending  the clerk of court a certified copy of the diplomatic note indicating when  the documents were transmitted. Plaintiffs filing lawsuits under the FSIA,  including lawsuits on behalf of victims and their families against state  sponsors of terrorism, have won judgments against a number of foreign  governments, including Iran, Syria, and Sudan. Those who have won  judgments can also apply for compensation from a special fund that  Congress set up in 2015. Plaintiffs awarded compensation from this fund  have included Iran hostages held from 1979 to 1981 and their spouses  and children, and victims of the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya  and Tanzania.", "You asked us to review how State conducts service of process. In this  report, we examine (1) how State completes service and how long it takes  to perform this function; and (2) whether State has implemented key  controls in record-keeping, monitoring, analysis, and performance  management for completing service requests. To describe how State  completes service, we reviewed State and embassy documentation such  as regulations, official guidance, and case files. In Washington, D.C., we  also interviewed officials of State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA);  Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, and Bureau of Administration.  Specifically, we interviewed officials in Consular Affairs\u2019 Directorate of  Overseas Citizens Services/Office of Legal Affairs (OCS/L) and  Administration\u2019s Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Office. We met with consular  officials from the U.S. Embassies in Berlin, Germany; Bern, Switzerland; and Prague, Czech Republic. We also met with court officials from three  of the principal courts that have requested service from State. Using  these sources, we developed a process map that we provided to State  officials for their review and comment. State officials did not indicate any  concerns about the process map.", "To document the length of time it took for State to complete service from  2007 through 2017, we reviewed State\u2019s spreadsheet, or case tracker, for  tracking service requests (cases), which documents various milestones in  the completion of service requests made during this time period\u2014for  example, when State received the request and when it notified the court  that service had been completed. Because the data in its spreadsheet  were incomplete, we improved the spreadsheet by supplementing it with  data from other sources such as court records. After making the  appropriate modifications to the data in the spreadsheet, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We analyzed the  data in the improved spreadsheet to determine the length of time it took  for State to complete service for the period 2007 through 2017\u2014the most  recent full-year data available at the time of our review\u2014as well as for key  stages of the process.", "To determine whether State implemented key controls in record-keeping,  monitoring, analysis and performance management for completing  service requests, we reviewed the FSIA and applicable guidelines,  including State and federal guidelines and met with State officials in  Washington, D.C. to discuss how they manage the completion of service,  as well as with consular officials from the U.S. Embassies in Berlin, Bern,  and Prague. These embassies were responsible for completing about 70  percent of all service requests. We also reviewed two State case trackers  to determine to what extent they were complete and accurate, and were  consistent with State record-keeping guidance. Similarly, we reviewed the  59 case files for service requests received in 2015 and 2016 to determine  to what extent the documentation contained in these files was consistent  with State guidance in the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and the Foreign  Affairs Handbook (FAH).", "We used the improved spreadsheet we developed, and worked with State  officials and the responsible plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, to identify 16 cases that  took more than, less than, or about the average amount of time to  process to identify the factors that affect the length of time it takes to  complete service requests. We also identified the principal courts that  have requested service through State. We discussed with court officials  and private attorneys and a firm familiar with service requirements under  the FSIA their experience obtaining service through State. We also met  with officials of the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund,  which was established by Congress to provide compensation to a specific  group of victims harmed by state-sponsored terrorism.

Plaintiffs are responsible for providing defendants both the  summons and a copy of the complaint. This procedure, known as service  of process, gives parties formal notice of the initiation of court  proceedings. In the event of a default judgment against a foreign state in  which the defendant has not responded to a summons or complaint and  the court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, FSIA requires that service of a  copy of the judgment be completed.", "The FSIA prescribes a sequential process for completing service on  foreign governments that plaintiffs must follow before requesting that  State complete service through the diplomatic channel.

Pursuant to  these regulations, where there are no diplomatic or consular relations  between the United States and the defendant foreign government or  where the United States has suspended diplomatic or consular  operations, service may be accomplished pursuant to the arrangement  the United States has with a friendly government known as a protecting  power arrangement. The protecting power arrangement specifies the  consular services that the friendly government will provide in assisting the  United States. As of November 2018, the United States had protecting  power arrangements with the governments of the Czech Republic,  France, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Iran alone  accounted for over 60 percent of all service requests, followed by Syria  with about 7 percent, and Sudan with about 5 percent. Because  Switzerland and the Czech Republic serve as protecting powers for the United States in Iran and Syria, respectively, about two-thirds of all  service requests were accounted for by the U.S. Embassies in Bern and  Prague. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of FSIA service requests by  defendant country from 2007 through 2017. Over the last 2 years, 2016  and 2017, State completed 31 and 48 cases respectively.

The vast majority of service requests were made  through federal district courts. One court\u2014the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia\u2014was the venue for 73 percent of all completed  service requests, followed by 8 percent for the U.S. District Court for the  Southern District of New York and 3 percent for the U.S. District Court for  the Southern District of Florida. According to some plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys  with whom we spoke, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia  has jurisdiction over most cases involving victims of state-sponsored  terrorism.

The Fund was established by  Congress in 2015 with about $1 billion in appropriations. Congress  established the Fund for a period of 10 years ending in 2026 and  mandated that certain forfeiture proceeds, penalties, and fines be  deposited into the Fund if paid to the United States after the Fund\u2019s  establishment. The Fund can provide compensation to those, who (1)  have secured final judgments in a U.S. district court against a state  sponsor of terrorism for a claim arising from an act of international  terrorism for which the state was not found immune from the FSIA, (2)  were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran from November  1979 to January 1981,  or (3) are the personal representatives of the  estate of a deceased individual in one of these two categories. Victims  must file appropriate documentation with the Fund, and be found to  qualify. Compensation for victims is calculated on a pro-rata basis on the  amount of available funds for each distribution, and is subject to certain  statutory caps. The first payments from the Fund were authorized in  December 2016; the second distribution is scheduled for authorization in  January 2019.

Figure 3  summarizes how State completes service in countries where a protecting  power assists in the completion of service under the FSIA.", "The steps involved are numerous and require action by litigants, courts,  and the State Department, but can be summarized in four stages:  1.  Preparing and submitting a request for service to State. Plaintiffs\u2019  attorneys compile and submit the required documentation to the  relevant clerk of court, who transmits the package to State. This  documentation must include two copies of the complaint, summons  and a notice of suit, together with a translation of each into the official  language of the foreign state, or where a plaintiff has obtained a  default judgment against a foreign state, translated copies of that  default judgment and a notice of default judgment, as well as a  cashier\u2019s check made out to the appropriate U.S. embassy for the  applicable fee.  2.  Receiving and processing the request at State. OCS/L receives  the package from the clerk of the court where the suit was filed,  verifies that the package is complete and the check is written for the  proper fee amount, works with plaintiff\u2019s attorney or the clerk of court  to resolve any errors or issues with the package, prepares language  for the diplomatic note and instructions for the embassy staff, and  circulates the diplomatic note and instructions for clearances from  relevant Department of State offices. OCS/L sends, via diplomatic  pouch, this package to the appropriate embassy depending on the  defendant. In cases involving the assistance of a protecting power for  the United States to serve documents under the FSIA, OCS/L sends  the package via diplomatic pouch to the U.S. embassy in the country  that serves as the protecting power for U.S. interests in the defendant  country. In the case of suits against the government of Syria, for  example, the protecting power is the Czech Republic. In cases  involving countries where the United States has diplomatic relations  and an embassy the package goes to the U.S. embassy in the  defendant country.  3.  Receiving and processing a request at U.S. embassies and  working with protecting powers. At the U.S. embassy, an American  consular officer prepares a diplomatic note in accordance with OCS/L  guidance that is added to the package and sends the package to the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In cases involving the assistance of a  protecting power for the United States to serve documents under the  FSIA, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepares instructions for the  consular officer at the foreign interest section of the embassy in the  defendant country and sends him the package. A consular officer in  the U.S. interest section of the protecting power\u2019s embassy in the  defendant country prepares a diplomatic note to add to the package  and delivers the package, or arranges for its delivery, to the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs of the defendant country.  4.  Notifying the court that service has been completed. Once service  has been completed, the package is sent back to OCS/L for delivery  to the clerk of court.

According to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys we interviewed, State\u2019s  taking a long time to complete service could adversely affect victims\u2019  ability to gain compensation for two reasons. First, slow service can  lengthen the time it takes to obtain a final judgment against a foreign  government, thereby delaying plaintiffs\u2019 ability to meet the requirements  necessary to satisfy judgments through asset seizures or to apply for  compensation from the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.  For efforts to collect judgments through asset seizures, plaintiffs\u2019  attorneys explained that the first plaintiff to successfully make such a  claim is awarded the entire asset. Thus they are competing to be first in  making such claims. Second, slow service can also reduce the total  award that claimants receive from the Victims Fund. For example, slow  service could result in plaintiffs being unable to provide the required  documentation before the deadline of a particular round of distributions  for the Fund. The deadline for the 2019 distribution was September 14,  2018.", "The Fund\u2019s procedures allow victims to apply for compensation after a  court has issued a default judgment that includes compensation against  the defendant government in their case and following their transmittal of a  request for service of the default judgment through State.

The first type of  documentation or record is a \u201ccase tracker\u201d spreadsheet that OCS/L uses  to document the status of service requests (cases). The second type of  record OCS/L relies on is case files which include various documents  related to the completion of service.", "We analyzed the case tracker that OCS/L provided to us in November  2017. We determined that it did not contain complete and accurate data  about the service requests from 2006 through 2016 because it did not  contain any fields documenting the start of the process at State\u2014for  example, the date when the court sent the request to OCS/L or the date  when OCS/L received the request. Without this, OCS/L lacked any data  about when it first received and began working on a request. In addition,  OCS/L lacked data about the status of any service request during the  initial document review and clearance stage of the process, which as  previously discussed, is the most time consuming stage. In response to  our request for additional data to use in analyzing the timeliness of State\u2019s  service completions, in December 2017, OCS/L provided us with an  updated tracker containing three fields not in the previous tracker. The  three fields were designed to capture the start of the process, but were  often blank. For example, 82 percent of the cases did not contain the date  when OCS/L received the request from the court. By contrast, our  analysis of both the November 2017 and December 2017 case trackers  showed that OCS/L almost always recorded the \u201cend dates\u201d in the  process when service was completed and when OCS/L notified the court  that service had been completed.", "We also reviewed the 59 case files OCS/L provided for the 2015 and  2016 service completions and determined that OCS/L did not consistently  keep copies of several critical documents. We chose these years  because OCS/L officials said that providing case files for the entire period  under review would present a significant logistical challenge and the case  files for the prior years were less complete. As table 2 summarizes, all but  three files contained a copy of the memorandum providing instructions to  the embassy and language for the diplomatic notes. Nine case files were  missing a copy of the diplomatic note. There were also 16 case files  missing the certification that service was completed on a specific date.  These two documents are critical to demonstrating that service has been  completed. There were also 47 case files lacking a signed copy of the  notification to the court. None of the 59 case files we reviewed included a  copy of an email required by State guidance providing key information on  the completion of service. The Foreign Affairs Manual requires embassies  to send OCS/L an email documenting when documents required for  service were received by the embassy, when those documents were  transmitted to a foreign ministry, and the date an executed request was  sent to OCS/L for relay to a court (including invoice, registry, and pouch  numbers by which the documents were returned to State headquarters),  but none of the files we reviewed contained this documentation. Table 2  summarizes the results of our review of the case files.", "In discussing why their case tracker and case files are incomplete and  sometimes inaccurate, OCS/L officials noted that State\u2019s agency-wide  record-keeping guidance does not prescribe what kind of records they  must keep for service requests. Federal internal control standards state  that management should implement control activities through policies  such as through day-to-day procedures or guidance. Additionally, these  standards state that management should design controls to achieve  objectives and respond to risks. These controls could, for example,  document significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to  be readily available for examination or require edit checks during  information processing. Further these control activities should ensure  that documentation and records are properly managed and maintained. In  September 2018, after reviewing our analysis, State officials said that as  a matter of practice they had begun digitally scanning service documents,  but still did not have a standard list of documents to be maintained in  case files. They also acknowledged that the level of completeness of the  \u201ccase tracker\u201d and case files varied depending on the individual  maintaining the files.", "Additionally, in June 2018 State launched a new case tracker using a  database management application. According to OCS/L officials, the new  tracker will facilitate the recording and updating of key milestone  information. The new tracker allows for including some information not  documented in the previous case tracker spreadsheet. However, it does not capture the date the court sent the request to OCS/L. According to  OCS/L officials and our analysis, the time between when the court sent  the request to OCS/L and OCS/L receives the request can vary  significantly. In nine instances, it took from about 3 weeks to over a year  for the service request to travel from the court to OCS/L. OCS/L officials  explained the new tracker does not capture the date when the court sent  the package because they believe the key information they need to use in  analyzing and managing the program begins at the point where OCS/L  receives the package and not before. However, without capturing this  data, OCS/L will not be able to determine the extent to which service  requests are delayed in CA\u2019s mailroom before being delivered to  OCS/L\u2014one of the four key stages of the process for completing service.

Additionally, federal  standards for internal control state that management should establish  monitoring activities, evaluate the results, and remediate any  deficiencies. OCS/L officials indicated that they have not continuously  monitored service requests because they are not required to do so.

Based  on our analysis of available data and records kept by the U.S. Embassy  Bern we determined that the time it took OCS/L to review and clear  service requests led to OCS/L\u2019s waiving the fees because checks for  payment of services had expired by the time they reached the U.S.  Embassy in Bern. In one such instance, OCS/L took 131 days to send  the request to Bern. OCS/L directed consular officials to proceed with the  provision of service without receiving payment. Our analysis showed that  this occurred in approximately 27 percent of all available service requests  handled by Bern in 2016 and 2017.

These included: (1)  incomplete packages provided by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys; (2) the time it takes  to deliver diplomatic pouches to embassies, which can vary by post; (3)  delays due to some foreign governments\u2019 avoidance or delay in accepting  meetings with consular staff; and (4) consular officials\u2019 level of familiarity  with service requirements as well as heavy consular workloads. Our  analysis of available data showed that the document review and  clearance stage in Washington, D.C. took longer than the other stages.  However, we were unable to determine the extent to which the longer  time taken in Washington, D.C. was due to documentation that was  missing from the package that was sent by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys because  OCS/L only recorded a handful of cases where this occurred and did not  record the date when OCS/L first received the service request or the date  it determined the request was complete and free of errors. Moreover,  while OCS/L officials attributed most of the time it took to complete the  process to the time it takes to deliver documents overseas, our analysis  showed that most of the time spent processing requests was consumed  by OCS/L in the document review and clearance stage in Washington,  D.C. Without periodically analyzing data on service requests, as called for  in the Foreign Affairs Manual, OCS/L will not have a sound basis for  determining the causes for delays in completing service and how to make  improvements to eliminate those delays and reduce service completion  times. In September 2018, OCS/L officials told us that they planned to  begin using data to, among other things, measure current and past FSIA  workload and performance and identify areas for improvement. However,  they could not provide details or documentation of this effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs Has Not Established Performance Standards to Manage and Improve Its Provision of Service Under the FSIA", "paragraphs": ["Consular Affairs has not established performance standards for the full  process used to complete service requests. Consular Affairs officials said  they have not established performance measures for the full process  because they do not have good data to do so. When we began our  review, Consular Affairs did not have any time frames for completing  service requests. However, in June 2018, OCS/L issued a new manual  that includes timeframes for certain steps of completing service within  OCS/L. For example, the manual states that once OCS/L has received a  service request package, the package must be reviewed within 2  business days to determine whether it contains any errors, omissions, or  other issues that must be resolved. The manual also states that if OCS/L  does not get clearance to send the package to the embassy within 2  weeks, then a senior OCS/L official must be notified for further action.  However, the manual does not specify a deadline for staff to contact the  plaintiff\u2019s attorney to correct any problems with the package, such as  missing documents, nor does the manual establish an overall timeframe  for State to complete the document reviews and clearances in  Washington, D.C. and U.S. embassies.", "GAO\u2019s prior work has demonstrated the importance of setting  performance standards that can be used across a range of management  functions to improve results. In addition, federal internal control  standards state that management should design control activities\u2014such  as setting of performance standards\u2014to achieve objectives. Setting  performance standards, among other things, can provide managers with  crucial information on which to base their organizational and management  decisions.", "Consular Affairs has established performance standards for some of its  other activities. For example, in fiscal year 2017 Consular Affairs  established performance standards for processing passport applications  within published timeframes and ensuring that visa applicants were  interviewed within a 3-week period. For fiscal years 2018 and 2019,  among other goals, the Bureau established a performance standard of  100 percent to activate appropriate consular crises response tools, such as travel warnings and security and emergency messages, within 6 hours  after notification of a crisis event.

In analyzing cases from 2007  through 2017, we identified multiple opportunities to improve the  management and oversight of the process. Despite State\u2019s recent steps  to improve how it completes service, additional actions could help to  ensure that service is completed in a timely manner. For example,  guidance that specifies information that OCS/L must maintain in its case  tracker and case files would help ensure that State has complete and  accurate information on service requests.

We also met with officials of State\u2019s Bureau of Consular  Affairs. Consular Affair\u2019s Directorate of Overseas Citizens Services/Office  of the Legal Affairs (OCS/L) is responsible for managing State\u2019s  completion of service. Based on discussions with OCS/L and  documentation, we mapped how OCS/L manages the process in  Washington, D.C and confirmed the process that we mapped with State  officials. We met with officials from State\u2019s Diplomatic Pouch and Mail  Office, who described how they put together and track diplomatic  pouches from State to embassies overseas. Because the role of consular  and other officials at embassies overseas in completing service to  defendant foreign governments is crucial, we also met with consular and  other officials at the U.S. Embassies in Berlin, Germany; Bern,  Switzerland; and Prague, Czech Republic.", "We selected these embassies based on (1) the number of service  requests each handled, and (2) the method each uses to complete  service. The U.S. Embassies in Bern and Prague ranked first and second  on the list of embassies managing service requests, while the U.S.  Embassy in Berlin ranked fourth. In the Czech Republic, we met with  officials of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who described how they  receive and complete service requests from the U.S. Embassy in Prague.  Similarly, the Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided us with a detailed  description of how it receives and completes service on the Iranian  government. We cannot generalize our findings from these two countries  to any other countries, and note that the majority of the other countries  received five or fewer requests for the 11 years we reviewed.", "To describe the process used by courts and attorneys that represent  plaintiffs filing lawsuits against foreign governments under FSIA to  request service from State, we met with court officials and plaintiffs\u2019  attorneys. Using a spreadsheet that State provided us in December 2017,  we identified the top four federal courts that requested service from State  from 2007 to 2017 (the most recent full year available) and met with  officials from three of these courts. We based our description of the  procedure followed by court officials and attorneys say they follow at the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia because about  three-fourths of all service requests were made through that court. Using  a spreadsheet that State had provided, we also identified and met with 10  firms that had requested service from State. The firms that we met with  had a mix of experience requesting service from State. Some firms had  extensive experience and others had little experience requesting service  from State. We cannot generalize the responses to these firms to all firms  that requested service from State.", "To determine the length of time it took for State to complete service from  2007 through 2017, in December 2017 we obtained a spreadsheet that  OCS/L developed. This spreadsheet documents various milestones in the  completion of service requests made during this period\u2014for example,  when the court sent the request to OCS/L, when OCS/L received the  request, when OCS/L sent the request to the appropriate embassy, and  when OCS/L notified the court that service had been completed. Because  OCS/L officials provided data that was not complete, we developed an  improved spreadsheet, using the spreadsheet we received in December  2017 as our starting point and improving the spreadsheet through the use  of supplemental data. To develop the improved spreadsheet, we first  identified requests for service, based on our examination of the original  spreadsheet, which appeared to have not been completed or were not  related to FSIA service. We requested clarification from State about  whether we should keep those requests in our improved spreadsheet,  and where appropriate, removed some service requests. We then  checked the remaining requests in the original spreadsheet against court  data obtained from the Lexis-Nexis database Courtlink. After completing  this process, we once again asked OCS/L officials for clarification about  certain service requests and incorporated their feedback. In June 2018,  State provided us with a copy of a new case tracker that OCS/L officials  had created. We incorporated data from 2017 into our improved  spreadsheet and once again checked the service requests in our  improved spreadsheet against court records. After making the appropriate  modifications, we had 289 requests for service between 2007 and 2017.  We processed the data in our improved spreadsheet using data analysis  software.", "We estimated, among other things, the mean and median lengths of time  it took for State to complete service from 2007 through 2017, as well as  for the three of the four key stages of the process for which State is fully  responsible. We estimated the time elapsed as the difference in calendar  days between the key dates that were available, for example, between  the date State notified the court that service was completed and the date  the court had sent to OCS/L the request for service. The three stages for  which we were able to estimate timeliness were (1) the days between the  date State received the request from the court and the date OCS/L sent  the request to the appropriate U.S. embassy overseas and, (2) the days  between the date OCS/L had sent the request to the embassy and the  date when service was completed overseas and, and (3) the days  between the date that service had been completed by the embassy or  protecting power and the date when OCS/L notified the court that service  was completed. The time taken for these stages includes the times for a  number of activities that we could not precisely estimate, such as the time  it took for the court\u2019s request to reach OCS/L and the time taken for  service documentation to be sent via diplomatic pouch to and from the  appropriate embassy. We used the date the court sent its request to  OCS/L as our start date because that was the most complete start date  data among the three options available. We restricted our analysis to  those cases for which State had completed service.", "One limitation that we had to address in our analysis was the lack of  certain key dates in OCS/L\u2019s spreadsheet for some of the requests. In  particular, while the date we used as the start date (which was the date  on which the court sent its request for service to OCS/L) had the most  complete data of the three possible start dates, the data were missing for  59 of the 289 requests for service that we were able to document. We  calculated overall time elapsed for the document review and clearance  stage using that date, but then had to do some sensitivity analysis to  check that the missing dates were not skewing our results. To perform the  sensitivity analysis, we identified those instances when the date the court  sent its request to OCS/L was missing, but an alternative start date, either  the date of the request letter, or the date when OCS recorded receiving  the request, was present. We were able to identify 40 instances where  this happened for the 59 missing cases. Our calculations using  estimations of the missing \u201ccourt sent to OCS/L\u201d dates indicated that the  results we present would likely have changed minimally if we could have  included them. In addition, we conducted further analysis of the  characteristics of the 17 service requests that had no start date of any  kind and found that these were generally similar to ones for which we had  start dates. However because these simulations indicated that there  would be minor changes, we present qualified rounded numbers in the  main body of the report.", "We also used the improved spreadsheet to extract other information, and  calculate timeliness by the years for which the requests were made, the  courts making requests for service, the countries for service, and the date  of service requested. In addition, we estimated the time elapsed for  service for each case for which we had data and generated a list of  service requests sorted from the ones that took the longest to those that  took the least amount of time to complete.", "To determine whether State has implemented key controls in record- keeping, monitoring, analysis, and performance management for  completing service requests, we met with OCS/L officials in Washington,  D.C. to discuss how they manage the process, as well as with consular  officials from the U.S. Embassies in Berlin, Bern, and Prague. We also  examined the 59 service request case files for requests received in 2015  and 2016. This sample is not generalizable to all requests for service  between 2007 and 2017. We determined to what extent these files were  missing key documents, such as a signed copy of the notification letter or  the diplomatic note. We also reviewed the December 2017 spreadsheet  that we had obtained from State to determine to what extent the  spreadsheet contained missing data as well as a November 2017  spreadsheet. As discussed earlier, because OCS/L officials did not  provide complete data, we created a separate improved spreadsheet  using court data. We analyzed the data in the improved spreadsheet we  created to determine where bottlenecks were occurring. We also used the  improved spreadsheet to help identify and review 16 service requests in  more depth with OCS/L officials. We selected these 16 service requests  to include: 6 requests that took well above the average number of days to  complete, 5 that took about the average amount of time to complete, and  5 that took below the average amount of time to complete. We met with  OCS/L and consular officials, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to discuss  events related to the 16 requests we had identified for review. We  obtained documentation from the U.S. Embassies in Bern and Prague for  the actions taken in providing service, the controls implemented, and the  records of transactions that they maintained. We met with officials from  three principal courts that request service, as well as officials of the U.S.  Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund (Fund) to discuss how service  could affect the progress of court cases and the compensation awarded.  Finally, we assessed State\u2019s implementation of key controls against  applicable laws, including the FSIA and Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993, as well as State guidance and federal internal control  standards.", "To determine the reliability of the data used in the report, we manually  checked State\u2019s December 2017 spreadsheet as well as the improved  spreadsheet that we developed for logical and other errors\u2014for example,  for dates that seemed out of order. We also performed electronic checks  on the improved spreadsheet to identify logical and other errors. Where  appropriate, we made adjustments to the improved spreadsheet. Based  on the results obtained, we determined that the improved spreadsheet  that we developed is sufficiently reliable for our use, though we note the  limitations in terms of the start dates, which required us to conduct  sensitivity analyses, as described earlier in this OSM, to increase our  confidence in the overall estimates for timeliness and for the document  review and clearance stage of the process (stage 2). As noted above, we  are rounding our estimates to reflect this limitation and qualifying them as  approximations.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to December  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
