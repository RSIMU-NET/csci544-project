Accordingly, since 1975 the United States has resettled hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from the region, including about 12,900 Indo-Chinese refugees under the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA). The CPA was an arrangement, or nonbinding agreement, for achieving a durable solution to the continuing flow of asylum seekers in the Southeast Asia region, adopted by the governments represented in the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees in Geneva on June 13-14, 1989.", "In response to your request, we reviewed the implementation of the CPA. Specifically, we (1) determined whether the first-asylum countries of Hong Kong and Indonesia implemented CPA refugee status determination procedures in accordance with international standards and criteria,(2) developed information about alleged corruption in the program, and (3) ascertained whether asylum seekers returning to Vietnam had encountered persecution.

However, we were not permitted to review Hong Kong or Indonesian government files, nor did we interview individual asylum seekers in these countries. Moreover, as with most human endeavors such as this, actual refugee status decisions involved considerable judgment on the part of interviewing and reviewing officials in determining the merits and credibility of the applicants\u2019 claims, particularly when many asylum seekers lacked evidence and documentation to substantiate their claims. We do not believe the information in UNHCR\u2019s files was sufficient for us to make conclusive determinations on asylum seekers\u2019 refugee status; however, we believe it was sufficient to assess whether status determination decisions made by country and UNHCR officials appeared reasonable based on international refugee adjudication standards.

Davis, III, and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, we are currently examining other aspects of the CPA\u2019s implementation in Hong Kong and Indonesia, as well as in Malaysia and the Philippines. This work involves about 235 individual asylum seeker cases and focuses primarily on an analysis of whether the cases may be of special interest to the United States. Our emphasis is on cases involving family unity and victims of violence, which are not addressed directly in this report, and on some cases involving refugee status determination.

However, by the late 1980s an unabating outflow, large numbers of asylum seekers already in asylum camps, and continuing resettlement placed increasing burdens on neighboring countries and territories and Western countries, and the need for a durable solution to the problem became critical.", "In June 1989, 75 countries, including the United States, Great Britain, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, and Vietnam adopted by declaration the CPA agreement to deal with the problem. The agreement\u2019s primary objectives were to deter clandestine departures, provide temporary refuge to all asylum seekers, establish procedures for determining their refugee status, resettle in third countries those found to be refugees, and repatriate those determined not to be refugees.", "The agreement stipulated that refugee status determination screening was the responsibility of the national authorities of individual first-asylum countries, in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, bearing in mind the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and taking into account the special situation of asylum seekers and the need to respect the family unit. Refugee status determination procedures were to be structured in accordance with international norms and were to employ internationally accepted refugee status determination criteria. International screening procedures include prescreening counseling for applicants, first-instance screening, and an appeal process for denied applicants.", "Notwithstanding the responsibilities vested with the first-asylum countries under the CPA, the agreement placed a number of important responsibilities on UNHCR.

To ensure its effective implementation, the plan, among other things, established that", "UNHCR, with the financial support of the donor community, would be in charge of continuing liaison and coordination with concerned governments and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations to implement the agreement;", "UNHCR was to participate in the refugee status determination process in an observer and advisory capacity; and", "UNHCR would be responsible for (1) providing training to first-asylum country officials to help ensure fairness and consistency in the screening process; (2) coordinating the timely resettlement of those found to be refugees; and (3) administering a safe, dignified repatriation program for those found to be nonrefugees.", "Appendix I discusses UNHCR\u2019s responsibilities under the CPA relative to its U.N. chartered authorities and responsibilities.", "The Charter of the Office of High Commissioner authorizes UNHCR to make its own determinations about individuals\u2019 refugee status. This authority is commonly referred to as mandate authority. In what is essentially an additional procedure in the refugee status determination process, UNHCR has examined under mandate authority many asylum seekers that were denied refugee status by national authorities. Some first-asylum countries, such as Hong Kong, have recognized UNHCR\u2019s mandate authority; others have not.", "Although not a requirement of the CPA, UNHCR has also carried out a returnee monitoring program designed to ensure that asylum seekers returning to Vietnam did so under conditions of safety and dignity and in conformance with Vietnamese and international law.", "According to State Department statistics, over 120,000 Vietnamese were screened under the CPA. As of March 1996, about 33,200 had been screened and resettled in third countries. About 75,500 had returned to Vietnam. A total of 36,623 remained in asylum camps in the region as of March 1996. (See fig. 1.)", "In March 1996, the Steering Committee of CPA member countries announced the CPA\u2019s formal closure as of June 30, 1996. The Committee reaffirmed that the only viable option for Vietnamese determined to be nonrefugees was for them to return to Vietnam, either voluntarily or under a mandatory repatriation program. The Steering Committee directed UNHCR to, therefore, phase down its care and maintenance activities and staffing in the first-asylum countries as of that date. In the case of Hong Kong, mindful of the special circumstances prevailing in the territory and the large number of asylum seekers still in the camps, UNHCR was to make other appropriate arrangements to resolve the asylum seeker problem as soon as possible.", "The application of international and U.S. refugee screening criteria can differ somewhat and could result in different screening decisions. For example, under U.S. criteria an asylum seeker could be properly considered a refugee solely on the basis of past persecution, but under international criteria, this is only one of several elements to be considered. Other elements include whether (1) the past persecution was distant in time, (2) the individual was subsequently able to lead a normal life, and (3) it is reasonably likely that the individual will be persecuted on return to his or her country. Therefore, individuals considered refugees under U.S. criteria may not be refugees under international criteria.

The officers\u2019 training program included a 9-day seminar of lectures and workshops and an extensive list of readings, including articles and books on Vietnam and human rights topics. Immigration Department officials told us most of the interviewing officers were also sent to Vietnam for 7-day familiarization visits. We were told that an extensive library of materials on conditions in Vietnam was established for the officers\u2019 use. At the height of CPA screening there were approximately 220 interviewing officers.", "According to UNHCR officers in Hong Kong, informal monthly staff meetings were held during the initial phases of the screening program at which Hong Kong\u2019s procedures were discussed and critiqued. We were told that if issues or points were raised that needed to be brought to the government\u2019s attention they were passed on to Immigration Department officials.", "The UNHCR officials also said that in accordance with a 1988 agreement with the Hong Kong government, UNHCR monitored and advised the government on its refugee screening procedures and provided the government periodic formal assessments of its procedures. According to UNHCR officials, these assessments identified various problems and suggested improvements. Early problems with Hong Kong first-instance screening procedures that UNHCR brought to the government\u2019s attention included inadequate interpretation of applicants\u2019 statements during screening interviews, questionable interviewing practices and techniques by interviewing officers, and inadequate assessments of applicants\u2019 claims by interviewing officers. Hong Kong government officials with whom we met also acknowledged such problems with screening procedures. UNHCR officials told us the Hong Kong government was very responsive to the problems raised and endeavored to correct them. The Chairman of the Refugee Status Review Board told us that the quality of interviewing officers\u2019 first-instance screening decisions varied widely initially but that the officers had good training and learned quickly.", "To gain greater insights into Hong Kong\u2019s screening procedures, and as a limited test of them, we examined 10 selected cases in which asylum seekers had been screened out by the Hong Kong authorities and denied mandate by UNHCR.

Another had been offered resettlement in the United States but refused the offer unless his son, who was screened separately as an adult and denied refugee status, could join him. In two other cases, we concluded, based on the documentation in UNHCR\u2019s files, that the applicants had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. In the fifth case, the applicant was screened out due to a lack of plausibility about portions of his claims. However, when we raised questions about portions of his claims and pointed out to UNHCR the strength of those aspects of the claim where plausibility had not been questioned, UNHCR reexamined his case and mandated refugee status for him. A UNHCR official acknowledged judgmental errors in this case. According to the official, any system dependent upon human judgments will sometimes produce errors.", "In the other five cases, documentation in UNHCR\u2019s case files indicates that the applicants could not establish a well-founded fear of persecution for any of the reasons specified in the 1951 Convention.

The first documented reporting of corruption appeared in June 1991, when a UNHCR official at Galang in a memorandum to his office in Jakarta reported rumors of P3V officials soliciting sexual favors from female asylum seekers and offerings of such services by the asylum seekers in exchange for favorable screening decisions. Boat People S.O.S. provided us numerous statements, affidavits, and referrals of individuals who had been asked for or had paid bribes or other demands for themselves or family members in exchange for favorable screening decisions. The alleged corruption involved not only Indonesian government officials in Galang and Jakarta, but two Indonesian legal consultants employed by UNHCR, as well. The allegations included assertions that asylum seekers with genuine refugee claims were screened out due to their inability to met corruption demands.", "Affidavits and interviews with individuals referred to us by Boat People S.O.S. and discussions with UNHCR officials in Jakarta and Galang and inhabitants of the Galang camp indicated potentially widespread corruption in the screening process. UNHCR officials told us that there was undoubtedly corruption in the camps during the screening process. And, residents in the camp indicated that corruption existed. A Vietnamese camp leader told us, for example, that P3V officials actively solicited bribes and asylees willingly offered payment in exchange for help in the screening process.", "UNHCR officials told us that despite widespread rumors of corruption they had no hard evidence of it. A senior UNHCR official told us that UNHCR had no authority to investigate Indonesian government officials\u2019 activities and that UNHCR could only urge Indonesian authorities to pursue the matter. The official told us that Indonesian authorities regularly conducted investigations at Galang and that a number of cases were overturned as a result. He said, because P3V officials were removed and cases were overturned, he concluded that corruption was involved. He said he never saw a documented corruption case, however, and Indonesian authorities did not acknowledge corruption. Indonesian officials also denied to us that any corruption existed in the refugee determination process.", "UNHCR officials in Indonesia told us they took various steps to combat corruption by pressuring the Indonesian government to minimize it. These included mentioning allegations to Indonesian authorities, discussing rumors with high-level foreign government officials during consultations and visits to the Galang camp, and publishing allegations in quarterly operations reports, all in the attempt to embarrass the government into acting.", "UNHCR officials acknowledged there were no posters or leaflets distributed in the camps urging residents not to participate in corruption and to report any bribery solicitations. There were no UNHCR notices or warnings to camp officials. There were also no provisions, such as hot lines, established for residents to report anonymously.", "A UNHCR official at Galang told us that on his own initiative he conducted a 15-month investigation into corruption in the camp. The official, who for a time lived in the camp and had his own network of informants, was unable to obtain proof of corruption. During his investigation, the official compiled a list of about 40 corruption cases, all instances of individuals paying bribes but being screened out nonetheless. The official said he heard of these cases only because the individuals were complaining in an attempt to recoup their bribe money. According to the official, none of the cases in his investigation involved individuals with strong refugee claims being screened out because they could not pay bribes. The official concluded that asylum seekers were active participants in corruption and were unwilling to provide direct evidence because it benefited those with weak claims.", "In response to intense criticism by nongovernmental organizations and some members of the U.S. Congress in late 1994 and early 1995, UNHCR launched a series of four reviews of screening procedures and the impacts of corruption on the screening caseload in Indonesia. The reviews, conducted by UNHCR attorneys and senior program personnel from outside Indonesia, examined a total of 486 nonrandomly selected cases, representing about 10 percent of the remaining camp population. The selected cases included high-visibility cases, such as the 22 cases screened positive by UNHCR but negative by Indonesian officials, all the cases examined by UNHCR\u2019s two Indonesian legal consultants who had corruption allegations lodged against them, and 21 cases previously referred from the U.S. Department of State and nongovernmental organizations. The reviews also included both positive and negative cases on which UNHCR consultants and Indonesian officials had reached the same decisions.", "The reviews upheld the screening decisions in 481 of the 486 cases reviewed. The remaining five cases were given refugee status under UNHCR\u2019s mandate authority, although this status had not yet been recognized by the Indonesian government or communicated to the asylum seekers at the time of our field work in January 1996. The reviews concluded that, overall, Indonesia\u2019s screening procedures properly identified and screened in cases with serious protection concerns, but that a small number of borderline cases could possibly have benefited from more sympathetic application of the screening criteria. The reviews found that corruption was a factor that impinged on screening procedures, but was rarely, if ever, substantiated in the case files, and that the chief effect was to inflate the number of positive decisions by also screening in weak cases. The reviews did not support the assertion that strong cases failed because they could not pay corruption demands.", "The reviews also concluded that UNHCR did not take adequate steps to detect or prevent corruption in the screening process, allowing corruption to undermine the integrity of the process. They also indicated that UNHCR took no actions with regard to the two Indonesian legal consultants alleged to have been involved in corruption.", "In a limited test of Indonesia\u2019s processing procedures and screening decisions, we examined a sample of 10 cases. All were cases alleged by Boat People S.O.S. to have been improperly screened out and included seven cases where the individuals were allegedly screened out because they could not pay bribes demanded of them. Our review of UNHCR case files in the branch office near Galang (the files did not contain P3V or appeals data) indicated that in five of the seven cases allegedly screened out due to the applicants\u2019 inability to pay bribes, the decisions reached appeared to be reasonable and consistent with screening criteria. In two of the cases, however, the applicants appeared to have reasonable claims and the screening decisions appeared to be incorrect. Both cases had been examined by UNHCR as part of its 1995 review, however, and both were among the five cases mandated during the review.", "Of the three remaining cases, one appeared to have a reasonable claim for refugee status but was screened out at first instance. However, he fled Galang for Australia before his case was appealed. UNHCR officials told us that had he been screened out on appeal, he probably would have received UNHCR mandated refugee status. The second case appeared to be reasonably adjudicated. In the third case, we raised questions that resulted in UNHCR\u2019s mandating the individual. In this case, Indonesian authorities screened the individual out at both first instance screening and upon appeal. UNHCR representatives had recommended that the individual be screened in at first instance, but UNHCR concurred in the appeal decision. UNHCR also rejected the individual at mandate review, on the bases that elements of the individual\u2019s claims did not constitute persecution and additional important representations presented at appeal lacked credibility. UNHCR reconsidered and mandated the case after we raised questions about whether elements of the individual\u2019s and his family\u2019s treatment after 1975, taken together, could afford the individual the benefit of a doubt\u2014even without considering the information provided at appeal."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of State Failed to Monitor Screening Processes", "paragraphs": ["As a participating country and a major contributor to the CPA, the United States has a strong interest in the CPA\u2019s effective implementation.

Our review indicated that while State Department\u2019s Washington and embassy officials were familiar with the CPA program and had in-depth knowledge of asylum seekers\u2019 care and maintenance and resettlement issues, they possessed only cursory knowledge of the first-asylum countries\u2019 screening processes and weaknesses in them. It was not until advocacy groups began petitioning State and UNHCR in mid-1994 (after the screening process had essentially concluded) to look into charges of corruption that the scope of the alleged corruption became known. It appears that until that time, State relied on UNHCR reporting to determine how the screening process was being implemented and confined its oversight and management to care and maintenance and resettlement issues.

In his letter, the Secretary General noted that the CPA\u2019s success depended upon a balanced implementation of all its aspects, including that of the return and reintegration of persons determined not to be refugees, and that humanitarian consideration argued strongly for the United Nation\u2019s continued involvement in the matter.", "As of February 1996, UNHCR employed seven international staff as monitoring officers (four based in Hanoi and three in Ho Chi Minh City) and a contingent of national administrative and support staff to implement its monitoring program. All of the monitoring officers were fluent in Vietnamese\u2014several were also fluent in regional dialects. Five of the monitoring officers had worked in first-asylum country programs prior to taking positions as monitors in Vietnam. None of the monitoring officers needed or used interpreters in their work.", "The UNHCR monitoring system is built around and keyed to priority cases, returnees of special significance or concern or those who specifically request monitoring upon their return. UNHCR offices in the first-asylum countries are to notify the Hanoi office of pending returnees, both priority and routine cases. This information is to be placed in returnee databases in UNHCR\u2019s Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City offices.", "Returnees, who usually arrived by air in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, were to be met by UNHCR officers and first-asylum country embassy representatives, in addition to Vietnamese authorities. If the flights comprised involuntary returnees from Hong Kong, they were also to be met by British Embassy officials, as Hong Kong\u2019s involuntary return program, called the Orderly Return Program, was being carried out under a bilateral agreement between the British and Hong Kong governments and Vietnam. British Embassy monitoring officers were to independently monitor Hong Kong\u2019s involuntary returnees, including priority cases. British and UNHCR officers viewed their dual monitoring of these cases as positive reinforcement of each other\u2019s efforts. The British viewed their monitoring effort as necessary to be consistent with their orderly return Memorandum of Understanding with the Vietnam government, notwithstanding UNHCR\u2019s monitoring program.", "Returnees were to be transferred from the airports to reception centers, where they were to undergo registration and reintegration processing by government agencies and foreign nongovernmental organizations, such as Nordic Assistance to Returning Vietnamese. They were also to be visited by UNHCR monitors, who were to answer any questions, pass out business cards with addresses and telephone numbers where they could be reached, and take names and addresses of individuals who requested priority monitoring.", "From the returnee databases, UNHCR planned monitoring missions\u2014field trips designed to visit specific priority cases. These cases were supplemented with names of routine returnees in the area. The monitors notified the government authorities of their monitoring mission destinations (by province, district, and village) and in the south provided lists of all returnees in the provinces to be visited.", "According to UNHCR monitoring officials this approach had several advantages. It ensured government authorities of UNHCR\u2019s openness, while securing the assistance of local officials as guides in finding individual returnees; ensured systematic planning so that all priority cases would be visited; was more efficient than random visits; and did not specify individual priority cases to be visited.", "This approach also enabled UNHCR to visit with local government officials and help ensure that local officials were adhering to government commitments not to persecute returnees.", "Monitoring missions, which normally consisted of two monitoring officers in the south and one in the north, were designed to contact 100 to 150 returnees per mission. Monitoring officers had conducted 363 monitoring missions as of our visit in February 1996. As they traveled, the monitors stopped at villages to ask village leaders and local citizens how local returnees were faring as a whole. They also visited outlying areas to ask similar questions. The monitors then visited individual returnees. UNHCR monitors told us that through these practices they gained a good knowledge about a much larger proportion of returnees than the numbers visited would indicate.", "If the officers sensed a returnee was reluctant to speak candidly they employed the technique of either occupying government officials with one officer while the other took the individual aside, or simply taking the returnee aside, to discuss the situation. According to UNHCR officials, as well as our observations while interviewing returnees in Dong Nai province, government officials normally did not attend the interviews but rather waited in places such as coffee shops until the monitoring visits were completed. Monitors, as well as others with extensive experience in Vietnamese culture told us, however, that Vietnamese speak their minds freely and would not be reticent to voice their concerns of treatment in front of government officials.", "The government\u2019s attitude and attention toward monitoring has evolved over time; returnee monitoring initially drew considerable government attention, according to UNHCR monitoring officers. They said their monitoring missions drew entourages of 10 to 12 persons, including officials from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs; but, over time the government\u2019s attitude grew more relaxed. Over the last several years UNHCR monitoring officers were usually accompanied only by an official from the Labor and Social Welfare Department under the provincial Peoples\u2019 Committee and the Labor Ministry. These departments are UNHCR\u2019s counterparts and hosts in the provinces. They organize and administer the distribution of UNHCR\u2019s individual cash grants and support the planning and implementation of UNHCR\u2019s micro-projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees letter dated September 9, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
