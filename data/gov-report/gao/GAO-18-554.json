This figure is consistent with the percentage of all federal contract obligations to these businesses over this period. Overall, advertising contract obligations to all three categories of businesses increased between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, as shown in the figure below. Within the minority-owned business category, which includes businesses owned by Asian-Pacific-, Subcontinent-Asian-, Black-, Hispanic-, and Native-Americans, over half of the obligations went to those owned by Hispanic-Americans.", "Three agencies\u2014the departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security\u2014were responsible for nearly three-quarters of advertising contract obligations to the three categories of businesses from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. These agencies were associated with much of the increase in these obligations to specified businesses over the 5-year period. Although some agencies obligated higher shares of their advertising contract obligations to these businesses, they generally obligated fewer dollars than DOD and the two other agencies. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration directed 98 percent of its obligations to these businesses, but the agency's total advertising contract obligations were $21 million over the 5-year period. DOD obligated $2.6 billion for these contracts over the same period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, federal spending on advertising contracts has  approached $1 billion annually, making the federal government one of the  top advertisers in the country. Federal agencies contract with advertising  agencies, public relations firms, and other organizations to provide,  among other things, information to the public about programs and  services. As it does for virtually all of the products and services it  procures, the government seeks to provide procurement opportunities to  socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses as well as  minority- and women-owned businesses. For example, the Small  Business Act, as amended, requires federal agencies to, among other  things, establish annual goals for contracting with small businesses  owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals.", "Given the federal government\u2019s advertising spending and its emphasis on  contracting with certain business types, you requested that we report on  federal advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses and women- owned businesses, regardless of size, and small disadvantaged  businesses (SDB)\u2014which are those that self-identify as an SDB, those  that have been certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) as participants in the agency\u2019s 8(a) businesses development program, or  both. We determined (1) the amount federal agencies have obligated on  advertising contracts over the most recent five fiscal years (2013 through  2017) and the amount going to these business categories; and (2) the  agencies that have directed the most advertising contract obligations to  these business categories and how this has changed over time.", "To address both objectives, we analyzed data from the Federal  Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation (FPDS-NG) database for  fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The FPDS-NG database includes data  for most federal contract actions that have an estimated value of over  $3,500.

Businesses may self-identify in the government\u2019s System for Award  Management as an SDB, minority-owned, or women-owned, among other  categories. For purposes of this report, we refer to the three categories  of businesses we examined as \u201cspecified businesses.\u201d In addition to  analyzing FPDS-NG data, we interviewed SBA officials, who are  responsible for assessing government-wide and agency contracting with  small and other business categories, about their perspectives on trends in  federal contracting.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data through steps such as  considering known strengths and weaknesses based on our past work  and looking for obvious errors and inconsistencies in the data we used for  our analysis. We also interviewed SBA officials, who use FPDS-NG data  in assessing federal contracting, about the database\u2019s reliability.

One key statute is the  Small Business Act, which established SBA and directed it to aid,  counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small business concerns,  among other things. The Small Business Act, as amended over the  years, as well as executive orders, emphasize the government\u2019s policies  on contracting with SDBs and businesses owned by women and  minorities.", "The Small Business Act sets a minimum government-wide goal for small  business participation of not less than 23 percent of the total value of all  prime contracts for each fiscal year and makes SBA responsible for  reporting annually to the President and Congress on agencies\u2019 progress  in meeting this goal, and making this information available on a public  website. SBA reported that the federal government reached this goal for  the fifth consecutive year in fiscal year 2017, awarding about 24 percent  of total federal contract dollars to small businesses. SBA also negotiates  specific goals with agencies to ensure the government-wide goal is met.", "Each agency\u2019s progress toward meeting its goals is generally based on  the percentage of obligations on contracts with small businesses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Categories of Specified Businesses", "paragraphs": ["The three categories of businesses we examined for this report are small  disadvantaged, minority-owned, and women-owned.", "Small disadvantaged business. Because SBA\u2019s 8(a) business  development program and SDB criteria are similar, in this report we use  the term \u201csmall disadvantaged business\u201d or \u201cSDB\u201d to refer to both  categories of businesses. Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act  established the 8(a) business development program, which authorizes the  SBA to enter into contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts  for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation.  To be certified under the 8(a) program, a business must, in general,  satisfy requirements for size, be at least 51 percent unconditionally  owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically  disadvantaged individuals who are U.S. citizens, and demonstrate  potential for success. Similar to the 8(a) program, SDBs are defined as  those that are primarily owned and controlled by one or more socially and  economically disadvantaged individuals, though there are some  differences in criteria for the 8(a) program and SDB classification. For  example, businesses in the 8(a) program must demonstrate the potential  for success and business principals must demonstrate good character,  but the requirements to demonstrate these do not apply to SDB  classification. A business\u2019s self-identification as SDB in the federal  government\u2019s System for Award Management does not automatically lead  to acceptance into SBA\u2019s 8(a) business development program.", "Minority-owned business. Businesses of all sizes that are at least 51  percent owned by one or more members of a minority group may self- identify as minority-owned businesses in the federal government\u2019s  System for Award Management. Minority-owned businesses are further  broken down into businesses owned by Asian-Pacific-, Subcontinent- Asian-, Black-, Hispanic-, Native-Americans, and other.", "Women-owned business. Businesses of all sizes that are at least 51  percent owned by one or more women and whose management and daily  business operations are controlled by one or more women may self- identify as a women-owned business in the System for Award  Management.", "These three categories of specified businesses overlap. For example, an  SDB may be women-owned and therefore be counted in FPDS-NG as  both an SDB and a women-owned business. To avoid double-counting  when presenting consolidated data, we counted obligations and  businesses classified under more than one category only once."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Advertising Activities", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, there are several types of activities that  are supported by federal advertising contracts.

This share of  advertising contract obligations going to these businesses over fiscal  years 2013 through 2017 was consistent with the share of total federal  contracting obligations going to these businesses (also on average 13  percent over this period).", "Advertising contract obligations to specified businesses and the number  of these businesses receiving advertising contract obligations have both  generally increased over fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The amount of  advertising contract obligations going to these businesses nearly doubled  from fiscal year 2013 to 2017 (from $75 million to $147 million) and also  increased as a percent of total advertising contract obligations (from 9  percent of these obligations to 16 percent). Specified businesses also  represented an increasing share of businesses receiving advertising  contract obligations, from 30 percent (194 businesses) in fiscal year 2013  to 39 percent (250 businesses) in fiscal year 2017. Figure 1 shows  advertising contract obligations to specified businesses and the number  of these businesses receiving these obligations over fiscal years 2013  through 2017.", "In the 5 years from fiscal year 2013 through 2017, a relatively small  number of specified businesses received a relatively large amount of  federal advertising contract obligations. For example, the top five  businesses received about 40 percent of annual advertising contract  obligations to specified businesses over the 5-year period. Consistent  with findings from our previous work, obligations were also concentrated  among a relatively small number of contracts.

(The amount going to women- owned businesses declined between fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and the  amounts going to minority-owned businesses and SDBs declined  between fiscal years 2016 and 2017.) The most notable increase over the  5-year timeframe, both in dollars and percentage terms, was in the  women-owned category, which increased by $56 million, or 93 percent.  Figure 3 shows the amounts obligated to each specified business  category, and to the three categories combined. Table 2 in appendix II  shows the amounts obligated to each specified business category, in  dollars and as a percentage of federal advertising contract obligations, in  each of the 5 years.", "SBA officials we interviewed told us that a program they started in 2011,  the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program, may  have accounted for some of the increase in contracting rates with women- owned businesses over the past 5 years. This is because the program  aims to help women-owned small businesses have an equal opportunity  to participate in federal contracting and to assist agencies in achieving  their goals for contracting with women-owned small businesses. The  program generally allows women-owned small businesses to compete for  set-aside contracts or receive sole source awards in industries where  these businesses are underrepresented or substantially  underrepresented.", "Changes in advertising contract obligations to specified businesses were  in some cases associated with a small number of contracts. For example,  the $29 million increase in advertising contract obligations to women- owned businesses between fiscal years 2016 and 2017 was due in large  part to two contracts with an advertising agency with combined  obligations of about $22 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition, two  contracts that had each been classified under both the SDB and minority- owned categories contributed to the decrease in these two categories  between fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Obligations to these two contracts  declined by about $16 million over this period, a substantial portion of the  overall declines in these two categories. (Obligations to SDBs declined by  about $23 million; those to minority-owned businesses declined by about  $21 million.) Although obligations to the SDB and minority-owned  categories decreased from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, the numbers of these  businesses receiving advertising contract obligations both increased. The  number of SDBs receiving these obligations went from 123 to 134; the  number of minority-owned businesses went from 95 to 98.", "Federal agencies are also required to set-aside procurements exclusively  for small businesses or businesses in the 8(a) program under certain  circumstances, and specific authorities exist to allow award of a contract  on a sole source basis to a business in the 8(a) program. However, these  authorities were in place prior to fiscal year 2013 and therefore, according  to SBA officials, it is unlikely they would have caused a change in  contracting activity over the past 5 years.", "As mentioned above, businesses may be classified as more than one  category, and thus there is overlap in obligations and contracts among  specified business categories. For example, about one-quarter ($147  million) of the $570 million in advertising contract obligations directed to  specified businesses over the 5-year period went to businesses classified  under all three categories.
