The FIAR Guidance requires DOD  components to identify and prioritize their business processes into  assessable units, and then prepare a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP)  for each assessable unit in accordance with the FIAR Guidance.

For example, it took 3 months and repeated  attempts before DFAS-IN could provide a population of service members  who received active duty Army military pay in fiscal year 2010.

The DOD IG further stated that as a result, the Navy ERP System, which is expected to manage 54  percent of the Navy\u2019s obligation authority when fully deployed, might not  produce accurate and reliable financial information.", "DOD Inspector General, Navy Enterprise Resource Planning System Does Not Comply  With the Standard Financial Information Structure and U.S. Government Standard  General Ledger, DODIG-2012-051 (Arlington, Va.: Feb. 13, 2012).", "Two ERP systems\u2014the Army\u2019s General Fund Enterprise Business  System (GFEBS) and the Air Force\u2019s Defense Enterprise Accounting and  Management System (DEAMS)\u2014are general ledger systems intended to  support a wide range of financial management and accounting functions.  However, DFAS users of these systems told us that they were having  difficulties using the systems to perform their daily operations. Problems  identified by DFAS users included interoperability deficiencies between  legacy systems and the new ERP systems, lack of query and ad hoc  reporting capabilities, and reduced visibility for tracing transactions to  resolve accounting differences. For example:", "Approximately two-thirds of invoice and receipt data must be manually  entered into GFEBS from the invoicing and receiving system due to  interface problems. Army officials explained that the primary cause of  the problem was that the interface specification that GFEBS is  required by DOD to use did not provide the same level of functionality  as the interface specification used by the legacy systems. At the time  of our review, Army officials stated that they are working with DOD to  resolve the problem, but no time frame for resolution had been  established.", "DEAMS did not provide the capability\u2014which existed in the legacy  systems\u2014to produce ad hoc query reports that could be used to  perform data analysis needed for day-to-day operations. DFAS  officials noted that when DEAMS did produce requested reports, the  accuracy of those reports was questionable. According to DFAS  officials, they are currently working with DEAMS financial  management to design the type of reports that DFAS needs.", "While we were told that as of February 2012, the Army and the Air Force  had corrective actions under way to address identified deficiencies,  specific timelines had not been developed so that progress could be  monitored.", "In February 2012, we reported that independent assessments of four  ERPs\u2014the Army\u2019s GFEBS and Global Combat Support System (GCSS- Army), and the Air Force\u2019s DEAMS and Expeditionary Combat Support  System (ECSS)\u2014identified operational problems, such as deficiencies in  data accuracy, inability to generate auditable financial reports, the need  for manual workarounds, and training. DOD oversight authority limited  the deployment of GFEBS and DEAMS on the basis of the results of the  independent assessments. However, in June 2011, DOD authorized  continued deployment of GFEBS and delegated further GFEBS  deployment decisions to the Under Secretary of the Army.", "In addition to functional issues, we found that training was inadequate.  According to DFAS personnel as of February 2012, the training they  received for GFEBS and DEAMS did not fully meet their needs. DFAS  personnel informed us that the training focused on an overview of GFEBS  and DEAMS and how the systems were supposed to operate. While this  was beneficial in identifying how GFEBS and DEAMS were different from  the existing legacy systems, the training focused too much on concepts  rather than the skills needed for DFAS users to perform their day-to-day  operations.

In addition, while DOD largely  followed its certification and oversight processes, we reported that key  steps were not performed.
