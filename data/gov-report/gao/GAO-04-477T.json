Proper accounting and reporting practices are essential in the public sector. The U.S. government is the largest, most diverse, most complex, and arguably the most important entity on earth today. Its services--homeland security, national defense, Social Security, mail delivery, and food inspection, to name a few--directly affect the well-being of almost every American. But sound decisions on the future direction of vital federal government programs and policies are made more difficult without timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance information. Until the problems discussed in GAO's audit report on the U.S. government's consolidated financial statements are adequately addressed, they will continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to accurately report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, and costs; (2) affect the federal government's ability to accurately measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs while effectively managing related operations; and (3) significantly impair the federal government's ability to adequately safeguard certain significant assets and properly record various transactions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As in the 6 previous fiscal years, certain material weaknesses in internal control and in selected accounting and reporting practices resulted in conditions that continued to prevent GAO from being able to provide the Congress and American citizens an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government are fairly stated in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Three major impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements continue to be (1) serious financial management problems at DOD, (2) the federal government's inability to fully account for and reconcile transactions between federal government entities, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal year 2003, 20 of 23 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies received unqualified opinions, the same number received by these agencies for fiscal year 2002, up from 6 for fiscal year 1996. However, only 3 of the CFO Act agencies had neither a material weakness in internal control, an issue involving compliance with applicable laws and regulations, nor an instance of lack of substantial compliance with Federal Financial Management Improvement Act requirements. The requirement for timely, accurate, and useful financial and performance management information is greater than ever as the nation faces major long-term fiscal challenges that will require tough choices in setting priorities and linking resources to results. Given the nation's large and growing long-term fiscal imbalance, which is driven largely by known demographic trends and health care costs, coupled with new homeland security and defense commitments, the status quo is unsustainable. Current financial reporting does not clearly and transparently show the wide range of responsibilities, programs, and activities that may either obligate the federal government to future spending or create an expectation for such spending and provides an unrealistic and even misleading picture of the federal government's overall performance and financial condition. In addition, too many significant federal government commitments and obligations, such as Social Security and Medicare, are not fully and consistently disclosed in the federal government's financial statements and budget, and current federal financial reporting standards do not require such disclosure. A top-to-bottom review of government activities to ensure their relevance and fit for the 21st century and their relative priority is long overdue. The federal government needs a three-pronged approach to (1) restructure existing entitlement programs, (2) reexamine the base of discretionary and other spending, and (3) review and revise the federal government's tax policy and enforcement programs. New accounting and reporting approaches, budget control mechanisms, and metrics are needed for considering and measuring the impact of spending and tax policies and decisions over the long term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2003 and  2002.

Across government, financial  management improvement initiatives are under way that, if effectively  implemented, have the potential to appreciably improve the quality of the  federal government\u2019s financial management and reporting. Federal  agencies continue to make progress in their efforts to modernize their  financial management systems and improve financial management  performance as called for in the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "The Principals of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program  (JFMIP) agreed with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  initiative to accelerate the agency financial statements reporting date to  November 15 for fiscal year 2004. For fiscal year 2003, OMB required the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies to deliver their Performance  and Accountability Reports, including their audited financial statements,  to OMB by January 30, 2004. However, to prepare for meeting the required  November 15 accelerated reporting date for fiscal year 2004, OMB  encouraged the CFO Act agencies to accelerate the issuance of their fiscal  year 2003 audited financial statements to November 15, 2003, or as close to  that date as possible. OMB reported that 8 CFO Act agencies\u2014the  Department of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency, the  Department of Health and Human Services, the National Science  Foundation, the Social Security Administration, the Department of the  Treasury, the Agency for International Development, and the Department  of Veterans Affairs\u2014were able to issue their fiscal year 2003 financial  statements with unqualified audit opinions by mid-November 2003.  Another 10 CFO Act agencies issued their financial statements by  December 31, 2003, and the remaining 5 CFO Act agencies issued by the  end of January 2004. A 24th major agency, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), issued its financial statements on February 13, 2004. DHS  faced a herculean challenge with respect to issuing audited financial  statements, since the department had been in operation only for the last 7  months of the fiscal year and involved a transfer of operations from a  number of diverse entities, some with known financial management  problems.", "While these results represent a significant improvement over previous  years in the timeliness of CFO Act agencies\u2019 issuance of audited financial  statements, they also demonstrate the significant challenges that the  federal government will face in meeting the November 15 accelerated  reporting date for fiscal year 2004. Auditors at several of the CFO Act  agencies reported that the agencies may not be able to produce auditable  financial statements within the accelerated time frame for fiscal year 2004  without making fundamental changes to improve a number of their  financial management practices. For example, certain federal agency  auditors reported that major improvements are needed in (1) management  controls to monitor established policies and procedures for conducting  financial analyses and reconciliations throughout the year, (2) fully  integrating financial management systems, and (3) providing adequate and  skilled staff to support efficient, effective preparation of federal agency  consolidated financial statements. Our experience as the auditor of the  financial statements of the Internal Revenue Service, which successfully  accelerated its reporting to November 15 beginning with its fiscal year  2002 financial statements, showed that significant changes had to be made  to improve routine financial management procedures in order to be able to  accelerate reporting.", "For fiscal year 2003, as in fiscal year 2002, 20 of 23 CFO Act agencies were  able to attain unqualified audit opinions on their financial statements (see  app. I), up from 6 agencies for fiscal year 1996. This is the same number of  unqualified opinions received by these CFO Act agencies for fiscal year  2002. However, 2 agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 opinions were different from  those they received for fiscal year 2002. The Agency for International  Development received an unqualified opinion on all of its fiscal year 2003  financial statements for the first time, while the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, which for fiscal year 2002 received an unqualified  opinion on its financial statements, received a disclaimer of opinion for  fiscal year 2003. DHS, which as I mentioned before prepared consolidated  financial statements for fiscal year 2003 covering its first 7 months of  operations, received a qualified opinion on two of the six required  financial statements.", "In identifying improved financial performance as one of its five  governmentwide initiatives, the President\u2019s Management Agenda  recognized that a clean (unqualified) financial audit opinion is a basic  prescription for any well-managed organization. At the same time, it  recognized that \u201cmost federal agencies that obtain clean audits only do so  after making extraordinary, labor-intensive assaults on financial records\u201d  at or after year-end. The President\u2019s Management Agenda further  recognized that without sound internal control and accurate and timely  financial information, it is not possible to accomplish the agenda and  secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for the  American people. The JFMIP Principals have defined certain measures, in  addition to receiving an unqualified financial statement opinion, for  achieving financial management success. These additional measures  include being able to routinely provide timely, accurate, and useful  financial and performance information and having no material internal  control weaknesses or material noncompliance with laws and regulations  and the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement  Act of 1996 (FFMIA). As shown in figure 1, while the severity and  magnitude of the problems identified vary greatly, reports of inspectors  general and their contract auditors indicated that for fiscal year 2003 only  3 of the 23 CFO Act agencies had neither a material weakness in internal  control, an issue involving compliance with applicable laws and  regulations, nor an instance of lack of substantial compliance with the  requirements of FFMIA.", "In this testimony, I will highlight the major issues relating to the  consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, discuss  systems problems that continue to hinder federal agency accountability,  and describe progress that has been made toward addressing major  impediments to an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

While the problems are much more severe at some agencies than at others,  their nature and severity indicate that overall, management at most CFO  Act agencies lacks the full range of information needed for accountability,  performance reporting, and decision making. These problems include  nonintegrated financial systems, lack of accurate and timely recording of  data, inadequate reconciliation procedures, and noncompliance with  accounting standards and the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger  (SGL).", "Agencies\u2019 inability to meet the federal financial management systems  requirements continues to be the major barrier to achieving compliance  with FFMIA.

The auditors for these 6 agencies did not definitively state  whether the agencies\u2019 systems substantially complied with FFMIA  requirements, as is required under the statute. DHS is not subject to the  requirements of the CFO Act and, consequently, is not required to comply  with FFMIA. Accordingly, DHS\u2019s auditors did not report on DHS\u2019s  compliance with FFMIA.

To date, none  of the military services or major DOD components has passed the test of  an independent financial audit because of pervasive weaknesses in  financial management systems, operations, and controls. DOD has been up  front about the seriousness of these problems and the need to transform  the way it does business. To address these problems, DOD has taken  several positive steps in many key areas. For example, the Secretary of  Defense has included improving DOD\u2019s financial management as one of his  top 10 priorities, and the department has taken a number of actions under  its Business Management Modernization Program, including development  in April 2003 of an initial business enterprise architecture to guide  operational and technological changes. DOD is currently working to  refine and implement that architecture and expects to issue new versions  of it during 2004. DOD reports that it is also developing detailed financial  improvement plans intended to provide disciplined leadership, identify  corrective actions, implement solutions, and result in a favorable audit  opinion on the fiscal year 2007 DOD-wide financial statements.
