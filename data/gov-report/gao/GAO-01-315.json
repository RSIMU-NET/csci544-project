Peru is the second largest source of imported asparagus and benefits from duty-free treatment under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). ATPA is estimated to have displaced between two and eight percent of the value of domestic production from what it would have been without the act. Although the supply of fresh asparagus from imports has increased since ATPA's enactment, consumer demand has been strong, and prices have risen. In addition, an apparent increase in consumer preference for fresh asparagus has contributed to a downward shift in the domestic demand for processed asparagus. Most of the decline in the domestic production of processed asparagus occurred in Michigan and Washington, the two states that produce most canned and frozen asparagus. If ATPA is reauthorized, domestic producers of asparagus and, in particular, asparagus for processing, will likely face continued displacement, but consumers can expect continued benefits from the year-round availability of fresh asparagus. However, some of this displacement will likely occur even if ATPA is not reauthorized and the normal tariff is imposed. If ATPA is not reauthorized, consumers would likely have decreased availability and pay higher prices to the extent that tariff increases reduce Peruvian asparagus imports and hence total asparagus supplies. Domestic industries can petition the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate whether increased imports under the ATPA have caused them serious injury or threat of serious injury. If the Commission finds serious injury, it may recommend relief options to the President, including suspending duty-free treatment for imports."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. asparagus imports increased by over 215 percent in the 1990s and now comprise nearly one-half of the asparagus consumed in the United States. Peru is the second largest source of imported asparagus and benefits from duty-free treatment under the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) of 1991, as amended.  Asparagus imported from Peru accounted for 34 percent of U.S. imports in 1999. ATPA was designed to promote the production of non-drug-related crops and to increase the economic development of four South American countries involved in the drug trade, including Peru.  During the 1990s, Peru substantially increased its production of asparagus and became a major exporter of frozen asparagus, complementing its already strong position in the canned market. Imports of Peruvian asparagus have made fresh asparagus available in the United States from August through December\u2014months that domestic fresh asparagus had generally been unavailable.", "ATPA expires in December 2001, and legislation to extend the act is likely to be proposed in 2001. While imports of fresh and frozen asparagus and domestic production of fresh asparagus have increased, the production of domestic processed (canned and frozen) asparagus has declined. For example, the value of U.S. fresh asparagus production increased from $117 million in 1990 to $172 million in 2000. However, the value of processed asparagus declined from $60 million to $44 million during this period. Industry representatives attribute this decline to increasing Peruvian imports.", "In this context, the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, asked us to (1) review the impact that asparagus imported from Peru under ATPA has had on domestic asparagus producers and consumers, (2) review ATPA\u2019s likely impact on domestic asparagus producers and consumers if the act is reauthorized in December 2001, and (3) describe the remedies available to domestic industries adversely affected by imports under ATPA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Asparagus is a perennial crop that has a relatively long life expectancy of up to 20 years in commercial plantings. Since the crop is not usually harvested for the first 3 years, asparagus production represents a significant long-term investment for growers. In addition, since the time from planting to the first harvest takes 3 years, producers cannot quickly increase production in response to market demand. While asparagus is a native of temperate regions, its cultivation is most successful in locations where either extreme temperature or drought stops the growth of the plant, providing it with a rest period. Asparagus is produced and sold either as fresh, uncooked whole spears or processed (heat-treated canned or frozen) whole spears or cut pieces.", "Asparagus is a labor-intensive, high-value vegetable crop. For example, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 2000, the season-average shipping-point price for fresh asparagus was $1.14 per pound.  In comparison, the price for the second and third highest value vegetables\u2014artichokes and fresh market snap beans\u2014was $0.64 and $0.42 per pound, respectively.", "In 2000, the United States produced 227 million pounds of asparagus having a value of about $217 million.  The majority of the asparagus produced was green asparagus for the fresh market\u201466 percent was fresh, while 34 percent was processed (about 28 percent was for canning and 6 percent for freezing). Figure 1 shows the annual quantity of domestic production from 1990 to 2000.", "As shown in figure 1, the production of fresh asparagus in the United States trended downward until 1995, when it reached a low in part due to poor weather in California. Since then, production has been increasing. In contrast, the production of asparagus for processing has been steadily declining.", "The major commercial asparagus-producing states are California, Washington, and Michigan. California, the most important state for fresh production, has a harvest season from January through May. While Washington and Michigan produce some asparagus for the fresh market, the majority of their production is for the processed market. Production from Michigan occurs from May through June and Washington from May through July. In recent years, Washington has begun shifting some production from asparagus for processing to fresh asparagus, although doing so is costly for producers.  Thus, when the three states are considered, domestically produced fresh asparagus is available from January through July. At other times of the year, only canned and frozen production is available from domestic sources.", "In recent years, imports have accounted for a growing proportion of the U.S. fresh asparagus supply and, in 1999, represented 57 percent of fresh asparagus consumption. In 1999, over 90 percent of total U.S. asparagus imports were of fresh asparagus. The growth in imports has been made possible, in part, by the Andean Trade Preference Act and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).", "ATPA, which was signed into law in December 1991, eliminates or reduces U.S. tariffs on eligible products from four Andean countries\u2014Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.  ATPA\u2019s primary goal is to promote broad- based economic development in these Andean countries and to develop viable economic alternatives to coca cultivation and cocaine production by offering Andean products broader access to the U.S. market. The President proclaimed preferential duty treatment for Peru in 1993. These preferences are scheduled to end effective December 4, 2001.", "NAFTA, which was ratified by the Congress in 1993 and implemented in January 1994, created a free trade area between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA provides for the gradual elimination of tariffs\u2014from as high as 25 percent on fresh asparagus\u2014and other trade barriers on most goods, over a 10- to 15-year period.", "As shown in figure 2, asparagus imports were increasing prior to ATPA\u2019s and NAFTA\u2019s enactment and have continued to increase since that time. For example, imports grew from 44 million pounds in 1990 to 142 million pounds in 1999\u2014an average annual rate of increase of 14 percent, whereby Mexico and Peru provided most of the increase.", "According to information from the Peruvian Asparagus Institute,increases in asparagus production, assisted by the implementation of ATPA, have resulted in making asparagus Peru\u2019s second largest export crop, after coffee. Peru has also developed a modern frozen asparagus industry and has rapidly increased exports of this product to the United States and U.S. frozen export markets, such as Japan. Asparagus accounted for 14.1 percent of Peru\u2019s agricultural exports and resulted in employment for over 20,000 Peruvians in 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Asparagus Imports Under ATPA Have Displaced Some Domestic Production, but Consumers Have Benefited From Increased Availability", "paragraphs": ["According to the U.S. International Trade Commission\u2019s (ITC) 1999 study, ATPA has displaced an estimated 2 to 8 percent of the total value of domestic fresh asparagus production from what it would have been without the act.

According to ITC, asparagus and cut flowers are the two industries experiencing potentially significant displacement under ATPA.", "ITC measured the impact of tariff reductions under ATPA by comparing estimated market conditions under full tariff treatment versus actual market conditions under duty-free entry.  A decrease in the price of imported asparagus caused by tariff reductions results in the substitution of imported asparagus for domestically produced asparagus, but the displacement is not one for one because of various reasons, such as a retailer\u2019s preference for marketing domestically produced product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Consumers Benefited From Imports Under ATPA as Consumption Shifted to Fresh Asparagus", "paragraphs": ["Consumers have benefited from ATPA because fresh asparagus is now available during the months when it is generally unavailable from domestic producers. This increased availability, combined with consumers\u2019 preference for fresh asparagus, has contributed to a downward shift in the consumption of processed asparagus.", "Figure 3 shows that the U.S. primarily produces and ships fresh asparagus during January through July. In contrast, imports from Peru occur nearly year-round, including months when U.S. fresh production is unavailable. As the figure shows, the majority of imports from Peru occur from August through December, when there is virtually no U.S. fresh production. Only canned or frozen asparagus is available from domestic sources during this time.", "Fresh asparagus from Peru is available, in part, because the elimination of tariffs reduced the price of Peruvian asparagus in the United States. While imports from Peru have increased the supply of fresh asparagus in the United States, demand has been strong, as demonstrated by the increased per capita consumption of fresh asparagus.", "As figure 4 shows, in the mid-1980s, the per capita consumption of asparagus shifted from processed to fresh asparagus, demonstrating consumers\u2019 preference for the latter. This shift in consumer preference accelerated in the mid-1990s, as fresh asparagus became available on a year-round basis.", "The shift in the per capita consumption of asparagus is part of the general trend toward increased consumer preference for fresh vegetables. In addition, the consumption of asparagus, which is a high-value product, is particularly responsive to increases in personal income, according to econometric studies. In the latter half of the 1990s, real disposable personal income increased by an average annual rate of about 3 percent.", "The increase in fresh asparagus consumption has helped keep prices trending upward despite the increase in supply from imports. In contrast, shifts in preference and the declining consumption of processed asparagus have kept prices for processed asparagus relatively flat, as shown in figure 5.", "The decline in the consumption of processed asparagus particularly affects producers in Michigan and Washington, the two states that produce the majority of frozen and canned asparagus. For example, processed asparagus accounted for approximately 86 percent and 68 percent of the production of that crop in Michigan and Washington, respectively, in 2000. Our analysis shows that processed asparagus decreased from 42 percent of domestic production in 1990 to 34 percent in 2000.

This is because U.S. consumers prefer fresh asparagus, which domestic producers cannot supply in some months, and because of Peru\u2019s advantages in climate and labor costs. In addition, consumers would likely face decreased availability and pay higher prices than they would otherwise to the extent that the increase in tariff creates a reduction in imports from Peru and hence an overall reduction in asparagus supply. U.S. asparagus producers will also face increasing competition from Mexican imports under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Since consumers tend to prefer fresh rather than processed asparagus when it is available, this displacement will likely continue.", "Consumers can expect continued benefits from this year-round availability of fresh asparagus. Peruvian asparagus enters the United States when domestic production is low, resulting in an increased supply of fresh asparagus in the marketplace. This extended product availability is believed to be partly responsible for increases in the consumption of fresh asparagus and declines in the consumption of processed asparagus. As shown in figure 6, the consumption of fresh asparagus reached 250 million pounds in 1999\u2014representing a 103-million-pound, or 70-percent, increase since 1990.

This is because U.S. consumers have expressed a preference for fresh rather than processed asparagus when it is available in the marketplace.

Peru also enjoys relatively lower labor costs for this labor- intensive crop.", "These advantages have allowed Peru to become the world\u2019s second largest producer of asparagus over the past decade and have given Peru the potential for increasing exports in the future.  In addition, Peruvian growers began a marketing promotion program in 2000 to stimulate U.S. consumers\u2019 purchases of fresh asparagus.", "Without ATPA, consumers would likely have decreased year-round availability of fresh asparagus and pay higher prices to the extent that the increase in tariff creates a reduction in imports from Peru.

Upon receiving a petition, ITC conducts an investigation to substantiate the allegation.  ITC\u2019s investigation is designed to determine whether a product is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry. In making its determination, the Commission must consider all relevant economic factors, including whether (1) productive facilities in the industry have been significantly idled, (2) a significant number of firms have been unable to operate at a reasonable level of profit, and (3) significant unemployment or underemployment has occurred within the industry. ITC also considers, among other things, whether there is a decline in sales or market share; a higher and growing inventory of the product; and a downward trend in production, profits, wages, productivity, or employment in the industry. In addition, the Commission must consider imports from all sources. There is no requirement that the increases in imports or serious injury to a domestic industry be attributable to an unfair trade practice.", "If ITC makes an affirmative injury determination, it is required to recommend to the President an action that would be most effective in addressing the injury. Recommended actions may include increased tariffs, quotas, trade adjustment assistance to workers (such as job training), or a combination of these measures.  As part of its recommendation, ITC must also state whether and to what extent its findings and recommendations apply to imports from ATPA countries. Following the receipt of ITC\u2019s recommendations, the President may take one of several actions. These include taking (1) the action recommended by ITC, (2) other action deemed appropriate, or (3) no action. However, the President cannot take action that is solely in the form of suspension of duty-free treatment for ATPA imports unless the Commission\u2019s investigation has found that the serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry resulted from the duty-free treatment. In any event, the President is required to report to the Congress what action, if any, he intends to make. If the President takes action that differs from ITC\u2019s recommendation or takes no action, the Congress may enact a joint resolution, which directs that he proclaim the action recommended by ITC.", "The trade act also authorizes ITC to make preliminary determinations and recommendations to the President for provisional relief in two situations. Under the first situation, an industry producing a perishable agricultural commodity that has already petitioned ITC and is undergoing a section 201 investigation, may file a request with the U.S. Trade Representative for the monitoring of imports. The U.S. Trade Representative may then request that ITC monitor imports. If an ITC monitoring investigation has been under way for at least 90 days, then the industry producing the domestic product may request, in a section 201 petition with respect to imports of the monitored product, that a remedy be applied on a provisional basis, pending completion of a full section 201 investigation and presidential review. ITC would have 21 days to make a recommendation concerning provisional relief, and the President would have 7 days to make a decision. Any provisional relief granted by the President upon ITC\u2019s recommendation would generally be in the form of increased tariffs.", "Under a second situation, an industry filing a section 201 petition may request provisional relief if it believes critical circumstances exist. Such circumstances exist when clear evidence shows that increased imports are a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of serious injury to the domestic industry and delay in taking action would cause damage that would be difficult to repair. ITC would have 60 days to make a critical circumstances determination and make a recommendation, and the President would have 30 days to decide what, if any, action to take. Such an action would generally be in the form of a tariff increase.", "In addition, ATPA specifically provides that an industry filing a section 201 petition with ITC can then also petition the Secretary of Agriculture for provisional relief. Under the ATPA special emergency relief provision, the Secretary of Agriculture and the President are authorized to make speedier determinations when an investigation of a perishable agricultural product under the trade act is ongoing. If the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s determination is affirmative, the President may temporarily withdraw the product\u2019s duty-free treatment or take no action. No preexisting monitoring investigation by ITC is required. The Secretary and President have a total of 21 days to make their final determination. The emergency action would be rescinded upon a negative determination of ITC\u2019s investigation, a presidential determination of changed circumstances, or the decision to take another relief action.", "To date, asparagus producers have not petitioned ITC for an investigation based on allegations of serious injury from imports under ATPA.
