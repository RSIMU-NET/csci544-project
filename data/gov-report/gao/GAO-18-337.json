In addition, although NASA\u2019s  Policy Directive 2810.1E, NASA Information Security Policy provided the  SAISO with responsibility for the agency\u2019s cybersecurity risk, the policy  assigned mission directorates control over risk decisions for their  missions and programs and the centers were given the authority to  implement any technical changes needed to address risk.", "NASA\u2019s Procedural Requirement 2810.1A, Security of Information  Technology states that the agency\u2019s SAISO is responsible for ensuring  that information security policies and procedures are reviewed and  appropriately updated. However, according to officials in the Office of the  CIO, including the specialist for IT security, responsibilities for  establishing, reviewing, and updating policies and procedures are being  shared by two groups: the IT Security Division, led by the SAISO, and the  Capital Planning and Governance Division. Specifically, the IT Security  Division controls the content of IT-related policies and procedures but  does not have control over the established NASA-wide process for  reviewing the policies and procedures to determine if any changes are  needed to the content. Instead, the Capital Planning and Governance  Division is responsible for ensuring formal review and approval of any IT- related policies and procedures through the standard agency process and  schedule.", "Officials from the Office of the CIO, including the specialist for IT security,  also stated that they intend to (1) establish a policy management  framework that would provide the SAISO with more control over policies  and procedures and include an annual document review, and (2) clarify  and update cybersecurity roles and responsibilities in NASA policies.  However, the agency has not yet developed a plan and specific time  frame for completing these activities.", "In addition, the Acting Deputy Associate CIO for Information Security  stated that, having expired policies and procedures is not significant  because they will remain in use until they are rescinded or superseded by  updated versions. However, until NASA fully updates its policies and  procedures to govern security over the agency\u2019s computing  environments, it will have limited assurance that controls over information  are appropriately applied to its systems."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NASA continues to pursue efforts to improve IT strategic planning,  workforce planning, IT governance, and cybersecurity, but consistently  lacks the documented processes needed to ensure that policies and  leading practices are fully addressed. Specifically, the agency has taken  steps to improve the content of its strategic plan and established an  agency-wide goal for improving its workforce. In addition, after analyzing  its IT management and governance structure, NASA took action to  streamline its governance boards and standardize and strengthen its  selection and oversight of investments, including initiating a portfolio  management process. NASA has also moved toward new strategies and  plans to bolster cybersecurity.", "Nevertheless, while NASA has made progress, the agency has not yet  fully addressed many of the leading IT management practices noted in  this report or completed efforts to increase the CIO\u2019s authority over, and  visibility into, agency-wide IT. Among other things, NASA has not fully  documented a process for IT strategic planning or addressed all key  elements of a comprehensive plan. In addition, it has not yet fully  implemented a workforce planning process and has gaps in efforts to  address leading practices. Regarding IT governance, its efforts to institute  an effective governance structure and update policies and procedures for  selecting IT investments are not yet complete. Moreover, NASA has not  yet addressed weaknesses in its oversight practices or fully defined  policies and procedures for developing an effective portfolio management  process.", "Similarly, although NASA continues cybersecurity improvement efforts,  important elements of an effective cybersecurity approach have not been  completed, including establishing a risk management strategy, an  information security program plan, and updated policies and procedures.  Until NASA leadership fully addresses these leading practices, its ability  to overcome its longstanding weaknesses and ensure effective oversight  and management of IT across the agency will remain limited. Moreover,  NASA may be limited in its ability to strengthen its risk posture, including  ensuring effective cybersecurity across partnerships with commercial  entities, federal agencies, and other countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making 10 recommendations to the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration:", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to  develop a fully documented IT strategic planning process, including  methods by which the agency defines its IT needs and develops  strategies, systems, and capabilities to meet those needs.  (Recommendation 1)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to update  the IT strategic plan for 2018 to 2021 and develop associated  implementation plans to ensure it fully describes strategies the agency  will use to achieve the desired results and descriptions of  interdependencies within and across programs. (Recommendation 2)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to  address, in conjunction with the Chief Human Capital Officer, gaps in  IT workforce planning by fully implementing the eight key IT workforce  planning activities noted in this report. (Recommendation 3)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to  institute an effective IT governance structure by completing planned  improvement efforts and finalizing charters to fully establish IT  governance boards, clearly defining roles and responsibilities for  selecting and overseeing IT investments, and ensuring that the  governance boards operate as intended. (Recommendation 4)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to update  policies and procedures for selecting investments to provide a  structured process, including thresholds and criteria needed for,  among other things, evaluating investment risks as part of governance  board decision making, and outline a process for reselecting  investments. (Recommendation 5)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to  address weaknesses in oversight practices and ensure routine  oversight of all investments by taking action to document criteria for  escalating investments among governance boards and establish  procedures for tracking corrective actions for underperforming  investments. (Recommendation 6)", "The Administrator should ensure that the Chief Information Officer  fully defines policies and procedures for developing the portfolio  criteria, creating the portfolio, and evaluating the portfolio.  (Recommendation 7)", "The Administrator should direct the Chief Information Officer to  establish an agency-wide approach to managing cybersecurity risk  that includes a cybersecurity strategy that, among other things, makes explicit  the agency\u2019s risk tolerance, accepted risk assessment  methodologies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across  the organization, response strategies and approaches for  monitoring risk over time, and priorities for risk management  investments; (Recommendation 8) an information security program plan that fully reflects the  agency\u2019s IT security functions and services and agency-wide  privacy controls for protecting information; (Recommendation 9)  and policies and procedures with well-defined roles and  responsibilities that are integrated and reflect NASA\u2019s current  security practices and operating environment.

In its  comments, which are reproduced in appendix II, NASA concurred with  seven of the recommendations, partially concurred with two  recommendations, and did not concur with one recommendation.", "NASA partially concurred with our first and second recommendations.  Specifically, consistent with the first recommendation, NASA agreed to  fully document its strategic planning process, including the methods by  which the agency defines IT needs and develops outcomes, strategies,  major actions, and performance measures to meet those needs.", "In addition, our second recommendation called for NASA to update the  strategic plan and develop associated implementation plans. With regard  to updating the plan, NASA stated that its strategic plan provides the  context and parameters to support achievement of the agency's vision  and mission through the strategic use of IT. The agency also stated that  this plan describes the business outcomes, strategies, major actions, and  performance measures to achieve the desired results.", "With regard to the implementation plans related to our first and second  recommendation, NASA agreed to develop the associated  implementation plans for accomplishing the IT strategic plan, including  descriptions of the interdependencies within and across programs.  Nevertheless, in commenting on both recommendations, as well as the  first recommendation, NASA stated that it does not believe that  implementation plans, including specific IT capability and system  changes, should be part of a strategic plan. The agency also maintained  that the implementation plans, including descriptions of  interdependencies within and across programs, are at a lower level than  the IT strategic plan, since detailed IT implementation plans are more  dynamic than the four-year NASA IT Strategic Plan.", "However, our first and second recommendations do not call for NASA to  incorporate implementation plans within the strategic plan. Rather, as  discussed in the report, it is important that NASA document how it intends  to accomplish the activities outlined in the strategic plan. Further, we  continue to believe that NASA should address the weaknesses we  identified in this report by updating the strategic plan to incorporate  strategies on resources and time frames to achieve desired results and  descriptions of interdependencies within and across projects so that they  can be understood and managed. Thus, we stand by both  recommendations (recommendations 1 and 2) that the agency take these  actions.", "NASA did not concur with our third recommendation to implement the IT  workforce planning activities noted in our report. In this regard, the  agency stated that its workforce improvement efforts were already  underway. Specifically, NASA stated that IT workforce planning is part of  the agencywide Mission Support Future Architecture Program. It added  that, among other things, this program is intended to ensure that mission  support resources, including the IT workforce, are optimally structured to  support NASA\u2019s mission. In addition, NASA referenced our two additional  ongoing audits of the agency\u2019s IT workforce, and noted that its activities  related to IT workforce planning would be centered on any  recommendations resulting from those audits.", "In our view, neither of these circumstances should hinder NASA from  addressing our recommendation in this report. As of March 2018, the  agency\u2019s IT workforce plans were out-of-date and incomplete because  activities the agency had been planning since 2015 had not been finalized  in an approved plan or implemented. Further, NASA had not yet  determined when the Office of the CIO would become an active part of  the agencywide Mission Support Future Architecture program or  developed plans for when that program\u2019s assessment of the IT workforce  would be completed.", "Thus, instead of limiting NASA\u2019s ability to address our recommendation,  implementing the workforce planning activities discussed in this report  could complement the agency\u2019s ongoing and future efforts. Specifically,  NASA could use the IT workforce leading practices described in this  report to strengthen any new workforce plans and assess the  implementation of any planned improvements. Until NASA documents an  IT workforce planning process and implements all of the key IT workforce  planning activities, the agency may not be effectively positioned to  anticipate and respond to changing staffing needs. Further, the agency is  likely to face challenges in controlling human capital risks when  developing, implementing, and operating IT systems.", "NASA concurred with our four recommendations aimed at addressing  deficiencies in its IT governance (recommendations 4 through 7). In this  regard, the agency described planned actions intended to address each  of these recommendations. For example, among other activities, the  agency stated that it intended to publish charters for all IT governance  boards; have the IT Council review governance board operations  annually; document criteria for escalating investments among governance  boards; and update policies and procedures for managing its investments  as a portfolio.", "Similarly, NASA concurred with our three recommendations related to  establishing an agency-wide approach to managing cybersecurity risk  (recommendations 8, 9, and 10). The agency described actions it had  taken or planned to address each of these recommendations. In  particular, with regard to establishing a cybersecurity risk management  strategy (recommendation 8), NASA asserted that it had already taken  actions that met the requirements of our recommendation. Specifically,  NASA stated that it had established an approach to developing its  cybersecurity risk management strategy by approving a charter for an  agency-wide team to address cybersecurity risk management needs and  hiring a Chief Cybersecurity Risk Officer to oversee agency-wide risk  management initiatives.", "While these actions constitute steps toward addressing the  recommendation, we disagree that establishing a charter for a team and  hiring a Chief Cybersecurity Risk Officer fully addresses the  recommendation. As previously noted in this report, the agency does not  have a cybersecurity risk management strategy that includes elements of  NIST guidance. The strategy should, among other things, make explicit  the agency\u2019s risk tolerance, accepted risk assessment methodologies, a  process for consistently evaluating risk across the organization, risk  response strategies, approaches for monitoring risk over time, and  priorities for investing in risk management. Ensuring that the established  agency-wide team and the Chief Cybersecurity Risk Officer develop a  cybersecurity risk management strategy that aligns with the NIST  guidance will be essential to fully address our recommendation.", "NASA also provided technical comments on the draft report, which we  incorporated, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and other interested parties.

Our  specific objective for this review was to address the extent to which the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has established  and implemented leading IT management practices in strategic planning,  workforce planning, governance, and cybersecurity.", "To address this objective, we compared NASA\u2019s IT management policies,  procedures, and other documentation to criteria established by federal  laws and leading practices. This documentation included the agency\u2019s  strategic plans, workforce gap assessments, governance board meeting  minutes and briefings, charters, policies and procedures, and other  documentation of the Chief Information Officer\u2019s (CIO) authority.

We then  reviewed the agency\u2019s overall strategic plan, and evaluated its previous  and current IT strategic plans against key practices for IT strategic  planning that we have previously identified. These practices call for  documenting the agency\u2019s IT strategic planning processes and  developing an IT strategic plan that aligns with the agency\u2019s overall strategy;  identifies the mission of the agency, results-oriented goals, and  performance measures that permit the agency to determine whether  implementation of the plan is succeeding;  includes strategies the governing IT organization will use to achieve  desired results; and provides descriptions of interdependencies within and across projects  so that they can be understood and managed.", "To determine the extent to which NASA has established and implemented  leading IT workforce planning practices, we conducted a comparative  analysis of NASA\u2019s IT workforce planning policies and documents.  Specifically, we compared agency documents, such as NASA policy  directives, the desk guide, and documentation of efforts to establish IT  workforce competencies and staffing requirements and conduct gap  assessments, to GAO\u2019s IT workforce framework. GAO\u2019s framework  consists of four IT workforce planning steps and eight key activities. The  eight key activities were identified in federal law, regulations, and  guidance, including the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the legislation  referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform  Act, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Human Capital Framework, and GAO  reports.", "Based on our assessment of the documentation and discussions with  agency officials, we assessed the extent to which the agency  implemented, partially implemented, or did not implement the activities.  We considered an activity to be fully implemented if NASA addressed all  of the underlying practices for the activity; partially implemented if it  addressed some but not all of the underlying practices for the activity; and  not implemented if it did not address any of the underlying practices for  the activity.", "We assessed IT governance practices by comparing NASA  documentation to critical processes identified by GAO in the IT  investment management framework. To align our work with the provision in Section 811(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 calling for NASA to  take actions regarding IT governance, we selected critical processes  from Stage 2 of the framework:  instituting the investment board;  selecting and reselecting investments that meet business needs; and providing investment oversight.", "For each critical process, we compared key practices outlined in the  framework to NASA documentation. The documentation we reviewed  included NASA\u2019s IT governance policies and procedures, and charters  and other guidance. We also reviewed governance board meeting  minutes and briefings from each board\u2019s first meeting in 2016 through  meetings held in August 2017.", "In addition, we selected key practices for effective governance from Stage  3 of the IT investment management framework regarding establishing and  implementing policies and procedures for developing the portfolio criteria,  creating the portfolio, and evaluating the portfolio. We then compared  documentation, including NASA\u2019s IT Capital Planning and Investment  Control Process guide dated October 2006, and Annual Capital  Investment Review Implementation Plan dated October 2015, and draft IT  portfolio management plans, against these practices.", "Using standards and guidance from the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST), which identify foundational elements of  effective cybersecurity risk management, we evaluated NASA\u2019s  cybersecurity risk management approach by analyzing policies and plans for establishing a comprehensive risk evaluating documents and plans for establishing a cybersecurity risk  comparing a draft Information Security Program Plan to determine if it  was consistent with NIST guidance; and analyzing policies and procedures to determine if they address  relevant NIST security controls and are current.", "In addition to assessing NASA headquarters, we reviewed IT  management practices at two of the agency\u2019s nine centers (Marshall  Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; and Johnson Space Center  in Houston, Texas) and at one of NASA\u2019s four mission directorates (the  Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate). The two centers  and one mission directorate were selected because they had the largest  fiscal year 2017 IT budgets, respectively, as reported on the federal IT  dashboard. We also visited the Goddard Space Flight Center in  Greenbelt, Maryland, because of the center\u2019s proximity to GAO. The  results of our work at the selected NASA centers and mission directorate  are not generalizable to other NASA centers and mission directorates.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we compared them to budgetary  data obtained directly from NASA\u2019s Office of the CIO.
