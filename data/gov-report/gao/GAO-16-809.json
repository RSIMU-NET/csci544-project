GAO was asked to provide information about Medicaid beneficiaries in FFS arrangements.", "This report examines (1) the proportion and characteristics of Medicaid beneficiaries served in FFS arrangements, and (2) the federal and state resources available to help Medicaid beneficiaries in FFS arrangements find participating providers and report related challenges. GAO analyzed 2014 CMS data, the most recent available, on the proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries in different service delivery arrangements by state, and a 2015 survey of state Medicaid agencies by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. GAO catalogued online, publicly available information from the 23 states having at least 30 percent of their Medicaid population in FFS arrangements, and confirmed the information via email or interview. GAO interviewed Medicaid officials and advocates in 6 of the 23 states and CMS officials. These states were selected, in part, based on the diversity of delivery system arrangements and resources.

The percentage of beneficiaries in FFS arrangements varied widely among states\u201422 states served between 50 and 100 percent of beneficiaries, almost 16 million people, in FFS arrangements. A recent survey of states suggests that millions remained in FFS arrangements as of July 1, 2015. The survey also suggests that the proportion of beneficiaries in FFS arrangements is declining as states move more populations into risk-based managed care. Aged and disabled beneficiaries and children with special health care needs were the most likely of different Medicaid populations to be served through FFS arrangements instead of managed care.", "CMS, the federal agency that oversees Medicaid, and states consider the development of resources to help beneficiaries find a provider to be a state role. CMS supports a federal resource for pediatric dental care and has provided guidance to states related to resources. The 23 states GAO reviewed have 4 common types of resources to help beneficiaries: searchable provider directories; nonsearchable provider lists; beneficiary helplines; and beneficiary handbooks. These resources vary with respect to the scope of information, availability, and states' adaptations to address beneficiary needs.

This enrollee population is a  diverse group that includes children, low-income adults, aged individuals,  and those who are disabled. However, research has shown that  enrollment in Medicaid does not ensure a beneficiary can obtain needed  services. Access to health care services in Medicaid is affected by a  number of different factors such as physician participation, availability of  appointments, and proximity to participating providers.", "Medicaid was designed as a federal-state partnership that allows states  significant flexibility to design and implement their Medicaid programs.  Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and states; the  federal government matches state Medicaid expenditures according to a  statutory formula. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  provides oversight and technical assistance for the Medicaid program, but  states are primarily responsible for administering their respective  Medicaid program\u2019s day-to-day operations, such as setting payment  rates, within broad federal requirements.", "The inherent flexibility in the program has resulted in variability across  states in how Medicaid services are delivered, ranging from traditional  fee-for-service (FFS) to comprehensive risk-based managed care. In  traditional fee-for-service, states pay participating providers for each  delivered service (e.g., an office visit, test, or procedure). Primary care  case management (PCCM) is another FFS delivery arrangement in which  providers are reimbursed on a FFS basis for each service delivered.  However, in PCCM a primary care provider also receives a small case  management fee per patient for monitoring, coordinating, and authorizing  patient care, including referrals to specialty care. For the purposes of this  report we generally consider both traditional FFS and PCCM as FFS  arrangements, because the providers serving a beneficiary are  reimbursed on a FFS basis for medical services provided to the patient.  In contrast, under comprehensive, risk-based managed care, states  contract with managed care organizations to provide all or most Medicaid- covered services for beneficiaries and are at financial risk if spending on  services and administration exceeds payments from the state.", "States have been transitioning greater numbers of Medicaid enrollees to  managed care in recent years as a way to enhance care and control  costs. For example, according to CMS data, between 2010 and 2014  managed care enrollment grew by over 16 million enrollees. As this  transition continues, stakeholders have raised questions about the  populations that remain in FFS arrangements and the resources, such as  provider directories or hotlines, beneficiaries can use to find health care  providers. We have reported that some Medicaid enrollees may face  challenges accessing needed health care services\u2014for example,  obtaining specialty care (such as mental health care) or dental care.  There are no federal statutory requirements that mandate what resources  states must provide to beneficiaries to assist them in finding available  providers in FFS arrangements.", "You asked us to provide information about Medicaid beneficiaries who  are served in FFS arrangements. This report describes  1.  the proportion and characteristics of Medicaid beneficiaries served  in fee-for-service arrangements; and  2.  the federal and state resources available to help Medicaid  beneficiaries in fee-for-service arrangements find participating  providers and report related challenges.", "To describe the proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries served through FFS  arrangements at the national and state levels, we analyzed two data sets  that varied in timeliness and completeness. Our primary source was data  collected directly from states by CMS showing the number of Medicaid  beneficiaries in various service delivery arrangements as of July 1, 2014.  We considered beneficiaries served through either PCCM or traditional  FFS to be in a FFS arrangement. Because the CMS data, the most  recent available from the agency, were over 1 year old, we also examined  more recent but less complete data from a second source: the 2015  survey of state Medicaid officials conducted by Health Management  Associates and the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured in  collaboration with the National Association of Medicaid Directors,  (hereafter called the Medicaid Survey). In the Medicaid Survey, states  reported the percentages of beneficiaries in different service delivery  arrangements as of July 1, 2015, but not the number of beneficiaries. We  were able to use these data to assess whether the reported percentage of  beneficiaries in FFS arrangements had changed in any given state since  2014, but not whether the percentage had changed nationally, as it is not  possible to determine from statewide percentages either the number or  percentage of beneficiaries in FFS arrangements nationwide. We also  reviewed information on selected state Medicaid websites accessed in  March through July 2016 to identify additional changes in service delivery  arrangements that states have planned or made since July 2015. To  describe the characteristics of Medicaid beneficiaries in FFS  arrangements, we analyzed data from two sources: (1) Medicaid Survey  data showing the percentage of beneficiaries in each of four eligibility  groups\u2014children; newly eligible adults in states that opted to expand  Medicaid as authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA); other low-income adults; and individuals who were aged or had  disabilities\u2014who were enrolled in managed care as of July 1, 2015; and  (2) CMS data showing whether states enrolled selected populations in  managed care in 2014, from which we were able to determine whether  these populations were served through FFS arrangements instead. We  assessed the reliability of the CMS and Medicaid survey data by  comparing these data to data from other sources and other years and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "To provide information on the federal and state resources available to  help Medicaid beneficiaries in FFS arrangements find participating  providers and report challenges accessing care, we examined resources  in 23 of the 25 states that use FFS arrangements to deliver care to at  least 30 percent of their Medicaid population as of July 2015, based on  the 2015 Medicaid Survey data. We reviewed and catalogued online,  publicly available resources that assist beneficiaries in finding primary  and specialty care physicians in these 23 states. We confirmed the  resources we identified with all 23 states through either email or phone  interviews. We checked the functionality of the online directories but did  not evaluate the accuracy of the information provided. The information  on state resources that we identified in these 23 states is not  generalizable to other states. From this sample of 23, we interviewed  state Medicaid officials as well as representatives from advocacy groups  that work with Medicaid beneficiaries from 6 states. We chose these  states because of geographic diversity; variation in the proportion of  individuals served through managed care and FFS arrangements; and  variation in types of resources offered to beneficiaries. The selected  states were Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Utah, and  Wisconsin. We used these interviews to better understand the resources  available to beneficiaries, the process for tracking and reporting  beneficiary issues with locating a provider, and any access to care issues  in FFS populations in these states. The experiences of the Medicaid  officials in these 6 states are not generalizable to other states. In addition  to our state interviews, we also interviewed CMS officials and  representatives from a national advocacy group, examined federal  statutes and regulations, and reviewed available federal resources\u2014such  as information on CMS\u2019s website\u2014that are intended to assist either  beneficiaries or states.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to August 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Within that framework, states often use a variety of arrangements to  deliver services to their Medicaid populations, including traditional FFS,  PCCM and managed care. The state Medicaid agency is responsible for  administering the program, and the structure of how Medicaid services  are coordinated, administered, and delivered varies by state and  arrangement.", "In traditional FFS, beneficiaries can visit any provider that accepts  Medicaid patients. Some states that use both FFS arrangements and  managed care restrict certain populations to traditional FFS to ensure  they have access to all participating Medicaid providers. Certain states  also use PCCM to enhance care coordination and reduce unnecessary  and duplicative costs. PCCM structures vary across the states. While all  PCCM programs feature a primary care case manager that coordinates  beneficiary care, some states have adopted a more enhanced model that  can incorporate provider network management and performance and  quality reporting. To comply with federal regulations, a state\u2019s contract  with a PCCM must include certain provisions, including a requirement to  provide 24-hour availability of information, referral, and treatment for  emergency medical conditions as well as arrangements with, or referrals  to, sufficient numbers of physicians and other practitioners to ensure that  services under the contract can be furnished to enrollees promptly and  without compromise to quality of care. Additionally, federal regulations  require states to give beneficiaries enrolled in PCCM arrangements  contact information for nearby providers.", "Medicaid managed care has become more prevalent over the past  decade as states look to provide health care services in a cost-effective  manner. Under managed care, state agencies typically contract with  organizations to provide a specific set of Medicaid-covered services to  beneficiaries, paying those organizations a set amount per beneficiary,  per month to provide services. States vary in terms of the populations and  services included in managed care. For example, states may have  mandatory enrollment in managed care for some populations, voluntary  enrollment for others, and may also exclude certain populations from  managed care. States or their managed care contractors are required to  provide information to enrolled beneficiaries about primary care providers,  specialists, and hospitals included in their provider network, including  names, locations, telephone numbers, languages spoken, and whether  the provider is accepting new patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Access to Care Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal law establishes that state Medicaid payments to providers must  be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are  available to beneficiaries to at least the extent that they are available to  the general population in the same geographic area. This part of the  Medicaid statute, which is sometimes referred to as the \u201cequal access  provision,\u201d has been previously used by providers and beneficiaries to  challenge state reimbursement rates to providers on the grounds that the  rates are insufficient to attract enough providers and are, therefore, not in  compliance with the law. In March 2015, however, the U.S. Supreme  Court ruled in Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., that the equal  access provision does not provide a cause of action for providers to  challenge a state\u2019s reimbursement rates.", "Subsequent to the Armstrong decision, CMS published a final rule on  Medicaid access to care, Medicaid Program: Methods for Assuring  Access to Covered Medicaid Services. One purpose of the rule is to  provide CMS with the necessary information to ensure that state  reimbursement rates meet the requirements of the equal access  provision. The rule outlines a process for states to document their  approach to monitoring access, especially when proposed rate reductions  or other changes that may reduce beneficiaries\u2019 abilities to access care.  Under the rule, states are required to develop access monitoring review  plans\u2014which must contain specific data sources to support a finding of  sufficient access\u2014that cover at a minimum primary care and physician  specialist services, behavioral health services, pre- and post-natal  obstetric care, including labor and delivery, home health services, and  any services for which the state or CMS has received a higher than usual  volume of complaints. The data collected for these services through the  access monitoring review plan must be analyzed every 3 years by states.  States proposing to reduce or restructure provider payments that could  result in diminished access to care must also submit an access review  with the state plan amendment proposing such changes. In addition,  states must monitor access to care after the implementation of the rate  reduction or payment restructuring, at a minimum, annually over a 3-year  period.  States must submit their initial access monitoring review plans to  CMS by October 1, 2016. Additionally, the rule requires that states have  ongoing mechanisms for beneficiaries and providers to comment on  access to care (through hotlines, surveys, ombudsman, review of  grievance and appeals data, or another equivalent mechanism).

By some measures, access  to care for Medicaid enrollees is comparable to that of privately insured  individuals and better than that of uninsured individuals. In a national  survey, for example, less than 4 percent of beneficiaries who had  Medicaid coverage for a full year reported difficulty obtaining medical  care, which was similar to individuals with full-year private insurance. At  the same time, however, Medicaid beneficiaries may have greater health  care needs; for example, higher rates of obesity and other health  conditions, and greater difficulty accessing specialty and dental care.  Certain groups of Medicaid enrollees have reported difficulty obtaining  necessary care relative to others. For example, in 2012, about 7.8  percent of working-age adults with full-year Medicaid reported difficulty  obtaining care compared with 3.3 percent of similar adults with private  insurance\u2014a statistically significant difference.

Historically,  many states have served beneficiaries with disabilities through FFS  arrangements rather than managed care, in part to ensure that these  vulnerable beneficiaries have access to a range of providers (some of  whom might not have participated in managed care). While this trend is  changing and states are increasingly enrolling individuals with disabilities  in managed care, along with those whose complex health care needs  require long-term services and supports, some states with managed care  still serve all or most individuals with disabilities through FFS  arrangements.

Under CMS\u2019s rule, states must have ongoing  mechanisms for beneficiary and provider input on access to care (through  hotlines, surveys, ombudsman, review of grievance and appeals data, or  other equivalent mechanism). States are required to maintain a record of  the input they receive and how they responded. They must also provide  this information to CMS upon request. Medicaid officials in the six states  told us that they were still determining how they will adjust their  approaches to identifying and responding to access to care challenges\u2014 such as issues locating a provider\u2014to comply with CMS\u2019s rule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.

Several state Medicaid officials and advocacy groups  noted that provider shortages, proximity to participating providers, and  transportation, among other things, were more directly related to access  challenges than resources for finding a provider. Several states have  initiated efforts to address these challenges, including the following  examples:  In Oklahoma, Medicaid officials have started using telemedicine to  help address the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists in the  state.", "In Connecticut, Medicaid officials require the administrative service  organizations to perform and present annual geo-access analyses. A  geo-access analysis is a visual mapping of provider locations to help  identify potential access issues due to remoteness of beneficiaries.", "Utah\u2019s state legislature passed a law in 2016 to create state income  tax credits for psychiatrists and psychiatric mental health nurse  practitioners, under certain circumstances, to help recruit those  providers to the state.", "While some states are addressing access challenges with statewide  efforts, several state Medicaid officials and advocates in the 6 states we  interviewed commented that challenges locating a provider can be  community-specific at the county or city level and noted that federally  qualified health centers, local health departments, or community health  workers are points for both disseminating information about resources  and for identifying and mitigating local access challenges. Additionally,  some communities are developing resources to tackle specific access  challenges in their area. For example, an alliance of health care  stakeholder organizations in Denver is preparing to pilot the use of a  specialty care referral network to address the difficulties underserved  residents in the area face in finding specialty care physicians.
