Income limits vary widely among programs, ranging from approximately $32,000 to $136,500 per year for students from a four-person household in school year 2017-2018. Programs have different requirements for how students can use their scholarships and different methods for calculating scholarship amounts. More than half of the programs (13 of 22) allow students to use their scholarship money for costs like transportation and books in addition to tuition, whereas the remaining programs (9 of 22) require scholarships funds to be used for tuition only. Average scholarship awards in school year 2016-2017 ranged from $500 to $5,468 per student among the 16 programs that published or provided GAO with such information.", "The effect of TCS donations on donors' tax liability depends on program characteristics and donors' financial circumstances. Specifically, half of the 22 programs allow eligible donors to claim 100 percent of their donations as state tax credits, meaning that for each dollar donated, state taxes owed are reduced by a dollar, up to any maximum set by the state. The remaining 11 programs allow donors to claim from 50 to 85 percent of their donations as state tax credits. Programs often specify a maximum tax credit that may be claimed each year by a donor, by all donors combined, or both. Individual donors may also reduce their federal tax liabilities through the federal deduction for charitable contributions, depending on their financial circumstances and applicable tax provisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State tax credit scholarship (TCS) programs offer tax credits to individuals  or businesses that donate to scholarship funds for students to attend  private elementary and secondary schools.

In some  cases, TCS program donations may also affect the amount of federal  taxes donors owe, through the federal deduction for charitable  contributions. TCS programs are one type of private school choice  program that states have established to help fund students\u2019 attendance at  private schools. Other types of private school choice programs include  school voucher and education savings account programs. As of January  2018, there were 22 TCS programs authorized across 18 states, with an  additional program enacted later in the year. In school year (SY) 2016- 2017 (the most recent year for which information was available), TCS  programs collectively awarded scholarships totaling more than $856  million, according to state-reported data.", "Designing a TCS program requires that many decisions be made, such  as who will be eligible to receive scholarships and the effect donations will  have on the amount donors owe in state taxes.

We verified the accuracy of this information with state  officials from each program. We did not conduct an independent review  of state laws and regulations. Throughout the report, we provide the most  recent and complete information available for the various types of  information. Specifically, unless otherwise noted, student eligibility  requirements are as of SY 2017-2018 and tax provisions are as of  calendar year (CY) 2018. Scholarship amount information is from SY  2016-2017 and program donations made by taxpayers are from CY 2016.", "We also used economic data from the 2012-2016 American Community  Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates administered by the U.S. Census  Bureau. ACS is a national survey that collects information about social,  economic, demographic, and housing characteristics from a sample of  households. For this report, we used ACS estimates of the state level  median income for a four-person household to provide context for TCS  program income eligibility requirements in relation to state income  distributions. For the TCS programs with income eligibility requirements,  we calculated program income limits for a four-person household based  on each TCS program\u2019s income eligibility requirements for SY 2016-2017  and 2017-2018. We then compared these limits to 2012-2016 5-year ACS  estimates of state median household income for four-person households.  In addition to verifying the program data we collected with state officials,  we reviewed ACS documentation on survey design and methodology  used to produce the estimates of state median household income. We  concluded that the data presented in this report were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "In addition, we spoke with officials at the U.S. Department of Education to  obtain their observations about the state programs, and identify whether  the department had conducted research related to TCS programs. We  also spoke with other stakeholders such as TCS program researchers to  understand current research and emerging issues regarding these  programs.", "For the second objective, in addition to reviewing program documents  and verifying the information with state officials, we developed illustrative examples of how TCS donations may affect state and federal tax liabilities  for donors with varying tax circumstances\u2014including examples that  assume different percentages of a donation that donors are allowed to  claim as a state tax credit (referred to in this report as tax credit  percentages). Specifically we developed examples that assume a 50  percent TCS program tax credit and examples that assume a 100 percent  TCS program tax credit, which represent the smallest and largest tax  credit percentages offered by existing TCS programs. In August 2018, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Treasury published proposed  regulations that, if finalized without modification, would change the extent  to which individuals who make TCS program donations can reduce their  federal tax liability. We did not address the proposed regulations in our  analysis because they were not final at the time this report was published  and are therefore subject to change. We also reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and other documents related to federal tax policy and  spoke with the IRS regarding federal deductions for charitable  contributions and state and local taxes.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Most TCS programs began within the last 10 years; the first  TCS program awarded scholarships in Arizona in 1998 and Florida  created the newest program in 2018, according to state program  documents and officials.", "Scholarships are funded through donations from private individuals and  businesses, and the financial impact to states from TCS programs  primarily occurs through forgone revenue resulting from the associated  tax credits.

For context, we compared these income limits to the 2012- 2016 5-year ACS estimates of state median household income for four- person households. Six of the 17 programs had household income limits  in SY 2017-2018 above their state\u2019s median income. This included two  programs each in Arizona and Pennsylvania which collectively accounted  for about one-third of all TCS scholarships awarded to students in SY  2016-2017, according to state-reported data. Of the 17 programs that  have household income limits, 6 also require SGOs to further consider  income when selecting scholarship recipients among eligible students.", "Such requirements include giving preference to scholarship applicants  from lower-income households or ensuring that a certain percentage of  scholarship recipients come from lower-income households.", "Of the remaining five TCS programs that do not use income to determine  eligibility, three use one or more other types of eligibility criteria, such as  whether the student has a disability, and two\u2014Montana\u2019s TCS program  and Arizona\u2019s Original Individual Income Tax Credit program\u2014are open  to all school-aged residents.", "TCS programs collected limited information on the household incomes of  scholarship recipients. The 11 programs that had income information on  recipient families collected and reported it in different ways. For example,  the Alabama program requires SGOs to report the total number and  amount of scholarships awarded to students qualifying for the federal free  and reduced-price lunch program and makes the information publicly  available. Arizona makes an annual report publicly available on the  state\u2019s four TCS programs, including breakdowns of the number of  students receiving scholarships from various income levels.", "Other eligibility requirements: Some TCS programs\u2019 eligibility criteria  for student scholarship recipients include other factors, such as students\u2019  disability status or previous schooling. Specifically, 7 of 22 programs are  limited to students with disabilities or allow students with disabilities to  qualify for a scholarship even if they do not meet some requirements for  students without disabilities. For example, to be eligible for Virginia\u2019s  program, all students must have a household income below a certain  amount, but that amount is higher for students with disabilities. South  Carolina\u2019s program is limited to students with disabilities. In addition,  some programs may require students to have previously attended a  public school (9 of 22) or live in the attendance area of a public school  with performance challenges (5 of 22).
