This includes $377.3 million, primarily for additional enforcement staff, and $373 million for increased costs of maintaining current operations--funded from three sources--the budget increase, program reductions and internal savings. The request for more enforcement staff follows similar requests in IRS's past five budgets. Despite budget requests that were almost fully funded and despite realizing some savings in prior years, the number of most skilled enforcement staff declined by over 21 percent between 1998 and 2003 because of other priorities, including unbudgeted expenses. This history, and the expectation of unbudgeted costs in 2005, raises questions about whether IRS will be able to increase enforcement staff as planned. IRS's request also includes about $1.93 billion in information technology-- $285 million for BSM contractor costs and about $1.64 billion for information systems. Most BSM projects have experienced cost overruns and schedule delays postponing benefits expected under BSM. IRS reduced its BSM budget request to focus on fewer projects and is implementing plans to respond to known deficiencies. IRS has made progress in implementing investment management best practices for developing and supporting its information systems budget request. However, until IRS fully implements the improvements, its ability to develop supportable budget requests for information systems operations and maintenance will be limited. IRS's reported 2004 filing season performance in key areas improved, with the exception of the accuracy of tax law responses provided over the telephones to taxpayers, which declined. Also, the number of taxpayers seeking assistance at IRS's walk-in assistance sites declined as did the number of tax returns prepared at those sites."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s hearing on the  Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) fiscal year 2005 budget request and its  performance to date during the 2004 tax filing season.", "Effective tax administration requires a combination of quality taxpayer  service to help those who want to comply, and effective enforcement  measures against those who do not. Although tax administrators  continually debate the proper balance between taxpayer service and  enforcement, the ultimate goal is to assure a high level of voluntary  compliance. Currently, about 98 percent of the money IRS collects is  received voluntarily\u2014without any IRS enforcement action.", "For the last few years, we have been reporting on trends in taxpayer  service and enforcement. During this period, IRS has noticeably improved  the quality of service to taxpayers. At the same time, there have been  declines in many of IRS\u2019s enforcement programs and in the numbers of the  most skilled enforcement staff. Many inside and outside IRS have become  concerned that the declines in enforcement efforts have reduced  taxpayers\u2019 incentive to voluntarily comply with the tax laws. While the  actual impact on voluntary compliance is unknown, because IRS does not  have a reliable current estimate of the overall compliance rate, the fear is  that taxpayers could lose confidence in IRS\u2019s ability to ensure that all  taxpayers pay what they should. If taxpayers ever lose confidence that  their friends, neighbors, and business competitors are paying their fair  share of taxes, then they could become less willing to pay themselves.", "One key to improving taxpayer service and enforcement is IRS\u2019s Business  Systems Modernization (BSM) effort, now in its 6th year. If successful,  BSM is expected to allow IRS to better serve taxpayers and enforce the tax  laws without a major increase in staffing and other resources. However,  we continue to report that modernization is a high-risk area, the scope and  complexity of BSM is growing, and BSM projects are experiencing  additional costs and delays.", "As you requested, our statement discusses both IRS\u2019s 2005 budget request  and its 2004 filing season performance to date. With respect to the budget,  we assessed the likelihood that (1) IRS will be able to allocate more  resources to enforcement, and (2) BSM and other technology efforts will  deliver cost savings and efficiencies in the immediate future. With respect  to the filing season, we assessed IRS\u2019s performance in processing returns  and providing assistance to taxpayers.", "Our assessment of the budget request and BSM is based on a comparative  analysis of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2002 through 2005 budget requests, funding,  and expenditures, supporting documentation, and interviews with IRS  officials. Our assessment of the filing season is based on a comparison of  IRS\u2019s performance this year to the previous two filing seasons, site visits to  an IRS processing center and walk-in sites, monitoring processing status  meetings, interviews with IRS and Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration (TIGTA) officials and other external stakeholders, reviews  of TIGTA and other external reports, and reviews of IRS\u2019s Web site. We  used historical budget and performance data including filing season  performance data from reports and budget requests used by the IRS,  Department of Treasury, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Although we have not verified the accuracy of the most recent data, in past  reports we have assessed IRS\u2019s budget and performance data. As a result,  we considered the data to be sufficiently reliable for purposes of this  testimony. The budget and performance projections for fiscal years 2004  and 2005 are subject to change. Also, we did not independently validate  planned BSM projects\u2019 cost estimates or confirm, through system and  project management documentation, the validity of IRS-provided  information on the projects\u2019 content and progress. We performed our work  in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Ga. from December 2003 through March  2004, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, our assessment of IRS\u2019s 2005 budget request shows that:  IRS is requesting $10.7 billion, an increase of $489.8 million over fiscal year  2004. The 2005 budget proposes $377.3 million to fund new initiatives,  primarily increases in enforcement staff, and $373 million to cover the  increased costs, such as salary increases, of maintaining current programs.  IRS plans to fund the additional spending from three sources\u2014the budget  increase, program reductions ($149.7 million) and internal savings   ($110.8 million). IRS has made increasing enforcement staff a priority in its  last five budget requests. However, despite getting its requests almost fully  funded and despite realizing some savings\u2014although not all that were  projected\u2014IRS did not achieve increases in enforcement staff. Staffing in  three key enforcement occupations\u2014revenue agents, revenue officers,  and special agents\u2014declined by over 21 percent between 1998 and 2003.  IRS funded other priorities such as unbudgeted expenses and  improvements to taxpayer service. This raises several questions and  concerns. One is whether IRS will be able to increase enforcement staff as  planned in 2005. Another is whether the declines in enforcement staff, and  the resulting declines in statistics related to IRS\u2019s enforcement programs,  are eroding taxpayers\u2019 incentive to voluntarily comply with the tax laws.", "Included in IRS\u2019s budget request is about $1.93 billion (including 7,385  staff years) in information technology resources. This includes (1) $285  million for the agency\u2019s multiyear capital account that funds contractor  costs for the BSM program and (2) about $1.64 billion for information  systems, of which $1.55 billion is for operations and maintenance. The  BSM request has been developed consistent with federal guidance on  budget preparation. While BSM management controls have improved,  some weaknesses, such as cost and schedule estimating, still remain. Most  BSM projects have experienced cost overruns and schedule delays that  have postponed the delivery of benefits to taxpayers and IRS operations.  In an effort to better ensure that projects are delivered within budget and  on schedule, IRS has reduced its BSM budget request to focus on a smaller  modernization project portfolio and is implementing action plans to  respond to deficiencies noted in several recent assessments of the BSM  program. In addition, with respect to its information systems budget  request, IRS has made progress in implementing investment management  best practices for developing and supporting it. However, until IRS fully  implements planned process improvements, its ability to develop  supportable information systems operations and maintenance budget  requests will remain limited.", "Our assessment of the 2004 filing season to date shows that:  IRS\u2019s performance during the 2004 filing season has improved in most  areas compared to this time last year and the year before, based on the  data we reviewed on key filing season activities\u2014paper and electronic  processing, telephone assistance, IRS\u2019s Web site and walk-in assistance. In  particular, access to IRS\u2019s telephone assistors has improved and Web site  usage has increased. However, the accuracy of responses to tax law  questions provided by telephone assistors declined the last two years.  Additionally, the number of taxpayers seeking assistance at IRS\u2019s walk-in  sites continued to decline and IRS is shifting work from its walk-in sites to  alternative means of providing assistance, such as its volunteer  organizations and its Web site.

To address our recommendation, IRS agreed to take the  following actions:    develop an activity-based cost model to plan, project, and report costs for  business tasks/activities funded by the information systems budget;    develop a capital planning guide to implement processes for capital  planning and investment control, budget formulation and execution,  business case development, and project prioritization; and  implement a process for managing all information systems investments as  a portfolio, patterned after the BSM program.", "IRS has made progress in implementing investment management best  practices in developing and supporting its information systems budget  request. IRS officials reported that the agency is managing all information  systems funding requirements as a portfolio within Treasury\u2019s IT  investment portfolio system, and preparing business cases for many of its  operational program activities, as required by OMB. According to IRS,  these business cases are updated on a periodic basis and are evaluated  within the context of the agency\u2019s overall IT funding portfolio. IRS plans to  align this portfolio management process with the capital planning and  investment control system now being implemented to provide a uniform  process to select, manage, and control all IT investments, including  modernization, enhancements, and sustaining operations.", "Although progress has been made, IRS has not yet completed all of its  planned actions to implement our prior recommendation. Completion of  IRS\u2019s capital planning and investment control guide has been delayed due  to changing roles and responsibilities within the Modernization and  Information Technology Services organization, and thus was not used in  preparing the fiscal year 2005 information systems budget request.  According to IRS, the capital planning guidance will not be completed  until September 2004. In addition, as of March 2004, IRS has not yet  developed an activity-based cost accounting system to enable it to account  for the full cost of operations and maintenance projects and determine  how effectively IRS projects are achieving program goals and mission  needs. This cost model, which is being developed in conjunction with the  Integrated Financial System modernization project, has been delayed, and  due to Integrated Financial System schedule delays, will not be available  until the fiscal year 2008 budget formulation cycle.

As table 5 shows, through March 19, 2004,  IRS has processed about 63 million individual tax returns\u2014of which 43  million were received electronically, which is about 4.4 million more  electronically filed returns than this time last year. IRS officials have  attributed this year\u2019s performance, in part, to having planned appropriately  for issues such as correcting errors related to the advanced child tax  credit. Through March 12, 2004, IRS had identified about 2.7 million  individual tax returns with errors, with approximately 1.6 million related  to the advanced child tax credit.", "Electronic filing has grown from the same time last year.

IRS officials recognize that they will not achieve the goal of having 80  percent of all individual income tax returns filed electronically by 2007.  However, IRS officials told us they will continue to strive to achieve that  goal in the future. Moreover, as we reported last year, the growth rate  from 1996 through 2003 has been generally decreasing, with the 13 percent  growth rate in 2003 representing the smallest percentage increase in the  number of individual tax returns filed electronically since 1996. Although  the current growth rate is about 11 percent, according to IRS data, the  number of electronic filings is ahead of estimates at this time.  Consequently, IRS officials believe IRS will meet and might exceed the  annual growth rate goal of 12 percent by the year\u2019s end.", "Growth in electronic filing remains a key part of IRS\u2019s modernization  strategy. Electronic filing has allowed IRS to reduce resources devoted to  processing (discussed in appendix I) and begin consolidating paper  processing centers. It also reduces errors because IRS would not have to  transcribe tax returns information and some up-front checks are built into  electronic filing. Finally, taxpayers get refunds quicker with electronic  filing\u2014IRS\u2019s goal for refunds for electronically filed returns is about half  the 40 days that IRS allows for refunds for returns filed on paper.", "IRS has implemented numerous initiatives over the years intended to  increase electronic filing usage. IRS\u2019s new major electronic filing  initiatives this year are related to business not individual income tax  returns. They are modernized E-File, which allows the electronic filing of  corporate income tax form 1120 and E-Services, which is a suite of  Internet services offered to tax practitioners such as electronic account  resolution and transcript delivery. IRS officials do not expect these  initiatives to dramatically increase electronic filing of individual tax  returns this year, because taxpayers and practitioners will need to adjust  their behavior and take advantage of the new services. However, these  initiatives are important, because they should increase the willingness of  tax practitioners to file both corporate and individual tax returns  electronically in future filing seasons, which can currently be done only on  a limited basis for corporate returns.", "IRS made some changes to improve the Free File Alliance program,  which began last year to promote electronic filing of individual income tax  returns.

However,  cost overruns and schedule delays associated with on-going BSM projects,  along with planned reductions to the BSM project portfolio mean that  many of these benefits will not be realized in the short term.
