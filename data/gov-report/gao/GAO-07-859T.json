In its last  comprehensive misclassification estimate, the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) estimated that 15 percent of employers misclassified 3.4 million  workers as independent contractors in 1984, resulting in an estimated tax  loss of $1.6 billion (or $2.72 billion in inflation-adjusted 2006 dollars) in  Social Security tax, unemployment tax, and income tax.", "The Department of Labor (DOL) enforces a wide range of labor laws that  provide protections to workers, including the Fair Labor Standards Act  (FLSA), which provides minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor  protections.

I will  discuss (1) the number and characteristics of independent contractors,   (2) the workforce protections and benefits provided to employees that  typically are not available to independent contractors, and (3) the actions  that DOL takes to detect and address employee misclassification. To  identify information on the contingent workforce, we analyzed data from  the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) Current Population Survey (CPS),  which is used to survey people about their work and workplace benefits,  and a CPS supplement developed to collect information on the contingent  workforce; interviewed BLS officials and other researchers about  contingent worker issues; and reviewed key workforce protection laws to  determine coverage of contingent workers. To obtain information on  DOL\u2019s efforts to detect and address employee misclassification, we  reviewed DOL documents and interviewed DOL officials and reviewed  literature and interviewed researchers about employee misclassification  issues. We performed our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards between July 2005 and June 2006.", "In summary, the number of independent contractors in the total employed  workforce grew from 6.7 percent in 1995 to 7.4 percent in 2005.

GAO  recommended in its July 2006 report that DOL revise the workplace poster  to include additional contact information that would facilitate the  reporting of potential employee misclassification complaints, and evaluate  the extent to which misclassification cases identified through  investigations are referred to the appropriate federal or state agency, and  take action to make improvements as necessary. DOL generally agreed  with both recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The term \u201ccontingent work\u201d can be defined in many ways to refer to a  variety of nonstandard work arrangements. Broadly defined, \u201ccontingent  work\u201d refers to work arrangements that are not long-term, year-round, full- time employment with a single employer. For example, an employer may  hire workers when there is an immediate and limited demand for their  services, without any offer of permanent or even long-term employment.  Independent contractors, temporary workers, and part-time workers are  examples of contingent workers. Specifically, independent contractors can  be seen as individuals who obtain customers on their own to provide a  product or service (and who may have other employees working for  them), such as maids, realtors, child care providers, and management  consultants.", "Research has shown that employers use contingent work arrangements for  a variety of reasons. Employers may hire contingent workers to  accommodate workload fluctuations, fill temporary absences, meet  employees\u2019 requests for part-time hours, screen workers for permanent  positions, and save on wage and benefit costs, among other reasons.  Previous analyses of data from the CPS Contingent Work Supplement have  indicated that workers also take temporary and other contingent jobs for a  variety of personal and economic reasons. For example, workers in  various types of contingent jobs indicated that they (1) preferred a flexible  schedule to accommodate their school, family, or other obligations;   (2) needed additional income; (3) could not find a more permanent job; or  (4) hoped the job would lead to permanent employment. Studies using  data from the BLS National Longitudinal Survey of Youth show that events  such as the birth of a child or a change in marital status affect the  likelihood of entering different types of employment arrangements and  prompt some workers to enter contingent work arrangements.", "Concerns arise when employers misclassify workers as independent  contractors, who are excluded from certain worker protections. Employee  misclassification occurs when an employer improperly classifies a worker  as an independent contractor when the worker should be classified as an  employee. In 2000, we reported that because most key workforce  protection laws cover only workers who are employees, independent  contractors and certain other contingent workers, such as self-employed  workers, are, by definition, not covered.", "DOL may encounter employee misclassification while enforcing worker  protection laws. DOL\u2019s mission is to promote the welfare of job seekers,  workers, and retirees in the United States by improving their working  conditions, advancing their opportunities for profitable employment,  protecting their retirement and health care benefits, helping employers  find workers, strengthening free collective bargaining, and tracking  changes in employment, prices, and other national economic  measurements.

The Wage and Hour Division\u2014with  staff located in 5 regional and 72 district, area, and field offices throughout  the country\u2014conducts investigations of employers who have $500,000 or  more in annual sales volume. In addition, the division conducts outreach  efforts for employers and workers to ensure compliance with FLSA.  District directors oversee investigators, who play a key role in carrying out  FLSA enforcement. Investigators are trained to investigate a wide variety  of workplace conditions and complaints and enforce a variety of labor  laws in addition to FLSA. Regional and district offices conduct outreach  to employers and workers through brochures, workplace posters,  presentations or training sessions for individuals or groups, and Web- based information.", "FLSA\u2014which provides minimum wage and overtime pay protections\u2014 requires that employers pay those employees covered by the act at least  the minimum wage and pay overtime wages when they work more than   40 hours a week.

These criteria have been  classified as the economic realities test, the common law test, and a  combination of the two sometimes referred to as a hybrid test. The  economic realities test looks to whether the worker is economically  dependent upon the principal or is in business for him or herself. The test  is not precise, leaving determinations to be made on a case-by-case basis.  The test consists of a number of factors, such as the degree of control  exercised by the employing party over the worker, the worker\u2019s  opportunity for profit or loss, the worker\u2019s capital investment in the  business, the degree of skill required for the job, and whether the worker  is an integral part of the business. The traditional common law test  examines the employing party\u2019s right to control how the work is  performed. To determine whether the employing party has this right,  courts may consider the degree of skill required to perform the work, who  supplies the tools and equipment needed to perform the work, and the  length of time the worker has been working for the employing party. When  the tests are combined in some type of hybrid, a court typically weighs the  common law factors and some additional factors related to the worker\u2019s  economic situation, such as how the work relationship may be terminated,  whether the worker receives leave and retirement benefits, and whether  the hiring party pays Social Security taxes.", "Aside from the complexities of distinguishing employees from  independent contractors, employers have economic incentives to  misclassify employees as independent contractors. Namely, employers are  not obligated to make certain financial expenditures for independent  contractors that they make for employees, such as paying certain taxes  (Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes), providing workers\u2019  compensation insurance, paying minimum wage and overtime wages, or  including independent contractors in employee benefit plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Misclassified Employees May Be Excluded from Coverage under Key Worker Protection Laws", "paragraphs": ["Contingent workers who are employees are generally protected under key  laws designed to protect workers, but certain categories of contingent  workers\u2014such as independent contractors\u2014may be excluded from  coverage under these laws.
