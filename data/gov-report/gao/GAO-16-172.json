Specifically, DOD partially addressed three statutory requirements and did not address three statutory requirements. For example, DOD's September 2014 report to Congress partially addressed the requirement to develop and implement a plan for achieving savings by outlining reductions in its civilian and contractor workforces, but DOD does not describe a process for implementing the planned reductions. Also, DOD did not address savings the department intends to achieve through reductions in the number of military, civilian, and contractor personnel. Instead the report outlined reductions in full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, which may not equate to savings, and did not outline savings in funding for the contractor workforce beyond fiscal year 2015. Without this information, Congress has limited assurance on how the department will achieve required savings and whether the savings will be achieved in a manner that is consistent with workforce-management laws.", "Moreover, according to its reports, DOD has made civilian personnel reductions; however, GAO's analysis indicates that the reductions may not achieve the savings required by section 955, and DOD has not provided an explanation of the reasons for the projected shortfall in achieved savings in the contractor workforce. Section 955 requires DOD to achieve savings in the cost of the civilian and contractor workforces between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2017 at least as large in percentage terms as the savings in military basic pay resulting from reductions in military end strength over the same period. In its section 955 reports, DOD reports on reductions to civilian FTEs, but does not report the civilian personnel savings associated with the reductions. Civilian FTEs by themselves, however, may not be reliable measures of the cost of the civilian workforce. For instance, GAO's analysis shows that from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, civilian FTEs declined by 3.3 percent, but civilian personnel costs declined by only 0.9 percent adjusted for inflation. Because DOD's focus has been on making and reporting on FTE reductions, DOD and Congress lack information on the extent to which the reductions will achieve savings, and DOD may risk falling short of the statutory requirement for cost savings in the civilian workforce. In addition, in its fiscal year 2016 budget, DOD shows a planned increase in spending on the contractor workforce that, if carried out, will mean that about half the reduction to contractor workforce spending that DOD has identified as its goal through fiscal 2017 remains to be achieved. Further, GAO's analysis shows that DOD would need to reduce its spending on the contractor workforce by about $4.1 billion from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 in order to match the approximately 7.0 percent reduction in military average strength over the same period. DOD has not provided an explanation of the reasons for the shortfall as required by section 955, in part because complying with other statutory requirements has been a main focus of DOD's efforts to limit spending on the contractor workforce. Without this information, it is uncertain whether DOD will achieve the required section 955 savings in contractor spending, which hinders Congress's insight into what additional actions are required to achieve this goal."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense fully address ongoing section 955 requirements in its next two status reports to Congress.

DOD\u2019s civilian and  contractor personnel perform a wide variety of duties and responsibilities,  including mission-essential combat support functions such as logistics  support and maintenance. With long-term fiscal challenges likely to  continue, DOD must operate strategically and efficiently, including  through cost-effective management of its human capital.", "Our prior work has emphasized the importance of DOD strategically  determining, as part of its workforce planning, the appropriate workforce  mix to perform the missions of the department, along with assessing  personnel costs and effects on readiness. In May 2013, we found that  DOD had not taken a holistic approach to managing its workforce  requirements to achieve the appropriate balance using all three  components\u2014military, civilian, and contractor\u2014of its total workforce, and  to prioritize the achievement of a workforce sufficiently sized and of the  appropriate mix to carry out DOD\u2019s mission. We recommended that DOD  revise its workforce policies and procedures to address the determination  of the appropriate workforce mix. DOD partially concurred, stating that it  was in the process of issuing guidance to its military, civilian, and  contractor manpower management, and did not believe additional  direction was necessary at the time of the report.

Section 955 also required  the Secretary of Defense to issue a series of reports on DOD\u2019s  implementation of that plan, and includes a provision that we review each  of the reports DOD submits to Congress to determine whether the  required savings in the civilian and contractor workforces are being  achieved and whether the plan is being implemented in a manner  consistent with sourcing and workforce-management laws. This report  addresses the extent to which (1) DOD, as indicated in its initial  September 2014 report and February 2015 status report accompanying  the fiscal year 2016 budget request, is meeting the requirements  specified in section 955, and (2) has achieved the cost savings specified  by section 955 and has identified the savings in these reports.", "To determine the extent to which DOD, as indicated in its reports, is  meeting the requirements specified in section 955, we analyzed DOD\u2019s  September 2014 and February 2015 reports as well as related  documentation, and compared them to the requirements in section 955.  As of December 2015, these were the only two reports DOD had  submitted.

The analysts then met to resolve any differences in their respective  independent analyses, and the final assessment was reviewed by both  our Office of General Counsel and team methodologist. In addition, we  reviewed the September 2014 report and related documentation using the  same methodology to assess the extent to which they contain information  regarding compliance with the workforce management laws specified in  the act.

To assess DOD\u2019s progress towards its goal for civilian  FTE reduction, we calculated, based on DOD\u2019s February 2015 report, (1)  the FTE reduction that occurred from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year  2014, the most recent year for which actual levels are available, and (2)  the additional reduction that DOD has planned through fiscal year 2017.  We then compared the percentage reduction in civilian FTEs from fiscal  year 2012 to fiscal year 2017 to the percent reduction in military average  strength over the same period.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress toward its goal for the contractor workforces,  we calculated (1) the reduction that would be required for DOD to achieve  its goal of matching the reduction in contractor workforce spending to the  reduction in military average strength from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal  year 2017 that DOD included in its February 2015 report; (2) the  reduction that has occurred from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year  2014, the most recent year for which actual levels are available; (3) the  increase that DOD has planned through fiscal year 2016, the latest year  for which DOD provides contractor workforce spending levels; and (4) any  shortfall between the required reductions and DOD\u2019s actual and planned  reductions through fiscal year 2017. We also interviewed DOD and  military service officials to obtain an understanding of why they selected  the savings and reductions goals identified in the reports and the  information upon which the goals are based. In addition, to assess the  extent to which reductions in civilian FTEs may result in the required  savings to the civilian workforce, as well as the extent to which reductions  in military average strength result in a similar reduction to military basic  pay, we reviewed DOD budget data on each data series for fiscal years  2012 through 2016 and calculated (1) the annual percentage change from  year to year, and (2) the overall percentage change during this period,  and reviewed these relationships.", "We determined that the data contained in DOD\u2019s reports and related  budget materials were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on  and analyzing reductions to the civilian workforces in the context of data  as presented by DOD.

In its  reports, however, DOD provides information on reductions to civilian full- time equivalents (FTE), but does not report the civilian personnel costs  associated with the reductions, and as a result it is not clear whether its  reductions will achieve the savings required under section 955.", "According to its September 2014 report, DOD does not project either  military pay or civilian personnel costs beyond the budget year. As a  result, DOD did not provide the information required by section 955.  According to OUSD Comptroller officials, DOD does develop 5-year plans  for civilian FTEs as a part of the process for both the annual budget and  Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). In addition, according to these  officials, FTEs are typically the primary measure they use in managing  and reporting on DOD\u2019s civilian workforce. For example, Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-11, which provides guidance on the  preparation of the President\u2019s budget, uses FTEs as the main measure  for the size of an agency\u2019s civilian workforce in certain contexts. As a  result, OUSD Comptroller chose to use civilian FTEs and military average  strength\u2014which is the closest approximation to FTEs for military  personnel\u2014for the purpose of assessing compliance with section 955\u2019s  savings requirement, rather than reporting savings in the cost of the  civilian workforce compared to savings in military basic pay resulting from  reductions in military end strength over the same period, as section 955  requires.", "According to DOD\u2019s reports, it set a goal for achieving compliance with  section 955 of reducing civilian FTEs less exclusions from fiscal year  2012 through fiscal year 2017 by the same amount, in percentage terms,  as military average strength over the same period. As of DOD\u2019s February  2015 report, this goal amounts to approximately a 7.0 percent reduction in  the civilian workforce from fiscal years 2012 through 2017. As discussed  above, under section 955, DOD is permitted to exclude spending on  certain portions of the civilian and contractor workforces from the required  reductions. In its February 2015 report, DOD reported that of its  approximately 776,000 civilian FTEs in fiscal year 2012, approximately  538,000 civilian FTEs, or about 69 percent, are covered by an exclusion.  The approximately 7.0 percent reduction needed to match the reduction  in military average strength applies to the remaining 238,000 civilian  FTEs. In its February 2015 report, DOD reported that it had reduced  civilian FTEs by 15,448 through fiscal year 2014, and has planned for an  additional reduction of about 789 FTEs through fiscal year 2017.  Together, these actual and planned FTE reductions represent a reduction  of 6.8 percent from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2017, compared to the  7.0 percent reduction in military average strength over the same period  DOD set as its goal for achieving compliance with section 955.", "Civilian FTEs and military average strength by themselves, however, may  not be reliable measures of the cost of the civilian personnel workforce  and military personnel basic pay, which section 955 requires DOD to use  in measuring the savings it is to achieve. As shown in table 3, from fiscal  year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, DOD\u2019s total civilian personnel costs  increased by 2.9 percent in current year (non-inflation-adjusted) terms  even as total civilian FTEs decreased. In constant (inflation-adjusted)  terms, total civilian personnel costs decreased, though not as much as  civilian FTEs. As a result, reductions to civilian FTEs may not achieve  commensurate savings, and larger FTE reductions may be required in  order for DOD to achieve the savings required by section 955.  Additionally, reductions in spending on military basic pay may have been  more or less than reductions in military average strength over this period,  depending on whether inflation-adjusted figures are used. As a result,  using reductions in spending on military basic pay resulting from  reductions in military end strength as its benchmark for savings, as  section 955 requires, could mean that, depending on the treatment of  inflation, either a smaller or larger reduction could be required for DOD to  achieve the savings required by section 955 than if DOD were to continue  to use reductions in military average strength as its benchmark. The  effect of this difference over the period from fiscal years 2012 through  2016 is shown in table 3.", "OUSD Comptroller and military service officials told us that they do not  normally project civilian or military personnel costs beyond the budget  year, and therefore this information is not typically available. However,  they also noted that it may be possible to estimate costs for the purpose  of section 955 compliance. For example, some military service officials  said they were able to estimate the cost associated with positions  excluded under section 955, which, if subtracted from the total funding for  the civilian workforce, could be used to help estimate the amount of  savings under section 955. In addition, an OUSD Comptroller official  indicated military basic pay spending could be estimated based on budget  year basic pay rates and projected strength levels.", "Standards for Internal Control for the Federal Government note that  agencies need operational and financial data to determine whether an  agency is achieving its compliance requirements under various laws and  regulations, monitor performance, and allocate resources. Because  DOD\u2019s focus has been on making and reporting FTE reductions, not cost  savings as required by 955, DOD and Congress do not have information  on the extent to which the reductions will achieve savings, and DOD may  risk falling short of the statutory requirement for cost savings in the civilian  workforce."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Had Made the Majority of Required Reductions to Contractor Workforce Spending, but a Planned Increase in Fiscal Year 2016 Poses a Challenge to Achieving Required Savings", "paragraphs": ["Its September 2014 report indicated that DOD was on track to complete a  majority of the reduction in spending on the contractor workforce required  to meet its stated goal by fiscal year 2017.

Between fiscal years 2014 and 2016, however,  DOD budgeted for an increase in contractor workforce spending of about  $1.2 billion. If carried out, this will mean that about half the reduction to  contractor workforce spending through fiscal year 2017 that DOD has  identified as its goal remains to be made.", "An OUSD Comptroller official told us that the increase in spending on the  contractor workforce between fiscal years 2014 and 2016 was driven by a  number of different needs, including additional requirements for facilities  maintenance and contracted services to support readiness and training  needs. In addition, the official stated that complying with spending  limitations under section 808 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012, rather  than section 955, has been a main focus of their efforts to limit spending  on the contractor workforce in recent years. This was in part because,  while section 955 requires that a certain level of savings be achieved by  fiscal year 2017, section 808 was a recurring requirement for fiscal years  2012 through 2015, and has been a main focus for those years. The  official also explained that the contracted services spending reported by  DOD is volatile in part because some categories of contract services,  such as maintenance of facilities and equipment, can be deferred based  on the department\u2019s needs and available resources, including statutory  limitations on spending such as sections 808 and 955.", "Section 955 requires DOD to report on the savings achieved in each of its  annual status reports and that, in any case in which savings fall short of  the annual targets, the report shall include an explanation of the reasons  for the shortfall.

Specifically, we reviewed DOD instructions  governing the roles and responsibilities of the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD Comptroller), Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD P&R),  and the military services. We interviewed knowledgeable officials from the  OUSD Comptroller, USD P&R, and Department of the Army, Navy, and  Air Force offices with responsibility for section 955. We discussed roles,  responsibilities, information, and assumptions involved in preparing the  plan and DOD reports. Additionally, we had discussions with OUSD  Comptroller, USD P&R, and service officials to determine what guidance  was provided to DOD to implement the plan, as described in its  September 2014 report, consistent with workforce-management laws.  Also, we provided written questions to each of the services to obtain their  perspectives on the roles, responsibilities, information, and assumptions  involved in preparing their proposed reductions.", "Further, we requested documentation on the assumptions and data used  to compile the September 2014 report and budget justification materials  accompanying the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2016. We  requested documentation on DOD guidance to address section 955  requirements, but DOD officials said there were not aware of any  documentation. We therefore relied on interviews with DOD and service  offices to obtain this information. To determine the extent to which DOD  met the requirements specified in section 955 of the NDAA for fiscal year  2013, we analyzed DOD\u2019s September 2014 report and February 2015  report and compared them to the statutory requirements in section 955.  We conducted this assessment with two analysts independently reviewing  DOD\u2019s September 2014 report using a scorecard methodology and  assigned a score to determine whether the document (1) addresses, (2)  partially addresses, or (3) does not address the statutory requirements.  The analysts then met to resolve any differences in their respective  independent analyses.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has achieved the cost savings  required under section 955 and identified the savings in its September  2014 report and February 2015 report, we reviewed and analyzed the  civilian and contractor workforce reductions identified in these reports and  associated budget documents. To assess DOD\u2019s progress towards its  goal for civilian full-time equivalent (FTE) reductions, we calculated,  based on DOD\u2019s February 2015 report, (1) the FTE reduction that  occurred from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2014, the most recent  year for which actual values are available, and (2) the additional reduction  that DOD has planned through fiscal year 2017. We then compared the  percentage reduction in civilian FTEs from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year  2017 to the percentage reduction in military average strength over the  same period.", "To assess the extent to which reductions in civilian FTEs may result in the  required savings to the civilian workforce, as well as the extent to which  reductions in military average strength result in a similar reduction to  military basic pay, we reviewed DOD budget data on each data series for  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and calculated (1) the annual percentage  change from year to year, and (2) the overall percentage change during  this period. We then compared the relationships between (1) civilian FTEs  and personnel costs\u2014both drawn from DOD\u2019s annual Operations and  Maintenance overview submitted to Congress as part of its budget  justification, and (2) military average strength as reported in the section  955 report and military basic pay as reported in DOD and service budget  documents. In comparing these relationships, we used both current year  (non-inflation-adjusted) and fiscal year 2012 constant (inflation-adjusted)  dollars for civilian personnel costs and military basic pay. To produce the  inflation-adjusted figures, we used the following deflators, as published by  DOD in its National Defense Budget Estimates for Fiscal Year 2016: for  civilian compensation, the \u201cCivilian Pay\u201d deflator; for civilian benefits, the  \u201cTotal Excluding Pay, Fuel, and Medical\u201d deflator; for military basic pay,  the \u201cMilitary Pay\u201d deflator.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress towards its goal for the contractor workforce,  we calculated the planned percentage reduction to military average  strength from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 that DOD included  in its status report accompanying the fiscal year 2016 budget. Using that  percentage reduction, we calculated the reduction that would be required  to achieve an equivalent percentage reduction in contractor workforce  spending. We then calculated, based on the data provided by DOD in its  report and related documentation, (1) the reduction that has occurred  from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2014, the most recent year for  which actual values are available; (3) the additional increase that DOD  has planned through fiscal year 2016, the latest year for which DOD  provides contractor workforce spending data; and (4) any shortfall  between the required reductions and DOD\u2019s actual and planned  reductions through fiscal year 2017. To the extent that our analysis  identified a shortfall, we interviewed OUSD Comptroller officials to  understand the reasons for the shortfall. We also interviewed OUSD  Comptroller officials about how and why they chose the goals and data  that were included in their reports, as well as alternative approaches to  collecting the data required by section 955.", "According to OUSD Comptroller officials, the data on military, civilian, and  contractor workforces included in their 955 reports and budget materials  are based on data from the Comptroller Information System and Program  Resources Collection Process. We determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on and analyzing  reductions to the civilian workforces. Specifically, we reviewed previous  GAO reports that used workforce data, reviewed DOD instructions on the  preparation and entering of this data, compared military and civilian  personnel and funding to other data published by DOD, and discussed  the reliability of the data with OUSD Comptroller officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to December  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
