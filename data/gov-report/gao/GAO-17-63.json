Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) is one tool that can assist federal leaders in  anticipating and managing risks, as well as considering how multiple risks  in their agency can present even greater challenges and opportunities  when examined as a whole. Risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives  with the potential for either a negative outcome or a positive outcome or  opportunity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines ERM  as an effective agency-wide approach to addressing the full spectrum of  the organization\u2019s significant internal and external risks by understanding  the combined impact of risks as an interrelated portfolio, rather than  addressing risks only within silos. An example of an agency enterprise  risk is unfilled mission critical positions across the entire organization that  when examined as a whole could threaten the accomplishment of the  mission.", "We first issued our risk management framework in 2005 related to  homeland security efforts for assessing threats and taking appropriate  steps to deal with them.

Our objectives were to (1) update our risk  management framework to more fully include evolving requirements and  essential elements for federal ERM, and (2) identify good practices that  selected agencies were taking that illustrate those essential elements. We  also considered views of subject matter specialists with current  experience in ERM. See appendix I for the list of subject matter  specialists who advised us in our review of the practices.", "To adapt our 2005 risk management framework to focus on ERM, we  identified essential elements needed to execute ERM and assist agencies  as they implement and sustain their ERM programs that are generally  consistent with other commonly used ERM frameworks, such as the ISO  31000 Risk Management Principles and Guidelines and the 2004 COSO  Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework.

As such, ERM is a decision-making tool that allows leadership to  view risks from across an organization\u2019s portfolio of responsibilities. ERM  recognizes how risks interact (i.e., how one risk can magnify or offset  another risk), and also examines the interaction of risk treatments  (actions taken to address a risk), such as acceptance or avoidance. For  example, treatment of one risk in one part of the organization can create  a new risk elsewhere or can affect the effectiveness of the risk treatment  applied to another risk. ERM is part of overall organizational governance  and accountability functions and encompasses all areas where an  organization is exposed to risk (financial, operational, reporting,  compliance, governance, strategic, reputation, etc.).", "In July 2016, OMB updated its Circular No. A-123 guidance to establish  management\u2019s responsibilities for ERM, as well as updates to internal  control in accordance with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. OMB also updated Circular No. A-11, Preparation,  Submission, and Execution of the Budget in 2016 and refers agencies to  Circular No. A-123 for implementation requirements for ERM. Circular  No. A-123 guides agencies on how to integrate organizational  performance and ERM to yield an \u201centerprise-wide, strategically-aligned  portfolio view of organizational challenges that provides better insight  about how to most effectively prioritize resource allocations to ensure  successful mission delivery.\u201d The updated requirements in Circulars A- 123 and A-11 help modernize existing management efforts by requiring  agencies to implement an ERM capability coordinated with the strategic  planning and strategic review process established by the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), and with the internal control  processes required by the FMFIA and in our Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. This integrated governance  structure is designed to improve mission delivery, reduce costs, and focus  corrective actions towards key risks.", "More specifically, Circular No. A-123 discusses both internal control and  ERM and how these fit together to manage agency risks. Our Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government describes internal control  as a process put in place by an entity\u2019s oversight body, management, and  other personnel that provides reasonable assurance that objectives  related to operations, compliance, and reporting will be achieved, and  serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding assets. Internal  control is also part of ERM and used to manage or reduce risks in an  organization. Prior to implementing ERM, risk management focused on  traditional internal control concepts to managing risk exposures. Beyond  traditional internal controls, ERM promotes risk management by  considering its effect across the entire organization and how it may  interact with other identified risks. Additionally, ERM also addresses  other topics such as setting strategy, governance, communicating with  stakeholders, and measuring performance, and its principles apply at all  levels of the organization and across all functions.", "Implementation of OMB circulars is expected to engage all agency  management, beyond the traditional ownership of A-123 by the Chief  Financial Officer community. According to the A-123 Circular, it requires  leadership from the agency Chief Operating Officer (COO) and  Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) or other senior official with  responsibility for the enterprise, and close collaboration across all agency  mission and mission-support functions. The A-123 guidance also  requires agencies to create a risk profile that helps them identify and  assess risks arising from mission and mission-support operations, and  consider those risks as part of the annual strategic review process.  Circular A-123 requires that agencies\u2019 risk profiles include risks to  strategic, operations, reporting and compliance objectives.", "A federal interagency group of ERM practitioners developed a Playbook  released through the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) and the  Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) in July 2016 to provide federal  agencies with a resource to support ERM.

As  mentioned previously, our 2005 risk management framework was  developed in the context of risks associated with homeland security and  combating terrorism. However, increased attention to ERM concepts and  their applicability to all federal agencies and missions led us to revise our  risk framework to incorporate ERM concepts that can help leaders better  address uncertainties in the federal environment, changing and more  complex operating environments due to technology and other global  factors, the passage of GPRAMA and its focus on overall performance  improvement, and stakeholders seeking greater transparency and  accountability. For many similar reasons, the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) initiated an effort to  update its ERM framework for 2016, and the International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) plans to update its ERM framework in 2017.  Further, as noted, OMB has now incorporated ERM into Circulars A-11  and A-123 to help improve overall agency performance.", "We identified six essential elements to assist federal agencies as they  move forward with ERM implementation. Figure 1 below shows how  ERM\u2019s essential elements fit together to form a continuing process for  managing enterprise risks. The absence of any one of the elements  below would likely result in an agency incompletely identifying and  managing enterprise risk. For example, if an agency did not monitor risks,  then it would have no way to ensure that it had responded to risks  successfully. There is no \u201cone right\u201d ERM framework that all organizations  should adopt. However, agencies should include certain essential  elements in their ERM program.", "Below we describe each essential element in more detail, why it is  important, and some actions necessary to successfully build an ERM  program.  1.  Align the ERM process to agency goals and objectives. Ensure  the ERM process maximizes the achievement of agency mission and  results. Agency leaders examine strategic objectives by regularly  considering how uncertainties, both risks and opportunities, could  affect the agency\u2019s ability to achieve its mission. ERM subject matter  specialists confirmed that this element is critical because the ERM  process should support the achievement of agency goals and  objectives and provide value for the organization and its stakeholders.  By aligning the ERM process to the agency mission, agency leaders  can address risks via an enterprise-wide, strategically-aligned portfolio  rather than addressing individual risks within silos. Thus, agency  leaders can make better, more effective decisions when prioritizing  risks and allocating resources to manage risks to mission delivery.  While leadership is integral throughout the ERM process, it is an  especially critical component of aligning ERM to agency goals and  objectives because senior leaders have an active role in strategic  planning and accountability for results.  2.  Identify risks. Assemble a comprehensive list of risks, both threats  and opportunities, that could affect the agency from achieving its  goals and objectives. This element of ERM systematically identifies  the sources of risks as they relate to strategic objectives by examining  internal and external factors that could affect their accomplishment. It  is important that risks either can be opportunities for, or threats to,  accomplishing strategic objectives. The literature we reviewed, as well  as subject matter specialists, pointed out that identifying risks in any  organization is challenging for employees, as they may be concerned  about reprisals for highlighting \"bad news.\"   Risks to objectives can often be grouped by type or category. For  example, a number of risks may be grouped together in categories  such as strategic, program, operational, reporting, reputational,  technological, etc. Categorizing risks can help agency leaders see  how risks relate and to what extent the sources of the risks are  similar. The risks are linked to relevant strategic objectives and  documented in a risk register or some other comprehensive format  that also identifies the relevant source and a risk owner to manage the  treatment of the risk. Comprehensive risk identification is critical even  if the agency does not control the source of the risk. The literature and  subject matter specialists we consulted told us that it is important to  build a culture where all employees can effectively raise risks. It is  also important for the risk owner to be the person who is most  knowledgeable about the risk, as this person is likely to have the most  insight about appropriate ways to treat the risk.   3.  Assess risks. Examine risks considering both the likelihood of the  risk and the impact of the risk on the mission to help prioritize risk  response. Agency leaders, risk owners, and subject matter experts  assess each risk by assigning the likelihood of the risk\u2019s occurrence  and the potential impact if the risk occurs. It is important to use the  best information available to make the risk assessment as realistic as  possible. Risk owners may be in the best position to assess risks.  Risks are ranked based on organizational priorities in relation to  strategic objectives. Risks are ranked based on organizational  priorities in relation to strategic objectives. Agencies need to be  familiar with the strengths of their internal control when assessing  risks to determine whether the likelihood of a risk event is higher or  lower based on the level of uncertainty within the existing control  environment. Senior leaders determine if a risk requires treatment or  not. Some identified risks may not require treatment at all because  they fall within the agency's risk appetite, defined as how much risk  the organization is willing to accept relative to mission achievement.  The literature we reviewed and subject matter specialists noted that  integrating ERM efforts with strategic planning and organizational  performance management would help an organization more  effectively assess its risks with respect to the impact on the mission.   4.  Select risk response. Select a risk treatment response (based on  risk appetite) including acceptance, avoidance, reduction, sharing, or  transfer. Agency leaders review the prioritized list of risks and select  the most appropriate treatment strategy to manage the risk. When  selecting the risk response, subject matter experts noted that it is  important to involve stakeholders that may also be affected, not only  by the risk, but also by the risk treatment. Subject matter specialists  also told us that when agencies discuss proposed risk treatments,  they should also consider treatment costs and benefits. Not all  treatment strategies manage the risk entirely; there may be some  residual risk after the risk treatment is applied. Senior leaders need to  decide if the residual risk is within their risk appetite and if additional  treatment will be required. The risk response should also fit into the  management structure, culture, and processes of the agency, so that  ERM becomes an integral part of regular management functions. One  subject matter specialist suggested that maximize opportunity should  also be included as a risk treatment response, so that leaders may  capture the positive outcomes or opportunities associated with some  risks.   5.  Monitor Risks. Monitor how risks are changing and if responses are  successful. After implementing the risk response, agencies must  monitor the risk to help ensure that the entire risk management  process remains current and relevant. The literature we reviewed also  suggests using a risk register or other comprehensive risk report to  track the success of the treatment for managing the risk. Senior  leaders and risk owners review the effectiveness of the selected risk  treatment and change the risk response as necessary. Subject matter  specialists noted that a good practice includes continuously  monitoring and managing risks. Monitoring should be a planned part  of the ERM process and can involve regular checking as part of  management processes or part of a periodic risk review. Senior  leaders also could use performance measures to help track the  success of the treatment, and if it has had the desired effect on the  mission.   6.  Communicate and Report on Risks. Communicate risks with  stakeholders and report on the status of addressing the risks.  Communicating and reporting risk information informs agency  stakeholders about the status of identified risks and their associated  treatments, and assures them that agency leaders are managing risk  effectively. In a federal setting, communicating risk is important  because of the additional transparency expected by Congress,  taxpayers, and other relevant stakeholders. Communicating risk  information through a dedicated risk management report or integrating  risk information into existing organizational performance management  reports, such as the annual performance and accountability report,  may be useful ways of sharing progress on the management of risk.  The literature we reviewed showed and subject matter specialists  confirmed that sharing risk information is a good practice. However,  concerns may arise about sharing overly specific information or risk  responses that would rely on sensitive information. Safeguards should  be put in place to help secure information that requires careful  management, such as information that could jeopardize security,  safety, health, or fraud prevention efforts. In this case, agencies can  help alleviate concerns by establishing safeguards, such as  communicating risk information only to appropriate parties, encrypting  sensitive data, authorizing users' level of rights and privileges, and  providing information on a need-to-know basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emerging Good Practices Are Being Used at Selected Agencies to Implement ERM", "paragraphs": ["We identified six good practices that nine agencies are implementing that  illustrate ERM\u2019s essential elements.

The CRO role includes leading  the ERM process; involving those that need to participate and holding  them accountable; ensuring that ERM reviews take place regularly;  obtaining resources, such as data and staff support if needed; and  ensuring that risks are communicated appropriately to internal and  external stakeholders, among other things. For example, at TSA, the  CRO serves as the principal advisor on all risks that could affect TSA\u2019s  ability to perform its mission, according to the August 2014 TSA ERM  Policy Manual. The CRO reports directly to the TSA Administrator and the  Deputy Administrator.
