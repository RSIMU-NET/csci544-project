Since 1980, the number of active participants in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insured single employer DB plans has dropped from 27.3 percent of all national private wage and salary workers in 1980, to about 15 percent in 2002, and more recently the PBGC has assumed billions of dollars in unfunded benefit obligations from bankrupt plan sponsors. Some analysts have identified hybrid DB plans like cash balance (CB) plans as a possible means to revitalize this declining system. However, conversions from traditional DB plans to CB plans have sometimes been controversial because of the effect conversions may have on the benefits of workers of different ages. As House and Senate committees consider comprehensive pension reform legislation that includes efforts to resolve uncertainties about CB plans, GAO was asked to (1) review current research about the implications of CB conversions for employee benefits, (2) describe the prevalence and type of transition provisions used to protect workers' benefits in past CB conversions, and (3) estimate the effects of CB conversions on the benefits of individual participants under a hypothetical conversion to a typical CB plan from a typical traditional DB plan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Current pension and economic literature provides little conclusive evidence about the effects of CB plan conversions on benefits. In many cases, data and other methodological issues (e.g., sampling methods) limit the generalization of results. Nonetheless, cash balance research indicates that the effects of a conversion depend on many factors, including the generosity of the CB plan, transition provisions that might limit any adverse effects on current employees, and firm-specific employee demographics. CB plan conversions are posited to have distributional effects on expected pension wealth: younger, more mobile workers usually benefit while older workers with long job tenure are likelier to experience a loss, particularly if they are nearly eligible for early retirement. GAO's analysis of a representative sample of plan conversions determined that most conversions occurred between 1990 and 1999 and primarily in the manufacturing, health care, finance and insurance industries. Most conversions set participants' opening account balances equal to the present value of benefits accrued under the previous plan, although the interest rate used to calculate the balance varied around the 30-year Treasury bond rate. Most plans provided some form of transition provisions to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a conversion on workers' expected benefits for at least some employees. About 47 percent of all conversions grandfathered at least some of the employees into the former traditional DB plan. In most cases, grandfathering eligibility was limited to employees meeting a specified minimum age and/or years of service. GAO's simulations of the effects of conversions on pension benefits show that in conversions from a traditional DB plan to a typical CB plan, most workers, regardless of age, would have received greater benefits under the DB plan. Unless grandfathered into the former plan, older workers experience a greater loss of expected benefits than younger workers. Further, in comparing a typical CB plan to a terminated FAP plan, all vested workers would do better under the CB plan. Also, in conversions from a traditional DB plan to a CB plan of equal cost to the sponsor and more generous than the typical CB plan, while more workers at age 30 have benefit increases under the CB plan, this was not true for those at age 40 and 50. Moreover, in comparing a equal cost CB plan to a terminated FAP plan, again all vested workers would do better under the CB plan. Finally, GAO's comparisons focusing on the lifetime present value of benefits did not change the basic findings of GAO's analysis of monthly benefits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s private defined benefit (DB) pension system, a key  contributor to the financial security of millions of American workers and  their families, is in long-term decline. The number of single employer DB  plans has declined dramatically over the past several decades, from over  95,000 in 1980 to less than 35,000 in 2002, with the number of active  participants in such plans dropping from 27.3 percent of all national  private wage and salary workers in 1980, to about 15 percent in 2002.  Structural problems in industries like airlines, steel, and auto parts have  led to large bankrupt firms terminating their DB plans, with thousands of  workers losing some of their benefits and saddling the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) with billions of dollars in unfunded benefit  guarantees. In response, several congressional committees have proposed  comprehensive pension reform legislation that, among other issues, would  address the underfunding of single employer defined benefit plans.", "Some analysts have identified hybrid DB plans like cash balance (CB)  plans as a possible means to revitalize this declining system. CB plans are  referred to as hybrid plans because legally they are DB plans but contain  certain features that resemble defined contribution plans. Similar to  traditional DB plans, CB plans use a formula to determine pension  benefits. However, unlike traditional final average pay (FAP) plans that  pay retirement benefits on the basis of an annuity amount calculated using  years of service and earnings, CB plans express benefits as a hypothetical  individual account balance that is based on pay credits (percentage of  salary or compensation) and interest credits, rather than an annuity.", "In the late 1990s, many pension plan sponsors converted their traditional  final average pay plans to CB plans. Conversions to CB plans have been  controversial because of the effect they may have on pension benefits of  workers of different ages and years of service. In particular, CB plan  conversions can sometimes result in so-called \u201cwearaway\u201d situations  where some workers do not earn additional pension benefits while other  workers continue to do so. The legality of CB plans has recently been  questioned in a court ruling regarding whether a CB plan is age  discriminatory. Employers report this legal uncertainty has made CB plan  conversions less popular than in the past. In 2000, we reported on the  implications of conversions to CB plans and recommended legislative and  executive agency actions to address the regulatory uncertainty concerning  CB plans and to improve disclosure to affected participants.", "In response to the problems facing the DB system, committees in both the  House and the Senate have recently proposed legislation that would  address many issues facing defined benefit plans, including the legal  uncertainty regarding the formation of new CB plans or the conversion of  traditional DB plans to CB plans. To help in your deliberations, you asked  us to provide information on the incidence, features, and effects of CB  plan conversions. More specifically, you asked: (1) What does the current  research say about the implications of CB plan conversions for workers\u2019  benefits? (2) What is the prevalence and types of transition provisions  provided to protect workers\u2019 benefits in past conversions to CB plans? (3)  How do individual participants fare under a hypothetical conversion to a  typical CB plan compared to the typical FAP plan? On September 1, 2005,  and again on October 12, 2005, we briefed your staff on the results of our  analysis. This report formally conveys the information provided during  those briefings. (See app. I).", "To determine the results of current research, we conducted a review of  academic and business literature regarding CB plans and the conversion of  traditional DB plans to CB plans. To identify the prevalence and types of  transition provisions in CB plans, we worked with the 2001 Form 5500 to  identify and examine CB plan conversions for their design features. We  first identified all 843 plans with 100 or more participants that indicated a  CB or hybrid plan component on Form 5500. We then  selected a random  sample of 205 of these plans. Our sample was comprised of the 45 largest  plans (the smallest of which has about 17,500 participants) and a random  sample of 160 other plans. Of these 205 plans, we identified 31 large plans  and 102 smaller plans as conversions from traditional DB plans to CB  plans. (For our methodology, see apps. II, III and IV.)", "To analyze the effects of a CB plan conversion on individual workers, we  used a pension policy microsimulation model (PENSIM). PENSIM  simulates lifetime retirement benefits for over 100,000 participants in the  1955 birth cohort. We calculated and compared monthly retirement  income for workers from the 1955 birth cohort who are projected to be  alive at age 68, and vested in a job covered by a typical FAP plan that is  converted to a CB plan. The model allows comparison of benefits received  from CB plans and ongoing traditional FAP plans, as well as terminated  FAP plans.", "We conducted four simulations:  typical CB plan versus typical FAP plan,  typical CB plan versus terminated FAP plan,    equal cost CB plan versus typical FAP plan, and    equal cost CB plan versus terminated FAP plan.", "Plan characteristics for the traditional FAP plan and typical CB plan were  based on Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) employee compensation and  benefit data, our analysis of CB conversions as designated in the 2001  Form 5500 data base and discussions with industry actuaries and  consultants knowledgeable about CB plans and DB plans generally. We  developed the features of our equal cost CB plan by starting with the  design features of the typical CB plan and then increasing both the base  pay credit and the weighted pay credits (a percentage of pay that increases  as an employee\u2019s age and/or years of service increase) until the cost was  equivalent with a traditional FAP plan with a workforce of identical  actuarial, demographic, and labor market characteristics. (See slides 19 to  25 in app. I.) We conducted our work between September 2004 and  September 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "In summary, we found the following:    The pension and economic literature provides little conclusive  evidence about the effects on benefits and other aspects of CB plan  conversions, particularly with regard to why sponsors convert to CB  plans in the first place. (See slides 9 and 10.) In many cases, data and  other methodological issues (e.g., sampling methods) limit the  generalization of results. The effects of a conversion depend on a  variety of factors including the generosity of the CB plan itself,  transition provisions that might limit any adverse effects on current  employees, and firm-specific employee demographics. CB plan  conversions are posited to have distributional effects on expected  pension wealth: younger, more mobile workers usually benefit while  older workers with long job tenure are more likely to experience a loss,  particularly if they are near the age and service requirements for early  retirement. Less research is available on the actual benefit  distributional effects of such conversions, e.g., how participants are  likely to fare under a CB plan compared to the traditional DB plan that  is being replaced.", "Our analysis of plan conversions determined that most conversions  occurred between 1990 and 1999, and primarily in the manufacturing,  health care, finance and insurance industries. Most conversions set  participants\u2019 opening account balances equal to the present value of  their accrued benefits under the previous plan, although the interest  rate used to calculate the balance varied plus or minus 1 percent of the  30-year Treasury bond rate. (See slides 11 to 18.) The use of interest  rates above the 30-year Treasury rate is more likely to result in a  wearaway situation, unless otherwise mitigated. Most plans provided  some form of transition provisions to mitigate the potential adverse  effects of a conversion on workers\u2019 expected benefits for at least some  employees. About 47 percent of all conversions used some form of  grandfathering that was applied to at least some of the employees in  the former traditional DB plan. In most cases, grandfathering  eligibility was limited to employees meeting a specified minimum age  or years of service or both. Most conversions also used some form of  ongoing weighted pay credit.", "Our comparison of a typical FAP plan that is converted to a typical CB  plan finds that, regardless of a worker\u2019s age, more workers would have  received greater benefits under the FAP than under the typical CB  plan. (See slides 26 to 28.) For workers who receive less under the CB  conversion, median benefit decreases range from $59 per month at age  30 to $238 per month at age 50. For the workers who receive more  under the conversion, median benefit increases range from $15 per  month at age 30 to $27 per month at age 50. Those who experience  either benefit increases or decreases are more likely to be men, except  for those at the age 50 conversion, where they are more likely to be  women.", "In comparing a conversion to a typical CB plan with a terminated FAP,  all vested workers would do better under the CB plan. Median monthly  benefits increase at conversion ages 30, 40, and 50, with increases  ranging from $150 per month for conversions at age 30 to $305 per  month for conversions at age 50. (See slides 29 to 30.) The increase in  benefits for older workers is because grandfathered benefits are  included in these results.  Although the analysis focuses on vested  workers at the time of conversion, under a terminated FAP plan, by law  all previously unvested workers (those with less than 5 years service)  are immediately vested.", "Under a traditional FAP plan conversion to an equal cost CB plan,  larger numbers of workers at all ages have benefit increases than under  the typical CB plan/FAP plan scenario. (See slides 33 to 35.)  Grandfathering again protects the benefits of those older workers who  were covered. However, while more workers who are converted at age  30 fare better under the CB plan, this was not true at other ages. A key  factor is the greater generosity of the equal cost CB plan compared to  the typical CB plan we also simulated. Under the equal cost scenario,  median reductions range from $75 per month for conversions at age 30  to $128 per month for conversions at age 50, while median increases  range from $90 per month for conversions at age 30 to $29 per month  for conversions at age 50. For all conversion ages, those with longer job  tenure and who are not covered by grandfathering protections are  more likely to lose than those workers with shorter tenure. At each  conversion age, a greater percentage of those who are more likely to  experience benefit increases are men rather than women.", "In comparing a conversion to an equal cost CB plan with a terminated  FAP plan, again all vested workers do better under the CB plan. Median  increases range from $283 per month for conversions at age 30 to $396  per month for conversions at age 50. (See slides 36 to 37.) The increase  in benefits for older workers comes about because grandfathered  benefits are included in these results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis illustrates one of the difficult choices facing the Congress in  crafting comprehensive DB pension reform legislation, including the  controversial issues surrounding the legal status of CB plans, and  particularly CB conversions. The current confusion concerning CB plans is  largely a consequence of the present mismatch between the ongoing  developments in pension plan design and a regulatory framework that has  failed to adapt to these designs. Although CB plans legally are DB plans,  they do not fit neatly within the existing regulatory structure governing DB  plans. This mismatch has resulted in considerable regulatory uncertainty  for employers as well as litigation with potentially significant financial  liabilities. For many workers, this mismatch has raised questions about the  confidence they may have in the level of income they expect at retirement,  confidence that has already been shaken by the termination of large  pension plans by some bankrupt employers.", "CB plans may provide more understandable benefits and larger accruals to  workers earlier in their careers, advantages that may be appealing to a  mobile workforce. However, conversions of traditional FAP plans to CB  plans redistribute benefits among groups of workers and can result in  benefits for workers, particularly those who are longer tenured, that fall  short of those anticipated under the prior FAP plan. Our simulations  suggest that grandfathering plan participants who are being converted can  protect those workers\u2019 expected benefits, and, in fact, such protections, in  some form, are fairly common in conversions. Our simulations also show  that without such mitigation, many workers can receive less than their  expected benefits when converted from a traditional FAP plan, even in  cases where the CB plan is of equal cost to the FAP plan it is replacing. As  a result, as we noted in our 2000 report, additional protections are  needed to address the potential adverse outcomes stemming from the  conversion to CB plans. For example, requirements for setting opening  account balances could protect plan participants, especially older  workers, from experiencing periods of no new pension accruals after  conversion while other workers continue to earn benefits.", "Our simulated comparison of CB plans with the termination of a FAP plan  leads to several important observations. First, the immediate vesting of all  unvested workers requirement in a plan termination actually leads to a  greater number of workers getting some retirement benefits and highlights  the portability limitation of DB plans. Workers in an ongoing DB plan only  receive benefits if they are vested. Appealing to a mobile workforce would  seem to place an even greater significance on pension portability. Yet even  CB plans, which often feature lump sum provisions in their design, do not  address this issue because they typically have similar vesting requirements  as traditional FAPs.", "In our simulations, vested workers under either a typical or equal cost CB  plan still fare better than if the FAP plan is terminated. We note further  that some sponsors of CB plans have already exited the DB system, a  system that has been declining in sponsorship and participation for several  decades now. There is a crucial balance between protecting workers\u2019  benefit expectations with unduly burdensome requirements that could  exacerbate the exodus of plan sponsors from the DB system. Congress, as  it grapples with the broader components of pension reform, has the  opportunity not only to protect the benefits promised to millions of  workers and eliminate the legal uncertainty surrounding CB plans that  employers face, but also to craft balanced reforms that could stabilize and  possibly permit the long-term revival of the DB system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the departments of Labor, Treasury,  and the PBGC.

However, the 22  percent cost reduction estimated in this study and the 19 percent cost  reduction estimated in the Watson Wyatt study are not comparable  because of differences in the Watson Wyatt life history simulations, which  ignore disability events, and therefore, underestimate the cost of the FAP  plans. To make our estimates comparable to the Watson Wyatt estimates,  we subtracted the 0.487 percent disability costs from 7.545 percent  yielding a without-disability employer cost estimate for the typical FAP  plan of 7.058 percent. Our estimate of the immediate cost of the typical CB  plan is 5.870 percent, which is about 17 percent below the 7.058 percent  without-disability estimate.
