GAO found that they all offer training and educational programs and activities to help participants understand security and military matters and to enhance their knowledge, skills, and experiences in these matters. However, there are notable differences in that the Regional Centers generally focus on helping foreign participants understand and respond to regional security issues; generally target a foreign civilian and military personnel audience; and offer shorter and typically less formal courses of study. The Regional Centers support DOD policy objectives with curricula designed to enhance security and foster partnerships through education and exchanges. By contrast, other DOD training and education organizations focus their curricula on military operations and leadership. While the Regional Centers' target audience is foreign civilian and military officials, the other DOD educational organizations typically aim their programs and activities at U.S. servicemembers at all career levels. Regional Center participants generally do not earn credit toward a degree, and the offered courses, conferences, and workshops are of shorter duration ranging from days to weeks. DOD's professional military education and advanced degree-conferring institutions are accredited and generally offer longer, more formal courses that provide participants the opportunity to earn advanced degrees.", "DOD has taken some steps to enhance its oversight of the Regional Centers' plans and activities, but its ability to determine whether the Regional Centers are achieving departmental priorities remains limited because it has not developed an approach for assessing progress. DOD has defined roles and responsibilities, issued relevant guidance that reflects departmental objectives, and established a governance body and planning process to facilitate information sharing and to achieve more integrated decision making. However, DOD has not developed an approach that includes measurable goals and objectives, metrics for assessing performance, or a methodology to assess the Regional Centers' progress in achieving DOD priorities, to include clarifying how it will use performance data provided by the Regional Centers. GAO's prior work has found that achieving results in government requires a comprehensive oversight framework that includes clear goals, measurable objectives, and metrics for assessing progress, consistent with the framework established in the Government Performance and Results Act. The Regional Centers report various types of performance data, such as summaries of past activities. While DOD has established a governance body to assist in monitoring the Regional Centers' plans and activities, the body has not identified how it will use performance information to assess the Regional Centers' progress toward achieving department priorities. Conducting routine assessments using measurable goals and objectives, with metrics to evaluate progress, and a methodology for using performance information to include defining the role of the governance body would provide DOD a sounder basis for assessing the Regional Centers' progress in achieving results, and for better determining the allocation of resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop measurable goals linked to key programming priorities for the Regional Centers, metrics for assessing performance against these goals, and a methodology to assess the Regional Centers' progress in achieving DOD priorities.

Termed \u201cbuilding partner capacity,\u201d  this approach, according to DOD officials, represents the way to reduced  long-term U.S. presence while protecting the territory of other nations.  The strategic guidance stated that a fiscally constrained environment will  require innovative, low-cost, and small-footprint activities toward building  partner capacity. These activities include training, educating, and  assisting foreign countries\u2019 civilian and military personnel in becoming  more proficient at defense-related decision making, providing security to  their populations, and protecting their resources and territories.", "As part of the department\u2019s efforts to build partner capacity, DOD relies  on its Regional Centers for Security Studies (Regional Centers) to  coordinate with the geographic combatant commands in developing  training and educational programs around the globe to enhance security,  deepen foreign officials\u2019 understanding of the United States, and foster  bilateral and multilateral partnerships. In addition to the Regional Centers,  DOD and the Department of State (State) offer other programs and  activities to provide training and education to foreign military and civilian  personnel. These include, among other programs and activities, officer  exchange programs, educational opportunities at U.S. professional  military schools, and programs designed to assist foreign nations with  building more effective defense institutions. In fiscal year 2012, the  Regional Centers obligated approximately $101.4 million.

Specifically, we have found instances in  which DOD had not consistently defined measures to evaluate progress,  and in which reporting on the progress and effectiveness of some  defense capacity-building activities had been limited. For example, in  2012 we reported that because the National Guard\u2019s State Partnership  Program did not have agreed-upon goals or metrics, DOD could not  assess progress toward achieving program goals. Our work has  emphasized how, among other things, setting clear goals can help  stakeholders understand what defense capacity-building programs seek  to accomplish, and how establishing mechanisms to evaluate progress  can help ensure that programs have long-term impact.

For example, the Asia- Pacific Center for Security Studies administers a Comprehensive Security  Responses to Terrorism course designed to broaden knowledge and  improve skills in assessing terrorism threats in the Asia-Pacific region and  to develop a community of professionals to collaborate on regional and  global issues. Another example is the Africa Center\u2019s African Executive  Dialogue, which brings together African and U.S. senior officials to  discuss how African countries can work together and with external  stakeholders on Africa\u2019s key security challenges.

For  example, the National Defense University administers a Combating  Terrorism Strategies and Policies course in which students examine the  ongoing challenge to U.S. national security posed by the threat of  international terrorism and the ways in which the United States is  attempting to prevent future terror attacks. The advanced degree- conferring institutions focus on instructing U.S. military professionals on  security-related knowledge and skills, such as operations research,  logistics, and information system management.

In 2012, 82 percent of the participants at the  five Regional Centers were civilians or members of the military from other  countries. According to officials and participants with whom we spoke, the  preponderance of foreign participants provide U.S. participants with the  unique experience of being in the minority during the discussion of U.S.  security policy decisions and their impacts around the world. Further,  officials stated that the Regional Centers intentionally invite executive- level civilian officials as well as representatives from nongovernmental  organizations, international organizations, and the private sector to  ensure a broad, whole-of-government audience. Past participants of the  Africa Center for Strategic Studies have included six current and former  heads of state.", "By contrast, professional military education and advanced degree- conferring institutions are primarily attended by members of the U.S.  military at all career levels.

In 2005,  DOD designated the DSCA director as the executive agent for the  Regional Centers and assigned it the responsibility for programming,  budgeting, and management of the resources necessary to support  their operation and providing them with needed staffing.", "Guidance: OUSD Policy issues guidance to the Regional Centers that  assigns priorities to them reflecting national security and departmental  objectives. For example, in January 2013, OUSD Policy issued fiscal  year 2013 guidance incorporating policy priorities identified in DOD\u2019s  January 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance, and instructing the  Regional Centers to address those priorities as they plan and execute  programs. DSCA issues planning guidance that requires the  Regional Centers to develop program plans to meet the OUSD Policy  priorities within their projected funding baseline and existing  authorities. The fiscal year 2014-2015 guidance states that each  Regional Center\u2019s program plan, among others requirements, should  include a cover letter signed by the Regional Center director or  program manager, background and concept papers for core program  and significant events, a completed 2-year budget submission, and a  list of efficiency initiatives to be implemented. Further, DOD Directive  5200.41 states that the Regional Centers are required to develop and  implement their activities according to guidance from the geographic  combatant commanders.", "Governance body and planning process: In December 2011, DOD  established a governance body within OUSD Policy, called the  Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Board, that  provides guidance for and monitoring of the Regional Centers\u2019  activities and plans. According to DOD officials, OUSD Policy  established the board intending to facilitate coordination and  information sharing among different OUSD Policy offices, and to  achieve more integrated decision making on policies, plans,  programs, and budgets. DOD officials told us that before the board\u2019s  establishment, each Regional Center reported to its respective OUSD  Policy stakeholders, and the opportunity for broader information  sharing was minimal. The board\u2019s activities include, in 2011,  establishing a 16-month planning process to guide how the board and  OUSD Policy stakeholders will provide guidance and oversee the  development of plans and activities of the Regional Centers. As  shown in figure 2, key steps in the planning cycle include  identifying priorities and providing guidance to the Regional  Centers; providing a means with which the Regional Center directors can  update stakeholders on prior-year activities and future-year plans;  coordinating proposed Regional Center program plans with OUSD  Policy offices, the geographic combatant commands, and the  board; and  reviewing Regional Centers\u2019 budgets and program plans.", "In 2010, OUSD Policy tasked the Regional Centers with developing a  comprehensive set of measures of effectiveness by which progress  toward objectives could be assessed. In November 2010 the Regional  Centers submitted a plan.", "Thereafter, OUSD Policy contracted with the RAND Corporation to  review the November 2010 plan. In September 2011, RAND  concluded that the measures of effectiveness identified in the plan  had some weaknesses. RAND recommended that the Regional  Centers develop a more comprehensive set of metrics and proposed  a framework for developing them.", "On the basis of the results, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense Board concluded that further study was needed.  Therefore, in July 2012, OUSD Policy contracted with RAND to  conduct a study to evaluate the effect of the Regional Centers and to  determine their contribution toward fulfilling OUSD Policy strategy  objectives. DOD expects RAND to publish a final report in September  2013. According to OUSD Policy officials, they believe the RAND  study will provide additional insights into the metrics or indicators that  could be used to evaluate the Regional Centers\u2019 performance.", "We recognize and have previously reported that it is difficult to establish  performance measures for outcomes that are not readily observable and  that in some cases systematic, in-depth program evaluation studies may  be needed in addition to performance measures. Such program  evaluation studies are conducted periodically and include context in order  to examine the extent to which a program is meeting its objectives.  Further, our prior work has shown that performance measures should  focus on core activities that would help managers assess whether they  are achieving organizational goals.", "OUSD Policy has not established a methodology for assessing the  Regional Centers\u2019 progress in achieving DOD priorities, to include  clarifying how it will use performance data provided by the Regional  Centers and clearly identifying the role of its governance board in the  assessment process.

In its comments, DOD noted that our  recommendation should take into account that a process already exists  for Regional Center program development and approval, which requires  the Regional Centers to identify specific program goals that meet policy  objectives. DOD further noted that the department recognized the need to  improve the identification of measurable goals and objectives, metrics, or  other indicators of performance, and is already taking steps to address  this issue.

First, we researched U.S.  government programs, activities, and initiatives providing training and  education to foreign civilian and military individuals. We reviewed two  U.S. government reports that provided comprehensive information on  training and education provided to foreign civilian and military  professionals: the Interagency Working Group on U.S. Government- Sponsored International Exchanges and Training fiscal year 2011 Annual  Report; and the Foreign Military Training Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011  Joint Report to Congress. The Interagency Working Group Annual  Reports provide a review of activities over a given fiscal year and they  include the previous fiscal year\u2019s inventory of programs detailing the  scope of federal international exchanges and training. The Foreign  Military Training Report is jointly completed by DOD and the Department  of State (State) and provides information on all military training provided  to foreign military personnel by DOD and State during the previous fiscal  year and all such training proposed for the current fiscal year. In addition,  we reviewed the Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management\u2019s  The Management of Security Cooperation (Green Book); the Defense  Security Cooperation Agency\u2019s fiscal year 2013 Budget Request; and  Army Regulation 12-15, Joint Security Cooperation Education and  Training. The Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management  Green Book is the publication employed by the institute for instruction  covering the full range of security cooperation and security assistance  activities. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency\u2019s fiscal year 2013  Budget Request identifies specific security cooperation activities  administered by the agency. The Joint Security Cooperation Education  and Training regulation prescribes policies, procedures, and  responsibilities for training international personnel. By reviewing these  documents, we identified a comprehensive inventory of U.S. security  cooperation and security assistance programs that provide training and  education to foreign nationals. Second, we excluded programs that: (1)  did not have national security and policy as their primary focus, or (2)  taught specific skill- or tactical-level training, such as language or flight  training. We then compared these programs against the legislation  establishing the Regional Centers and the DOD directive governing their  activities. On the basis of this comparison, we focused our selection on  the subset of training and education programs and building partner  capacity initiatives that, like the Regional Centers, support DOD priorities  by enhancing security, fostering partnerships, and assisting regional  leaders to develop strong defense establishments. We learned that the  programs identified in these first two steps of our selection process could  be classified in two categories: (1) DOD institutions that provide training  and education and (2) DOD and State programs and authorities that  provide funds for U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to attend these  institutions. Because one of the Regional Centers\u2019 activities is to provide  for education and exchanges by conducting in-residence courses, in- country seminars, and conferences, among other activities, we focused  our next selection step on identifying training and educational program  providers. Third, we completed additional research on DOD institutions  that provide training and education. We conducted a preliminary review of  each institution by reading a description of it, and we again excluded  those that provide tactical-level training on skills not addressed by the  Regional Centers. The team collected additional information about these  institutions by completing online research, reviewing documentation  collected during the engagement, and requesting data and information  from each institution. On the basis of this research and review, we  identified and selected 17 organizations for this analysis; the  organizations are DOD institutions that provide training and education,  but U.S. citizens and foreign nationals that attend these institutions are, in  some instances, funded by DOD and State programs and authorities.  Where applicable, we also analyzed the various schools under each  institution.  1.  Air Force Institute of Technology (part of Air University)  3.  Army Command and General Staff College  4.  Army JFK Special Warfare School  5.  Army War College  6.  Center for Civil Military Relations  7.  Defense Acquisition University  8.  Defense Institute for Medical Operations  9.  Defense Institute of International Legal Studies  10. Defense Resource Management Institute  11. Joint Special Operations University  12. Marine Corps War College  13. National Defense University  14. NATO School  15. Naval Postgraduate School  16. Naval War College  17. Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation  Fourth, we identified which attributes to examine. For this engagement,  we selected three similar areas for comparison\u2014curriculum topics, target  audience, and program type and format. In prior work, GAO has  compared programs by examining various program attributes, such as the  populations targeted, the types of services provided, or the program\u2019s  geographic focus. As the analysis entailed comparing the Regional  Centers to the above 17 selected training and educational providers, we  concluded a review should examine the curriculum offered by each  provider and that the populations targeted and program format attributes  were applicable. We determined that these attributes we selected were  appropriate for comparing training and educational providers because  they explain the curriculum focus of each organization\u2019s primary training  and educational efforts, who they engage in these efforts, and their  method of engagement. The results of our analysis are not generalizable  to DOD training and education programs and activities outside of those  included in the scope of our work.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed and implemented  an approach to oversee the Regional Centers and assess their progress  in achieving DOD priorities, we evaluated relevant documentation and  interviewed knowledgeable officials. Specifically, we reviewed the  legislation establishing the Regional Centers, DOD guidance governing  their activities, and the 2010 and 2011 DOD annual reports to Congress  on Regional Center activities; the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (OUSD) Policy fiscal year 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 policy  guidance and DSCA Fiscal Year 2014-2015 program planning guidance  to the Regional Centers, and the Regional Centers\u2019 program plans  submitted in response; and briefing documents concerning the  establishment of the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  Board. In January 2013 we attended and observed the fourth meeting of  this board. We also reviewed a prior study conducted by the RAND  Corporation, contracted by OUSD Policy, to evaluate the Regional  Centers\u2019 measures-of-effectiveness plan, and met with RAND officials. In  completing site visits to the Regional Centers, we reviewed  documentation relating to their missions, anticipated outcomes,  scheduled and proposed activities, program development processes, and  outreach to alumni. We also observed classes and conferences in  progress and met with international attendees. Additionally, to identify  oversight mechanisms for the Regional Centers, we reviewed key  geographic combatant command documents to include guidance issued  to Regional Centers and theater planning documents, and we interviewed  key command officials. We also referred to our prior work that identifies  elements that constitute a comprehensive oversight framework, and to  prior work that identifies the relationship between performance  management and program evaluation.", "To provide information about the process used by DOD and State to  approve and monitor Regional Center requests to waive reimbursement  of costs for nongovernmental and international organizations that  participate in the Regional Centers\u2019 activities, we reviewed relevant  legislation and DSCA guidance identifying the procedures for submitting  requests and the criteria applied to consideration of waivers for  nongovernmental and international organizations.
