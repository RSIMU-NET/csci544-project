The severity of these consequences underscores the importance of impartially administering justice in order to promote accountability and confidence that such allegations are taken seriously. GAO was asked to address the extent to which (1) the Department of Defense (DOD) conducts oversight of the military services' investigative organizations and (2) the services provide resources for investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents. GAO also identified an issue relating to the military's criminal code during this review. GAO analyzed relevant DOD and service policies and procedures; reviewed applicable laws, including provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice; and interviewed senior DOD and service officials, including a total of 48 judge advocates and DOD civilian lawyers, at the headquarters level and at five selected military installations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) developed a policy on sexual assault prevention and response. In June 2006, OSD published DOD Instruction 6495.02, which specifies that the DOD Inspector General's Office shall develop policy and oversee sexual assault investigations and related training for the DOD criminal investigative organizations. However, the Inspector General's Office has not performed these responsibilities, primarily because it believes it has other, higher priorities. For example, GAO found no evidence of Inspector General oversight at the service level for any of the 2,594 sexual assault investigations that DOD reported the services completed in fiscal year 2010. Without a policy and plan for conducting oversight, the Inspector General's Office will remain limited in its ability to help ensure consistency and accountability, and that training is being conducted in the most effective manner. Consistent with the Secretary of Defense's priorities for sexual assault prevention and response, each service provides various resources to support investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents. Specifically, each service has provided personnel who advise and assist on investigations and adjudications of sexual assault incidents. Each service's investigative and legal organizations also received funding, above their operating budgets, for efforts to enhance investigations and adjudications of sexual assault. For example, in fiscal year 2009, Army investigators received $4.4 million to redesign training on sexual assault investigations. However, the services' investigative and legal organizations are not fully capitalizing on opportunities to leverage each other's expertise and limited resources. For example, the Secretary of Defense, as part of the Base Realignment and Closure process, recommended that the services' investigative organizations co-locate to achieve operational synergies. However, the services currently have no plan for using opportunities such as the co-location--a move that has cost over $426 million and reportedly saved about $53 million for infrastructure support from fiscal years 2006 through 2011--to better leverage expertise and limited resources. Judge advocates also collaborate on some initiatives, but do not have a plan for leveraging resources either. Without a plan, the services cannot help ensure that resources are sustained and efficiencies are maximized. GAO met with judge advocates who consistently expressed concerns, similar to those noted in a 2009 Defense Task Force report, that a 2007 amendment to Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice complicates sexual assault prosecutions and may be causing unwarranted acquittals. Specifically, judge advocates stated that there is a lack of clarity with regard to the meaning of certain terms in the amended article, which makes it more difficult to prosecute these cases. Further, recent opinions issued by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces addressed constitutional issues that may arise related to the burden of proof in certain situations. For fiscal year 2012, DOD proposed revisions to Congress intended to remedy some of these issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD develop policy and provide oversight for sexual assault investigations and related training, and for the services to develop a plan to better leverage expertise and limited resources.

The military services\u2019 handling of alleged sexual assault  incidents is particularly important because it promotes good order and  discipline, demonstrates a commitment to accountability, and helps to  engender confidence that such allegations are taken seriously. According  to judge advocates from each of the military services, the administration  of justice in sexual assault cases is often complicated by the limited  availability of forensic evidence and by conflicting testimonial accounts by  the parties involved. In light of the unique challenges that arise while  investigating and adjudicating these types of cases, a vigilant approach is  vital in order to help ensure the proper administration of justice and to  send the appropriate message to servicemembers regarding sexual assault  prevention and response in the military services.", "Since 2004, Congress has passed various legislative provisions related to  the military services\u2019 investigation and adjudication of sexual assault  incidents. For example, provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 required the Department of  Defense (DOD), among other things, to develop a comprehensive policy  that covers topics such as the investigation of alleged sexual assault  incidents, and to conduct a review of how sexual assault offenses are  covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Additionally, we have  conducted a number of reviews to help inform congressional deliberations  on issues related to sexual assault in the military. In 2008, we issued two  reports that generally address the prevention of and response to sexual  assault: the first, issued in January, addresses sexual assault at the DOD  and Coast Guard academies, and the second, issued in August, addresses  sexual assault in the military and Coast Guard services. In February 2010  we reported on DOD and Coast Guard efforts to strengthen the  implementation and oversight of their respective sexual assault prevention  and response programs, and on the status of their efforts to implement the  recommendations made in our August 2008 report. As a supplement to  these reports, we testified three times before the Subcommittee on  National Security and Foreign Affairs, House Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, on our findings. A list of these and other related GAO  products is included at the end of this report.", "In October 2009, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2010 included a mandate for GAO to review various aspects of the  military services\u2019 investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual  incidents involving servicemembers. In October 2010, we satisfied our  mandate by providing the House and Senate Committees on Armed  Services with a briefing that detailed our observations. The House Armed  Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel requested that we build on  the observations in our briefing to include an assessment of how the  military services\u2019 investigative and legal policies and procedures are being  implemented at military installations. This report responds to the  Subcommittee\u2019s request and expands on our observations of the military  services\u2019 investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual assault  incidents. Specifically, it addresses the extent to which (1) DOD is  conducting oversight of the military services\u2019 investigative organizations  assault  and (2) the military services provide resources for investigations and  adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents. During the course of our  review, we identified an additional issue regarding revisions to the  Uniform Code of Military Justice that may be complicating the  adjudication of alleged sexual assault incidents.", "For our first objective, we reviewed and analyzed Office of the Secretary  of Defense (OSD) and DOD Inspector General policies, guidance, and  procedures to identify department-level oversight responsibilities for the  military criminal investigative organizations. We also reviewed and  analyzed each of the service\u2019s investigative policies and procedures to  identify the extent to which similarities and differences exist in their  respective processes for conducting sexual assault investigations. Further,  we interviewed senior officials in OSD, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s  Office, and the military services to gain their perspectives on  responsibilities for and oversight of the military criminal investigative  organizations, and how the services\u2019 investigative policies and procedures  compare. For our second objective, we reviewed OSD, DOD Inspector  General, and the military services\u2019 policies to identify responsibilities and  processes for providing personnel and fiscal resources for investigations  and adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents. We obtained and  analyzed budget information from OSD and the military services to  determine the extent and consistency of funding that has been provided to  enhance investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual assault  incidents. We also interviewed OSD, DOD Inspector General, and senior  military service officials to obtain their perspectives on the provision of  resources for investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual incidents.  To address the additional issue regarding a 2006 revision to Article 120 of  the Uniform Code of Military Justice, we reviewed the text of the statute  and the corresponding sections of the Manual for Courts-Martial that  were effective before and after the amendment. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s  fiscal years 2011 and 2012 legislative proposals for amending Article 120 in  order to understand DOD\u2019s concerns with the current version of Article  120. We also interviewed senior officials from OSD and a total of 48 judge  advocates and DOD civilian lawyers at the services\u2019 headquarters and at  five selected installations to gain their perspectives on the impact of the  amended Article 120 on adjudications of sexual assault cases.

All  members of the armed forces are subject to the Uniform Code of Military  Justice, including the punitive articles that define specific offenses. The  punitive articles include offenses similar to those found in civilian criminal  law (e.g., murder, rape, wrongful use of controlled substances, larceny,  and drunken driving) as well as other offenses that specifically affect good  order and discipline in the military (e.g., absence without leave, disrespect  toward superior commissioned officer, or dereliction of duty).", "When a servicemember is accused of an offense such as sexual assault,  military criminal investigators, commanding officers, and military  lawyers\u2014known as judge advocates\u2014have responsibilities related to the  investigation and adjudication of the alleged criminal conduct.

Each organization has criminal  investigators who are responsible for interviewing witnesses, alleged  victims, and suspects, and gathering physical evidence. These  investigators present the results of the completed investigation to the  commanding officer of an accused servicemember for disposition. Military  commanding officers are responsible for good order and discipline in their  commands, and they have a number of judicial and administrative options  at their disposal. Commanding officers have access to judge advocates  who may advise throughout the process of determining an appropriate  disposition for an alleged offense, but ultimately, commanding officers are  accountable for disposing of allegations of offenses in a timely manner and  at the lowest appropriate level of disposition using one of the following  options:    No action: A commanding officer may decide to take no action.", "Administrative action: A commanding officer may elect to take  administrative actions, which include corrective measures such as  counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disapproval,  criticism, censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military instruction, the  administrative withholding of privileges, or any combination of the  above.", "Nonjudicial punishment: Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military  Justice allows for a number of disciplinary actions, or \u201cnonjudicial  punishments,\u201d that are more serious than corrective measures taken in  an administrative action, but less serious than a trial by court-martial.  Nonjudicial punishments include admonition, reprimand, reducing a  member\u2019s grade, forfeiture of pay, adding extra duty, and imposing  restrictions on freedom.", "Court-martial: This option provides for the most severe punishments,  including death, prison time, forfeiture of pay and allowances,  reduction in rank, and punitive separation from military service.  Commanders may choose from three types of courts-martial\u2014 summary, special, or general.

For example, OSD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office provided the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force  with nearly $3 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to support service  efforts to enhance training for trial counsel on the prosecution of sexual  assault cases. Each of the services used this and other service-level  funding to implement training initiatives for judge advocates handling  sexual assault cases. For example, the Army judge advocate office used  the $2.1 million it received from the Army\u2019s Sexual Harassment/Assault  Response and Prevention program in fiscal year 2010 for the improvement  of sexual assault litigation efforts, including conducting seven conferences  led by subject matter experts who trained Army prosecutors on the  litigation of special victim sexual assault cases. The Navy\u2019s judge advocate  office used a portion of the $350,000 that it received from OSD\u2019s Sexual  Assault Prevention and Response Office in fiscal year 2009 to provide a  course at the Naval Justice School for Navy and Marine prosecutors on  handling complex sexual assault cases. In addition, the Navy\u2019s judge  advocate office used some of its general program funds to send defense  counsel to the defense-specific portions of this sexual assault litigation  course. The Air Force\u2019s judge advocate office used nearly half of the $2.3  million provided to the services by OSD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office in fiscal year 2009 to develop joint training on sexual  assault prosecution for each of the service\u2019s trial counsel. Separate Air  Force funds were also applied to the development of this joint training  program, which includes modules on collaborating with criminal  investigators, case strategy, and working with victims, among other topics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Investigative Organizations and Judge Advocate Offices Are Not Maximizing Opportunities to Leverage Expertise and Limited Resources", "paragraphs": ["The services have taken positive steps to enhance investigations and  adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents, but they have not fully  capitalized on existing opportunities to leverage each other\u2019s expertise and  limited resources. Our prior work has shown that by exploring ways to  collaborate, including leveraging resources, organizations can obtain  additional benefits that would not have been available if they were  working separately. Recognizing the potential to achieve such benefits,  the Secretary of Defense recommended, as part of the 2005 Base  Realignment and Closure process, that the services\u2019 investigative  organizations colocate to Marine Corps Base Quantico. According to the  justification set out by the Secretary of Defense in the Base Realignment  and Closure Commission\u2019s report, the co-location would produce  operational synergies by locating entities with similar or related missions  in one place. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission  subsequently adopted a modified version of the Secretary\u2019s  recommendation. However, senior officials from each service\u2019s  investigative organization told us that there are currently no plans to use  opportunities such as this co-location to develop joint initiatives, including  advanced-level training on investigating sexual assaults, that could allow  the services to better leverage each other\u2019s expertise and limited resources  to achieve the operational synergies noted by the Secretary of Defense.  Further, the services reported in their fiscal year 2012 budget justifications  to Congress that the co-location efforts have cost over $426 million, and  produced a total of about $53 million in savings from fiscal years 2006 to  2011, which were derived, in part, through the reduction in costs to  support infrastructure. An additional $5.6 million in net annual recurring  savings is projected after this co-location is completed in fiscal year 2011.  However, as we have previously reported, we believe that DOD\u2019s net  annual recurring savings estimates may be overstated because they  include savings from eliminating military personnel positions without  corresponding decreases in end strength. The low amount of savings  estimated relative to the high cost of implementing the initiative  underscores the importance of continued efforts by the services to  maximize and extend the cost saving once the co-location is completed by  September 2011.", "Like investigators, judge advocates perform similar responsibilities that  are based on a common set of legal principles. During our review, senior  officials in the judge advocate general offices told us that the services\u2019  judge advocates regularly communicate on issues such as sexual assault  and collaborate, where appropriate. For example, in fiscal year 2010, the  services collaborated to develop an interactive training program that uses  a simulated court-martial trial for a sexual assault offense to develop and  test judge advocates\u2019 competence at each stage of the trial. While this is a  positive step toward better leveraging of each other\u2019s expertise and  resources, the services have no formal plan to help ensure that such  efforts will be sustained. Without such plans for mutually leveraging  resources, the efficiencies to be achieved from efforts such as a co- location will be limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Expressed Concerns with Article 120 Revisions", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our review, service judge advocates consistently told  us that a 2007 revision to Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military  Justice, the article encompassing most sexual assault crimes, has  complicated the process for adjudicating sexual assault incidents.  Concerns about the 2007 revision have also been raised by the 2009  Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in the Military Services and the  Joint Service Committee on Military Justice. Additionally, the Court of  Appeals for the Armed Forces has recently issued opinions addressing  issues with the application of Article 120.", "The Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2005 directed the Secretary of Defense to review the Uniform Code of  Military Justice and the Manual for Courts-Martial in order to determine  what changes were required to improve the ability of the military justice  system to address issues related to sexual assault, and to conform those  authorities more closely to other federal laws and regulations that address  such issues. The Secretary of Defense subsequently submitted a report,  as required, on the review that included proposed revisions as well as the  rationale for those revisions. Following that review, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 amended Article 120, effective  October 1, 2007. Among other things, the amendment brought certain  types of sexual misconduct into the category of sexual assault, including  indecent assault, indecent acts or liberties with a child, indecent exposure,  and indecent acts with another, which were previously addressed by the  Uniform Code of Military Justice\u2019s General Article, Article 134.", "In a December 2009 report, the Defense Task Force on Sexual Assault in  the Military Services recommended a review of the effectiveness of Article  120 after learning that practitioners had concerns with the revised article.  According to the report, the task force noted that significant issues had  evolved related to lesser included offenses as well as the Constitutionality  of Article 120. The task force also reported that practitioners consistently  advised its members that the new Article 120 is cumbersome and  confusing, and stated that prosecutors had expressed concern that the  new Article may be causing unwarranted acquittals. Although the task  force did not elaborate on these issues, judge advocates consistently  expressed similar concerns to us during the course of our work. For  example, service judge advocates told us that there is a lack of clarity with  regard to the meaning of certain terms in the amended article, which  makes it more difficult to prosecute these cases. Moreover, recent  opinions issued by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces addressed  issues that were raised in our discussions with judge advocates, including  constitutional issues that may arise related to the burden of proof in  certain situations.", "Subsequently, the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice, which  includes representatives from each of the military service\u2019s judge advocate  offices, completed a review in fiscal year 2010 in response to the task  force\u2019s 2009 recommendation and submitted to Congress proposed  amendments to Article 120 along with the rationale for the proposed  revisions. Among other changes, the revisions they proposed would have  split Article 120 into three parts: rape and sexual assault of any person,  rape and sexual assault of a child, and other sexual misconduct. According  to the committee\u2019s proposal, the suggested language would have simplified  the statutory treatment of consent, simplified definitions overall, and  reduced the number of offenses. Section 561 of a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (S. 3454) contained  language that would have amended Article 120 consistent with the  committee\u2019s proposal. However, that bill was not enacted. In April 2011,  DOD submitted a new proposal for revisions to Article 120 as part of the  legislative proposals provided to Congress in conjunction with the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2012 spending request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that sexual assault crimes undermine the core values of the military  services and degrade mission readiness, the effective and efficient  administration of military justice for addressing these offenses is essential  to the maintenance of good order and discipline in the armed forces, and  consequently contributes to the national security of the United States. The  inherent complexities of administering justice in sexual assault cases  requires the focused attention of DOD and service personnel in order that  the investigations and adjudications are properly conducted. DOD and the  services have taken a series of positive steps toward enhancing the  investigations and adjudications of alleged sexual assault incidents.  However, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office has not instituted oversight  of criminal investigations or established comprehensive guidance for  conducting sexual assault investigations\u2014both of which are requirements  specified in DOD\u2019s sexual assault prevention and response policy. If these  issues are not addressed, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office will not be  poised to help ensure that a consistent and effective approach is being  applied to sexual assault investigations across the services. Further, the  current budgetary environment may jeopardize the sustainability of  funding for DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 initiatives to enhance investigations  and adjudications of sexual assault, and until a plan is developed to  leverage resources and generate operational synergies among the  respective offices, DOD will not be in the best position to help support the  continuation of these efforts.

The DOD Inspector  General\u2019s Office further added that it is currently coordinating with the  military services to develop overarching policy guidance on sexual assault  investigations that will address the responsibilities of military  commanders and the services\u2019 criminal investigative organizations that are  critical for successfully responding to sexual assault investigations.

Further, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office noted that it is currently in  discussions with the services to develop a peer review\u2013type process that  will provide oversight of the services\u2019 criminal investigative organizations,  including sexual assault investigations. In addition, the DOD Inspector  General\u2019s Office noted that during fiscal year 2012, it plans to initiate an  evaluation of sexual assault training provided to criminal investigators  within DOD.", "However, while the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office agreed with our  recommendations and described actions it plans to take in response, in its  comments it stated that our draft report mischaracterized its performance  of its responsibilities. We disagree with this statement and believe our  report accurately reflects oversight exercised by the DOD Inspector  General\u2019s Office. Our report is solely focused on the DOD Inspector  General\u2019s Office responsibilities for developing policy and conducting  oversight of sexual assault investigations. Specifically, we reviewed DOD  Inspector General\u2019s Office policies related to criminal investigations,  including the five it notes in its comments, and our report credits the DOD  Inspector General with developing some guidance on the general conduct  of criminal investigations that has relevance to investigations of sexual  assault. Further, we recognize that the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office  initiated other efforts related to sexual assault during our review,  including hosting forums, that it notes in its comments, facilitated the  development of standardized definitions for sexual assault investigation  reporting requirements. However, as we note in our report and it concurs  with in its response, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office has not developed  a policy or a process to monitor and evaluate sexual assault investigations  and related training, as is specified in DOD guidance. Further, we disagree  with the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office comment that investigative  policies and procedures are the same for all criminal investigations,  including those conducted on incidents of sexual assault. DOD has  established policies specific to sexual assault incidents, such as restricted  reporting, which necessitates that first responders, including criminal  investigators, distinguish how they respond to sexual assault incidents.  Additionally, we reiterate that Congress, in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, directed the development of a  comprehensive policy to address sexual assault\u2013specific matters in a  variety of areas, to include investigations of sexual assault complaints.  Finally, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office is correct in noting that it  completed five evaluations from 2003 through 2011 related to sexual  assault in the military; however, none of these evaluations were self- initiated but rather were conducted at the direction of others, such as  Congress. For all of these reasons, we maintain that our report accurately  reflects the extent to which the DOD Inspector General\u2019s Office has  performed its designated policy development and oversight  responsibilities for sexual assault investigations.", "In concurring with our third recommendation that the service secretaries  develop a plan for leveraging each other\u2019s resources and expertise for  investigating and adjudicating alleged sexual assault incidents, DOD noted  that representatives from each service\u2019s criminal investigative organization  currently meet on a regular basis to share best practices, collaborate, and  leverage each other\u2019s expertise. The department further noted that as part  of the co-location of the services\u2019 criminal investigative organizations at  Quantico, Virginia, the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Command has  volunteered to lead this working group in the development of a plan for  leveraging each service\u2019s resources and expertise for investigating sexual  assaults.
