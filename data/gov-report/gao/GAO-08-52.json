Regarding project-level practices, it has established an IT investment board that is responsible for defining and implementing the department's business systems investment governance process, has developed procedures for identifying and collecting information about its business systems to support investment selection and control, and has assigned responsibility for ensuring that the information collected during project identification meets the needs of the investment management process. However, Air Force has not fully documented business systems investment policies and procedures for directing investment board operations, selecting new investments, reselecting ongoing investments, or integrating the investment funding and investment selection processes. In addition, it has not implemented any of the policies and procedures for developing and maintaining a complete business system investment portfolio. Air Force officials stated that they are aware of the absence of documented policies and procedures in certain areas of project-level and portfolio-level management and that they are currently working on guidance to address these areas. For example, officials stated that they had begun drafting portfolio-level policies and procedures. According to Air Force officials, the policies and procedures are expected to be completed and approved by December 2007. Until Air Force fully defines policies and procedures for both individual projects and portfolios of projects, it risks not being able to select and control these business system investments in a way that is consistent and complete, which in turn increases the chances that these investments will not meet mission needs in the most effective manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems.

Specifically, Stage 2 encompasses building a sound  investment management foundation by establishing basic capabilities for  selecting new IT projects. This stage also involves developing the  capability to control projects so that they finish predictably within  established cost and schedule expectations and developing the capability  to identify potential exposures to risk and put in place strategies to  mitigate that risk. Further, it involves evaluating completed projects to  ensure they meet business needs and collecting lessons learned to improve  the IT investment management process. The basic management processes  established in Stage 2 lay the foundation for more mature management  capabilities in Stage 3, which represents a major step forward in maturity,  in which the agency moves from project-centric processes to a portfolio  approach, evaluating potential investments by how well they support the  agency\u2019s missions, strategies, and goals.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options.
