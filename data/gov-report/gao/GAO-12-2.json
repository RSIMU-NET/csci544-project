TANF and child welfare programs provide cash assistance and other services that support children living with nonparent caregivers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) oversees TANF and child welfare programs, which are administered by states. GAO was asked to examine the (1) trends and composition of the child-only caseload, (2) characteristics of caregivers and children in nonparent child-only cases, (3) factors influencing the level of benefits and services for children with non-parent caregivers, and (4) coordination efforts between state TANF and child welfare programs. GAO analyzed federal TANF and child welfare data; surveyed states; interviewed HHS officials and researchers; and conducted site visits in Tennessee, Texas, and Washington, selected for variation in TANF caseload characteristics and implementation of programs to support relative caregivers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, TANF child-only cases increased slightly but represented a greater share of the overall TANF caseload because cases with adults in the assistance unit experienced a significant decline. The national composition of the TANF child-only caseload has remained relatively unchanged since 2000. At the end of 2010, the majority of children receiving TANF lived with parents who were ineligible for cash assistance, and one-third lived with nonparent caregivers who were relatives or unrelated adults. However, this composition varies by state. For example, in Tennessee, almost 60 percent of the TANF child-only caseload included children living with nonparent caregivers, compared with about 30 percent in Texas. Most nonparent caregivers in TANF child-only cases are unmarried women who are over 50 years old, and research suggests that they often have low incomes and health problems. The children tend to be related to their caregiver, who is often a grandparent, and they remain on assistance for at least 2 years. Some of these children live with nonparent caregivers as a result of parental abuse or neglect, substance abuse, incarceration, or mental illness, but these circumstances may or may not be known by the child welfare agency. The level of benefits and services available to children living with nonparents depends on the extent to which a child welfare agency becomes involved in the family's situation and the licensing status of the caregiver. Children in foster care with licensed foster parents are generally eligible for greater benefits and services than children in other living arrangements, who may receive TANF child-only assistance. For one child, the national average minimum monthly foster care payment is $511 while the average TANF child-only payment is $249. Most children live with relatives who do not receive foster care payments because they are not licensed foster parents or they are in informal arrangements without child welfare involvement. Other factors influencing the assistance made available to children in a relative's care include available federal funding, state budget constraints, and increased state efforts to identify relative caregivers to prevent children from being placed in the foster care system. Several state and local efforts are under way to coordinate TANF and child welfare services to better serve children living with relative caregivers, but information sharing is a challenge. Coordination efforts include colocating TANF and child welfare services and having staff from each agency work together to help relative caregivers access services. ACF currently provides grants to states and tribes to support collaboration between TANF and child welfare programs and plans to disseminate the findings. However, information and data sharing between the two programs does not occur consistently, which can hinder relatives' access to available benefits. For example, although HHS provides funding, guidance, and technical assistance to promote data sharing between TANF and child welfare programs, more than half of states reported obstacles to sharing data, such as privacy concerns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the Secretary of HHS direct ACF to provide more guidance on data sharing opportunities. HHS agreed with GAO's recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides  cash assistance and other services to low-income families. Over 40  percent of families receiving TANF cash assistance in 2010 were \u201cchild- only\u201d cases, meaning the adults in the family receive the cash benefit on  behalf of the child, but the needs of the adults are not included in the  calculation of the cash benefit. These cases occur when either the  children\u2019s parents are ineligible for benefits, for example if they are  ineligible due to their immigration status, or the child is living with a  nonparent caregiver, who is either a relative or unrelated adult acting in  place of a parent. Children come into the care of nonparent caregivers for  a variety of reasons, including when the parents are absent due to military  deployment or incarceration, are incapacitated due to substance abuse or  mental illness, or have been determined to be abusive. One of the  purposes of TANF is to provide assistance to needy families so that  children may be cared for in their own homes or the homes of relatives.  Child welfare agencies also aim to keep families together, but when  children must be removed from the home due to abuse or neglect by their  parents, these programs provide financial assistance and services to  support children who live with nonparent caregivers.", "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversees  TANF and child welfare programs and states are responsible for  administering these programs. States have broad discretion in how they  design TANF and child welfare programs, which includes setting available  benefits and services. Although some of the same families may be served  by these programs, they are often administered by different state  agencies and involve different staff and information systems. The extent  to which these programs are coordinated or state agencies share  information is unclear. To address these issues and inform the expected  reauthorization of the TANF program, we examined the: (1) trends in the  TANF child-only caseload and composition of these cases, (2) general  characteristics of the caregivers and children in TANF child-only cases  where a child is living with a nonparent caregiver, (3) factors influencing  the level of benefits and services children living with nonparent caregivers  receive, and (4) coordination efforts between state TANF and child  welfare programs.", "In addition, this report provides information in appendix IV on how states  have implemented the federal guardianship assistance option and what is  known about how it has affected TANF child-only caseloads.", "To answer our research questions, we collected data through several  methods. To gather national level information about how the TANF child- only caseload has changed over time, and the characteristics of nonparent  caregiver cases, we analyzed HHS\u2019s TANF data for fiscal years 2000  through 2008. To collect information about TANF child-only policies, the  current TANF child-only caseload, financial assistance and services  available to children in these cases, and coordination between TANF and  child welfare programs, we conducted a Web-based survey of state TANF  administrators in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We also  conducted a survey of state child welfare administrators in all 50 states and  the District of Columbia to gather information on the financial assistance  and services available to children in foster care, the extent to which  relatives are licensed as foster parents, and coordination efforts between  TANF and child welfare programs. We administered the surveys between  March and June 2011. While we did not validate specific information that  administrators reported through our surveys, we reviewed their responses  and followed up, as necessary, to determine that their responses were  complete, reasonable, and sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. All state TANF and child welfare administrators responded to the  surveys. To collect more detailed information from state and local offices,  we conducted site visits in three states (Tennessee, Texas, and  Washington). Our site visit states were selected because of their variation  in TANF caseload characteristics and programs to assist relative  caregivers. Within each state, we interviewed state TANF and child welfare  administrators, as well as TANF and child welfare staff from two to three  local offices serving urban and rural areas. We cannot generalize our  findings from the site visits beyond the states and local offices we visited.  We also interviewed HHS officials and researchers knowledgeable about  TANF and child welfare programs and reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations. We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 to  October 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The  TANF program gives states the flexibility to develop their own definition of  an eligible family. While some states allow unrelated caregivers acting in  place of a parent to apply for TANF benefits, other states limit benefits to  relative caregivers and parents, according to information contained in the  Urban Institute\u2019s Welfare Rules Database.", "Each state sets its own TANF benefit levels, and the amount a family  receives depends in part on who is in the assistance unit. An assistance  unit is a group of people living together, often related by blood or some  other legal relationship. States can exclude adults from the assistance  unit but still allow the children to receive some assistance. In these child- only cases, the adults in the family are excluded from the assistance unit  and are not considered when calculating the benefit amount. There are  four main types of family circumstances that result in child-only cases:  \uf0b7  SSI parents. A parent is receiving Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) and is receiving TANF child-only payments on behalf of their  children.", "Immigrant parents. A family is headed by an immigrant parent who is  not eligible for TANF. These parents could include illegal immigrants,  as well as certain recent legal immigrants who are ineligible for  TANF. Ineligible immigrants can receive TANF for their children,  provided the children are U.S. citizens.  \uf0b7  Sanctioned or disqualified parents. The parent has not complied with  TANF program requirements, such as work requirements, and has  been denied benefits, but the state allows the children to continue  receiving benefits. States must also disqualify adults from receiving  TANF benefits for other reasons, such as if they are fleeing to avoid a  felony conviction, violating a condition of probation or parole, or in  certain circumstances, fraudulently receiving TANF assistance.  \uf0b7  Nonparent caregivers. A child is living with a family headed by a  nonparent caregiver, often a relative who receives cash assistance on  a child\u2019s behalf. According to HHS, nonparent caregivers may not be  legally obligated to support these children, and states can provide  child-only grants to any relative caring for a child, regardless of the  relative\u2019s income, provided that the relative meets the state\u2019s TANF  definition of a relative caretaker. If the nonparent caregiver chooses  to have their income and resources considered in order to receive a  higher level of assistance, the caregiver may be subject to work  requirements and time limits.", "Families receiving cash assistance with adults in the assistance unit are  subject to federal time limits and work requirements. PRWORA  established a 60-month time limit for families with an adult receiving aid;  however, states have the option to use federal funds to extend assistance  beyond the federal time limit for hardship reasons the state has defined.  PRWORA also requires adults to engage in work activities after 2 years of  assistance, or sooner, if the state determines the recipient is ready.

As a result, the share of child-only cases in the  overall TANF caseload increased from about 35 percent to about half  (see fig. 1). We previously reported that changes states made to their  welfare programs as they implemented TANF, including work  requirements, time limits, sanctions, and diversion policies, contributed  to a significant decline in program participation. TANF cases also  declined in part because during the 1990s when the economy was  stronger, incomes increased, and fewer families were eligible for TANF.  Our past work and survey results indicated that one of the reasons child- only cases may not have declined as much as cases with adults in the  assistance unit is because these cases are not subject to time limits in  most states and recipients may receive assistance for a longer time  period.", "Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, increases in two of the categories  were statistically significant: children living with parents who were  ineligible because they receive SSI benefits and children living with  parents who were ineligible because of their immigration status.

For example, as reported  through our survey, almost 60 percent of TANF child-only cases in  Tennessee included children living with nonparent caregivers, compared  with 31 percent in Texas. In addition, cases that are child-only because  the parent receives SSI comprise 40 percent of the TANF child-only  caseload in Tennessee compared with 10 percent in Texas (see fig. 3).", "Some of the variation in the composition of TANF child-only cases can be  attributed to differences in state demographics and state TANF policies.  For example, parents who were ineligible for TANF due to their  immigration status account for a greater portion of the TANF child-only  caseload in states with relatively large immigrant populations, such as  California and Texas. Our survey found that for the 40 states that  reported data, about one-third of the TANF child-only caseload is  comprised of families in which the parents are ineligible due to their  immigration status compared to more than half of the caseloads in  California and Texas. Another variation among states is how they  determine TANF eligibility for children living with nonparent caregivers.  States with less restrictive eligibility rules may have larger numbers of  nonparent caregiver cases. For example, Washington, which has a  relatively high percentage of nonparent cases, allows unrelated  caregivers, such as a friend or neighbor, to apply for TANF child-only  assistance after undergoing a home study and background check,  according to information provided by state officials.

In other cases, the child welfare agency may be involved after  receiving a report of child abuse or neglect; however, instead of taking  legal custody of the child the agency helps the parent voluntarily place the  child with a relative caregiver.

In Tennessee, a  kinship coordinator is located in every local child welfare office to inform  relative caregivers of their options, according to child welfare staff we  interviewed. Child welfare workers we interviewed in Texas said that in the  past they did not emphasize the option to become licensed, but they have  recently begun a concerted effort to help relatives become licensed so that  they can take advantage of the state\u2019s new subsidized guardianship  program.

To be eligible, the relative caregiver  must be related by blood, marriage, or  adoption, be the child\u2019s primary caregiver, and  agree to an in-home assessment.  Tennessee\u2019s child welfare agency contracts  with community based organizations  throughout the state to operate the program.   The types of assistance available through this  program, which became available statewide in  2006, include information about available  benefits, support groups, respite care,  short-term case management, and start-up or  emergency financial assistance. placements routinely maintain ongoing supervision of the children  removed from their parents\u2019 homes. Families with informal  arrangements made by the parents and other family members to care for  children are typically not involved with the child welfare system, but some  states have developed programs to help these families.", "Children living with relatives receiving TANF child-only payments may be  eligible for other services through the TANF agency, but fewer services  are available compared to the services child welfare agencies provide for  foster children (see fig. 7). According to our survey of state TANF  administrators, TANF agencies in 23 states offer child care assistance to  nonparent caregivers, and 3 states offer respite care. Less than half of  TANF agencies provide case management for TANF child-only cases, so  in a majority of states, TANF agencies are unlikely to have ongoing  contact with the caregiver after eligibility is determined.", "Available federal funding influences the level of assistance states offer  relative caregivers. Thirty-seven states reported in our survey that federal  financing of child welfare services had some influence on the assistance  made available to children in a relative\u2019s care. Title IV-E funding, which  accounts for most of the federal funding dedicated for child welfare  services, is restricted to supporting foster children who live with licensed or  approved foster parents. Specifically, states can only be reimbursed by the  federal government for payments made to support children if, among other  requirements, the children are in foster care, meet income and resource  requirements, and are living with licensed or approved foster parents. In  addition, changes made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 clarified the  amount that states can seek in federal reimbursement for IV-E  administrative costs associated with foster children living with unlicensed  relatives. Many states have used TANF to fund child welfare services  because although TANF funding is a capped block grant, it is a more  flexible funding source. For example, in Texas, 30 percent of the child  welfare agency\u2019s budget was funded with TANF dollars in state fiscal year  2010, according to state officials. However, some states may not be able to  continue relying on TANF to fund child welfare services because they need  to use TANF funds to address other program goals, such as promoting  work. For example, Tennessee officials told us that they previously used  some of their TANF grant to fund enhanced payments for relative  caregivers and their Relative Caregiver Program, but that the state recently  discontinued this practice due to budget constraints.", "In addition to federal funding constraints, 28 states reported that the cost  to the state of serving children in TANF or child welfare programs  influences the supports that are made available. Officials in the three  states we visited described recent budget problems that made it more  difficult to fund supports for children living with relative caregivers.  Tennessee\u2019s Relative Caregiver Program was cut by 15 percent, and the  state limited participation in their Families First Kinship Program to about  90 children, according to state officials. Officials in Texas told us that their  state legislature recently proposed eliminating Texas\u2019 Relative Caregiver  Assistance Program, but that the program was ultimately spared after  state agency officials successfully argued that, without this support, many  relatives would be unable to care for the children, and the state would  incur much higher costs if these children were placed with licensed foster  care providers. In Washington, the state legislature authorized the TANF  agency to begin means-testing child-only applicants to help address the  state\u2019s budget shortfall, according to state officials.", "In addition to federal and state funding constraints, states\u2019 child welfare  reform efforts have affected the types of assistance states offer children  living with relative caregivers. Specifically, 31 states reported in our child  welfare survey that their state\u2019s efforts to place maltreated children with  relatives and prevent entry into foster care had some influence on the  type of assistance made available. For example, Texas implemented a  child welfare reform effort that involved hiring additional CPS staff and  implemented family group decision-making meetings. The state also  began providing more in-home services to parents and increased efforts  to identify relatives when out-of-home care is necessary. These efforts  resulted in significant reductions in the number of children taken into state  custody, an increase in relative placements, and lower costs for the state.  State officials in Tennessee reported implementing a similar child welfare  reform effort, which involved hiring more CPS staff, using family group  decision-making meetings, and improving efforts to identify relatives and  prevent children from entering foster care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination Efforts Between TANF and Child Welfare Programs Can Affect Access to Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Several State and Local Efforts Are Under Way to Coordinate TANF and Child Welfare Programs", "paragraphs": ["Several states have initiated efforts to coordinate TANF and child welfare  programs to better serve children living with relative caregivers. About  two-thirds of states reported in our surveys that state TANF and child  welfare staff meet periodically to work on common areas of concern, such  as state budget or policy issues, and about half of state child welfare  administrators reported working with their state TANF agency to make  additional services available. For example, Washington\u2019s TANF agency  convened various state agencies including child welfare, in part to  improve coordination and help relative caregivers access resources and  services. Tennessee\u2019s TANF and child welfare agency collaborated on a  pilot project to provide an additional payment to supplement the TANF  child-only payment for relative caregivers caring for children who were  determined to be at risk of entering foster care. New York reported in our  survey that the state\u2019s TANF and child welfare agencies worked together  to launch an informational campaign to help relative caregivers access  TANF child-only and child welfare benefits and services.", "States surveyed and local offices we visited reported that various efforts  are also under way at the local level to coordinate services for children  living with relative caregivers. These efforts include colocating TANF and  child welfare services in the same building and working together on case  planning. Thirty-two states reported about half of their child welfare offices  are located in the same building as TANF offices. Some TANF and child  welfare staff from our site visits said colocation facilitated coordination by  allowing staff to more easily contact each other about cases. In addition,  officials from five states\u2014California, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, and  North Carolina\u2014reported having a combined team of TANF and child  welfare staff who work with relative caregivers within their states. In North  Carolina, combined TANF and child welfare units, which provide \u201cone- stop\u201d services, improved communication about families, programs, and  resources with the goal of preventing children from entering foster care.", "Most states cited benefits to coordination between state and local TANF  and child welfare agencies (see fig. 8). States reported that coordination  was most helpful in providing customer service to parents and relative  caregivers, followed by improved decision-making regarding appropriate  services for families and better use of TANF and child welfare staff  resources. For example, Colorado commented in our survey that one  benefit of coordination is maximizing available TANF resources to prevent  children from entering the child welfare system if the family lacks its own  resources.", "To promote coordination between TANF and child welfare programs,  HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families (ACF) provided  approximately $3.5 million per year for five years in grants to states and  tribes. ACF\u2019s Office of Financial Assistance awarded 10 grants to tribes to  test the effectiveness of efforts to coordinate tribal TANF and child  welfare services for tribal families at risk of child abuse or neglect. In  addition, ACF\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau provided grants to 2 states, a tribal  organization, and 2 counties to support collaboration between TANF and  child welfare programs. The purposes of the Children\u2019s Bureau grants are  to: (1) demonstrate models of effective collaboration between TANF and  child welfare agencies that will improve outcomes for children and youth  who are in, or are at risk of entering, the child welfare system; (2)  evaluate and document the processes and outcomes of these  collaborations; and (3) develop identifiable sites that state and local TANF  and child welfare agencies can look to for guidance and possible  replication of collaboration efforts. ACF officials told us they convene  meetings so that grantees can share information about their projects, but  information about the outcomes of these efforts has not been made  available to other states, in part because the demonstration projects and  evaluations are still under way. ACF officials told us that, although  dissemination activities to date have focused on information sharing  among grantees, as grantees complete their work, the agency plans to  disseminate best practices and lessons learned to all states.

A few offices we visited reported holding  regular meetings during which information is shared about the policies of  each program, however, some offices did not report meeting regularly. In  our site visits, some TANF and child welfare staff reported being unaware  of the services offered in each others\u2019 programs and the correct TANF  eligibility rules for relative caregivers. For example, some TANF workers  in Tennessee described instances in which child welfare workers had told  relative caregivers that they were eligible for child care from the TANF  agency, without clarifying that the caregivers must be working and meet  certain income limits to qualify. In Texas and Tennessee, TANF and child  welfare staff at the state and local levels were unaware of services  available to relative caregivers provided by their respective state agencies  on aging.", "In addition to information sharing between state TANF and child welfare  staff, data sharing is another way to help caregivers access benefits and  services. Under Title IV-E, states that receive federal funding to develop  their child welfare information systems\u2014known as statewide automated  child welfare information systems (SACWIS)\u2014are required to the extent  practicable to develop an interface with the information system used by  the state\u2019s TANF program. This interface is intended to allow the  exchange of client data. According to ACF officials, 23 of the 34 state  child welfare systems they formally reviewed have met this requirement,  and 11 state child welfare systems have not met this requirement. ACF  has not reviewed the remaining 17 state child welfare systems because  either the states do not operate SACWIS systems or the systems are still  being developed. Child welfare administrators from 10 of these 17 states  reported in our survey that case information cannot be shared between  the child welfare and TANF information systems. Similarly, less than half  of state TANF administrators responding to our survey reported that their  information systems share data with their state\u2019s child welfare systems,  which would allow them to identify duplicate payments or information on  whether a client is receiving child welfare services (see fig. 9). Some local  TANF workers we spoke to in all three states we visited said they would  like to access information in their state\u2019s child welfare information system  in order to more easily confirm if a child has been removed from their  parents and placed with a relative. Similarly, some local child welfare  workers we interviewed said that their state\u2019s TANF agency often has  more accurate contact information than their office and that this  information could help them locate relative caregivers or parents.", "In addition to providing federal funding for the development of SACWIS,  HHS provides guidance and technical assistance to help states develop  child welfare information systems that can interact with TANF information  systems, but more than half the states report obstacles to sharing  information, such as privacy concerns and technical challenges.  According to HHS officials, federal law should not present a barrier to the  sharing of information between the TANF and child welfare agencies,  although state law may, as states are permitted to determine their own  confidentiality rules. Thirty state TANF administrators and 20 state child  welfare administrators said that concerns about client confidentiality have  prevented them from sharing information in their state. The National  Association of State TANF Administrators, an affiliate of the American  Public Human Services Association, suggested in a recent paper that  more clarification was needed about whether federal laws prohibit states  from sharing information between state TANF and child welfare  agencies. HHS officials indicated they have provided states with  technical assistance on the interface requirement through conferences  and ongoing training.

Coordination among programs that provide  financial assistance and support to these families is one way to ensure  that caregivers are aware of available resources. It will be important for  ACF to follow through with its plans to disseminate information gathered  from its grants about effective collaboration practices so states can have  models to look to for possible replication. Data sharing is another way for  states to help caregivers access assistance. If caseworkers have  automatic access to information about shared clients, they may be able to  make better decisions about what services are needed and accelerate  eligibility determination.
