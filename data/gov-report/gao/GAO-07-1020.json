In addition, all five states we visited had implemented at least some elements of the agreement that need to be carried out on the state level, but faced challenges implementing others. Labor and VA have not developed an implementation plan that includes long-range time frames and benchmarks to measure progress. Further, Labor and VA have not fully assessed state actions to implement the agreement and may not have provided states with sufficient guidance. While VA has mostly implemented its Five-Track employment program for disabled veterans, the employment needs of newly returning veterans may pose challenges. VA officials have completed a pilot study, trained staff, distributed orientation materials, and deployed employment coordinators, but other components remain in process. Some officials expressed concerns that employment programs for disabled veterans--including the Five-Track program--may not be prepared to meet the needs of participants returning from recent conflicts, who VA predicts will be more likely than previous returning veterans to have certain disabilities, such as those associated with traumatic brain injuries. VA has begun efforts to address these needs. VA employment coordinators and job resource labs in the five states we visited provided employment assistance to a limited number of veterans and some of their functions were available elsewhere. Employment coordinators provided direct employment services for veterans and also performed job development and outreach activities. However, employment coordinators we met with provided limited services to veterans outside their local areas, and similar services were available elsewhere. Job resource labs provided some additional resources for veterans, but according to some staff, not many veterans are using the labs.

We also conducted site visits to five states\u2014Alabama,  California (San Diego Region), Illinois, Michigan, and South Dakota\u2014 where we met with VA and Labor staff, state workforce agency officials,  and program participants, and toured job resource labs and one-stop  career centers. We selected a mix of states based on the following criteria:  (1) dispersion across the four VRE geographic areas (Eastern, Central,  Southern, and Western), (2) both pilot and nonpilot sites for the Five- Track program, (3) states with large and small veteran populations, and  (4) states with a history of greater and lesser coordination between VA and  Labor at the state and local levels, which we determined based on input  from Labor and VA officials, veterans\u2019 service organizations, and other  sources.

Their past efforts to coordinate and collaborate have  faced difficulties, however. In 2005, at the recommendation of a VA task  force and encouragement of congressional staff, the two agencies forged a  new memorandum of agreement. In this agreement, the agencies agreed to  share information, including wage data, and establish and maintain  management information systems to enable accurate yearly reporting. The  agreement also called for three joint work groups to develop performance  measures to assess partnership program results, design a training  curriculum, and establish joint data collection, analysis, and reports. In  addition, the agreement outlined means to promote cooperation and  eliminate duplication of efforts between the agencies. These include  developing an approach to serving veterans that involves both VA and  state workforce agency staff from the early stages, advising all VA clients  about the employment services offered by the state workforce agency, and  establishing an effective process for referring VA clients who are seeking  employment to the state workforce agency. While many of the specific  elements of the agreement need to be implemented at a national level  within Labor and VA, other activities, by their nature, would take place on  the state or local level. The agreement provides for separate  memorandums of agreement, containing common goals and measures, to  be executed among Labor, VA, and the states. Table 1 summarizes the key  elements of the national agreement, the specific actions to which Labor  and VA agreed, and the level at which implementation generally would  occur.", "Around the same time the national agreement was signed, VA rolled out  the Five-Track employment program aimed at standardizing rehabilitation  services for veterans with service-connected disabilities and providing a  greater focus on employment options early in the rehabilitation process.  The five employment tracks from which veterans can select are  reemployment with their previous employer, rapid access to employment  through job readiness preparation and training opportunities, self- employment, employment through long-term services that include  education programs and formal training leading to employment, and  independent living services for those who are currently unable to work  due to their disabilities. These tracks were available prior to the rollout,  but the program changed the way they were presented to veterans. The  Five-Track program was piloted in four regional offices starting in October  2004, and a national rollout began in November 2005. Figure 1 describes  the Five-Track model.", "As part of the Five-Track program, VA established the employment  coordinator position and drew up plans to install job resource labs. The  position description for the employment coordinator contains duties  aimed at providing veterans with assistance preparing for and finding  employment. These duties include helping veterans make informed  choices about their employment track, assessing veterans\u2019 readiness to  seek employment, and assisting veterans with job networking,  development, and placement. The position description also includes  responsibilities for marketing the VA program to employers and  developing partnerships with other agencies to assist veterans with  employment services. Also as part of the Five-Track program, VA allocated  funds for each location to install a job resource lab with computers,  Internet access, and other materials for veterans to use in their career  exploration and job search. VA made plans to have employment  coordinators in most of its 57 regions, and a job resource lab in each  regional office and in every satellite location.", "Although the missions of Labor\u2019s VETS and VA\u2019s VRE programs to provide  employment assistance to disabled veterans are similar, the organizational  structure of each is somewhat different. VA administers its VRE programs  through regional offices\u2014roughly one in each state, with multiple offices  in larger states\u2014and its staff are federal employees. The regional offices  have some autonomy in deciding the operations of the office, including  their working relationships with the Labor programs and the state  workforce agency. Labor administers its programs through the Disabled  Veterans\u2019 Outreach Program (DVOP) and the Local Veterans\u2019 Employment  Representative (LVER) program, which are funded by a grant from Labor  to the state workforce agencies. DVOP specialists and LVER staff are  employees of the state and are typically housed in state employment  service offices. Although there is evidence LVER staff and DVOP  specialists often perform similar duties, the DVOP specialist\u2019s role was  designed to provide intensive services to veterans with employment  barriers, including those with disabilities, while the LVER staff role was  designed to market veterans to employers. Labor provides oversight and  monitoring of the state grants through a state VETS program director  (DVET) in each state.", "The Labor and VA programs serve similar clientele, but there are  differences in eligibility requirements and the measure of successful  completion. To participate in VA\u2019s VRE program, the veteran must have  disabilities that affect a minimum percentage of daily activities, as  determined by VA, and must have an employment handicap related to the  disability. In addition, there is a time limit for receiving services, generally  12 years following the date the veteran was discharged or separated from  the military or received a disability percentage rating from VA. The  primary outcome measured by VA\u2019s VRE program is whether the veteran  obtained and maintained suitable employment, that is, work that is within  a veteran\u2019s emotional and physical capabilities and consistent with the  veteran\u2019s abilities, aptitudes, and interests. By contrast, any veteran who  was discharged because of a service-connected disability or who served  more than 180 days and was not dishonorably discharged can receive  services through Labor\u2019s programs. The primary outcome measured by  Labor is whether or not the veteran entered employment, without  requiring determination of suitability.", "VA and the state workforce agencies\u2014including DVOP specialists and  LVER staff\u2014work together on the local level. In many states, DVOP  specialists work with veterans who have completed their VA training to  help them find employment. The process by which these referrals are  made is not determined nationally; it is left up to VA regional officials to  develop local policies and procedures. In addition, some state workforce  agencies provide VA staff with state unemployment insurance wage data  to verify the employment status of their clients. Additionally, many VA  regional offices have a DVOP specialist colocated in the office at least part  of the time. However, cooperation between Labor and VA has historically  been better in some states than in others, reportedly in part because of  variation in the number and quality of services provided by DVOP  specialists. As a result, VA\u2019s VRE Task Force concluded in its 2004 report  that VRE should consider using DVOP specialist services as one of many  options to help its clients, and not view the DVOP specialist as the sole  provider of employment services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor and VA Have Implemented Some Elements of Their Agreement, but Data- Sharing Restrictions, Staffing Limitations, and Lack of a Comprehensive Plan Pose Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Labor and VA have fulfilled some elements of their agreement to  coordinate efforts, but the agencies face a variety of challenges to fully  executing the agreement, including the lack of a comprehensive plan for  implementing the agreement and measuring progress.

According to a Labor official, the implementation of the agencies\u2019  agreement revolves around the efforts of these work groups. The work  groups met for the first time in April 2006, 6 months after the agreement  was signed. In January 2007, they conducted a survey of Labor and VA  field staff in 24 states to gather preliminary information about the working  relationship between the agencies at the local level and identify areas  needing improvement. On the basis of the survey results, the work groups  plan to launch a pilot project in eight regional offices in August or  September of 2007 to explore new strategies to improve the partnership  between Labor and VA. Labor and VA officials expect to complete the pilot  project in January 2008, and plan to make recommendations thereafter  regarding the implementation of these strategies nationwide, but the work  groups have not yet made definitive recommendations for program  changes.", "Four of the elements that Labor and VA are responsible for  implementing\u2014staff evaluations, yearly reporting, performance measures,  and monitoring of state-level memorandums of agreement\u2014are in process  but not yet completed. The agreement between Labor and VA calls for  agency managers to consider the effectiveness of partnership activities  between VA and the state workforce agency when evaluating staff.  Although Labor has implemented such standards for state VETS program  directors, these provisions are not specifically outlined in the performance  standards for other VETS program staff or for VA staff. The agreement  also calls for the agencies to have yearly reports that include measures of  the number of VA program participants referred to the VETS program who  registered for state workforce agency services, the number of participants  who entered suitable employment, and the number of participants who  maintained suitable employment for 180 days or more. While the agencies  are collecting data on most of these measures, they are not currently  collecting data on the last measure. With regard to performance  measures, one of the joint work groups has started to develop new shared  measures to better assess partnership activities between the two agencies.  For example, one proposed measure is the percentage of veterans referred  from VA to VETS program DVOP specialists who receive an employment  services assessment within 30 days. In addition, the agreement calls for  the agencies to monitor common goals and measures within  memorandums of agreement executed at the state level and stipulates that  corrective action will be taken when such goals are not met.

All 5 states had processes  in place whereby VA advised program participants of the benefits of  registering for employment services with the state workforce agency. All  of the states we visited had also established a process for referring  veterans from VA to the state workforce agency for employment services,  although the process was not the same in every state. In addition, all 5  states we visited had a memorandum of agreement between the regional  VA office serving the state, the state VETS program director, and the state  workforce agency to coordinate their services for disabled veterans. All of  the states had recently revised their state agreement or were in the  process of doing so. All 5 states we visited had also appointed a VETS  program contact person for VA staff, and a national Labor official told us  that all 50 states have appointed such points of contact.

Typically, VA clients  seeking employment would meet with a VA counselor, VA employment  services staff, and a DVOP specialist from the state workforce agency.  However, the states varied in terms of the point at which the DVOP  specialist became involved. In three of the states we visited, DVOP  specialists provided assistance to veterans soon after they entered the VA  program, typically by presenting labor market information to veterans to  incorporate into their vocational rehabilitation plans. In the two other  states we visited, DVOP specialists did not typically meet with veterans  until they had neared the end of their VA training programs or were  otherwise prepared to seek employment. In one of these states, we were  told that this was due to negative past experiences in providing veterans  services from both VA and DVOP specialist staff at the same time.", "The five states we visited were collecting data on all but one of the yearly  reporting measures outlined in the agreement between Labor and VA, and  staff identified challenges to implementing this remaining reporting  measure. In all five states, agency staff told us that they were gathering  data on the number of VA program participants referred to the VETS  program, and of those referred, the number who registered for state  workforce agency services and the number who entered suitable  employment. In these states, VA staff said that they tracked program  participants for 60 days after they obtained suitable employment, and we  learned that state workforce agencies tracked veterans for varying lengths  of time. However, none of the states were tracking the number of VA  program participants who maintained suitable employment for 180 days or  more. In four states, some agency staff told us that they would face  challenges implementing this additional reporting measure, and staff in  three states said that this was because following up with veterans for   180 days would likely require additional staff time and resources.", "In four states, workforce agencies were able to share UI wage data with  VA, but in one state, they faced challenges sharing such data because of  state laws. UI wage data are managed by the states. According to VA  officials, if agency staff want to use this information\u2014for example, to  verify that a client is employed\u2014they need to obtain the data from the  state workforce agency. In Illinois, VA and the state workforce agency had  signed a shared data agreement that allowed the workforce agency to  provide VA with UI wage data. In Alabama, state workforce agency staff  told us that they had given VA staff direct access to their database, which  contained UI wage information. In California\u2019s San Diego region, VA and  the state workforce agency had developed a centralized process in which  VA sent UI wage data requests to the state workforce agency headquarters.  And in South Dakota, workforce agency staff told us that they were able to  share UI wage data with VA, but said that they rarely received requests for  such data. However, in Michigan, we were told that they were unable to  share UI wage information because state law prevents the workforce  agency from sharing an individual\u2019s wage data with VA.", "Staffing limitations prevented some states from having a full-time  colocated DVOP specialist at the VA office, although most had at least  part-time coverage from an itinerant DVOP specialist. The agreement  states that to the extent feasible and appropriate, a DVOP specialist or  other designated individual will be colocated at the VA office or will  otherwise provide itinerant coverage to VA participants. Only one of the  five states we visited had a full-time colocated DVOP specialist at the VA  office. Three of the other states we visited had part-time colocated DVOP  specialists, but one state had no coverage at the VA office at the time of  our visit. VA staff in the states with a DVOP specialist on site part-time told  us that such an arrangement was useful, and staff in two states said that  they would like to increase the amount of colocation time per week.  However, officials in three states told us that funding constraints limited  the number of workforce agency staff and thus the workforce agency\u2019s  ability to share a DVOP specialist with the VA office. National VA officials  also told us that fluctuating state budgets made it challenging for states to  commit to providing a colocated DVOP specialist from year to year.", "None of the five states had fully implemented the information-sharing  element of the national agreement between Labor and VA, and staff in all  five states told us that some of this information sharing was unnecessary.  The agreement states that both agencies will share all information about  veterans gathered from interviews, counseling, testing, and assessment.  VA staff in the five states we visited told us that they did not regularly  share all of the information outlined in the agreement with the state  workforce agency, and staff in all states said that it is not necessary to  share all information about veterans in order to help them find  employment. In all five states, VA staff shared a standardized, but limited,  set of information with the state workforce agency when referring a  veteran for employment services. For example, in one state, VA staff told  us that this standardized set of information included the veteran\u2019s contact  information, employment goal, and level of education, as well as general  information related to the veteran\u2019s barriers to employment.

Before  providing funding, VA conducted a survey of its field offices to assess  existing resources. Then, between June and September 2006, VA provided  field offices funding to purchase noncomputer items such as furniture and  books. VA transferred $1.5 million to the VA Office of Information and  Technology for procurement of 359 computers, but there were delays in  obtaining them. VA officials told us the computers should be available in  summer 2007.", "According to VA, officials have begun to implement a new employment  resource Web site and a program manual, but they are not yet completed.  VA launched the employment resource Web site, known as vetsuccess.gov,  in 2005 to be a new supportive tool for veterans and VA staff. Currently,  veterans may access the Web site via the Internet and can utilize the site to  view program videos, employment resources, employment search links,  and information about VA partner organizations. VA is planning to install  additional interactive features on the Web site, including a log-in option  that would allow veterans to post r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and employers to search and  view them. However, a VA official told us the installation has been delayed  indefinitely until security concerns can be resolved. Additionally, as part  of the Five-Track program implementation, VA officials plan to distribute a  program manual to staff. However, a VA official told us the agency is  postponing the release of the manual until the employment Web site  features have been completed and can be included as part of the manual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Taken Initial Steps to Address Challenges Posed by Employment Needs of Recent Veterans because of the Types and Severity of Their Disabilities", "paragraphs": ["Officials in some states we visited raised concerns about the ability of  employment programs\u2014including the Five-Track program\u2014to address the  needs of severely disabled program participants returning from recent  conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to VA officials, many recently  returning veterans have multiple and severe disabilities, such as speech,  hearing, and visual impairments as well as loss of limbs and brain injuries,  and behavioral issues due to the stress of combat. Additionally, veterans  from recent conflicts are surviving with more of these serious injuries that  would have been fatal in past conflicts, a fact that can present major  challenges to providing training and securing appropriate job placements.  For example, VA officials in one state told us that from their experiences  assisting veterans with traumatic brain injuries, they have found that these  veterans may find it difficult to filter their thoughts and actions and may  act and speak inappropriately, making employment placement more  difficult. In addition, VA officials anticipate increased caseloads because  of expanded outreach efforts to veterans and service members separating  from the military, and increasing disability claims from veterans of recent  conflicts.", "To address these challenges, VA told us that officials have developed  programs to provide additional resources for recently returning veterans  to receive employment services. VA officials have an early outreach  program, Coming Home to Work, to provide civilian work experience to  eligible service members pending medical separation from active duty at  military treatment facilities. VA has also designated a particular individual  in each VA regional office to coordinate vocational rehabilitation and  employment case services for recently returning service members located  in military treatment facilities.", "According to VA, officials have also made training available to staff on the  specific disabilities that may be more prevalent among recently returning  veterans. The agency has developed training materials on traumatic brain  injuries, amputations, and transferable work skills, which an official told  us have been made available to VA counselors and employment  coordinators through VA internal satellite broadcasts and other means.  Additionally, VA plans to develop an online training curriculum that would  include training specific to the needs of recently returning veterans that  will be available to VA staff. In addition to training, a VA official told us the  agency used internal staff meetings and conference calls to address the  immediate concerns of VA staff related to recently returning veterans.", "Labor has also taken some initial steps to address the challenges of serving  severely disabled Five-Track program participants returning from recent  conflicts, and we were told staff who work with these veterans have  access to VA training. Labor has a program, called Recovery and  Employment Assistance Lifelines (REALifelines), to provide individualized  job preparation, counseling, and reemployment services to veterans  seriously injured in recent conflicts. VETS program staff, including DVOP  specialists and LVER staff, can also access the National Veterans\u2019 Training  Institute VETS NET online newsletter, which often includes links to  information on serving recently returning veterans. In addition, VA told us  that state VETS program directors have access to training materials  related to the needs of recently returning veterans such as traumatic brain  injuries and amputations. Similarly, VA told us that state workforce agency  staff will also have access to its planned online training curriculum,  including courses specific to the employment needs of recently returning  veterans.

Employment coordinators generally  provided direct employment services to veterans and performed job  development activities and outreach to employers and the community.  Despite the fact that the employment coordinator position description  outlines a variety of services to be provided to veterans across each VA  region, these activities were largely limited to their local areas. In addition,  employment coordinators performed some services that duplicated other  available resources.

Job resource labs also  provided some resources that veterans were able to access elsewhere."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Employment Coordinators Performed Direct Services, Job Development, and Outreach in Their Local Areas and Duplicated Some Other Available Resources", "paragraphs": ["The employment coordinators in the five states we visited provided some  direct assistance to veterans. The services to veterans included helping  with veteran employment plans, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, interview  preparation, and job search activities. In addition, employment  coordinators with whom we spoke typically provided veterans and VA  counselors with labor market information, which generally included  average salary, to assist veterans in selecting potential career fields. Other  duties varied by state and included managing the referral process to DVOP  specialists, conducting follow-up with veterans after they have been  placed in employment, arranging for the distribution of a stipend given to  veterans during their employment search, and focusing on providing  services to veterans who were having difficulty finding employment. One  employment coordinator reported that she assisted employers with  making workplace accommodations for disabled veteran employees who  were participants in the VA program, while two others reported that they  had not had the opportunity to provide such accommodations. In one case,  the employment coordinator had carved out the specific role of assisting  veterans with federal job applications.", "Most of the employment coordinators we met with also performed some  job development and outreach activities. These activities included  promotion of VA programs, developing partnerships with businesses and  other agencies, and marketing and providing VA employer incentives. For  example, an employment coordinator in one state we visited told us she  partners with other agencies to obtain employment leads for veterans and  another employment coordinator told us that he markets an incentive  program to employers through which VA pays half of the veteran\u2019s salary  for the first 6 months of employment. Some employment coordinators also  told us they conduct presentations about VA at community events.", "Employment coordinators in the five states we visited primarily provided  services to veterans in their local areas, even though VA originally  intended that they provide a variety of employment services across each  VA region. In the five states we visited, the employment coordinators  seldom traveled to offices outside their local area, and when some did,  they met with a much smaller number of veterans. VA staff in several  locations told us the lack of face-to-face contact with an employment  coordinator disadvantaged some veterans. For example, VA staff in one  office without an employment coordinator on-site found communication  via phone and e-mail to be less effective in providing employment services  to veterans than in-person interactions. Similarly, an employment  coordinator in another state told us that veterans outside her local area do  not receive the same level of services from her as those located in her  immediate area. VA acknowledged it was not aware of the extent to which  employment coordinators were able to work with veterans outside their  local areas. In addition, VA national officials acknowledged that the  current number of employment coordinators is not enough to provide a  full array of employment services to all program participants, as they had  originally intended when they wrote the position description. They told us  they tried to compensate for this deficiency by assigning employment  coordinators to offices in the most populous areas and expected that state  workforce agency staff would serve veterans in other locales. In one state,  the employment coordinator was stationed over 200 miles away from the  office we visited and was only able to provide services for 15 of the  approximately 300 veterans served in that office at the time of our  interview. The employment coordinator, VA counselors, and some  veterans in this state told us they considered local DVOP specialists to be  the primary employment services providers for program participants.", "According to veterans and VA staff in the five states we visited,  employment coordinators provided some unique services to veterans in  their local areas, but other services were also available from alternative  sources. Employment coordinators provided some services that were not  available elsewhere, such as marketing VA employer incentives, promoting  the VA program through networking and ongoing contacts with employers,  distributing veterans\u2019 employment search stipend, and assisting with  employer accommodations. However, according to veterans and VA staff  in the five states we visited, some of the direct services provided by  employment coordinators were similar to those offered by others. For  example, according to some VA staff and veterans, college career centers,  DVOP specialists, and VA contractors all provide veterans assistance with  r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing and interviewing techniques. Additionally, some veterans  and VA staff told us that both employment coordinators and state  workforce agency staff can assist veterans and VA counselors with labor  market information. Similarly, in two states we visited employment  coordinators were available to provide more services to veterans who  were having difficulty finding employment, while DVOP specialists were  also responsible for facilitating services for veterans with special  employment needs. One veteran told us he met with the employment  coordinator daily for assistance with r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and interview preparation  and obtaining employment leads while also working with a DVOP  specialist weekly.", "The outreach activities employment coordinators conducted were also  sometimes performed by others. In some states we visited, both  employment coordinators and DVOP specialists marketed to employers on  behalf of disabled veterans in the VA program by identifying employer  hiring contacts and obtaining information on job vacancies and hiring  prerequisites. Similarly, in some states employment coordinators and  DVOP specialists performed job development activities, such as fostering  partnerships through participation in job fairs and networking with local  businesses. VA staff in two states told us that state workforce agency staff  often performed job development and outreach activities. Although Labor  and VA national officials acknowledged some similarities between the  employment services performed by employment coordinators and those  available to program participants elsewhere, VA officials have not  collected information on the full extent of the duplication nationally.

All of the labs in the five states we  visited were equipped with computers that had Internet access, desks,  printers, and employment resource libraries. The number of computers  available for veterans\u2019 use in the labs ranged from one to four. All of the  labs also had at least three additional resources such as copiers, fax  machines, informational pamphlets, job postings, and televisions and DVD  players located directly in the lab or available for use elsewhere in the  office. According to the veterans and VA staff in the five states we visited,  the job resource labs were used primarily to conduct Five-Track program  orientation and to allow for veterans to engage individually in career  exploration activities. In three of the states we visited, the labs were also  used as a meeting space, for example, to host workshops and veteran  employment networking groups. The labs sometimes also served as an  office for the part-time colocated DVOP specialist or as an extra space to  conduct activities such as mock interviews. We were told VA staff were  available to assist veterans as needed, but only one of the labs we visited  was staffed throughout the day. Although some veterans were able to use  the labs with minimal guidance, others told us they needed the assistance  provided by VA staff when they were first introduced to the labs. Figure 4  shows photographs of a sample of the job resource labs we visited.", "Veterans in the five states we visited did not typically use the labs for any  activities other than those that were part of the program orientation. VA  staff in the five states we visited told us the labs were not used by many  veterans. Four of the labs we visited tracked usage informally, and a  month of data from these labs showed as many as 34 veterans using one  lab and as few as 3 using another. Additionally, none of the veterans we  spoke with used the labs regularly or more than a few times during the  program. For example, 1 veteran said he only used the lab to occasionally  look at his grades online and another veteran used printed resources in the  lab once to prepare for an interview. Some of the low levels of usage may  be explained by factors associated with the lab. In two of the states we  visited, the labs had only been operational for 2 months or less. In three  other sites, VA staff lamented that the labs were housed in buildings that  were not conveniently located or required security searches to enter.  While VA officials told us they plan to assess the usage and effectiveness  of the job resource labs nationally, they have not done so yet because they  are waiting for all labs to have permanent computers.", "Veterans and VA officials told us that program participants have access to  equipment and materials similar to those in the job resource labs at other  locations. In the five states we visited, job resource labs provided veterans  with some additional VA services, for example, one-on-one computer  assistance from VA staff and the opportunity to network with other VA  participants. However, according to veterans and VA counselors with  whom we spoke, veterans typically had computer and Internet access  available at home, school, the public library, or the local one-stop career  center. Similarly, one veteran told us he used printed materials found in  the job resource labs, such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and interviewing technique books, at  his local one-stop career center. While some veterans and veteran service  organization representatives we spoke with found that having access to  resources at multiple locations allows veterans more flexibility, some also  told us the labs were duplicative of most of the basic resources available  at local one-stops, such as computers, printers, faxes, printed materials,  job postings, and brochures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA staff and their counterparts in Labor are charged with the  responsibility of helping veterans achieve the best possible employment  outcomes\u2014each in their own capacity but also in cooperation with each  other. Given their similar missions and clientele, and to ensure the  seamless delivery of services and efficient use of resources, it is critical  that these agencies work together effectively. The October 2005 agreement  between Labor and VA stated that both parties commit themselves to  active cooperation and coordination in meeting the goals of the  agreement. However, without additional efforts\u2014developing a  comprehensive plan that outlines long-range time frames and benchmarks  for its implementation, thoroughly reviewing implementation at the state  level, providing guidance to states, and outlining plans for taking action if  states do not implement the agreement\u2014it is difficult to determine the  extent to which the agreement has been implemented or what, if any,  progress has been made toward its goals. In addition, VA officials were not  fully aware of how the employment coordinator position was serving  veterans outside of the employment coordinator\u2019s local area. As a result,  VA may not be providing all veterans in a regional office\u2019s jurisdiction with  equal access to the full array of services from an employment coordinator.  Furthermore, Labor and VA have not collected systematic information on  employment coordinators and job resource labs to help eliminate all  duplication in the delivery of needed employment services and provide a  seamless employment transition. Without this information, there may be  unnecessary duplication of services, which is not in keeping with the  agreement.
