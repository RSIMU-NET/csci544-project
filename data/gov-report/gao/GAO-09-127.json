Specifically, less than 2 percent of respondents to telephone surveys since 2003 reported tuning in to Radio or TV Marti during the past week. Despite the importance of audience research, we found minimal sharing of such research among available sources. Because of limitations in the audience research data, decisionmakers lack basic information to help assess the relative success or return on investment from each of OCB's transmission methods. BBG's IBB--which directly oversees OCB--has established an annual program review process that serves as the main mechanism for assessing OCB's compliance with journalistic standards. While IBB officials report that the quality of OCB programming has improved in recent years, IBB reviews since 2003 have recommended improving adherence to certain journalistic standards, particularly in the areas of balance and objectivity. IBB's process provides useful feedback, but we found weaknesses such as limited training and operational guidance for staff conducting the reviews. OCB and IBB have taken steps to ensure that U.S. broadcasting adheres to relevant laws and standards, but some concerns remain. To comply with U.S. law, they have taken steps to minimize the domestic dissemination of OCB programming; however, OCB broadcasts reach U.S. audiences in several ways, such as through the Internet. In addition, a commercial TV station contracted to broadcast OCB programming showed some inappropriate advertisements during OCB programs. Furthermore, an international body found that OCB's TV broadcasts cause harmful interference to Cuban broadcasts, but the U.S. government has not taken steps to address this issue. Despite some efforts by BBG and OCB, oversight entities have identified problems such as poor communication by OCB management and low employee morale.

In fiscal year 2008, OCB spent  over $6 million on AeroMart\u00ed, which includes about $5 million for fuel,  operation, and maintenance of the airplanes and about $1 million to equip  one airplane with the ability to broadcast on channel 13. Additional OCB  resources were focused on TV Mart\u00ed transmissions because BBG and OCB  felt there were more opportunities to expand the size of the audience of  TV Mart\u00ed than that of Radio Mart\u00ed. Prior to its use of AeroMart\u00ed, OCB  transmitted TV Mart\u00ed through an aerostat (blimp) in the Florida Keys. The  aerostat was destroyed by a hurricane in 2005. BBG, IBB, and OCB  officials believe that AeroMart\u00ed is more effective than the aerostat due to  its technological capabilities. In December 2006, IBB began leasing 1 hour  of airtime from 12:00 midnight to 1:00 a.m. on weeknights on a commercial  AM radio station in Miami (Radio Mambi), at a cost of about $183,000 for a  6-month period.

For example, at a strategic level, documents produced as a part of BBG\u2019s  annual Language Service Review process contain data on the cost per  listener. However, we found that although documents from the 2004 and  2005 Language Service Reviews of OCB included such data, documents  from the 2006, 2007, and 2008 Language Service Reviews of OCB listed this  information as \u201cnot available.\u201d This is because the news and programming  operations and budgets for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed were merged in fiscal year  2005, thus making it impossible to separate the budgets (and, therefore,  the cost per listener) for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed.", "In addition, the research efforts provide decisionmakers with limited  information on the relative return on investment from each of the  individual transmission methods OCB uses. For example, the IBB  telephone surveys do not include questions on the transmission method\u2014 such as shortwave or medium-wave radio, satellite television, AeroMart\u00ed,  or the Internet\u2014that respondents used to listen to or watch Radio and TV  Mart\u00ed. As a result, it is impossible to determine from the telephone surveys  whether TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s audience is due to AeroMart\u00ed (which costs about $5.0  million annually) or the DirecTV transmission (which costs about $0.5  million annually).", "Furthermore, other officials have suggested that the current methods used  to broadcast to Cuba may not be the most cost-effective way to reach a  Cuban audience. For example, a USINT official stated that the most  successful distribution of TV Mart\u00ed has been via DVD (rather than satellite  or over-the-air AeroMart\u00ed broadcasts) and suggested that there could be  avenues for others to increase the distribution of DVDs throughout Cuban  society."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Nationally Representative Data on OCB\u2019s Audience Exists, but the Best Available Audience Research Suggests That Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s Audience Size Is Small", "paragraphs": ["Despite the lack of reliable nationally representative data, BBG has  determined that telephone surveys conducted from outside Cuba are  among the best available and most cost-effective methods of estimating  audience size for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed.

However, these results may not represent the  actual size of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s audience because (1) according to BBG  officials, higher viewing and listening rates are expected among recent  arrivals and (2) the demographic characteristics of the respondents to  this survey did not reflect the Cuban population in all aspects.", "In addition, OCB receives anecdotal information about its audience.

As an illustration, OCB  reported that Radio Mart\u00ed\u2019s coverage of Hurricane Ike, which struck Cuba  in September 2008, was widely heard in Cuba, with callers from all over  Cuba providing updated information on the situation to OCB.

To overcome Cuban government  counter-broadcasting of its AM broadcasts, OCB increases signal power  during daylight hours. According to OCB, the Cuban government\u2019s  counter-broadcasting is largely effective in and around Havana and several  other large cities, but probably has little impact outside these areas.  Recently arrived Cubans who participated in IBB-commissioned focus  groups reported that signal jamming and counter-broadcasting by the  Cuban government made it difficult for them to listen to Radio Mart\u00ed.", "The Cuban government also jams TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s signals from AeroMart\u00ed.  According to OCB engineers, the jamming attempts to disrupt the signal  reaching televisions in Cuba (rather than at the transmitter). OCB  engineers said that because AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s signal is transmitted from a high- altitude, constantly moving platform, they believe jamming is less  effective, but this has not been confirmed. A February 2008 OCB  assessment of Cuban jamming states that \u201cCuba would need many  thousands of additional jammers to totally block TV Mart\u00ed.\u201d However,  according to IBB\u2019s research contractor, none of the 533 respondents to  IBB\u2019s 2008 telephone survey living in Havana reported watching TV Mart\u00ed  broadcasts during the past 12 months. In addition, recently arrived  Cubans who participated in IBB-commissioned focus groups reported that  signal jamming of TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s over-the-air broadcast via AeroMart\u00ed made it  difficult for them to view TV Mart\u00ed.

Despite their efforts, IBB and  OCB still lack reliable data on the number, location, type, and  effectiveness of Cuban jamming equipment. As a result, it is unclear how  much of the radio and television signals can be heard and seen in Cuba.  For example, OCB recently asked AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s contractor to study  AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s capabilities and effectiveness in the presence and absence of  jamming. The contractor developed a model and estimated that  AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s broadcasts had a potential viewing audience of about 40  percent of the Cuban population in the absence of jamming and at least 20  percent of the population in the presence of Cuban jamming. This  estimate, however, assumed that the Cuban government uses four  jammers in fixed locations in the Havana area. OCB\u2019s Director of  Engineering said that the assumption that Cuba has four fixed jammers is  based on observations made in the 1990s by a USINT public affairs officer  and defecting Cuban jamming technicians. Given the dated nature of the  assumption, the estimates regarding AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s potential viewing  audience might be unreliable, and, therefore, the validity of the study\u2019s  conclusions is uncertain. The contractor\u2019s study also does not address or  account for other potential variables, including jamming outside of the  Havana area or the effect of mobile jammers on AeroMart\u00ed broadcasts. In  addition, according to OCB officials, Hurricane Ike may have reduced  Cuba\u2019s jamming capabilities.", "In addition, IBB Office of Engineering officials said that they have  provided equipment to monitor the quality of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s  technical reception in Cuba. According to an IBB Office of Engineering  official, these systems are not yet operational due to technical problems  and other State priorities. Once operational, the equipment will provide  IBB (and others, through a public Web site) with access to the Radio and  TV Mart\u00ed signal received in Cuba. IBB will be able to listen to and view  OCB broadcasts and analyze when, how often, and to what extent  broadcasts are jammed or interfered with.

In addition, IBB and OCB surveys and focus groups provide  some information regarding competing stations.

IBB\u2019s Office of Human Resources also has a full-time staff  person at OCB who, in addition to other administrative responsibilities,  receives employee complaints regarding mismanagement.", "BBG, IBB, and OCB staffs have mixed views regarding whether OCB\u2019s  location in Miami inhibits effective oversight of OCB operations. BBG and  IBB management reported that OCB\u2019s location does not inhibit their  efforts to oversee it. They noted that they are in regular contact with OCB  management by telephone and e-mail. They also noted that the monthly  BBG board meetings (one of which is held in Miami each year) provide  sufficient personal contact with OCB management. Some OCB employees,  however, expressed concern regarding what they perceive as a lack of  oversight or involvement by BBG and IBB. One employee commented that  OCB seemed to be \u201cout of sight and out of the minds\u201d of BBG and IBB.  Other OCB employees suggested that more regular visits by BBG or IBB  staff to OCB would enhance their understanding of OCB\u2019s operations and  management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight Efforts Have Raised Concerns Regarding Communication, Morale, and Fraud and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, three categories of problems have been raised regularly  regarding OCB operations. First, some OCB employees reported poor  communication from senior OCB management. Prior GAO work has  shown the benefits of maintaining continuous dialogue between  management and employees to share information and address workplace  issues. However, in responding to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s  2007 annual employee survey, more than half of OCB employees  responding disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that they  are satisfied with the information they received from management on what  is going on in the organization. Several OCB employees expressed  concern to us specifically regarding the lack of any formal systems for  disseminating information from management to staff or for staff to provide  input into management decisions. They expressed frustration with the lack  of regular staff meetings and absence of an employee newsletter to  improve communication. However, despite an informal recommendation  from the State OIG, OCB management has not established any formal or  regular mechanisms for communicating with staff, such as regular staff  meetings or newsletters. In response, OCB senior management noted that  there are frequent meetings between the OCB Director and senior  managers to discuss various issues, but that it is the responsibility of  managers to brief their staff on current issues and hold regular staff  meetings.", "Second, employee morale has been a concern at OCB. For example, a  majority of OCB employees responding to the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s 2007 annual employee survey either disagreed or strongly  disagreed with the statement that they are satisfied with their involvement  in decisions that affect their work. Our interviews with some employees  in Miami also confirmed that employee morale is a concern.", "Relating to the issue of employee morale, BBG management and OCB  employees expressed differing views regarding the current director\u2019s  management of OCB. BBG and IBB management praised his leadership  style and told us that he has made numerous improvements in OCB\u2019s  organization and broadcast quality. In 2007, the State OIG praised the  director as a \u201chands-on manager and an assertive, inspiring leader.\u201d At  the same time, the State OIG acknowledged that his management style has  intimidated some employees. Similarly, we spoke with some OCB  employees who view him as a \u201cmicromanager\u201d with excessive involvement  in the editorial content of OCB programming.", "Third, a variety of allegations regarding fraud and abuse have been raised.  For example, according to BBG officials, they referred one case of  suspected fraud to the State OIG. As a result, in 2007, an OCB employee  was sentenced to serve 27 months in prison and required to pay a  monetary fine for taking kickbacks from a production company doing  business with OCB. Other allegations, however, have not been  substantiated. From November 2007 through May 2008, our Office of  Forensic Audits and Special Investigations interviewed former and current  employees alleging mismanagement at OCB. Employee allegations  included, among other things, time and attendance abuse, improper hiring  practices, contracting improprieties, and excessive travel by OCB  managers. Our investigators requested documentation from employees  that would support their allegations. Although investigators received some  documentation, it was insufficient to pursue further investigation.  Therefore, while investigators found some indications of mismanagement,  much of the evidence was anecdotal or hearsay and did not provide a  sufficient basis to continue the investigation.", "Data from BBG\u2019s Office of Civil Rights show that the number of  complaints that OCB employees have filed recently averages fewer than 3  per year. Staff from the Office of Civil Rights suggested that this  represents an improvement from previous time periods when a larger  number of complaints were filed, and attributed this improvement to the  management style of the current OCB Director. Since 2003, the Office of  Civil Rights has received 15 formal complaints from OCB employees. The  most frequently cited reasons for complaints were reprisal and  discrimination on the basis of gender or national origin. According to the  Director of the Office of Civil Rights, a few cases were settled and  managers prevailed in the remainder of the 12 cases that have been  completed. In placing these most recent complaints in context, staff from  the Office of Civil Rights indicated the following:    A small number of OCB employees accounts for a majority of the  complaints. Since 2003, 4 employees have been responsible for 9 of the 15  complaints filed by OCB employees.", "The number of equal employment opportunity complaints filed by OCB  employees was substantially higher during the tenure of other OCB  Directors.", "In their experience, other BBG broadcast entities have more frequent  equal employment opportunity complaints than OCB.", "However, some OCB employees told us that the current outlets for  expressing concerns are ineffective. For example, an OCB employee union  representative indicated that in numerous cases, OCB management has  ignored or insufficiently addressed union members\u2019 concerns. In addition,  some employees expressed fear of reprisal by managers if they raise  concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BBG and OCB Have Taken Steps to Address Nearly All Recent Audit Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously discussed, external auditors have conducted  several reviews in recent years related to U.S. broadcasting to Cuba. Those  reviews have led to numerous recommendations for improvement to BBG,  IBB, and OCB. Most notably, in its 2003 and 2007 inspection reports of  OCB, the State OIG made 20 formal recommendations to improve OCB  operations. These recommendations addressed a variety of issues related  to OCB operations, including audience research, contracting, adherence to  journalistic standards, and strategic planning. Of those, the State OIG  considers 17 of the recommendations to be implemented. OCB officials  indicated that other recommendations related to physical security at OCB  headquarters will also be addressed soon.", "IBB staff are responsible for tracking the status of ongoing and completed  audits related to all BBG entities and providing monthly reports to ensure  that IBB management and BBG staff are aware of such ongoing activities.  According to BBG officials, this is performed mainly to ensure that BBG  staff are aware of auditors\u2019 ongoing inquiries. IBB staff maintain a paper  file for each audit, and, if a report is published and contains  recommendations, the file would maintain the report and any follow-up  documentation related to compliance. BBG officials stated that they are  developing a database that can be used to easily access information  regarding the compliance status of various audit recommendations.

Despite OCB\u2019s recent efforts to  broadcast Radio and TV Mart\u00ed using additional transmission methods at a  significant cost, the best available research indicates that OCB\u2019s audience  size is small. However, OCB believes that these results do not reflect the  true size of its audience in Cuba, citing the challenges to conducting valid  audience research in Cuba and anecdotal reports it receives from Cubans.  With a new President and Congress, the United States has a fresh  opportunity to reassess the purpose and effectiveness of U.S. radio and  television broadcasting to Cuba. To assist decisionmakers in formulating  the U.S. broadcasting strategy and making funding decisions, BBG and  OCB need to ensure that they have articulated a clear strategy and  assembled data to help decisionmakers assess the effectiveness and return  on investment of OCB\u2019s various transmission methods.", "In addition to the need for a clear strategy to guide current and future  policy direction, which OCB and BBG are developing, it is important to  have systems and processes in place to enable the efficient and effective  operation of OCB. To help ensure that U.S. broadcasting to Cuba is  informed by all available audience research, it is important to enhance  coordination among U.S. agencies and grantees that perform such  research. Additionally, to better ensure that U.S. broadcasting to Cuba is in  compliance with journalistic standards, the lack of training for OCB staff  needs to be addressed and guidance and training for IBB program analysts  who conduct reviews of OCB\u2019s adherence to journalistic standards should  be enhanced. Furthermore, to improve morale within the organization,  OCB management should take steps to address persistent concerns with  its communication and interaction with OCB staff. Finally, to avoid the  diminution of the reputation of U.S. government-funded broadcasting, it is  important that advertisements containing inappropriate material are not  shown during OCB broadcasts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To assist decisionmakers and improve OCB\u2019s strategy, we recommend that  the Broadcasting Board of Governors take the following two steps:    Conduct an analysis of the relative success and return on investment of  broadcasting to Cuba, showing the cost, nature of the audience, and  challenges\u2014such as jamming and competition\u2014related to each of OCB\u2019s  transmission methods.

BBG also suggested that the draft report at times did not fully  reflect the difficulties in broadcasting to a closed society or in evaluating  the reach of broadcasts to a closed society. We believe the report  addresses both issues appropriately. Regarding the difficulties in  broadcasting to a closed society, the report has separate sections (in  which BBG, IBB, and OCB officials are frequently cited) that discuss the  challenges posed by Cuban government jamming and competitors in the  Cuban media environment. Regarding the difficulties in evaluating the  reach of broadcasts to Cuba, the report clearly acknowledges that  significant challenges exist to conducting valid audience research in Cuba.  For example, the report discusses the prohibition on conducting in-person  audience research in Cuba and the lack of nationally representative data  from telephone surveys. BBG also suggested that the draft report\u2019s  discussion of a lack of a strategic plan was somewhat misleading. While  the report acknowledges coordination has occurred on some strategic  issues, OCB\u2019s draft strategic plan (which was first presented in July 2007)  has yet to be approved.

To describe OCB\u2019s approach, we reviewed BBG\u2019s strategic plan for  2008-2013 and OCB\u2019s draft strategic plan and interviewed officials at BBG,  IBB, and OCB regarding strategic planning exercises. To analyze OCB\u2019s  approach for broadcasting to Cuba, we reviewed relevant  documentation\u2014including OCB and IBB data on the cost, broadcast  schedule, geographic coverage, and effectiveness of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s  various transmission methods\u2014and interviewed OCB and IBB officials.  We also visited some of the sites from where OCB broadcasts Radio and  TV Mart\u00ed, including OCB\u2019s medium-wave radio station in Marathon,  Florida, and AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s station in Key West, Florida, and interviewed  OCB staff and contractors based at those locations. To describe the  makeup of OCB\u2019s budget, we obtained OCB data regarding its fiscal year  2008 budget. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of identifying the main categories and general budget levels  for each category. To identify the available information regarding the size  of OCB\u2019s audience, we analyzed IBB and OCB audience research from  2003 through 2008, including telephone surveys, focus group studies, and  anecdotal reports of reception. To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed BBG, IBB, and OCB officials, as well as IBB and OCB  audience research contractors, regarding the methodology for collecting  the data. We also observed an OCB-commissioned monitoring panel and a  Radio Mart\u00ed program review meeting with IBB and OCB officials to review  and analyze the results of audience research. In addition, we analyzed IBB  documents explaining the methodology for conducting various audience  research efforts. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of characterizing the size of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s audience  in very broad terms for the populations the surveys reached. However, the  fall in reported audience size in the 2008 IBB telephone survey does raise  some questions about the accuracy of that survey. To analyze the impact  of Cuban government jamming on OCB\u2019s broadcasts, we reviewed OCB  documents\u2014including an assessment of Cuban jamming capabilities and a  study conducted by AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s primary contractor on the airplane\u2019s  capabilities\u2014and interviewed IBB and OCB engineers and AeroMart\u00ed\u2019s  contractor. To analyze the effect of competition on OCB broadcasts, we  reviewed IBB telephone surveys and interviewed OCB and IBB officials.  To assess the extent of interagency coordination, we reviewed relevant  documentation, including the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba  reports, and interviewed BBG, OCB, U.S. Agency for International  Development, and State officials.", "To review how BBG and OCB ensure compliance with journalistic  principles, we reviewed documentation on journalistic standards,  including Voice of America\u2019s (VOA) Charter and OCB\u2019s editorial  guidelines, as well as IBB\u2019s qualitative and quantitative assessments of  Radio and TV Mart\u00ed\u2019s broadcast content. To understand IBB\u2019s process for  assessing OCB broadcast content, we observed a June 2008 TV Mart\u00ed  follow-up meeting and a September 2008 Radio Mart\u00ed program review  meeting and interviewed BBG, IBB, and OCB officials. To assess OCB  compliance with journalistic standards, we analyzed IBB program review  documentation from 2003 to 2008, including IBB\u2019s qualitative reviews of  OCB\u2019s broadcast content, IBB\u2019s content and production performance  scores for OCB and VOA broadcasts, and IBB actions plans. We also  interviewed IBB officials responsible for overseeing the performance  review process and the IBB program analyst who performed the reviews  of Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. To assess the quality of IBB reviews of OCB  broadcast content, we systematically analyzed IBB reviews of Radio and  TV Mart\u00ed broadcast content from 2003 to 2008. For each review, we  determined whether and to what extent the review report identified  information, such as the scope of the review, overall judgments regarding  compliance with journalistic standards, and the frequency or severity of  problems cited.
