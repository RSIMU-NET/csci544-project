For civilian institutions, the Corrosion Office documented procedures for selecting projects, but has not done so for approving these projects. In addition, for military academic institutions, the office has not documented procedures for selecting and approving projects. Corrosion Office officials stated that procedures for some aspects of the TCC program are not documented because the program is still evolving and they would like flexibility to enable innovation in determining how to manage the program. However, without fully documenting its decision-making procedures for selecting and approving projects, the Corrosion Office cannot demonstrate how projects were selected and approved for the TCC program.", "Corrosion Office officials provided data on the amount of funds spent on the TCC program for fiscal years 2008 through 2013, but in some cases the data were not readily available and were inconsistent for the same time frame. As a result, it is unclear what the Corrosion Office has spent on the TCC program. Section 2228 requires the Corrosion Office to include a description of the amount of funds used for the TCC program in its annual corrosion budget report to Congress. However, because the Corrosion Office does not track and maintain accurate records, it is unable to determine the amount of funds spent. In the absence of fully documented funding data that are readily available for examination, Corrosion Office officials cannot ensure that they will accurately account for and report TCC costs in the annual budget report to Congress.", "DOD has set goals for the TCC program, but has not developed a process to transition demonstrated results from projects to military departments.

To track the goal of developing people, the Corrosion Office cited, among other things, the research papers that have been produced as a result of the TCC program. Section 2228 requires that the Corrosion Office coordinate a research and development program that includes a plan for the transition of new corrosion-prevention technologies to the military departments. To track the goal to produce solutions that will reduce corrosion, the Corrosion Office monitors TCC projects' results; however, the office has not established a process to transition demonstrated results of the research projects to the military departments. Corrosion Office officials stated that it is difficult to transition results because outputs of TCC research are in the early stages of technology evolution and thus are not mature enough to be used by the military departments. Therefore, Corrosion Office officials acknowledge the need to establish a process to transition TCC results to the military departments. Until the Corrosion Office establishes a process to study and determine what, if any, TCC results could transition to the military departments, DOD will not be able to demonstrate the success of the TCC program and the extent to which TCC results are helping to prevent or mitigate corrosion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends five actions to improve DOD's management of the TCC program.

Corrosion is defined in Section 2228 of Title 10 of the  United States Code as the deterioration of a material or its properties due  to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment. Corrosion  affects military readiness by taking critical systems out of action and  creating safety hazards. DOD implements several programs to help  prevent and mitigate the costs of corrosion. To help identify technology or  methods to prevent or mitigate corrosion, and educate personnel about  corrosion prevention and mitigation, DOD funds research by universities  and military research labs that participate in DOD\u2019s Technical Corrosion  Collaboration (TCC) program, a research and development program.", "Congress has taken a series of legislative actions aimed at enhancing  DOD\u2019s ability to effectively address corrosion prevention and mitigation,  and to provide Congress with greater transparency over the department\u2019s  corrosion-prevention and mitigation efforts.

According to Section 2228 and DOD Instruction 5000.67, the  Director of the Corrosion Office is responsible for the prevention and  mitigation of corrosion of DOD equipment and infrastructure. The statute  requires the Secretary of Defense to, among other things, implement a  long-term strategy to reduce corrosion and the effects of corrosion on  military equipment and infrastructure, including, among other things, the  establishment of a coordinated research and development program for  the prevention and mitigation of corrosion for new and existing military  equipment and infrastructure that includes a plan to transition new  corrosion-prevention technologies into the military departments\u2019 systems.  Additionally, the statute requires the Secretary of Defense to annually  submit, along with defense budget materials, a report to Congress on  corrosion funding, including funding requirements for the coordinated  research and development program, also known as TCC projects. The  Corrosion Office also coordinates DOD-wide corrosion-prevention  activities such as operating the Corrosion Office website (hereafter  referred to as other corrosion-prevention and mitigation activities), and  projects proposed by the military departments such as testing a protective  covering for cable connectors on a missile system (hereafter referred to  as military demonstration projects).", "In 2013, Congress amended Section 2228 of Title 10 of the United States  Code to require the Corrosion Office to include the amount it spent on  TCC projects in its annual corrosion budget report.

We also  reviewed the TCC Definitions Document to identify DOD\u2019s procedures for  selecting and approving TCC projects. We compared DOD\u2019s procedures  for managing the TCC program with criteria in federal standards for  internal control. We obtained information from universities participating  in the TCC program regarding projects funded by the Corrosion Office for  fiscal years 2008 through 2013. We selected a nongeneralizable sample  of projects for further review. Specifically, we chose seven projects  conducted by the five universities that received the most funding from the  Corrosion Office. We used a semistructured interview tool to obtain  information from project managers at selected universities to further  understand the Corrosion Office\u2019s procedures and their implementation,  and to identify successes and challenges, if any. We requested and  reviewed project-related documents, such as white papers, formal  project proposals, purchase requests, cooperative agreements, grants,  and contracts to determine how projects were selected, approved, and  funded.

Thus, although the Navy expects tangible benefits from TCC, the  Navy believes that it may be too early to visualize potential benefits.", "Corrosion Office officials stated that it is difficult to transition results of the  TCC projects to the military departments because outputs of TCC  research are in the early stages of technology evolution and thus are not  mature enough to be used by the military departments. Therefore,  Corrosion Office officials acknowledged the need to establish a process  to transition TCC results to the military departments. Until the Corrosion  Office establishes a process to study and determine what, if any, TCC  results could transition to the military departments, DOD will not be able  to demonstrate the success of the TCC program and the extent to which  TCC results are helping to prevent or mitigate corrosion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To help reduce the billions of dollars in annual costs from the effects of  corrosion on DOD\u2019s infrastructure and military equipment, the  department\u2019s Corrosion Office has been collaborating with universities  and military research labs on research for solutions and to educate  personnel about corrosion. The Corrosion Office has provided an  overview of its management process, including minimum requirements for  selecting TCC projects, and uses the Broad Agency Announcement  process to select some TCC projects; however, officials have not fully  documented some key procedures for selecting and approving projects  for funding.

In its written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix IV, DOD partially concurred  with two of our recommendations and did not concur with three  recommendations.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, document the procedures for  selecting and approving military research labs supporting civilian and  military institutions in conducting projects within the TCC program. DOD  stated that the DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan  adequately documents the procedure for selecting and approving military  research labs that support projects conducted by civilian and military  institutions within the TCC program, but agreed to add additional details  to its documentation. DOD also stated that the strategic plan notes that it  will fund projects based on available budget, and funding will be provided  to both military research labs and universities. However, we do not agree  that this information represents documentation for selecting and  approving military research labs, as we have recommended. As we noted  in our report, we found that the 2014 strategic plan and TCC Definitions  Document provide some information about the requirements and factors  for selecting projects, but the documents do not mention the steps taken  by decision makers to select and approve the military research labs.  Although DOD\u2019s response agreed to add details to its 2014 strategic plan,  it did not specify what type of information will be added. Thus, we  maintain that DOD could enhance its oversight of corrosion projects by  documenting how it selects and then approves military research labs  supporting civilian and military institutions. Additionally, documenting  these procedures would help ensure that the Corrosion Office\u2019s leaders  consistently follow procedures for selecting and approving labs that  support the institutions within the TCC program.", "DOD partially concurred with our fourth recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, track and maintain accurate  records that include amounts of funds used for the TCC program, and  have them readily available for examination to ensure the funding data  will be accurately accounted for and reported in future reports, such as  the annual budget report to Congress. DOD stated that GAO was  provided a complete and accurate set of financial records during the  course of this engagement, but DOD acknowledged, in its comments and  during the review, that there was initially some inconsistency in financial  reporting. DOD cited the following reasons for inconsistent financial  reporting: (1) some projects funded early in the program, under the  University Corrosion Collaboration program, would not be considered  under the current TCC program; and (2) in 2013, Congress required the  Corrosion Office to call out funding for research opportunities separately  from activity requirements and project opportunities. Further, in its  response, DOD stated that it has now implemented internal controls to  identify and document budget categories for each financial transaction  executed, which it says will improve timeliness of reporting. In effect, this  would meet the intent of our recommendation, if implemented. However,  the reasons that DOD cited above, which we also noted in our report, do  not negate the need for DOD to track and maintain accurate funding  information. We maintain that DOD should track and maintain accurate  records that include amounts of funds used for the TCC program, and  have them readily available for examination to ensure the funding data  will be accurately accounted for and reported in future reports, such as  the annual budget report to Congress.", "DOD did not concur with our first and second recommendations that the  Director, Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, document the procedures  for approving projects for civilian institutions, and for selecting and  approving projects for military academic institutions. In its response, DOD  stated that the process is adequately documented in the DOD Corrosion  Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan and TCC Definitions Document.  DOD noted that the plan and definitions document (1) provide five primary  and six secondary project-selection requirements, and (2) state that the  Corrosion Office will convene and chair the project-selection panel.  Additionally, DOD noted that it did not make a distinction in the  documents regarding the type of institution (civilian or military) because  the requirements are applicable across the TCC program. We agree and  noted in our report that the TCC Definitions Document and its 2014  strategic plan include requirements (i.e., primary requirements) and other  factors to consider (i.e., secondary requirements) when selecting some  TCC projects. Although DOD states these requirements in its definitions  document and strategic plan, it has not documented how it applies these  requirements to approve projects for civilian institutions, and to select and  approve projects for military academic institutions. The selection of  projects is partially documented for civilian institutions (i.e., a panel  convenes). However, during our discussions with officials, they  acknowledged that a panel was not involved in the procedures for  selecting and approving military academic institutions.  Instead, the  Deputy Director makes selection and approval decisions, but these  procedures are not documented. We maintain that DOD could enhance  its oversight of corrosion projects by documenting how it approves  projects for civilian institutions and selects and approves TCC projects for  military academic institutions. Additionally, documenting these procedures  would help ensure that the Corrosion Office\u2019s leaders consistently follow  procedures for approving projects for the civilian institutions, and for  selecting and approving projects for military academic institutions.", "DOD did not concur with our fifth recommendation that the Director,  Corrosion Policy and Oversight Office, establish a process for  transitioning demonstrated results of TCC projects to the military  departments as required by Section 2228 of Title 10 of the United States  Code. In its response, DOD stated that the process for transitioning  demonstrated results of TCC projects to the military departments is  appropriately developed and documented in the DOD Corrosion  Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan and the TCC Definitions  Document. DOD also stated that the TCC program is specifically  designed to improve the probability of technology transition by ensuring  early and close collaboration between the research institutions and the  military department laboratories. Additionally, DOD stated that the DOD  Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan describes this  collaborative effort. Specifically, a figure within the plan illustrates that as  the research matures to the \u201cSystem Development/Prototype  Demonstration\u201d phase, military department personnel resume the primary  role in transitioning the technology to their respective departments with  the goal being implementation of the technology. We noted in our report  that DOD Instruction 5000.67, which implements Section 2228 of Title 10  of the United States Code, requires the Corrosion Office to develop a  long-term strategy for corrosion prevention and mitigation that, among  other things, provides for a coordinated research and development  program that includes the transition of new corrosion-prevention  technologies to the military departments. However, we did not identify a  process for transitioning project results to the military departments in  DOD documents, such as its strategic plan, which states that the project  results should transition to the military departments. Further, we also  found that the figure referenced does not illustrate a process for how the  Corrosion Office transitions project results to the military departments but  shows, as Corrosion Office officials stated, the collaborative efforts of the  parties involved in the TCC program. We also noted in our report that  Corrosion Office officials stated that it is difficult to transition results of the  TCC projects to the military departments because outputs of TCC  research are in the early stages of technology evolution and thus are not  mature enough to be used by the military departments.
