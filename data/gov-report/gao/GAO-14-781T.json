Accordingly, we  suggested that Congress consider examining the appropriateness and  viability of the fee-based model to determine whether it should continue.", "We have also continued to highlight this issue in our report and related  updates on actions needed to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication in the federal government. Specifically, in our 2013 report we  noted that many of the reports in NTIS\u2019s collection overlap with similar  information available from the issuing organizations or other sources for  free, and that action was still needed to reevaluate the appropriateness  and viability of the agency\u2019s fee-based model. In a subsequent update,  we noted that Congress had not taken final action to reexamine the fee- based model for disseminating technical information, and that Commerce  did not plan to propose any changes to the NTIS fee-based business  model in the near term.", "Recent legislation intended to reassess the critical functions of NTIS that  you, Chairwoman McCaskill, and Senator Coburn have introduced, well as the version of the legislation introduced by Representatives  Bridenstine and Cuellar, has the potential to address the issues we  have identified. In addition, the 2014 Senate appropriations bill for the  Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related  agencies contains a provision that would, among other things, prohibit  NTIS from charging for any report or document generated by the  legislative branch. These bills stand to serve as an important vehicle for  Congress to reexamine the appropriateness and viability of NTIS\u2019s fee- based model.", "In summary, changing practices for disseminating and accessing  technical information produced by federal agencies, which have been  driven in large part by the Internet, call into question the suitability or  viability of NTIS\u2019s role as a self-financing collector and disseminator of  such information. In light of this, a reconsideration of this role is warranted  to determine whether NTIS\u2019s statutorily-defined functions are still  necessary and, if so, to ensure that they are carried out in a way that best  serves the public interest.
