FHWA also provides funding that states may use for projects that address older driver safety. States have, to varying degrees, adopted FHWA's recommended practices. For example, 24 states reported including about half or more of FHWA's practices in state design guides, while the majority of states reported implementing certain FHWA practices in roadway construction, operations, and maintenance activities. States generally do not place high priority on projects that specifically address older driver safety but try to include practices that benefit older drivers in all projects. More than half of the states have implemented licensing requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than requirements for younger drivers, but states' assessment practices are not comprehensive. For example, these practices primarily involve more frequent or in-person renewals and mandatory vision screening but do not generally include assessments of physical and cognitive functions. While requirements for in-person license renewals generally appear to correspond with lower crash rates for drivers over age 85, the validity of other assessment tools is less clear. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is sponsoring research and other initiatives to develop and assist states in implementing more comprehensive driver fitness assessment practices. Five of the six states GAO visited have implemented coordination groups to assemble a broad range of stakeholders to develop strategies and foster efforts to improve older driver safety in areas of strategic planning, education and awareness, licensing and driver fitness assessment, roadway engineering, and data analysis. However, knowledge sharing among states on older driver safety initiatives is limited, and officials said states could benefit from knowledge of other states' initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As people age, their physical, visual, and cognitive abilities may deteriorate,  making it more difficult for them to drive safely.

For example, vision declines may reduce the ability to see other vehicles,  traffic signals, signs, lane markings, and pedestrians; cognitive declines  may reduce the ability to recognize traffic conditions, remember  destinations, and make appropriate decisions in operating the vehicle; and  physical declines may reduce the ability to perform movements required to  control the vehicle.", "A particular concern is older drivers with dementia, often as a result of  illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dementia impairs cognitive and  sensory functions causing disorientation, potentially leading to dangerous  driving practices. Age is the most significant risk factor for developing  dementia\u2014approximately 12 percent of those aged 65 to 84 are likely to  develop the condition while over 47 percent of those aged 85 and older are  likely to be afflicted. For drivers with the condition, the risk of being  involved in a crash is two to eight times greater than for those with no  cognitive impairment. However, some drivers with dementia, particularly  in the early stages, may still be capable of driving safely.", "Older drivers experience fewer fatal crashes per licensed driver compared  with drivers in younger age groups; however, on the basis of miles driven,  older drivers have a comparatively higher involvement in fatal crashes.  Over the past decade, the rate of older driver involvement in fatal crashes,  measured on the basis of licensed drivers, has decreased and, overall, older  drivers have a lower rate of fatal crashes than drivers in younger age  groups (see fig. 1). Older drivers\u2019 fatal crash rate per licensed driver is  lower than corresponding rates for drivers in younger age groups, in part,  because older drivers drive fewer miles per year than younger drivers, may  hold licenses even though they no longer drive, and may avoid driving  during times and under conditions when crashes tend to occur, such as  during rush hour or at night. However, on the basis of miles traveled, older  drivers who are involved in a crash are more likely to suffer fatal injuries  than are drivers in younger age groups who are involved in crashes. As  shown in figure 2, drivers aged 65 to 74 are more likely to be involved in a  fatal crash than all but the youngest drivers (aged 16 to 24), and drivers  aged 75 and older are more likely than drivers in all other age groups to be  involved in a fatal crash.", "Older drivers will be increasingly exposed to crash risks because older  adults are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and future  generations of older drivers are expected to drive more miles per year and  at older ages compared with the current older-driver cohort. The U.S.  Census Bureau projects that the population of adults aged 65 and older will  more than double, from 35.1 million people (12.4 percent of total  population) in 2000 to 86.7 million people (20.7 percent of total population)  in 2050 (see fig. 3).", "Intersections pose a particular safety problem for older drivers. Navigating  through intersections requires the ability to make rapid decisions, react  quickly, and accurately judge speed and distance. As these abilities can  diminish through aging, older drivers have more difficulties at intersections  and are more likely to be involved in a fatal crash at these locations.  Research shows that 37 percent of traffic-related fatalities involving drivers  aged 65 and older occur at intersections compared with 18 percent for  drivers aged 26 to 64.

NHTSA focuses on  reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities among older people by  promoting, in conjunction with nongovernmental organizations, research,  education, and programs aimed at identifying older drivers with functional  limitations that impair driving performance. NHTSA has developed several  guides, brochures, and booklets for use by the medical community, law  enforcement officials, older drivers\u2019 family members, and older drivers  themselves that provide guidance on what actions can be taken to improve  older drivers\u2019 capabilities or to compensate for lost capabilities.

Obtaining  input from stakeholders concerned about older driver safety\u2014from both  governmental and nongovernmental organizations\u2014is important because  they can contribute additional information, and can sometimes provide  resources, to address older driver safety issues. For example, elderly  mobility was identified by the Michigan State Safety Commission to be an  emerging issue and, in February 1998, funded the Southeast Michigan  Council of Governments (SEMCOG) to convene a statewide,  interdisciplinary Elderly Mobility and Safety Task Force.

This plan\u2014which  outlines recommendations in the areas of traffic engineering, alternative  transportation, housing and land use, health and medicine, licensing, and  education and awareness\u2014forms the basis for the strategy defined in  Michigan\u2019s SHSP to address older drivers\u2019 mobility and safety.", "Even though 27 state DOTs have reported establishing older driver safety  as a component of their SHSPs, only 4 state DOTs reported including older  driver safety improvement projects in their fiscal year 2007 STIPs.  However, state STIPs may contain projects that will benefit older drivers.  For example, 49 state DOTs reported including funding for intersection  improvements in their STIPs. Because drivers are increasingly more likely  to be involved in an intersection crash as they age, older drivers, in  particular, should benefit from states\u2019 investments in intersection safety  projects, which generally provide improved signage, traffic signals,  turning lanes, and other features consistent with FHWA\u2019s older driver safety  practices.", "Although older driver safety could become a more pressing need in the  future as the population of older drivers increases, states are applying their  resources to areas that pose greater safety concerns. In response to a  question in our survey about the extent to which resources\u2014defined to  include staff hours and funds spent on research, professional services, and  construction contracts\u2014were invested in different types of safety projects,  many state DOTs indicated that they apply resources to a great or very  great extent to safety projects other than those concerning older driver  safety (see table 3).

However, not all states  assure physicians that such reports will be kept confidential, so  physicians may choose not to report patients if they fear retribution in  the form of a lawsuit or loss of the patient\u2019s business.", "Third-party referrals\u2014In addition to reports from physicians, all states  accept third-party referrals of concerns about drivers of any age. Upon  receipt of the referral, the licensing agency may choose to contact the  driver in question to assess the person\u2019s fitness to drive.

To assist states in implementing assessment practices, NHTSA, as  authorized under SAFETEA-LU section 2017, developed a plan to, among  other things, (1) provide information and guidelines to people (medical  providers, licensing personnel, law enforcement officers) who can  influence older drivers and (2) improve the scientific basis for licensing  decisions.

As an element of its plan, NHTSA is cooperating with AAMVA to  create a Medical Review Task Force that will identify areas where  standards of practice to assess the driving of at-risk individuals are possible  and develop strategies for implementing guidelines that states can use in  choosing which practices to adopt. The task force will\u2014in areas such as  vision and cognition\u2014define existing practices used by states and identify  gaps in research to encourage consensus on standards. NHTSA officials  said that work is currently under way to develop neurological guidelines\u2014 which will cover issues related to cognitive assessments\u2014and anticipate  that the task force will report its findings in 2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Have Implemented Coordinating Groups and Other Initiatives to Promote Older Driver Safety", "paragraphs": ["Of the six states we visited, five\u2014California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, and  Michigan\u2014 have active multidisciplinary coordination groups that may  include government, medical, academic, and social service representatives,  among others, to develop strategies and implement efforts to improve older  driver safety. Each of these states identified its coordination group as a  key initiative in improving older driver safety. As shown in table 4, the  coordinating groups originated in different ways and vary in size and  structure. For example, Florida\u2019s At-Risk Driver Council was formally  established under state legislation while Maryland\u2019s group functions on an  ad hoc basis with no statutory authority. The approaches taken by these  groups in addressing older driver safety issues vary as well. For example,  California\u2019s large task force broadly reaches several state agencies and  partner organizations, and the task force leaders oversee the activity of  eight work groups in implementing multiple action items to improve older  driver safety. In contrast, Iowa\u2019s Older Driver Target Area Team is a smaller  group that operates through informal partnerships among member  agencies and is currently providing consulting services to the Iowa  Department of Transportation on the implementation of older driver  strategies identified in Iowa\u2019s Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan.", "Members of the coordination groups we spoke with said that their state  could benefit from information about other states\u2019 practices. For example,  coordinating group members told us that sharing information about leading  road design and licensing practices, legislative initiatives, research efforts,  and model training programs that affect older drivers could support  decisions about whether to implement new practices. Furthermore, group  members said that identifying the research basis for practices could help  them assess the benefits to be derived from implementing a particular  practice. While some mechanisms exist to facilitate information exchanges  on some topics, such as driver fitness assessment and licensing through  AAMVA\u2019s Web site, there is no mechanism for states to share information  on the broad range of efforts related to older driver safety.", "In addition to coordinating groups, the six states have ongoing efforts to  improve older driver safety in the areas of strategic planning, education  and awareness, licensing and driver fitness assessment, engineering, and  data analysis. The following examples highlight specific initiatives and  leading practices in each of these categories.", "Strategic planning\u2014Planning documents establish recommended actions  and provide guidance to stakeholders on ways to improve older driver  safety.", "The Michigan Senior Mobility Action Plan, issued in November 2006,  builds upon the state\u2019s 1999 plan (Elderly Mobility & Safety\u2014The  Michigan Approach) and outlines additional strategies, discusses  accomplishments, and sets action plans in the areas of planning,  research, education and awareness, engineering countermeasures,  alternative transportation, housing and land use, and licensing designed  to (1) reduce the number and severity of crashes involving older drivers  and pedestrians, (2) increase the scope and effectiveness of alternative  transportation options available to older people, (3) assist older people  in maintaining mobility safely for as long as possible, and (4) plan for a  day when driving may no longer be possible.

The system, currently being tested at  limited locations, is being developed to keep people driving safely for as  long as possible by providing a basis for a conditional licensing program  that can aid drivers in improving their driving-relevant functioning and  in adequately compensating for their limitations.", "Oregon requires physicians and other designated medical providers to  report drivers with severe and uncontrollable cognitive or functional  impairments that affect the person\u2019s ability to drive safely. Oregon  Driver and Motor Vehicle Services (ODMVS) evaluates each report and  determines if immediate suspension of driving privileges is necessary. A  person whose driving privileges have been suspended needs to obtain  medical clearance and pass ODMVS vision, knowledge, and road tests in  order to have his or her driving privileges reinstated. In cases where  driving privileges are not immediately suspended, people will normally  be given between 30 and 60 days to pass ODMVS tests or provide  medical evidence indicating that the reported condition does not  present a risk to their safe driving.", "Maryland was the first state to establish a Medical Advisory Board  (MAB)\u2014created by state legislation in 1947\u2014which is currently one of  the most active boards in the United States. Maryland\u2019s MAB manages  approximately 6000 cases per year\u2014most involving older drivers.  Drivers are referred from a number of sources\u2014including physicians,  law enforcement officers, friends, and relatives\u2014and the MAB reviews  screening results, physician reports, and driving records among other  information to determine driving fitness.

In the case of older driver safety, several universities are utilizing  Iowa crash data in research efforts. For example, University of Northern  Iowa researchers utilized crash data and geospatial analysis to  demonstrate how older driver crash locations could be identified and  how roadway elements could be subsequently modified to improve  safety for older drivers. University of Iowa researchers have used the  data in behavioral research to study actions of older drivers and learn  where changes in roadway geometrics, signing, or other roadway  elements could assist older drivers with their driving tasks.

However, the aging of  the American population suggests that older driver safety issues will  become more prominent in the future. Some states\u2014with federal  support\u2014have adopted practices to improve the driving environment for  older road users and have implemented assessment practices to support  licensing requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than  requirements for younger drivers. However, information on the  effectiveness of these practices is limited, and states have been reluctant to  commit resources to initiatives whose effectiveness has not been clearly  demonstrated. Some states have also implemented additional initiatives to  improve older driver safety, such as establishing coordination groups  involving a broad range of stakeholders and developing initiatives in the  areas of strategic planning, education and outreach, assessment and  licensing practices, engineering, and data analysis. NHTSA and FHWA also  have important roles to play in promoting older driver safety, including  conducting and supporting research on standards for the driving  environment and on driver fitness assessment. While states hold differing  views on the importance of older driver safety and have adopted varying  practices to address older driver safety issues, it is clear that there are  steps that states can take to prepare for the anticipated increase in the  older driver population and simultaneously improve safety for all drivers.
