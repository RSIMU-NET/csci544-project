Further, DLA is analyzing that data to identify actual or potential parts availability problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report follows up on our May 2001 recommendation that the Secretary of the Army develop improved estimates of private industry\u2019s spare parts production capability for meeting currently projected wartime scenarios. We made this recommendation after we found that the Army relied on internally generated data rather than on current data from industry to develop its industrial base capability assessments. The Army concurred with our recommendation and cited actions it intends to take. Improvements to industrial base capability assessments could lead to increased readiness and to reduced costs for unneeded wartime spare parts inventories In this report, we address whether (1) the Army has begun to collect and use current industrial base data and (2) opportunities exist to improve the reliability of the Army\u2019s industrial base capability assessments.", "To accomplish this review, we interviewed Army officials who are responsible for estimating the requirements and developing budgets for war reserve spare parts and for assessing what portion of those requirements private industry is capable of providing. We also talked with officials from the Defense Logistics Agency about its industrial base assessment program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s current policy calls for each military service to determine its requirements and acquire sufficient war reserve materiel for the execution of current wartime scenarios and to be able to sustain these operations until being re-supplied. Thus, in developing their plans, the services must consider the availability of spare parts in their peacetime operating stocks, their war reserve spare parts inventories, and from the industrial base, and then estimate what additional materiel they need to buy. The Army\u2019s industrial base and stationing strategies and DOD\u2019s regulations reflect the importance of the industrial base in supporting wartime operations and require the services to rely on the industrial base to the maximum extent possible. In addition, the Army is required to maintain a viable capability to monitor and assess the health of the industrial base and identify potential risks.", "The U.S. Army Materiel Command is responsible for determining the Army\u2019s requirements for war reserve spare parts, as well as the Army\u2019s estimate of what private industry can be expected to provide during wartime, in order to derive the war reserve spare parts shortfall. It receives technical expertise from the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Agency in determining its war reserve requirements and an estimate of what can be expected from private industry. The Command\u2019s major subordinate commands are responsible for purchasing specific types of materiel, such as aviation, tank, automotive, and communications parts, and they have a limited number of industrial base specialists who can be assigned to provide data for assessments. Figure 1 illustrates the steps that the Army follows to determine its war reserve shortfall.", "To plan how much war reserve materiel it needs to buy, the Army develops estimates of when spare parts will be available from the industrial base during wartime so that it can determine how much war reserve materiel it needs to buy and put into its war reserve inventory. In preparing its estimates, the Army first calculates the total amount of war materiel that it needs to support current wartime scenarios. Specifically, it calculates its requirements by using a computer model that considers several factors, such as spare parts usage and breakage rates. Next, it determines the amount of peacetime and war reserve inventories that are available to meet that requirement. The Army then applies the amount it estimates the industrial base can be expected to provide during wartime. The remaining amount is considered the total spare parts shortfall. The total shortfall can then be divided into the amount for which Congress has authorized funding, any amounts budgeted for future years, and an additional amount the Army has not yet requested from Congress.", "As table 2 shows, in preparation for its fiscal year 2003 budget submission to Congress (part of the fiscal year 2003-2007 out-of-cycle Program Objective Memorandum), the Army calculated that it required $3.30 billion for its wartime spare parts. Of this amount, it estimated that $1.93 billion worth of spare parts would be available from peacetime and war reserve inventories. Another $0.13 billion expected to be available from private industry was applied. The resulting total spare parts shortfall was $1.24 billion. Of this amount, the Army has been funded $0.11 billion for fiscal years 2000-2002 and expects to request $0.47 billion in fiscal years 2003-2007. Overall the Army reports a total spare parts shortfall of approximately $0.66 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Industrial Base Assessments Do Not Use Current Industry Data", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s approach for assessing wartime spare parts industrial base capability still does not use current data from industry. Rather, the Army\u2019s assessments of industry\u2019s capability to produce spare parts in wartime depend on historical data and lead-time factors that the Army develops itself. Without current data on industry\u2019s capability, assessments could be unreliable, resulting in reduced readiness due to critical spare parts shortfalls in wartime or inflated and costly war reserve spare parts inventories in peacetime. Moreover, the Army\u2019s budget requests to Congress for war reserve spare parts risk being inaccurate.", "In the past, the Army collected data directly from private industry through paper questionnaires to industry representatives that were up to 22 pages long. It stopped this practice primarily because of the poor response rates. According to Army Materiel Command officials, industry representatives said they saw no apparent direct benefit from filling in the lengthy questionnaires and, moreover, felt they should be compensated for their time and effort. We were told that command officials themselves do not believe that collecting current data from industry is cost-effective.", "Now, rather than collecting current data from private industry, the Army uses data that it acquired several years ago from private industry to create lead-time factors for estimating its wartime industrial base capability. These factors are based on out-of-date industry data. Furthermore they were developed from a limited range of spare part items but were applied to all parts needed for war. For example, in developing its fiscal year 2003 budget submission to Congress, the Army used a formula with wartime lead-time factors that were derived from estimated accelerated peacetime administrative lead times and production lead times. These accelerated lead-time factors of 85 and 61 percent, respectively, were based on data obtained prior to 1998 for specific items, such as howitzers, that were managed by the Army Tank and Automotive Command\u2019s Rock Island facility. According to an Army document, this method of calculating lead times fails to account for variations that exist from item to item and can lead to unrealistic industrial base capability estimates. For example, a 1998 Army study found that 44 of 86 parts assumed to be supported by industry could not be and that 176 of 218 parts that were assumed not to be supported by the industrial base were.", "Partly in response to the recommendation in our prior report, the Army has several initiatives underway to improve its industrial base capability assessments, but these initiatives continue to focus on historical, rather than current industry data. In one initiative, the Army is developing a new approach to calculate its wartime spare parts requirements, in part, from data collected from private industry during 1998. In another, the Army Materiel Command has designed a tool\u2014called the Industrial Base Hub\u2014 that brings together in one Web-based automated system a broad range of existing industrial base data. The data consist of war reserve requirements, producer capabilities, contract awards and actions, contractor businesses, and commercial businesses and finances. The Industrial Base Hub relies on historical data rather than on current data from industry. In a third initiative, the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Agency has proposed periodically collecting data on production lead times for the 100 costliest spare parts, which account for 70 percent of the total dollar value of the entire wartime spare parts requirement. The Army Materiel Systems Analysis Agency believes that collecting current data periodically from the private manufacturers of the top 100 costliest spare parts could be a reasonable way to get a cost-effective, reliable industrial base offset estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Improve the Reliability of the Army\u2019s Industrial Base Capability Assessments", "paragraphs": ["The Army could improve the reliability of its industrial base assessments by considering several key attributes present in DLA\u2019s industrial base assessment program.

DLA\u2019s assessment program, called the Worldwide Web Industrial Capabilities Assessment Program, was started in the fall of 1999. It consists of a data collection tool and an analytical tool, which is used to create management strategies. (See appendix I for a more detailed description.) The data collection tool provides the capability to gather new and updated information directly from private companies via the Internet. Company representatives voluntarily respond to a series of on-line survey questions that, depending on how answered, are self- tailored to that company to simplify and speed up the survey process.", "Private companies provide information on what spare part items they can provide (or are willing to provide); what quantities they can produce; how long it will take to produce them under different scenarios (e.g., normal or crisis conditions); and what potential bottlenecks (e.g., availability of certain materials, or equipment constraints) exist that could limit the production of certain spare parts. DLA validates this information as part of its assessment process before acting on the information.", "The program\u2019s analytical tool provides analysts with immediate access to the automated data collected from industry. This provides the capability to develop timely and reliable assessments of industry\u2019s ability to provide various spare parts in peacetime as well as wartime. In addition, it provides the capability to use the analytical data to identify actual or potential parts availability problems (e.g., items with unusually long lead times or items that are involved in bottlenecks) and, based on this information, to create a management strategy for resolving these problems, for example, by changing its acquisitions procedures or targeting investments in material and technology resources to reduce production lead times."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of DLA\u2019s Assessment Program", "paragraphs": ["Although DLA\u2019s industrial base assessment program is relatively new, it provides a number of examples that illustrate the effectiveness of collecting current data directly from the industrial base. Table 3 shows the impact on production lead time when it is based on up-to-date industry data. For example, clamp couplings for tanks, aircraft, and aircraft engines have a production lead time of 35 days during a crisis (surge) situation rather than a lead time of 156 days (lead time of record) previously estimated by DLA for normal, or peacetime, situations.", "This more reliable information could result in greater economy in purchasing decisions. For example, private industry says it can provide a resilient mount within 70 days during a crisis rather than in the 163 days that DLA previously estimated. The war reserve requirement for this item occurs during the first 3 months of a war. The reduction in production lead time from 163 to 70 days means that the third month could be covered with a savings of $4,810 by not buying the items. Likewise, the war reserve requirement for the centrifugal fan spreads over the first 6 months of a war with the bulk occurring during the last 3 months. The lead-time reduction from 109 days to 56 days means that months 2-6 could be covered with a savings of $62,560 by not buying the items.", "Additional benefits from the assessment program stem from evaluating currently collected and analyzed information to identify potential problems with production and create various management strategies to resolve them. For example, by identifying an unusually long lead time for a cesium lamp and examining the reasons for this, DLA was able to ultimately reduce the lamp\u2019s lead time of 360 days to only 30 days. The lamp is used on several types of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force aircraft in electronic counter measure systems to defeat infrared missiles. The lamp cartridge, which is a critical element used in these systems, is made of exotic materials and operates at extreme temperatures and power levels.", "An industrial capabilities assessment concluded that the lead time of record for this item was 360 days. Negotiations with the vendor, however, reduced this to 300 days. The lead time of 300 days is due to the use of highly technical processes and several long-lead-time materials in its production. Because of the unique nature of the cesium lamp, additional measures were needed to reduce the lead time further. As part of a targeted investment, DLA awarded a contract to preposition and rotate long-lead materials and partially finished components, resulting in a further 270-day reduction in lead time to 30 days. As a result, DLA is spending $530,000 for this investment, compared with the $1.1 million it would cost to purchase and store an equivalent amount of finished product to meet war reserve requirements, saving approximately $600,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Industrial Base Capability Assessments Can Be Improved", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s approach for assessing wartime spare parts industrial base capability can be improved.

Table 4 compares the DLA and Army industrial base assessment approaches for the three key attributes.", "By focusing on the above attributes, DLA\u2019s industrial base capability assessment program has become an improved, simplified, time-saving process for companies to provide current production capability data. For example, the process uses a streamlined Internet based data collection tool that industry representatives say is an improvement over the old paper process.

However, it did not concur that the Army should change its current process to be consistent with attributes of the DLA program.  It stated that the Army\u2019s current system already applies many of these attributes and must have the flexibility to do so in its own manner consistent with its specific requirements and resources. As we reported, our analysis shows the Army\u2019s program does not have all the key attributes such as collecting current industrial base capability data from industry.  Furthermore, we considered the Army\u2019s need for flexibility in managing and executing its program when developing our recommendation by stating that the Army should be consistent with\u2014not necessarily mirror the attributes of DLA\u2019s program.  Therefore, we continue to believe our recommendation is appropriate.", "DOD agreed with the underlying premise of our second recommendation that the most accurate data lead to the most accurate estimates.  However, it stated that we provided no evidence that more current data would result in a more accurate forecast of industry\u2019s capability to provide parts for war. As pointed out in our report, DLA provided examples of how it could save money by using current data it collected from industry, such as over $62,000 on the centrifugal fan. Furthermore, we noted that a study done by the Army in 1998 showed that data collected at that time about actual industrial base capability significantly disagreed with the Army\u2019s estimated industrial base capability. The department also did not agree to a comprehensive data collection effort because keeping more current data does not warrant additional resources and stated that it will direct the Army examine the feasibility of attempting to proactively collect production data for a limited number of items. We recognized the potential for such an initiative in our report and stated that the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Agency believes that periodically collecting current data on the top 100 costliest spare parts could be a reasonable approach. Although this is a good first step, a comprehensive effort to collect current industrial base capability data directly from industry is basic to the recommendation\u2019s underlying premise and is a best practice. Therefore we continue to believe that our recommendation has merit.", "DOD concurred with the point of our third recommendation that there is a need to identify potential production capability problems such as those resulting from a wartime surge in demand for spare parts.  However, it did not agree that the Army does not have such a process.  While the Army\u2019s approach may have many analytical features, it does not provide specific analyses of production capability.  Such analyses contribute to identifying possible production capability problems and could enhance the Army\u2019s management decisions.  Therefore, we continue to recommend that the Army create such analytical tools.  Furthermore, in response to DOD\u2019s comment about the need to validate survey data on production capability before taking action, we added information to our report stating that DLA does validate its industry surveys as part of its process.", "With regard to our fourth recommendation, DOD concurred with the concept that management strategies are needed to resolve spare parts availability problems.  But, it disagreed with the implication that the Army has no such strategies.
