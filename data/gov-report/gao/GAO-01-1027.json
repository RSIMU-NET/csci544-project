The FTAA agreement would eliminate tariffs and create common trade and investment rules among the 34 democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere. When completed, the FTAA agreement will cover about 800 million people, more than $11 trillion in production, and $3.4 trillion in world trade. The five FTAA negotiating groups pursuing liberalization of trade and investment--market access, agriculture, investment, services, and government procurement--have submitted initial proposals and agreed on a date to begin market access negotiations, but the groups face short-term and long-term issues. In the short-term, these groups must resolve several practical issues in order to begin negotiations on market access schedules no later than May 15, 2002, and to narrow differences and prepare revised trade rule chapters by August 2002. Over the long-term, these market-opening groups face fundamental questions about how much and how fast to liberalize. Narrowing outstanding differences may be difficult for the four other negotiating groups, which have made initial proposals on rules governing intellectual property; subsidies, antidumping, and countervailing duties; competition policy; and dispute settlement. Some groups face fundamental differences. Other negotiating groups have reached agreement on basic principles but disagree on key details. Two of the three crosscutting themes--smaller economies and civil society--have proven controversial. Because the FTAA's smaller economies are concerned about their capacity to implement such a vast agreement and its potential economic effects on their countries, they have been seeking assurances of technical assistance and other special treatment. The FTAA process has been viewed as not sufficiently open to the public, and past efforts to include nongovernmental interests, such as business, labor, the environment, and academia, have been widely seen as ineffective. Some steps have been taken to address these concerns, and other steps are being considered. As a comprehensive agreement, the FTAA could have wide-ranging effects on U.S. trade and investment with other Western Hemisphere countries. The elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers would improve U.S. market access; put U.S. exporters on an equal footing with competitors in FTAA markets; and expand trade, particularly in highly protected sectors such as agriculture. On the other hand, some protected U.S. sectors, including textiles, apparel, and agriculture, may face increased import competition and declining production if barriers were lowered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we review the negotiations toward a Free Trade Area of the  Americas (FTAA) agreement.

These negotiations are an  extension of the economic reform and integration that has occurred in  much of the hemisphere over the past decade, fueling increased trade and  investment within and outside of the region.

Following a serious debt crisis,  sluggish economic growth, and spiraling inflation in the 1980s, most Latin  American economies shifted their economic strategies from protected,  state-assisted industrialization to externally oriented, export-driven  development.  These strategies included lowering trade barriers and taking  steps to attract foreign investment.  As a result, economic growth doubled,  rising from 1.7 percent on average in the 1980s to 3.4 percent in the 1990s;  inflation decreased significantly; and trade expanded rapidly.", "All but 1 of the 34 nations participating in FTAA negotiations are members  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which sets trade rules on a global  basis through a process of multilateral negotiations among its members.   As part of their economic liberalization programs of the past decade,  countries in the Western Hemisphere have also pursued economic  integration through numerous free trade and customs union agreements.   The largest trading bloc outside of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) is Mercosur, which comprises Brazil, Argentina,  Paraguay, and Uruguay.  Other regional blocs include the Caribbean  Community and Common Market (CARICOM), the Andean Community,  and the Central American Common Market (CACM).  Countries in the  region, particularly Mexico and Chile, have concluded numerous bilateral  free trade and investment agreements with others in the region.  These  subregional agreements provide greater access for industrial goods and  have sometimes covered agriculture, services, and investment.  Countries  in the Western Hemisphere also are making agreements with those outside  of the hemisphere.  Mexico recently concluded a free trade agreement with  the European Union (EU), and Chile and Mercosur are negotiating their  own bilateral free trade agreements with the EU.", "Trade among Latin American countries and between Latin America and the  rest of the world expanded rapidly during the 1990s.  Overall trade by the  region grew by 10.8 percent annually on average, outpacing world trade  growth (6.6 percent) over the same period.  However, intra-regional trade  between members of the same trade blocs grew faster than extra-regional  trade.  This was particularly true for Mercosur and the Andean Community,  where intra-regional trade grew twice as fast as extra-regional trade.  Trade  within Latin America as a whole also grew faster than trade between Latin  America and the rest of the world (see fig. 1).", "Although the 1990s was a decade of continued reform and expanded trade,  new challenges arose.  For example, Mexico and Brazil both faced serious  financial crises in 1995 and 1998, respectively\u2014Hurricane Mitch devastated  parts of Central America in 1998, and the Andean region has struggled with  political instability and effects of the drug trade.  Also, Argentina has been  mired in recession and has recently faced its own financial crisis.  Despite  reforms, many countries still face high unemployment rates and wide  disparities between the wealthy and the poor.  These economic and social  obstacles create challenges for continued reform, economic development,  and liberalization.", "The prospects for the FTAA agreement, which evolved out of the reform  process, will be affected by how well countries resolve these challenges.   At the same time, a successfully concluded FTAA agreement may help  secure the liberalization that has already taken place and extend it to new  areas.  Beyond these economic benefits, the FTAA is widely regarded as a  centerpiece of efforts to forge closer and more productive ties among  Western Hemisphere nations, increase political stability, and strengthen  democracy.  While the FTAA should provide benefits, it may also adversely  affect certain sectors.  In addition, some labor and environmental groups  are concerned that potential FTAA provisions may reduce the ability of  countries to set and enforce high standards for health, safety, and the  environment.

We  reviewed formal comments about the FTAA that were made in response to  Federal Register notices and submitted to the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR).  We also met with experts on the FTAA and  international trade negotiations and representatives from business and civil  society groups that have expressed interest in the FTAA process.  In  addition, we traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to take part in the  Americas Business Forum and Academic Colloquium associated with the  FTAA Trade Ministerial and attended public briefings by USTR and the  Department of State for civil society representatives.", "To address the fourth objective, we analyzed U.S. and regional trade and  investment data from 1990 to 2000, current U.S. and regional trade barriers,  and market-distorting government policies.  We also examined the extent  to which FTAA countries were members of multilateral and bilateral trade  and investment agreements with the United States.  U.S. merchandise trade  data came from Department of Commerce official trade statistics.  Exports  were measured in terms of domestic exports at \u201cfree alongside ship\u201d value.   Imports were measured in terms of imports for consumption at customs  value.  U.S. services trade and investment data came from the Bureau of  Economic Analysis\u2019 Survey of Current Business.  World trade data came  from the United Nations international trade database.  U.S. tariff data came  from the U.S. International Trade Commission.  Some tariff rates are given  as specfic rates of duty (e.g., $5 per bushel) rather than ad valorem  (percentage of value) rates.  Ad valorem equivalent rates are conversions of  specific rates to ad valorem rates, which allow average tariff rates to be  calculated.  To the extent that they were available from the International  Trade Commission, these rates were used in the calculation of overall  average tariff rates.  U.S. trade and tariff data were analyzed at the eight- digit level of detail based on the harmonized system.  For determining U.S.  imports subject to duties, the tariff schedule was combined with  disaggregated trade data that identified imports by preferential trade  program.  Other FTAA countries\u2019 average tariff rates came from the World  Bank and the IDB.  In some instances, these organizations calculated  different average tariff rates for the same country in the same year.  For  example, the World Bank lists Uruguay\u2019s average tariff rate at about 4.5  percent in 1999, while the IDB reports an average tariff rate at above 12  percent.  For consistency, we reported World Bank calculated tariffs,  unless they were not available for a particular country.  In that case, we  reported IDB tariff rates.", "We relied on reports by the International Trade Commission on U.S.  services trade; the International Trade Commission and the United Nations  on U.S. and world investment; and the WTO, OAS, IDB, and ECLAC on each  of the negotiating areas.  We did not estimate an economywide model of the  overall effects of the FTAA.  We did review economic studies that analyze  some aspects of FTAA liberalization in an economywide framework.  We  also did not estimate the impact of an FTAA on production, labor, and  prices overall or for individual sectors of the U.S. economy.", "For all four objectives, we relied on our past and ongoing work on trade  liberalization in the Western Hemisphere.  Because FTAA negotiation  ground rules only allow countries to divulge their own positions, this report  generally does not name the countries holding particular positions unless  officials from those countries told us that it was acceptable to do so.  We  acknowledge that we analyzed the FTAA from the U.S. perspective, not that  of other countries participating in the process.  Finally, given the relatively  early stage of FTAA negotiations, and the recent emergence of key  information, such as a public version of the draft agreement, U.S. civil  society groups and the public that either favor or oppose the FTAA are  likely to be forthcoming with more concrete positions on FTAA negotiating  topics.

The FTAA negotiating group on market access  is responsible for conducting the negotiations to eliminate tariffs on trade  among the 34 countries.  Before substantive negotiations can begin on the  elimination of tariffs on specific goods, however, participating countries  must agree on the methods and modalities, or ground rules, they will follow  during later negotiations.  FTAA countries must agree on the following:  The base rate or starting point from which tariffs will be reduced.", "This issue involves reaching consensus on whether to use current  (applied) rates, bound rates, or some other measure as the base from  which to start negotiating.  Current or applied rates are the tariff rates a  country currently levies on particular goods.  Bound tariffs are the  maximum duties that a country has committed in the WTO to apply on  those goods.  Under WTO rules, a country may increase its applied rates  up to but no higher than its bound rates.  In practice, applied rates are  often significantly lower.  FTAA countries must determine the starting  point, or base rate, from which tariffs will be eliminated.  The higher this  initial starting point, the longer it may take for actual tariff reductions to  be realized.  For example, if countries use the bound rate as the starting  point, they may not be required to cut their applied rates until later in  the reduction period.    However, if the applied rate is used as the  starting point, then importers will see liberalization within the first years  of the agreement. To ensure that phased duty reductions produce  genuine market openings, the United States is proposing that the base  rate from which tariffs are phased out be the lower of either a product\u2019s  most favored nation applied rate in effect during the FTAA negotiations  or the WTO bound rate at the end of the FTAA negotiating process.", "Pace of tariff elimination.  This issue aims to define the process and  timing used by countries to reduce a product\u2019s tariff to zero.   A common  approach is to divide goods into baskets.  For example, the tariffs on  one basket of goods could be reduced to zero in 5 years, another basket  in 7 years, and a third in 10 years.  According to WTO rules tariffs must  be eliminated on substantially all products within 10 years. The United  States has proposed that products be grouped into three baskets with  tariffs eliminated either immediately, in 5 years, or in 10 years for the  most sensitive.", "Reference period for trade data.

Negotiations on rules of origin may be complex if they are  specified differently for specific products and entail unique requirements.   Also, origin rules may be more restrictive for some sensitive products.  For  example, under two unilateral trade programs, the United States recently  offered tariff preferences for import-sensitive apparel imports, but only if  producers use certain U.S.-made fabrics and materials to produce them.    Rules of origin are intended to ensure that the benefits of a free trade  agreement primarily accrue to the countries covered by the agreement.   However, the more restrictive the requirements are for particular products,  the more difficult it is for exporters to qualify for the preferential duty.   Restrictive rules of origin requirements have been identified as a reason  why some exporters do not fully use special tariff preferences offered to  them.", "Negotiators must agree upon the types of origin requirements they will use  in the FTAA agreement.  There are generally two types of origin  requirements.  The first are value tests, which confer origin on the basis of  the percentage of value added in a country.  For example, a value test may  confer origin if at least 60 percent of the worth of a product comes either  from FTAA inputs or the production process in an FTAA country.   The  second type of origin requirement is the tariff shift approach.  This  approach confers origin if the production process transforms a product and  its inputs enough to classify it as a different product in the tariff schedule.   For example, a tariff shift approach might confer origin if a final product,  such as a washing machine, is categorized differently on the tariff schedule  than its individual parts.", "With the tariff shift approach, countries also must decide at what level of  detail on the tariff schedule the shift takes place and whether to make  those decisions on a product-by-product basis.  For example, two products  may be in the same aggregate grouping, such as automobiles and auto  parts, but they may be in different groups at a more detailed level.  The U.S.  unilateral preference programs, such as the Generalized System of  Preferences, generally follow a value-added approach, while NAFTA  generally uses a tariff shift approach.  Several Latin American trade  agreements have used a combination of a value-added approach with a  tariff shift approach at one uniform level of detail.  The United States  supports a tariff shift approach for the FTAA, but without a uniform rule for  the level of detail for the shift.

Some countries have proposed that the FTAA go  beyond the current WTO agreement on agricultural domestic supports by  reducing and eliminating some supports that are currently permitted.   These countries feel that that much of their trade protection comes in the  form of tariffs, and, if they eliminate tariffs, their products would be  disadvantaged in the face of subsidized products.  Brazilian officials have  been particularly vocal on the issue of domestic supports, declaring that  the negotiations could not proceed if the United States refuses to address  domestic support programs.  The United States, however, has publicly  stated that commitments to domestic support reduction can only be  achieved in multilateral negotiations, such as those in the WTO.  U.S.  negotiators argue that because U.S. competitors, such as the EU, employ  such supports, reducing them in the FTAA instead of the WTO would  amount to unilateral disarmament.

Two FTAA experts reported that they expect certain products  will receive special treatment in the negotiations, such as longer phase-out  periods or outright exceptions to tariff elimination.  Others have stated that  they oppose exceptions to tariff elimination for agricultural products.  The  issue of product exceptions will be controversial because many of the  products that are sensitive to one country are strong exports for another.   For example, Brazil has called for increased access to the U.S. orange juice  market and is a major producer of sugar, two products for which the United  States maintains relatively high tariffs.  However, both industries have  asked U.S. negotiators to exclude their products from the negotiations.

If they eliminated their own subsidies within the hemisphere, they  would face a disadvantage in the face of third-party countries that use  export subsidies on products coming into the hemisphere.  Similarly, FTAA  countries disagree on whether they need to create rules on the use of  export subsidies outside of the hemisphere.  Solutions proposed so far  have included negotiating with third parties not to apply their subsidies,  suspending tariff preferences, and allowing for the option of fines if export  subsidies are used in either of these situations.  Some FTAA countries want  to go beyond the definition of an export subsidy currently used by the WTO  agreement on agriculture to include other programs, such as export credits,  credit guarantees, insurance programs, and food aid.  The United States,  however, has proposed using the WTO definition of export subsidies.  The  United States does not want export credits; export credit guarantees or  insurance programs, when provided in a manner consistent with WTO  rights and obligations; and international food aid to be considered to  constitute export subsidies for purposes of the FTAA, but it does call for  the staged elimination of exclusive export rights granted to state trading  enterprises (such as the Canadian Wheat Board).", "FTAA countries have agreed to fully implement the WTO SPS agreement  but have not agreed on how best to accomplish that goal.

Companies can  establish a commercial presence by investing, but unlike the WTO, the  FTAA has a separate negotiating group on investment (discussed below).

The WTO already has  additional agreements on basic telecommunications and financial services,  but not all FTAA countries are signatories or have fully adopted these  agreements.

There are two  approaches to scheduling services commitments: a top-down \u201cnegative list\u201d  approach and a bottom-up \u201cpositive list\u201d approach.  In a negative list, all  service sectors are subject to the core rules, and countries must then  indicate which sectors or measures they would seek to exclude from  coverage.  For example, a services agreement may have a \u201cnational  treatment\u201d provision that foreign service providers will be treated at least  as well as domestic service providers.  If a country intends to subject  foreign service providers in the insurance industry to additional  regulations, then it would need to take an exception to the national  treatment rule.  The positive list approach works the opposite way.  A  country specifies in its schedule only the commitments it plans to make.  If  a sector is not included in the schedule, then it is not covered by the  agreement.  The WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services generally  follows a positive list approach, and NAFTA follows a negative list  approach.", "The United States advocates using the negative list approach in the FTAA  services chapter, arguing that it is ambitious but allows countries the  flexibility to deal with domestic sensitivities (by scheduling reservations).   Other FTAA countries, however, have proposed using a positive list  approach or some variant.  Although most major subregional agreements in  the Western Hemisphere have used a negative list, Mercosur used a positive  list approach for its services liberalization.  Business representatives  throughout the hemisphere that met at the April ministerial were split over  whether the FTAA should use a positive or negative list approach.  Some  U.S. civil society and labor groups oppose using a negative list approach  because they believe it later may limit government social policies if  exceptions for particular sectors are not built into the agreement.  They are  concerned that countries could use a comprehensive services agreement to  challenge government provision of social services, such as health and  education, if those services compete with private sector firms.  USTR has  stated that it does not intend to use the FTAA to promote the privatization  of social services.", "Negotiators will also have to agree on the timing of liberalization to be  achieved through the market access commitments.  Countries will begin in  May 2002 to negotiate the schedules of commitments to allow access into  their markets.  Since this phase has not yet begun, countries generally have  not revealed their goals nor is it clear how difficult it will be to resolve  differences.  However, U.S. service companies are considered some of the  most competitive in the world, and some FTAA countries may be  concerned about the final commitments they will make and the speed at  which liberalization will take place.  Related to this, the draft text includes  potential language on a safeguard mechanism for services.  A safeguard  measure may provide negotiators some incentive to commit to greater  liberalization because they will have a mechanism to ease potentially  adverse effects.  The negotiators\u2019 mandate calls for the progressive  liberalization of trade in services, but achieving this may be difficult for two  reasons.  First, services involve domestic regulatory and qualitative  provisions that may in practice restrict foreigner\u2019s access to markets.   Given these domestic regulations, free market access may be hard to  define.  Second, countries may differ on whether to \u201cprogressively  liberalize\u201d services means to achieve full liberalization through one round  of negotiations or through a series of rounds in future years, which would  be scheduled in the agreement.

The United States  remains divided domestically on this issue.  Late in 2000, the United States  tabled language similar to NAFTA stating that countries agree not to relax  environmental or labor standards to attract investment.  However, strong  opposition from most other FTAA nations on the grounds that labor and  environmental provisions were \u201coff the table\u201d in FTAA negotiations  resulted in the initial exclusion of this proposal from the draft chapter.

Consistent with the goal of obtaining a comprehensive agreement, the  United States proposed that nondiscriminatory treatment apply to the  \u201cpreestablishment\u201d phase of investment, which would, except where  parties negotiate reservations for sensitive sectors,  effectively accord the  signatories\u2019 investors the right to establish, acquire, or expand an  investment on an equal footing with domestic and other foreign investors.   Other FTAA participants also support covering the preestablishment phase.   However, even though many FTAA nations have unilaterally liberalized  foreign investors\u2019 entry, some are reluctant to guarantee a general right of  establishment to foreign investors in an FTAA.", "Another difficult issue is whether and how to cover portfolio investment. A  majority of countries, including the United States, have proposed a broad,  asset-based definition of investment that includes portfolio investment,  some contracts and concessions, and intellectual property.  However, they  differ on the specific details of this definition.  For example, some propose  to narrow the definition to exclude speculative and certain other  transactions and to allow governments to limit transfers if problems arise.  Given the Asian financial crisis and concern that short-term fluctuations in  capital flows contribute to currency fluctuations and balance of payments  crises, certain nations oppose covering portfolio investment in the  definition at all.  Other countries propose addressing this concern by  providing an exception to the transfers protections for these situations,  rather than foreclosing portfolio investment from all protections of the  agreement.", "Approaches to performance requirements also differ.  Performance  requirements\u2014such as local content, trade balancing, local hiring or  management, and technology transfer requirements\u2014are sometimes  conditions for obtaining incentives or benefits from the host government  and can also be conditions for establishing an investment.  The United  States proposes to go beyond the WTO Trade-Related Investment Measures  or \"TRIMS\" agreement and current bilateral investment treaties in  prohibiting (subject to certain exceptions) several such performance  requirements and is proposing disciplines similar to NAFTA.  NAFTA and  the U.S. FTAA proposal discipline certain performance requirements  whether they are tied to an advantage or imposed as a condition for  establishment.

First, some FTAA nations slowed progress in the previous phase of  negotiations.  In part, this was due to a fundamental reticence by some  FTAA nations to go beyond their current obligations under the WTO  Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS).   Also, because of its importance to the overall FTAA package, which will be  a \u201csingle undertaking,\u201d some nations reportedly tried to ensure that  negotiations on IPR did not get ahead of negotiations on topics of more  interest to them, such as agriculture or subsidies, antidumping, and  countervailing duties, according to U.S. officials.  Second, the subject of  IPR is complex. Each area involves a different agency, specialty, or  industry, which makes the negotiating environment challenging.  Third, the  interests of FTAA participants in IPR differ widely.  The United States, the  leading proponent in FTAA IPR negotiations, is pushing for a state-of-the- art IPR agreement that reflects changes in technology, improved  international rules, and better enforcement.  The U.S. proposal for the  FTAA chapter on intellectual property goes beyond the obligations that the  United States and most FTAA countries have undertaken through the  TRIPS agreement.  It would extend NAFTA disciplines to countries  elsewhere in the region.  The United States is particularly interested in  strengthened enforcement of IPR because many FTAA countries have been  lax in enforcing TRIPS provisions.  (See ch. 5 for estimates of the economic  impact of lax IPR enforcement.)  Copyright piracy, for example, is still  commonplace. The United States also wants to ensure that the FTAA does  not undermine IPR protections secured under the WTO and NAFTA.", "Developing countries in the region have not traditionally been strong  supporters of IPR.  However, in the past decade, along with other economic  reforms and the advent of TRIPS, they have experienced a progressive  evolution in views and policies in favor of greater IPR protection.  Laws  and institutions now exist in key nations such as Mexico, Brazil, and  Argentina, according to trade experts.  However, some FTAA countries are  reluctant to take on obligations beyond TRIPS, particularly since many  improvements in IPR resulting from the FTAA will have to apply  unconditionally to all other WTO nations under the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d  principle contained in Article 4 of the TRIPS agreement.  In addition, some  FTAA countries have identified areas such as traditional knowledge and  folklore that can benefit them within an IPR regime.  However, these  countries face resource and technical challenges to effectively enforcing  IPR and believe that there may be trade-offs between stronger IPR  enforcement  and other domestic objectives.", "Because IPR negotiations are at a relatively early stage, it is difficult to tell  which issues will prove controversial, a U.S. official said.  Potentially  difficult subjects for negotiation include\u2014copyrights in a digital era,  compulsory licensing, limitations to patentabilty, enforcement, and the  relationship of trademarks to geographical indications.  Proposals by other  FTAA nations on folklore, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge  also may pose difficulties for the negotiators.", "In the area of copyrights, the United States is proposing to ensure  protection of copyrighted works in a digital environment by having the  FTAA incorporate the substantive provisions of two treaties concluded in  1996 under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization  (WIPO).  These treaties deal with music, programs, and literary works  provided over the Internet.  Although a number of countries in the  hemisphere already have acceded to the WIPO treaties, others have yet to  do so.  The WIPO provisions provide important new rights, such as an  exclusive right for authors to make their works available on-line.  However,  the United States faces resistance to its proposal.  Some nations do not  want to go beyond their current TRIPS obligations.  Others object to the  U.S. proposal because it contains language intended to clarify certain  principles contained in WIPO treaties.  For example, the WIPO treaty  prohibits tampering with technology designed to prevent unauthorized  access to protected works, performances, and phonograms.  The U.S. FTAA  proposal clarifies that this prohibition must cover both the building of  devices capable of tampering with the protected subject matter (e.g.,  decoding devices) and the actions of actually doing so (e.g., hacking), with  appropriate exceptions permitted.", "There are also many contentious issues in the area of patents.  For  example, compulsory licensing, or government permission to produce a  patented product or process without authorization of the patent holder, is a  contentious issue in the IPR debate over the proper balance between  providing incentives for research and the need for public access.  This is  especially acute with regard to making medicines affordable and  accessible.  In FTAA negotiations, the United States proposes to clearly  specify the circumstances under which FTAA members can grant  compulsory licenses.  Another FTAA participant has proposed that FTAA  members should be given greater scope to grant compulsory licenses,  including if a patent holder does not \u201cwork\u201d the patented product within a  specified period of time.  The positions of other FTAA participants range  from keeping the status quo under TRIPS\u2014which does not specify the  circumstances when governments can grant compulsory licenses, but sets  procedural requirements when doing so\u2014to easing TRIPS\u2019 procedural  requirements.", "The issue of whether certain items can or should be excluded from  patentability is another on which FTAA members diverge significantly, with  three major options proposed.  First, reflecting U.S. leadership in medical  and agricultural biotechnology, the United States is trying to narrow (from  TRIPS) the categories of products or processes for which patents may be  refused.  The United States is proposing that the FTAA result in a  requirement for members to grant patents for all subject matter except  medical and diagnostic procedures, provided that the basic criteria for  granting a patent are met\u2014namely, that they are new, involve an inventive  step, and are capable of industrial application.  FTAA countries would  retain the right under TRIPS to refuse patents for products or processes  whose commercial use in FTAA countries would jeopardize public order or  morality, or seriously jeopardize human, animal, or plant health or the  environment.  The second option, proposed by other FTAA countries, is  that FTAA members retain the right to exclude plants and animals (other  than microorganisms) and biological processes from patentability, even if  they otherwise met the criteria for patentability.  The third option proposed  is that FTAA members be prohibited from granting patents for plants,  animals, and biological processes.", "Enforcement is also an important issue in the FTAA negotiations.  The  United States has serious concerns about the enforcement of IPR in the  FTAA region and has proposed various steps to bolster enforcement  through the FTAA.  For example, the United States has proposed that  violators may be required to pay damages for IPR violations commensurate  with the harm suffered, including compensation that is based on the full  retail value.  Other FTAA participants, particularly developing countries,  have resisted the United States on the issue of enforcement.  Many of these  FTAA participants are already facing difficulty implementing their TRIPS  obligations and say that they lack the resources and capacity to enforce  IPR and face other problems that are more pressing, such as violent crime  and drug trafficking.", "In the area of trademarks, the main concern involves the relationship  between trademarks and geographical indications.  Both trademarks and  geographical indications provide consumers with information about the  source of products; both marks are considered distinct IPR rights that  entitle the owner to exclusive use of the mark once it is registered.   Geographical indications, such as Idaho potatoes, Florida oranges, and  Washington State apples, are marks that identify a good as originating from  a geographic area where the quality, reputation, or other characteristic of  the good is essentially attributable to that area.  FTAA negotiators must  decide whether the registration of one type of mark should preclude the  later registration of the other type of mark. The United States wants the  FTAA to establish the principle that the owner of the mark that was  registered first\u2014regardless of whether the original (first) mark is a  trademark or a geographical indication\u2014has the right to preclude  registration of another mark sought at a later date.  This would prevent  problems such as the one that occurred in Europe when a geographical  indication was granted for Budweiser beer (made in a town by the name  Budvar Ceske in the Czech Republic), despite the fact that a trademark on  the same name was already registered earlier to the U.S. company  Anheuser-Busch.  Other FTAA participants from developing countries  strongly resist the U.S. proposal because they perceive it as going beyond  their current TRIPS obligations.", "To capture greater returns from IPR, some developing FTAA countries are  proposing to go beyond TRIPS and include topics such as traditional  knowledge, folklore, and genetic resources in the FTAA\u2019s IPR chapter.   Traditional knowledge involves knowledge and practices such as  traditional healing methods.  Some claim that this knowledge, which exists  in local communities and is often passed from generation to generation,  can be valuable in the pursuit of innovative medicines.  Other countries  prefer that a technical forum, such as the WIPO, continue to vet those  issues before they are addressed in the FTAA.

Under the WTO,  before a complaining party that has won a favorable ruling can retaliate, it  must wait for the outcome of a possible appeal; the passage of a  \u201creasonable period of time\u201d for the party found to be in breach to comply;  and, if it still fails to compy, the possibility of up to three additional  authorization or arbitration procedures.  Under NAFTA, the aggrieved  country can automatically retaliate 30 days after the panel ruling.  The  United States has aggressively, and often successfully, employed dispute  settlement in complaints against foreign nations\u2019 measures in the WTO.   However, the WTO process has been accused of taking too long and failing  to reliably produce compliance.", "Resolving the different approaches to compliance will require FTAA  participants to balance a desire for certain enforceability against practical  and defensive considerations.  Recent events highlight that the United  States may be forced to defend its own measures and could have difficulty  meeting short deadlines or complying with adverse rulings.  For example,  the United States is now struggling to comply with rulings in two recent  cases involving a multibillion dollar U.S. tax program known as the Foreign  Sales Corporation and U.S. restrictions on Mexican trucking services.", "Another major difference in the FTAA negotiations is evident on the subject  of appeals.  Some FTAA nations have proposed a standing appeals body  that would, upon request of either party, examine the legal bases for panel  rulings and accept, reject, or modify them.  Other nations did not propose  an appeals stage.  Although the U.S. proposal did not include an appeals  stage, the U.S. government is currently evaluating its position.  Legal  experts that we contacted noted that appeals can add time and expense.   However, they stated that the WTO\u2019s track record of dispute settlement is  more extensive and better regarded than NAFTA\u2019s, in part because the WTO  Appellate Body helps promote consistency and legal rigor in panel  decisions.  Moreover, the WTO Appellate Body has served as an important  check in the system, substantially revising panel rulings against the United  States that raised sovereignty problems.  NAFTA\u2019s general dispute  settlement process does not contain an appeals mechanism, and this  dispute settlement process has rarely been used.", "FTAA governments differ widely on the subject of the openness (or  transparency) of the dispute settlement procedure.  The United States has  proposed that FTAA dispute settlement include several transparency  guarantees, such as open hearings; immediate public access to documents,  such as legal briefs; and opportunities for interested private persons,  organizations, or companies to be notified of the initiation of FTAA dispute  settlement and to provide input into the process.  Other FTAA countries not  only oppose the U.S. stance on openness but have proposed language for  the draft FTAA dispute settlement chapter that requires a confidential  process that generally precludes direct or indirect input and participation  by nongovernmental organizations.", "While not inherently controversial, several complex issues also face FTAA  negotiators on dispute settlement.  The first is known as \u201cchoice of forum\u201d  and has to do with who makes the decision regarding whether the FTAA  will be used as the forum to settle a dispute among FTAA participants and  on what basis.  This issue arises because most FTAA participants are  members of the WTO and subregional integration agreements such as  NAFTA.  These agreements may contain substantive obligations on the  same topic and provide separate dispute settlement forums.  A problem  could arise if (1) jurisprudence built up in one forum that is at odds with  another or (2) a country sought to pursue a complaint about the same  measure in two different forums on the same or different grounds.  The  United States has proposed that, as a rule, the complaining country choose  the forum in which to pursue a given complaint and, by that choice,  foreclose recourse to any other forum.  However, the U.S. proposal  recognizes that in situations where the FTAA goes beyond the WTO, the  FTAA may express a preference that FTAA dispute settlement be used.", "Second, the relationship of FTAA dispute settlement to other agreements  can also affect third-party rights.  Third-party rights are the rights of parties  other than the complaining country and the country complained against to  participate in a dispute as a co-complainant or as a third party after  proceedings have been initiated by another country.  Problems could arise  if (1) one FTAA country wanted to pursue a complaint about a given  measure in the FTAA and another FTAA country wanted to pursue a  complaint about the same measure in the WTO or (2) an FTAA country  proposed to pursue a complaint under a subregional agreement, such as  NAFTA, to which other FTAA participants did not have access.  The  challenge is to minimize multiple litigation while ensuring that all parties\u2019  rights are not diminished.  To address this challenge, the United States  proposed that FTAA countries be notified of the intent to file a formal WTO  complaint against an FTAA member\u2019s measure.  A third party\u2019s stated desire  to complain about the same measure would give rise to consultations with  an aim to reach agreement on a single forum.  The United States also  proposed that if a country failed to join an FTAA dispute as a complaining  party, it would normally forego litigation about the same matter at the WTO  or the FTAA.", "Third, making an FTAA dispute settlement system operational will require  resolution of institutional issues and the outcome of negotiations on other  substantive chapters of the FTAA.  For example, the WTO has an  institutionalized secretariat that provides considerable support to WTO  dispute settlement.  Smaller economies are anxious to ensure that they  have the monetary and technical resources required to participate  meaningfully in FTAA dispute settlement, including secretariat support.   The question of whether the FTAA dispute settlement system will handle all  disputes regardless of which agreement (or chapter) is involved depends  on the outcome of negotiations on other substantive chapters.  The  alternative is that the general dispute settlement procedure would be  supplemented by special dispute settlement rules for specific topics or  discrete dispute settlement procedures.  A related issue is whether any  general or specific standards of review would apply to guide panels.  The  WTO, for example, contains deferential standards of review with respect to  antidumping."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Next Steps", "paragraphs": ["The negotiating group on dispute settlement has three mandates for the  current phase of FTAA negotiations:  (1) prepare a revised draft chapter for  presentation to the TNC by August 2002, (2) submit to the Technical  Committee on Institutional Issues the negotiating group\u2019s preliminary  views on the institutions needed to implement FTAA dispute settlement  mechanisms, and (3) consider whether proposals for special dispute  settlement mechanisms made by other FTAA negotiating groups are  compatible with the general dispute settlement procedures developed for  the FTAA as a whole and report their conclusions to the TNC or to the  Technical Committee on Institutional Issues, as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Competition Policy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Topic, Importance, and Negotiating Mandate", "paragraphs": ["FTAA countries, including the United States, agree that each FTAA  signatory should implement measures to proscribe anticompetitive  business conduct but disagree over the level of detail needed in the  agreement.

The treatment of these economies is a crucial crosscutting theme in  the FTAA negotiations because smaller economies are concerned about  their ability to effectively implement and benefit from a new agreement.   According to some experts, these participants are concerned that they may  not have sufficient resources to implement new trade obligations.   Countries that base much of their government revenues on tariffs, for  example, may have difficulty finding alternative sources for that revenue if  tariffs are phased out.  These participants are also concerned that the very  factors that make trade beneficial to small countries may make it difficult  for some of them to achieve these benefits under the agreement. For  example, the dislocation of a key sector has a proportionately larger impact  on a small economy than on a larger, more diversified economy.", "Because so many FTAA participants consider themselves to be small or  developing, the theme of smaller economies has repeatedly been discussed  throughout the negotiations.

While these different sets do overlap,  not all countries designated small by one method are considered small by  others.  For example, a 1998 study states that per capita gross domestic  product in the Bahamas, which has only 0.16 percent of Brazil\u2019s land area,  is three times larger than Brazil\u2019s per capita gross domestic product.   According to one FTAA expert, the smaller economies group tried to define  a \u201csmaller economy\u201d in the FTAA context but failed to agree on a single  definition.  To solve this dilemma, the United States has proposed that the  treatment of smaller economies be decided on a case-by-case basis in the  negotiations instead of grouping countries by a single definition.

Under the FTAA negotiations, decisions about the treatment of  smaller or developing economies will be important for the tariff and  nontariff barrier modality discussions because they are supposed to define  which countries may be eligible for what type of treatment.

U.S.  negotiators hope that the implementation of new outreach measures will  go some way toward dampening the criticism that the process lacks  transparency.", "In response to broad demands for a more transparent process, the FTAA  ministers agreed on April 7, 2001, in Buenos Aires to publicly release the  draft text of the nine negotiating groups.

This text gives a snapshot of the status of the FTAA negotiations as  they stood as of the Buenos Aires Ministerial, including the range of topics  and proposals before the negotiators.  The publicly released text is the  same text from which negotiations are now proceeding, according to  USTR.  Because the text is heavily bracketed, it may be difficult for outside  observers to understand or to assess potential areas of agreement or  consensus.  In addition, the FTAA governments agreed not to include  country identifiers in the text in order to keep the negotiations more fluid.   Further, there is no guarantee that future revisions to the text will be made  available to the public.  This is important for two reasons.

However, the United States maintains high barriers on certain  agricultural products, such as sugar, peanuts, and citrus, and on textiles  and apparel products, which are important exports of various FTAA  countries.  For some of these products, imports are limited by quota or by  prohibitively high tariffs after an initial quantity has been imported.   Reductions in these barriers may increase imports, lower prices, and  reduce U.S. production.  FTAA negotiations also include antidumping  measures, which place additional duties on products if a country finds that  the products have been sold at less than their normal value.  Changes in  antidumping rules may have mixed results for the United States because it  is the country that has initiated the most cases and had the most cases  initiated against it within the FTAA region.

Chile has used complex price bands, which apply additional  duties on imports, to maintain domestic prices within a certain range for  wheat, wheat flour, edible vegetable oils, and sugar.  For example, due to  recent low international prices for wheat products, Chile applies duties as  high as 90 percent on imports of wheat, a key U.S. export.  FTAA  negotiations may address these and other agricultural trade practices that  distort domestic and international markets.
