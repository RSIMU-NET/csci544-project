The Army and the Department of Defense have taken action to address and focus command- and installation-level attention on management of delinquent travel card accounts. However, these actions are primarily focused on treating the symptoms or \"back-end\" problems rather than the \"front-end\" or preventive controls. GAO's work identified numerous instances of potentially fraudulent and abusive activity related to the travel card. During fiscal year 2001, 1,200 of the over 4,200 Army account holders who had written at least one nonsufficient funds (NSF) check to pay their travel card bill had their accounts charged off. In the same period, more than 200 cardholders whose accounts were eventually charged off may have also committed bank fraud by writing three or more NSF checks to the Bank of America. GAO's audit found that weaknesses in the Army's overall control environment, including a number of specific controls that were either flawed in their design or in their implementation, are the root source of the Army's inability to prevent or effectively detect the numerous instances of potentially fraudulent and abusive travel card related activity previously detected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On July 17, 2002, we testified before the Subcommittee on Government  Efficiency, Financial Management, and Intergovernmental Relations, House  Committee on Government Reform, on the results of our audit of internal  controls over travel activity associated with about 430,000 individually  billed Army travel card accounts, and $619 million in related travel card  charges for fiscal year 2001.  The individually billed travel card program is  significantly different from the purchase card program in that the  cardholder is directly responsible for all charges incurred on his or her  travel card account and the monthly bill is sent to the cardholder for  payment.

Our statistical sample test  results can be projected only to the individual installations where we  performed the testing and cannot be projected to the command level or to  the Army as a whole.  Through auditing travel card transactions at the four  installations and data mining of fiscal year 2001 transactions incurred by  units throughout the Army, we identified numerous examples of potentially  fraudulent and abusive travel card activity.

Many of the problems related directly to the control environment at the  Army and at the sites we visited.  Other problems related to the  implementation of the travel card program and a lack of controls over  travel card use and travel processing.  A detailed discussion of the control  environment and specific internal control issues is provided in the  following sections of this report.  Without proper management control,  demographics such as the age and pay rates of Army personnel also  contributed to delinquencies and charge-offs.", "Our analysis of available data showed that there was a correlation between  certain demographic factors and high delinquency and charge-off rates.   According to Army representatives, and based on our analysis, most Army  travel cardholders responsible for delinquencies and charge-offs were  young (generally married), low- and midlevel enlisted military personnel  (E-1-privates to E-6-staff sergeants), with relatively low incomes and little  experience in handling personal finances.  If these individuals get into  financial difficulty, they have fewer resources at their disposal to pay their  travel card balances in full every month.", "In the Army, grades E-1 through E-6 account for about 73 percent of all  military personnel.  Consequently, it is not surprising that they have the  highest outstanding travel card balance.  As shown in figure 2, the travel  cardholder\u2019s grade (and associated pay) is a strong predictor of  delinquency problems.  We found that the Army\u2019s delinquency and charge- off problems are primarily associated with young, low- and midlevel  enlisted military personnel with basic pay levels ranging from $11,000 to  $26,000.  Delinquency rates were as high as 40 percent and 25 percent for E- 1 to E-3 and E-4 to E-6, respectively, compared to Army civilians whose  delinquency rate is consistent with rates for federal civilian agencies, as  shown in figure 1.", "As shown in figure 3, personnel in grades E-1 through E-6 account for about  $8 million of the $10 million in total Army charge-offs for fiscal year 2001.", "Enlisted personnel in the E-1 to E-6 grade level range in rank from privates  to staff sergeants, respectively, and receive basic pay ranging from $11,033  to $26,253.  Although these basic pay rates are supplemented with amounts  such as housing and food allowances, these salaries may not permit  payment of excessive personal charges on travel cards. Also, if cardholders  in these lower grade levels do not receive their travel card reimbursements  promptly because of either delays in filing their vouchers or in voucher  processing, they may lack the financial resources to make timely required  payments on their travel card accounts.  Further, as discussed later,  because of the Army\u2019s failure to take any action to exempt personnel with  poor credit histories from required use of travel cards, these low- and  midlevel enlisted military personnel are often issued travel cards even  though they may already be in serious financial trouble and, therefore, may  not have been appropriate credit risks.  The failure to provide proper  training and monitoring of travel card use, as well as maintain firm credit  limits, may also have exacerbated the delinquency rates for these  individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Delinquency and Charge-off Rates Have Resulted in Increased Costs to the Government", "paragraphs": ["Although the bank generally absorbs the losses associated with  delinquencies and charge-offs, this problem has significant consequences  to the Army.

Other costs are real but not easily  measurable, such as the increased administrative burden to the Army  associated with additional resources required to address delinquent and  charged-off accounts.  For example, to effectively manage the travel card  program, employees with delinquent accounts must be identified,  counseled, disciplined, and closely monitored.  In addition, employees with  financial problems who also have access to sensitive data may pose a  security risk, as discussed later in this report.

In 1998, under  the provisions of the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) master  contract with Bank of America, DOD entered into a tailored task order for  Bank of America to provide travel card services for a period of 2 years,  ending November 29, 2000.  Under the terms of the task order, DOD had  three 1-year options to unilaterally renew the Bank of America contract.   On September 29, 2000, prior to the expiration of the initial task order, DOD  gave notice to Bank of America that it intended to exercise its option to  extend the task order for an additional year.  In November 2000, Bank of  America contested the provisions of the DOD task order with the GSA  contracting officer.  Bank of America claimed that the task order was  unprofitable because of required \u201ccontract and program management  policies and procedures\u201d associated with higher-than-anticipated credit  losses.  Bank of America officials estimated that 43,000 DOD employees  defaulted on more than $59 million in debts.  Bank of America only agreed  to drop its legal dispute with DOD after GSA renegotiated the terms of the  master contract and DOD renegotiated the related tailored task order for  travel card services in April 2001.  Specifically, under the renegotiated  master contract and related task order Bank of America was able to reduce  its financial risk by instituting additional fees, such as higher cash advance  and late payment fees; offsetting credit losses against rebates; facilitating  the collection of delinquent and charged-off amounts through salary and  military retirement pay offset; and participating in the split disbursement  payment process, in which the government pays the bank directly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of Increased Fees", "paragraphs": ["One of the terms of the renegotiation of the task order between Bank of  America and DOD was an increase in travel card cash advance fees from  1.9 percent to 3 percent, or $2, whichever would be the higher fee amount,  effective August 10, 2001.  The Army reimburses cash advance fees  incurred by a traveler while on authorized travel.  We estimate that this  contract modification will result in approximately $1.4 million of increased  costs to the Army each year for the reimbursement of cash advance fees.   Our estimate was made by applying the increase in the advance fees to cash  advances made during fiscal year 2001.

Table 2 shows the  10 cases we selected for review where the cardholders wrote three or more  NSF checks to Bank of America, and whose accounts were charged off due  in part to repeated use of NSF checks.", "Eight of the 10 cardholders included in table 2 had significant credit  problems prior to card issuance, such as charged-off credit card accounts  and automobile loans; mortgage foreclosures; bankruptcies; serious  delinquencies; referrals to collection agencies for unpaid utility bills,  medical fees, and department store accounts; and, in one case, prior  criminal convictions for writing NSF checks.  The remaining two had  similar credit problems subsequent to issuance of Bank of America travel  cards.  These examples are illustrative of many of the breakdowns in the  management and oversight over the Army travel card program, as  discussed in the following sections of this report.  The following provides  detailed information on some of these cases.", "Cardholder #1 was a staff sergeant who wrote 86 NSF checks totaling  almost $270,000 for payment on his Bank of America travel card account  for charges incurred when the cardholder was not on official  government travel.  This cardholder had a previous criminal record for  writing NSF checks.  The cardholder also had numerous other financial  problems, including mortgage foreclosure and claims discharged in  December 2001 for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Among the claims discharged  in bankruptcy was a $2,199 claim on the cardholder\u2019s previous  government travel card issued by American Express and a $114,750 real  estate loan.  This cardholder applied for and received a new Social  Security number when he legally changed his name in 1998, and since  then has had two Social Security numbers\u2014one under each name.  The  individual authorized a credit check at the time of his application for a  government travel card from Bank of America.  However, it appeared  that the credit check was not performed and the individual was issued a  standard card with a $10,000 limit in April 1999, instead of a restricted  card with a $2,500 credit limit.", "From July 1999 through November 2000, the cardholder wrote  approximately 86 NSF checks\u2014some on closed or invalid accounts\u2014to  Bank of America.  Industry regulations require that an account be  credited immediately upon receipt of a check.  Consequently, when  Bank of America posted the NSF checks, the account appeared to have  been paid, which provided credit to the cardholder to make additional  purchases.  Thus, by writing successively larger NSF checks, which  Bank of America credited to his travel card account, the staff sergeant  was able to, in effect, successively increase his credit limit to over  $35,000\u2014a practice known as \u201cboosting.\u201d  He used each of these  successive increases in his effective credit limit to charge additional  items on his travel card.  Despite the 86 NSF checks and associated  increases in the cumulative unpaid balance on the cardholder\u2019s  government travel card account, records we obtained indicate that Bank  of America did not close this individual\u2019s account until February 2001,  when the account was charged off.  The cardholder was undergoing  court-martial in late May 2002 for NSF checks related to his Bank of  America account as well as to the Army and Air Force Exchange  Services. Bank of America acknowledged that it erred in not closing this  account sooner.  This has resulted in the bank changing its policy to  require accounts to be closed when a cardholder has written three NSF  checks.", "Cardholder #3 currently works at the Pentagon as a GS-13 employee on  a classified program.  Because of her position, the cardholder has a top- secret clearance.  Prior to applying for the Bank of America travel card,  the employee had credit problems, including several charged-off  accounts.  Because the employee did not authorize a credit check on her  travel card application, she was given a restricted card with a credit  limit of $2,500, which should have been issued in \u201cinactive\u201d status and  only activated when needed for travel.  However, Bank of America  records showed that in July 2000, immediately after receiving the travel  card, the employee used the card to pay for a personal move and other  charges totaling more than $3,600\u2014more than $1,000 in excess of the  credit limit on restricted travel cards.  The cognizant APC told us that  while a credit check authorization should have been done for the  cardholder to exceed the $2,500 credit limit, she could not confirm that  one was done in this case.", "In addition, from October 2000 through September 2001, the employee  wrote four NSF checks totaling more than $7,700 to Bank of America.   The cardholder\u2019s account had an unpaid balance of $3,257 at the time it  was charged off in September 2001.  Although the cardholder had a  restricted card that should have been activated only for the first official  travel, the fact that she was able to use the card immediately upon  issuance while not on travel indicated that Bank of America issued the  card in an \u201cactive\u201d status.  Shortly after our investigators contacted this  cardholder, she paid her account balance in full.", "We also found that no disciplinary action had been taken against this  individual.  The two APCs were not aware that the employee had  problems with her account, much less that the account was charged  off, until contacted by our investigators.  The APCs told us they had  little time to devote to reviewing the over 500 individual accounts for  which they had oversight responsibilities assigned as a collateral duty.   In addition, while, according to a Bank of America official, APCs have  had access to NSF check information in its database since 2000, one of  the APCs told us she only recently received training on how to identify  delinquent accounts in Bank of America\u2019s database.", "Cardholder #6 exhibited a pattern of writing NSF checks about once a  month.  During fiscal year 2001, the cardholder wrote 11 NSF checks to  Bank of America that ranged from $250 to $630.  Some checks were  written to pay charges that appeared to be for personal travel.  The  cardholder\u2019s account balance of $3,380 was charged off in February  2002.  Further, when the cardholder was assigned from Ft. Hood, Texas,  to the U.S. Army Recruiting Command in Tampa, Florida, her travel card  account was not transferred and assigned to the APC responsible for  travel card oversight in her new unit.  Consequently, the APC in Florida  was not aware of the cardholder\u2019s problems because the cardholder did  not appear in any of the Recruiting Command\u2019s delinquency reports.", "Abusive Travel Card Activity We found instances of abusive travel card activity by Army cardholders that  covered charges for a wide variety of personal goods and services,  including cruises; sports and music event tickets; personal clothing items;  casino and Internet gambling; transactions to obtain cash at adult  entertainment establishments; and, in one case, the purchase of a used  automobile.  There should be no misunderstanding by Army personnel that  personal use of the card is not permitted.  The standard government travel  card used by most Army personnel is clearly marked, \u201cFor Official  Government Travel Only\u201d on the face of the card.", "In addition, all Army travel card applicants sign a statement that provides,  in part, that \u201cI also understand that I am authorized to use the card only for  those necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by me for official  travel.\u201d As part of our statistical sampling tests of travel card activity at  four Army locations, we estimated that 15 percent to 45 percent of the  fiscal year 2001 travel card transactions at those locations appeared to be  for charges not related to official travel and, therefore, were abusive.     Further, abusive use of the card related to failure to pay Bank of America  was the result of  (1) cardholders who were reimbursed for official travel  and then did not pay Bank of America and (2) cardholders who used the  card for personal charges and failed to pay Bank of America."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Travel Card Abuse due to Failure to Pay Bank of America Charges", "paragraphs": ["Our work at four case study sites and our Army-wide data mining identified  numerous examples of abusive travel card use where cardholders failed to  pay their travel card bills.  This abusive activity included (1) authorized  transactions incurred in conjunction with approved travel orders where the  cardholders received reimbursement but did not pay the bills, leading to  charge off of the cardholders\u2019 accounts, or (2) transactions incurred by  cardholders that were not associated with approved travel orders where  unpaid accounts were also charged off.  In all cases, we found that  ineffective monitoring contributed to charge-offs.  Specifically, many APCs,  commanders, and supervisors did not effectively monitor travel card usage  or address delinquencies timely.  We found little documentation indicating  that the APCs, commanders, and supervisors were aware of the problems  with individual cardholders, conducted follow-up, and took appropriate  disciplinary actions.  Table 3 provides examples of the two types of abusive  transactions related to nonpayment and the related follow-up and  disciplinary actions.", "Similar to individuals who wrote NSF checks, many of the 105 cardholders  that we reviewed whose accounts were charged off had significant prior  credit problems, such as charged-off credit card account balances and  automobile loan defaults, and referrals to collection agencies.  Many of  these individuals experienced further credit problems, including mortgage  foreclosure, after issuance of the government travel card.  As shown in  table 4, some charged-off accounts resulted from the use of the card for  transactions that were not proper travel expenses covered by valid travel  orders, while others resulted from official travel expenses that were  reimbursed but the cardholders failed to pay the bills.  The magnitude and  range of abusive transactions reflect the poor control environment and  other internal control weaknesses discussed later in this report.  The  following include details of some of these.", "Cardholder #1 was a GS-12 employee in Army Forces Command at Ft.  McPherson, Georgia.  In August 2000, the cardholder used the card to  pay for authorized charges associated with a permanent change of  station move from Qatar to Ft. McPherson.  The cardholder did not elect  split disbursement of his travel reimbursement between himself and  Bank of America when filing travel vouchers.  Thus, the entire  reimbursement for travel expenses was electronically deposited in the  cardholder\u2019s checking account.  The cardholder did not pay his travel  card bill, but instead used the reimbursement to, among other things,  pay the closing costs on the purchase of a home.  The cardholder was  counseled by the APC and his supervisors after his travel card account  became delinquent, but no disciplinary action was taken.  The  cardholder is now in the salary offset program.  The cardholder  informed us that he was briefed, at the time of card issuance, of his  responsibility to make timely payments to Bank of America in payment  of expenses claimed on approved travel vouchers.", "Cardholder #2 was a sergeant first class (E-7) with an Army Reserve  Officers\u2019 Training Corps unit.  Army investigative records showed that in  January 2001, the cardholder\u2019s spouse used his government travel card  to make two payments of $2,050 each to Budget Rent-A-Car for the  purchase of a used automobile.  The spouse was able to use the travel  card because of the general military power of attorney provided to her  by the sergeant.  In addition, several automated teller machine (ATM)  withdrawals were made using the card at times when the sergeant was  not on official travel status.  The cardholder received a letter of  reprimand and subsequently retired.  In February 2002, after his account  was charged off, the cardholder\u2019s account was put into the offset  program and a portion of his annuity automatically withheld for  repayment to Bank of America.", "Cardholder #9 was an Army specialist (E-4) at Ft. Drum and received a  total of three travel card accounts.  Shortly after receiving his first card  he incurred over $5,000 in personal charges, including casino gambling.   He then notified Bank of America that his wallet, which contained his  government travel card and driver\u2019s license, had been stolen and that the  charges on the card were not made by him and therefore were  fraudulent charges.  Bank of America closed this account, charged off  the amount as a fraud loss, and issued the soldier a second account.  The  soldier then incurred over $8,000 in personal charges for casino  gambling and notified Bank of America that this card was lost.  Bank of  America again closed this account and issued a third account to the  soldier.  The soldier incurred approximately $5,000 in personal charges  on this account, including casino gambling.  Bank of America personnel  began to question the soldier regarding the transactions made on both  the first and second accounts because both accounts showed  transactions at the same casino and the signatures on the charge  receipts were similar to the soldier\u2019s signature.  As of April 17, 2002, the  soldier\u2019s travel card account was in charge-off status, with an unpaid  balance of $10,029.  The soldier told us that he falsified the report to  Bank of America that his first card was stolen and that the charges were  fraudulent because he could not pay the bill.  He also told us that he  falsely reported his second card lost again because he could not pay the  bill.  In addition, the soldier stated that he made personal charges on the  third card, including casino gambling, in hopes of winning enough to pay  the bill.  In October 2000, the soldier received an Article 15 for misuse of  his travel cards.  He received a reduction in grade from an E-4 to an E-1,  forfeited a half-month\u2019s pay, and was to serve 45 days of extra duty  beyond his November 30, 2000, discharge date.  The soldier informed us  that the Commander waived the 45 days and he received an honorable  discharge as an E-4.  In February 2002, the Army enrolled this soldier in  the offset program.  The soldier is currently an E-5 with the  Pennsylvania National Guard.  According to the National Guard, the  Army\u2019 official personnel file for this soldier contains no information  concerning any adverse action.", "Cardholder #10, another Army specialist (E-4) at Ft. Drum used his  government travel card to make numerous purchases of personal items  totaling $2,841 over a 3-month period from May through July 2000.  The  personal items included 38 restaurant charges, 37 charges at gas  stations, 14 charges at grocery stores, and 5 hotel charges in the vicinity  of Ft. Drum.  The specialist, who had received a $10,000 credit limit on  his government travel card, had an unpaid balance of $7,643 as of  December 11, 2000.  As of April 17, 2002, the travel card was in charge- off status and the specialist no longer worked for the Army.  Our review  of the soldier\u2019s credit report showed that he received his government  travel card from Bank of America in May 1999.  Since that time, the  soldier opened numerous credit card and other consumer accounts with  other vendors, almost all of which had unpaid balances and were in  collection status or had been charged off.  We found no evidence that  the APC detected the soldier\u2019s personal use of the government travel  card.  As a result, the Army could not take timely action to cancel or  suspend the soldier\u2019s travel card account.  We also found no evidence  that disciplinary action was taken to address personal use of the travel  card or the unpaid debt once the Army became aware of the problem.", "In contrast to the charged-off accounts discussed above, we found some  instances where the failure to pay the travel card bill was attributable to the  delays and errors in processing vouchers and reimbursing the travelers.", "This issue is discussed in more detail in a later section on testing of key  internal controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Card Abuse Where Cardholder Paid Bank of America", "paragraphs": ["We also found instances in which cardholders used their travel cards for  personal purposes, but paid their travel card bills when they became due.

Personal use of the card increases the risk of charge-offs related to abusive  purchases, which are costly to the government and the taxpayer.  In  addition, the high rate of abuse with respect to travel card activity is  indicative of the weak internal control environment and the failure of the  APCs to monitor credit card activities, as discussed later in this report.", "Table 4 provides examples of the types of abusive charges we found during  our review.", "As shown in table 4, cardholders used their travel cards for a wide variety  of personal goods or services, including cruises, sporting and music event  tickets, membership dues, and personal clothing items.  For example, we  were able to determine that, during fiscal year 2001, approximately $45,000  was spent Army-wide to purchase cruise packages or to pay for a variety of  activities or services on cruise ships.", "Some individuals who abused their travel card privileges held positions  where they may have been responsible for taking appropriate disciplinary  action with respect to travel card abuse by personnel within their  commands.  For example, a Lieutenant Colonel used his travel card to  purchase accommodations and tickets to attend the Tournament of Roses  in Pasadena, California, as shown in example 2 in table 4."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Abusive Travel Card Use at Adult Entertainment Establishments", "paragraphs": ["We also found instances of abusive travel card activity in which Army  personnel used travel cards to obtain cash at establishments, such as  \u201cgentlemen\u2019s clubs,\u201d instead of following prescribed ATM procedures.   Specifically, we found cases in which these clubs provided adult  entertainment services and helped the cardholders circumvent travel card  ATM cash withdrawal limits, by supplying cardholders with actual cash or  \u201cclub cash\u201d for a 10 percent fee.  We were able to identify about 200 Army  travel cardholders who during fiscal year 2001 charged almost $38,000 on  their government travel cards at these establishments.  Some of these  individuals also did not pay their related travel card bills, and their travel  card accounts were charged off.", "DOD\u2019s travel card policy sets limits on the amount of cash a cardholder can  withdraw using ATMs.  Typically, the ATM limit is set at $500 for a standard  card and $200 for a restricted card, meaning that in any 1-month cycle,  Army cardholders could only obtain cash up to the limit specified on their  cards.  However, Army cardholders circumvented these policies by  obtaining cash or club cash at a substantial fee from such clubs.", "The gentlemen\u2019s clubs typically sell adult entertainment, many sell alcohol,  and some sell food.  DOD and other federal agencies use merchant  category codes (MCC) to identify and block merchants in certain  categories from accepting travel cards as payment for goods and services  at those establishments.  However, some merchants with blocked codes  circumvented this control by using an allowable MCC to submit cash  transactions at their establishments.  For instance, Crazy Horse Too is an  entertainment establishment that provides topless dancing and sells  alcohol, but not food.  This establishment allows customers to use their  travel cards to obtain club cash from the bar for a 10 percent fee.  Club cash  can only be used to tip dancers, waitresses, and bartenders, but cannot be  exchanged for currency and cannot be used to purchase alcohol.  Crazy  Horse Too codes the club cash that it provides to customers as a \u201cbar  charge\u201d in the name of its operating company, the Power Company.  This  coding allows these charges to bypass the MCC blocking control.  Other  clubs, such as Cheetahs Lounge Club, provide actual cash instead of club  cash, and also code the transactions as \u201cbar charges.\u201d", "For example, one cardholder used his restricted travel card to obtain more  than $5,000 in cash.  As discussed previously, a restricted card has a  maximum credit limit of $2,500 and an ATM cash withdrawal limit of $200  per monthly statement cycle.  In this instance, the cardholder\u2019s restricted  travel card was activated about 20 days prior to his official travel.  The  cardholder used the card to make numerous ATM cash withdrawals and  pay for large restaurant and grocery store charges prior to departure for  government travel.  After arrival at his temporary assignment location, the  cardholder requested that his APC raise his credit limit from $2,500 to  $10,000 based on his \u201cmission-critical status.\u201d The APC took the requested  action, without reviewing the cardholder\u2019s account history.  The cardholder  then frequented gentlemen\u2019s clubs near his temporary assignment location,  where he obtained more than $5,000 in cash.  The cardholder told our  investigators that he sent approximately $2,000 to his spouse, leaving him  with about $3,000 for personal use and entertainment.  The cardholder also  told us the ability to obtain cash from these clubs was common knowledge  among military personnel at his temporary assignment location.

The DOD Financial Management  Regulation (FMR) states that \u201ccommanders or supervisors shall not  tolerate misuse of the DOD travel cards and cardholders who do misuse  their cards shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.\u201d However,  DOD and Army policies and procedures do not define appropriate  disciplinary action to help ensure that consistent punitive actions are taken  against cardholders who abuse their travel cards.  Available documentation  indicates that commanders or supervisors did not take any disciplinary  actions against the majority of individuals who abused or misused their  cards during fiscal year 2001.  We found little documentation  demonstrating that APCs forwarded cardholder delinquency information to  appropriate commanders and supervisors to consider in determining  whether disciplinary actions were warranted.", "For the cardholders we inquired about, the primary action taken when  Army officials identified misuse or abuse of the travel card was to counsel  cardholders on proper use of the card and responsibility for timely  payment of travel card bills.  In some cases, APCs took actions to cancel  the cardholder\u2019s travel card account.  To the extent that more severe  disciplinary actions were taken, they were often in response to travel card  abuse in conjunction with other more serious offenses\u2014such as failing to  obey orders or drug abuse.

The foundation of all other controls, a  positive control environment provides discipline and structure as well as  the climate that influences the quality of internal controls.  Although we  observed improvements in the first half of fiscal year 2002, we identified  several factors that contributed to a weak overall control environment for  fiscal year 2001, including, as discussed previously, few documented  disciplinary actions taken against cardholders who abuse the card and a  lack of management attention and focus on establishing and maintaining  the organizational structure and human capital needed to support an  effective Army travel card management program.  We found that this  overall weak control environment contributed to design flaws and  weaknesses in seven management control areas needed for an effective  travel card program.  Specifically, we identified weaknesses in the Army  travel program controls related to (1) travel card issuance, (2) APCs\u2019  capacity to carry out assigned duties, (3) limiting card activation to meet  travel needs, (4) controls over transferred and \u201corphan\u201d accounts,  (5) procedures for terminating accounts when cardholders leave military  service, (6) segregation of duties to ensure that no one individual can  control all aspects of a travel transaction, and (7) access controls for Bank  of America\u2019s travel card database.", "All seven of these areas related to two key overall management  weaknesses:  (1) the lack of clear, sufficiently detailed policies and  procedures and (2) limited travel card audit and program oversight.  First,  the units we audited used DOD\u2019s travel management regulations (DOD  FMR, Volume 9, Chapter 3) as the primary source of policy guidance for  management of Army\u2019s travel card program.  However, in many areas, the  existing guidance was not sufficiently detailed to provide clear, consistent  travel management procedures to be followed across all Army units.   Second, as recognized in the DOD Inspector General\u2019s March 2002  summary report on the DOD travel card program, \u201cecause of its dollar  magnitude and mandated use, the DOD travel card program remains an  area needing continued emphasis, oversight, and improvement.   Independent internal audits should continue to be an integral component of  management controls.\u201d  However, the DOD Inspector General report noted  that only two internal review reports were issued from fiscal year 1999  through fiscal year 2001 concerning the Army\u2019s travel card program.  These  reports, issued by the Army\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Financial  Management (and Comptroller)\u2019s Internal Review Office, covered  government travel card usage in the Army during fiscal year 2000. In  addition, each of the Army installations we audited had internal review  groups that did some level of review of the travel program and identified  deficiencies in the Army\u2019s travel program at their installations.", "To the extent that oversight reviews were conducted, we saw few  indications that management took action to address the deficiencies  auditors identified.  For example, the Army\u2019s two fiscal year 2000 internal  review reports disclosed that existing review procedures were not effective  in identifying card misuse and identified additional actions needed to  address travel card abuses, such as unauthorized usage of the card and  unauthorized cash withdrawals.  We identified these same issues in our  fiscal year 2001 work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ineffective Controls over Issuance of Travel Cards", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s ability to prevent potentially fraudulent and abusive  transactions that can eventually lead to additional delinquencies and  charge-offs is significantly weakened if individuals who had histories of  financial irresponsibility are permitted to receive travel cards.  The Army\u2019s  practice is to facilitate Bank of America issuing travel cards\u2014with few  credit restrictions\u2014to all applicants regardless of whether they have  histories of credit problems.  DOD guidance in FMR, Volume 9, Chapter 3,  provides that all DOD personnel are to use the travel card to pay for official  business travel.  However, the policy also provides that exemptions from  using the travel card may be granted under a number of circumstances,  including for personnel who are denied travel cards for financial  irresponsibility.  However, DOD\u2019s policy is not clear as to what level of  financial irresponsibility by a travel card applicant would constitute a basis  for such an exemption. In addition, the DOD FMR provides that credit  checks are to be performed on all travel card applicants, unless an  applicant declines a credit check.  We found no evidence that the Army  exempted any individuals or groups from required acceptance and use of  travel cards, even those with histories of previous credit problems.", "In July 1999, Bank of America began obtaining credit checks on DOD travel  card applicants and used the credit history obtained through these checks  as a basis for determining the type of account\u2014restricted or standard\u2014it  would provide to new DOD travel applicants.  An applicant who did not  authorize a credit check, or with either no credit history or a history of  credit problems, is issued a restricted travel card with a $2,500 credit limit.   All other applicants are issued standard travel cards with a $10,000 credit  limit.  DOD policy also permits commanders or supervisors to raise the  credit limits and ATM limits of restricted travel cardholders to whatever  level they deem necessary to meet mission requirements, except when the  cardholder declined a credit check.  Our analysis of credit application  scoring models and credit risk scores used by major credit bureaus  confirmed that applicants with low credit scores due to histories of late  payments are poor credit risks.  Credit bureau officials told us that if their  credit rating guidelines for decisions on commercial credit card application  approvals were used to make decisions on travel card applicants, a  significant number of low- and midlevel enlisted Army cardholders would  not have qualified for credit cards even with the restricted limits.

Credit industry research  and the results of our work demonstrate that individuals with previous late  payments are much more likely to have payment problems in the future.    As discussed previously, many of the Army travel cardholders that we  audited who wrote numerous NSF checks, were severely delinquent, or had  their accounts charged off had histories of delinquencies and charge-offs  relating to other credit cards; defaulted automobile loans that resulted in  repossession of the vehicles; defaulted mortgage payments and foreclosure  proceedings on homes; numerous bankruptcies; and, in several cases, prior  arrests and convictions for crimes such as writing bad checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unrealistic APC Performance Expectations", "paragraphs": ["DOD policy provides that APCs are the primary focal points for day-to-day  management of the travel program.

DFAS erroneously  excluded these expenses from its reimbursement calculation and  consequently understated the amount paid to the cardholder by this  amount.  While the cardholder paid his bill from Bank of America that  included these expenses, it was not until we brought this matter to the  attention of Army and DFAS officials that the cardholder was  reimbursed.  In another instance, we found that an E-5 cardholder at Ft.  Drum filed a travel voucher with DFAS Orlando claiming and receiving  reimbursement for taxi fares totaling $48.50.  However, according to the  related travel order, a government vehicle was provided.  After we  brought this matter to its attention, DFAS Orlando obtained a $48.50  reimbursement from the cardholder.  At the California National Guard,  we found that a cardholder\u2019s per diem reimbursement was less than the  allowed amount, and the traveler was paid $75 for parking expense  when the receipt showed $86.", "The California National Guard\u2019s procedures for reviewing travel vouchers  differed from the other locations we audited in that the United States  Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO)\u2014an organizational component of the  California National Guard\u2014reviews all travel vouchers submitted by  California National Guard personnel for validity and accuracy before  submitting voucher payment requests to DFAS.  California National Guard  officials attributed the high error rate to staff shortages in the voucher  examination branch and difficulty in retaining high-quality personnel in  these low-paying positions.", "For the other Army units we audited, DFAS was responsible for reviewing  the vouchers for accuracy and proper support prior to payment.  We visited  DFAS Orlando\u2014the DFAS location responsible for processing travel  vouchers for two of our four test sites.  We found that DFAS Orlando made  some voucher processing errors, which officials at that location attributed,  at least in part, to the large volume of vouchers processed at that location,  the number of vacant positions, and the significant amount of overtime  needed to process vouchers and disburse funds within a 4- to 5-day time  frame.  For example, DFAS Orlando officials reported processing over  115,000 travel vouchers during fiscal year 2001, averaging approximately  11,000 vouchers per month, and had six vacancies that they were unable to  fill.  Also, in May 2002, DFAS Orlando reported 912 hours of overtime  associated with processing 13,422 of the estimated 17,500 travel vouchers  received during the month."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Processing Timeliness Was a Significant Problem Resulting in Late Payments to Travelers", "paragraphs": ["We tested two key areas where prompt action is needed to ensure that  travelers are reimbursed for valid expenses within required time frames.   First, DOD policy requires the traveler to submit a travel voucher within 5  days of return from travel.  We estimated significant failure rates for this  requirement at all four installations, ranging from 22 percent to 39 percent  of fiscal year 2001 transactions.  When this control failed in our sample  transactions, the delay in submitting a travel voucher ranged from 6 days to  as long as 228 days.  Numerous travelers took up to 3 weeks to submit  vouchers upon return from travel.  Installation officials told us that  travelers on extended travel for deployment to a war zone do not always  have an opportunity to file interim vouchers.  Also, the officials stated that  many travelers return from travel, only to leave within a day or 2 for annual  leave or another business trip and, therefore, do not have an opportunity to  submit their travel vouchers promptly.", "Delays in filing travel vouchers cause delays in travel reimbursements,  which can ultimately result in delinquent accounts.  For example in one of  the sampled Ft. Bragg, Special Operations, transactions, the cardholder  was on extended travel and did not file an interim voucher.  This traveler\u2019s  account became delinquent, but he paid the balance due after being  reimbursed.  In another instance, a member of the California National  Guard who completed travel in February 2001 did not complete a travel  voucher until mid-April 2001.  It took another 3 months for the voucher to  arrive at the USPFO facility responsible for processing it.  Although DFAS  paid the voucher 2 days after receipt of the payment request, the  cardholder\u2019s account was delinquent for the 3 months.", "Second, upon submission of a proper voucher by the employee, DOD has  30 days in which to make reimbursement without incurring late payment  fees and charges.  Once the approving official receives a properly  documented travel voucher, the 30-day payment period begins.  If payment  is not made in 30 days, the traveler is owed a late payment fee that is to be  calculated using, at a minimum, the Prompt Payment Act interest rate, as  required by TTRA and GSA regulations.  GSA\u2019s regulations also require  the cardholder to be paid an amount equal to the amount Bank of America  would have been entitled to charge the cardholder had the cardholder not  paid the bill by the due date.", "Failure rates for this control activity ranged from about 5 percent to 8  percent for three of the four installations we tested, which we considered  to be partially effective. Delays in these cases were generally attributed to  the review process at the installation, while DFAS generally made  payments within 7 days of receipt of the approved voucher package.   However, the fourth installation, the California National Guard, had an  estimated 61 percent of transactions that were associated with vouchers  that were not paid within the 30-day time frame.  Given the delays in initial  submission of the vouchers, as discussed previously, these additional  processing delays will result in travelers receiving payment well after they  receive their monthly travel card bills.  Unless travelers use personal funds  to pay the bills, many accounts will remain delinquent until payment is  received.  For example, we found that one Ft. Drum travel voucher was  submitted 34 days after travel ended and another Ft. Drum voucher was  paid 131 days after the travel ended.  A California National Guard  cardholder did not receive payment for a $3,554 voucher until 36 days after  he submitted his voucher.  While the cardholder paid Bank of America the  full amount due following receipt of his reimbursement, the cardholder\u2019s  account was initially delinquent because it was not paid within the required  30-day time frame.", "In another case we reviewed, an individual had planned to retire from the  Army and subsequently withdrew his retirement paperwork and was  reassigned to another location.  DFAS rejected the employee\u2019s travel  vouchers for reimbursement of official travel expenses because its records  showed that he had retired.  At the time of our audit, approximately 9  months had elapsed since the cardholder first sought reimbursement from  DFAS, and he was still not paid.  The individual\u2019s account was seriously  delinquent, his card was canceled, and he subsequently paid off his account  out of his own funds\u2014since he had not yet been reimbursed.", "With respect to the California National Guard, in many instances, USPFO  took more than 30 days from the date of receipt of the travel voucher to  send a request for voucher payment to DFAS.  USPFO officials attributed  these problems to the lack of qualified voucher examiners.", "Contrary to TTRA and GSA regulations, DFAS did not pay cardholders the  required late payment fees and charges.   According to the DOD FMR, the  fees and charges are only paid if the traveler claims reimbursement by  filing a separate voucher claiming the fees and charges.  Currently, DFAS  does not have the systems and data needed to identify and pay applicable  fees and charges due to travelers who are not reimbursed within 30 days."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The intent of the travel card program was to improve convenience for the  traveler and to reduce the government\u2019s costs of administering travel.   However, when the Army implemented the travel card as part of its travel  program, it did not provide the control infrastructure\u2014primarily human  capital\u2014necessary to manage and oversee the use of government travel  cards.  Consequently, a weak internal control environment in the travel  program has resulted in a significant level of delinquencies and charge-offs  of bad debts, and potentially fraudulent and abusive travel card activity.   This has resulted in millions of dollars of costs to the Army, including  higher fees, lost rebates, and substantial time pursuing and attempting to  collect delinquent travel card accounts.", "DOD and the Army have taken positive steps to reduce the delinquencies  and charge-offs, including establishing a system of wage and retirement  payment offset for many employees, sending travel reimbursements  directly to the bank rather than the employee, and making management of  the travel program a priority for the Army commands.  These actions have  resulted in significant collections of previously charged-off and delinquent  accounts and improved relations with Bank of America.  DOD and the  Army have also proposed additional steps as reported in the June 27, 2002,  DOD Charge Card Task Force report to improve the controls over the travel  card program.  However, these Army and DOD actions have primarily  addressed the symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the problems  with the program.  Specifically, actions to date have focused on dealing  with accounts that are seriously delinquent, which are \u201cback-end\u201d or  detective controls rather than \u201cfront-end\u201d or preventive controls.  To  effectively reform the travel program, DOD and the Army will need to work  to prevent potentially fraudulent and abusive activity and severe credit  problems with the travel card.  Preventive solutions include requiring use  of the split disbursement payment process by all employees; providing a  sufficient control infrastructure to effectively manage the program;  exempting individuals with histories of financial problems from required  use of travel cards; deactivating cards when employees are not on official  travel; and providing appropriate, consistent disciplinary action to  employees who commit fraud or abuse the travel cards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To reduce DOD\u2019s travel card delinquency and charge-off rates, particularly  the Army\u2019s, which are higher than those of any other executive branch  agency, the Congress should consider authorizing the Secretary of Defense  to require using employees\u2019 travel allowances to pay the travel card issuer  directly for charges incurred using the travel card.

DOD also stated the  Army intends to publish guidance that will require the APCs to notify  supervisors/commanders of incidents of abuse, misuse, delinquency, and  other events, including NSF checks.  This response appears to address the  intent of our recommendation.  We agree that APCs should be trained to  identify NSF checks and to report cardholders who write NSF checks to  the appropriate level of command for review and possible further action.   The supervisors and commanders would still maintain their discretion to  select the specific disciplinary action, if any, depending on the  circumstances of individual cases.", "Regarding establishing Army-wide disciplinary action policy for abusive  travel card activity, DOD stated that the Army already has a strong policy in  place against theft, fraud, and other intentionally dishonest conduct on the  part of civilian employees and that it would be inconsistent with current  law for the Army to establish further mandatory requirements that impose  specific disciplinary actions.  With regard to military personnel, DOD stated  that disciplinary actions are addressed as a matter of command discretion.", "We never contemplated that the policy would prescribe mandatory actions.   Rather, we intended the policy to be a guide of possible disciplinary actions  to be taken against cardholders.  This guidance would also serve as an  important internal control feature that clearly identifies the consequences  associated with improper and abusive travel card use and would serve as a  deterrent to such abuse.  Further, the policy could include a range of  actions that would be appropriate for various types of travel card misuse.   To eliminate any confusion concerning the intent of our recommendation,  we made a slight modification to the text of the recommendation.", "We also recommended developing a system to identify travel  reimbursements that exceed the 30-day requirement so that individuals not  paid within the statutory period are paid late fees in accordance with the  law.  DOD agreed that the current systems for processing and computing  travel vouchers for the Army do not provide for automated means of  calculating interest due on vouchers exceeding the 30 days from the proper  submission date.  DOD also stated that the Defense Travel System (DTS)  currently being deployed automates the voucher submission process and  should reduce the instances where reimbursements extend beyond 30  days.  However, the DOD Office of Inspector General concluded in a recent  report that DTS remains at high risk of not being an effective solution in  streamlining the DOD travel management process and that it is not  expected to be deployed until fiscal year 2006.  This system has been under  development since 1998 with substantial schedule delays and cost overruns  as well as reductions in functionality. Based on this evaluation, we do not  consider DTS to be a timely or viable solution for identifying those  reimbursements outside of the 30-day requirement.  TTRA and GSA  regulations require that late fees be paid to those persons reimbursed  outside of the 30-day requirement.  TTRA imposes a duty on agencies to  pay the late fees and does not condition the payment of late fees on  travelers identifying late reimbursements and submitting claims for the  fees.  Until DTS is fully implemented and operational, we continue to  believe that DOD needs to develop an interim process to identify late  reimbursements and pay cardholders the appropriate fees in accordance  with the law.", "In addition, in one area, although DOD concurred with our  recommendation, we do not believe that its response indicates full  agreement or understanding of the intent of the recommendation.   Specifically, with regard to our recommendation that credit check results  be used to make decisions on travel card applicants, DOD responded that  those with prior credit problems are issued restricted cards and that  mandatory use of the government travel card is required by TTRA.  This is  not correct.  Both the DOD FMR and TTRA provide for exemptions from  the mandatory use requirements under certain conditions, including  evidence of financial irresponsibility.  When an exemption is granted from  the mandatory use of the travel charge card, the use of personal funds,  including cash or personal charge card; travel advances; or Government  Travel Requests may be authorized for payment of travel expenses.  We  continue to believe that until the Army takes action to consider past credit  problems in determining whether to authorize issuing government travel  cards, it will continue to increase the risk that individuals will repeat a  pattern of fraud, abuse, and delinquency or nonpayment.  Our report  includes numerous examples of such individuals, including those who were  issued restricted cards.", "Finally, in concurring with our recommendations regarding the lack of  segregation of duties and other voucher processing problems at the  California Army National Guard, DOD indicated that it had a number of  detective and compensating controls in place.

When Bank of America has not received a required payment on any travel  cardholder\u2019s account within 60 days of the billing statement closing date,  the account is considered delinquent.

Bank of America has the option to call the  cardholder with a reminder that payment is past due and to advise the  cardholder that the account will be suspended if it becomes 60 days past  due.  55 days past due\u2014Bank of America is to send the cardholder a pre- suspension letter warning that Bank of America will suspend the  account if it is not paid.  If Bank of America suspends an account, the  card cannot be used until the account is paid.  60 days past due\u2014The APC is to issue a 60-day delinquency notification  memorandum to the cardholder and to the cardholder\u2019s immediate  supervisor informing them that the cardholder\u2019s account has been  suspended by Bank of America due to nonpayment.  The next day, a  suspension letter is to be sent by Bank of America to the cardholder  providing notice that the card has been suspended until payment is  received.  75 days past due\u2014Bank of America is to assess the account a late fee.", "The late fee charged by Bank of America was $20 through August 9,  2001.  Effective August 10, 2001, Bank of America increased the late fee  to $29 under the terms of the contract modification between Bank of  America and DOD.  Bank of America is allowed to assess an additional  late fee every 30 days until the account is made current or charged off.  90 days past due\u2014The APC is to issue a 90-day delinquency notification  memorandum to the cardholder, the cardholder\u2019s immediate supervisor,  and the company commander (or unit director).  The company  commander is to initiate an investigation into the delinquency and take  appropriate action, at his or her discretion.  At the same time, Bank of  America is to send a \u201cdue process letter\u201d to the cardholder providing  notice that the account will be canceled if payment is not received  within 30 days unless he or she enters into a payment plan, disputes  charge(s) in question, or declares bankruptcy.  120 days past due\u2014The APC is to issue a 120-day delinquency  notification memorandum to the cardholder\u2019s commanding officer.  At  the same time, Bank of America is to send a pre-cancellation letter to the  cardholder. At 126 days past due, the account is to be canceled by Bank  of America.  Beginning in October 2001, once accounts were 120 days  past due, Bank of America began sending files to DFAS listing these  accounts for salary offset.    180 days past due\u2014Bank of America is to send a \u201cpre-charge off\u201d or last  call letter to the cardholder informing him or her that Bank of America  will charge off the account and report the cardholder to a credit bureau  if payment is not received.  A credit bureau is a service that reports the  credit history of an individual.  Banks and other businesses assess the  credit-worthiness of an individual using credit bureau reports.  210 days past due\u2014Bank of America is to charge off the delinquent  account and, if the balance is $50 or greater, report it to a credit bureau.", "Some accounts are pursued for collection by Bank of America\u2019s recovery  department, others are sent to attorneys or collection agencies for  recovery.  The delinquency management process can be suspended when a  cardholder\u2019s APC informs Bank of America that the cardholder is on  official travel, but is unable to submit vouchers and timely pay his or her  account, through no fault of his or her own.  Under such circumstances, the  APC is to notify the Bank of America that the cardholder is in mission- critical status.  Activating this status precludes Bank of America from  identifying the cardholder\u2019s account as delinquent until 45 days after such  time as the APC determines the cardholder is to be removed from mission- critical status.

We  reviewed applicable policies and procedures and program guidance they  provided.  We visited four Army units to gain an understanding of the travel  process, including the management of travel card usage and delinquency.   We visited the DFAS Orlando location to gain an understanding of the  voucher review and payment process used for two of the four Army  locations we tested.

We selected two units from Army\u2019s Forces Command  because that command represented approximately 19 percent of travel  card activity, 22 percent of the delinquent accounts, and 28 percent of  accounts charged off during fiscal year 2001 across the Army.  We also  selected an Army National Guard location because the Army National  Guard represented 13 percent of the total travel card activity, 22 percent of  the delinquent accounts, and 15 percent of charge-offs for fiscal year 2001.   Special Operations Command represents about 6 percent of Army\u2019s charge  card activity, 5 percent of the delinquent accounts, and 4 percent of Army  travel card accounts charged off in fiscal year 2001.  Each of the units  within the commands was selected because of the relative size of the unit  within the respective command.", "At each of the Army locations we audited we also used our review of  policies and procedures and the results of our understanding of travel  processes and other observations to assess the effectiveness of controls  over segregation of duties among persons responsible for preparing travel  vouchers, processing and approving travel vouchers, and certifying travel  voucher payments.   In addition, to ensure that work responsibilities were  properly segregated at the California National Guard so that no single  individual can perform or control all key aspects of computer-related  operations, we performed a limited review of security controls in place at  that location over access to DOD\u2019s Integrated Automated Travel System  (IATS).  California National Guard personnel used this system to record  and process travel vouchers.
