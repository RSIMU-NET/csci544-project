According to State officials, its policy is to allow its program managers and ambassadors to use their discretion when determining which programs and activities to mark or publicize. USDA, DOD, HHS, Treasury, and MCC have also established some policies for marking and publicizing assistance, though these policies vary in their level of formality and detail. To increase awareness of U.S. assistance abroad, key agencies that we reviewed used various methods to mark and publicize some of their activities and exercised flexibility in deciding when it was appropriate to do so. These agencies used different methods of marking, or visibly acknowledging, their assistance. In addition, agencies generally used embassy public affairs offices for publicizing, information about the source of their assistance and, in some cases, augmented these efforts with their own publicity methods. We identified some challenges to marking and publicizing U.S. foreign assistance, including the lack of (1) a strategy for assessing the impact of marking and publicity efforts on increasing the awareness of U.S. foreign assistance and (2) governmentwide guidance for marking and publicizing U.S. foreign assistance. First, although some agencies conduct surveys in recipient countries that primarily capture information on public opinion of the United States, little reliable work has been done to assess the impact of U.S. assistance on foreign citizens' awareness of the source of U.S. provided assistance.

Foreign assistance has  grown in complexity in recent years as the United States, through the  efforts of a wide spectrum of U.S. agencies, has used foreign aid to address  transforming events such as the end of the Cold War; the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001; and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

Moreover,  circumstances may occur when U.S. foreign assistance marking may need  to be modified or withheld due to safety, political, or other concerns, such  as concerns associated with advising high-level government officials or  providing foreign assistance in volatile issue areas such as narcotics  control. Also, at certain times, such as before elections, marking of foreign  assistance activities may be suspended to remove any association of U.S.  foreign assistance with certain issues\u2014such as the connection between  funding a health clinic and the issue of reproductive health.

For example, in  Serbia, in order to not compromise the perceived neutrality of program  activities and diminish the credibility of materials produced during the  course of the project, USAID approved exceptions to marking  requirements for certain activities associated with a civil society project in  public policy advocacy and reform. USAID regulations also allow for the  possibility that, political, safety, or security conditions could warrant a  request to the mission director or the most senior USAID officer at the  mission for a full or partial waiver of the marking requirements. For  example, in Indonesia, the mission director approved a waiver of the  marking requirements for a project designed to demonstrate democracy\u2019s  compatibility with Islam because of threats from religious fundamentalists  to the safety of the individuals involved in the project.

On  another project, a communication officer was contacted by television  producers who were preparing a video about an ecological project that  had received USAID foreign assistance funding. At the communications  officer\u2019s suggestion, the producers interviewed the USAID mission  director to highlight how USAID supported the project. The final film was  shown on television.", "In Serbia, two newly hired communication specialists redesigned a Web  site and, subsequently, developed questions on public awareness of  USAID\u2019s foreign assistance activities that were incorporated into the  embassy\u2019s public opinion poll.", "According to mission officials in South Africa, the outreach efforts of the  communications specialist there have resulted in an improved perception  among the local population of USAID/South Africa programs, which were  previously hampered by negative comments made by high-level South  African government officials in the late 1990s. In addition, the  communications specialist conducted five training workshops, primarily  for PEPFAR partners, on how to write stories of successful projects. The  workshops resulted in more than 40 stories submitted by implementing  partners, which were posted on various U.S. government Web sites and in  publications.

However, these surveys focus on  tracking trends in the foreign public\u2019s perception of the United States to  serve U.S. public diplomacy efforts and do not assess public awareness of  U.S. foreign assistance activities or the effectiveness of publicity activities.  Some individual embassies perform surveys of public attitudes and  awareness relating to U.S. foreign assistance activities. For example, the  surveys commissioned by the embassy in Serbia and Montenegro attempt  to measure public awareness of foreign assistance programs in addition to  measuring public perception of the United States. However, the surveys do  not attempt to link any foreign assistance programs to the level of  awareness, but instead track changes in the level of awareness for a given  period of time.", "USAID also conducts some research. The agency requires that its  communications specialists develop a communications strategy that  includes methods to measure impact, and USAID\u2019s communications  manual encourages communications specialists to monitor local media  coverage and obtain and analyze locally conducted polls as a means to  measures results. The agency has contracted with polling firms to conduct  eight public opinion surveys in various locations overseas\u2014including one  survey in Egypt, two in Indonesia, one in Jordan (along with a focus  group), one in Colombia, and three in the West Bank and Gaza. According  to a USAID official, these surveys were designed to test different methods  for conducting broad-based public affairs campaigns. The surveys  included questions to assess (1) the extent of awareness of USAID and  U.S. foreign assistance; (2) attitudes toward USAID and U.S. foreign  assistance among recipients of that foreign assistance; and (3) which  communication sources, ranging from billboards and magazines to  television and the Internet, may be most effective in reaching target  audiences. Although each of the USAID surveys we reviewed provide  information about the extent of awareness of USAID and U.S. assistance,  the surveys in Colombia, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza were  not designed to compare pre- and post-campaign levels of awareness.

USAID hired a  contractor to train communications specialists on public opinion polling.  The training instructs communications specialists on issues such as the  importance and benefits of polling, types of polling, the most effective  ways to deliver messages, principles of sampling in polling, and how to  hire a qualified agency to conduct the polls.

During our field visits to  five countries between May and August 2006, we found that three of the  five embassies lacked specific guidance that addresses assistance  publicity. Embassy Mission Performance Plans are the means by which an  embassy aligns its plans, programs, and resources with the U.S.  government\u2019s international affairs strategy, including publicizing foreign  assistance. Only one Mission Performance Plan\u2014for Serbia and  Montenegro\u2014listed foreign assistance publicity as an embassy priority  and established that the embassy would increase its outreach activities  and aggressive advertising of U.S. foreign assistance by (1) improving  media coverage, (2) coordinating public diplomacy activities at the  mission to improve synergy and publicity of foreign assistance programs,  and (3) using polling and focus group information to help direct these  efforts. The embassy was also planning to expand exchange programs that  would bring individuals from Serbia and Montenegro to the United States.  The ambassador said that he became aware that U.S. foreign assistance  was not widely known in Serbia and Montenegro after he arrived at the  mission and saw that implementing partners often used project logos that  did not clearly communicate that the foreign assistance was from the  United States. He identified a need to more clearly portray U.S. foreign  assistance and made it a priority for the embassy. In addition, the Mission  Performance Plan for Liberia called for publicizing U.S. efforts to rebuild  security services and promote respect for human rights.", "In the five countries that we visited, we also found that assistance is  publicized by public affairs officers on an ad hoc basis and, as a result,  embassies may miss opportunities to publicize their foreign assistance  activities. For example, in Indonesia, the USDA attach\u00e9 told us that an  exchange program that brings agricultural specialists to the United States  for training has not been publicized by the embassy because the public  affairs officer was not aware of it. Also in Indonesia, the public affairs  officer almost missed a publicity opportunity when the officer was initially  opposed to issuing a press release on an event to promote a teacher- training program that was attended by representatives of an NGO and 15  Indonesian institutions, because communicating about the program was  not an embassy priority.  The public affairs officer later reconsidered and  issued a press release.", "Moreover, agencies at embassies may receive conflicting guidance on  marking their assistance activities when an agency\u2019s headquarters position  on marking differs from an embassy\u2019s position. After USAID headquarters  developed its logo in 2004, the Serbia and Montenegro embassy developed  a logo (featuring the American and Serbian and Montenegrin flags) and  encouraged all agencies to use it. Most agencies used the logo to mark and  publicize their foreign assistance activities, and the logo was also used on  the embassy Web site. Subsequently, the USAID mission developed and  used a logo that combined the embassy logo and USAID\u2019s logo. Although  the USAID mission\u2019s logo was different from the embassy logo, the  ambassador agreed to the compromise, and USAID used that logo to mark  and publicize its assistance activities.

Although State\u2019s public opinion polls measure  general public opinion trends, they do not specifically provide information  on the impact of the U.S. government\u2019s overall efforts to increase public  awareness of U.S. foreign assistance activities. USAID has only completed  a limited number of surveys to measure public awareness of U.S.  assistance, including a public opinion survey of U.S. post-tsunami efforts  in Indonesia.
