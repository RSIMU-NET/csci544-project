Within DHS, CBP temporarily holds individuals in its facilities and processes them for further action, such as release or transfer to ICE. ICE manages the nation's immigration detention system. ICE utilizes various facility types to detain individuals, such as those owned and operated by ICE and contract facilities. GAO was asked to review issues related to the care of pregnant women in DHS facilities.", "This report examines (1) what available data indicate about pregnant women detained or held in DHS facilities, (2) DHS policies and standards that address the care of pregnant women, and (3) what is known about the care provided to pregnant women in DHS facilities.", "GAO analyzed available DHS data and documents from calendar years 2015 through 2019, including detention data, inspection reports and data, and complaints; reviewed policies related to the care of pregnant women; and interviewed agency officials and three national non-governmental organizations.

However, some facility types\u2014which vary based on who owns, operates, and provides medical care at the facility\u2014did not address all these pregnancy-related topics in their policies and standards, such as prenatal vitamins, as of December 2019. ICE has plans to address the gaps GAO identified in these facility types, including updating some of its policies and detention standards in February 2020. In regards to CBP, its facilities are designed for holding individuals for no more than 72 hours, and therefore are not equipped to provide long-term care. Nonetheless, CBP has some policies and standards regarding pregnant women for its short-term facilities, including those related to nutrition and the circumstances in which restraints could be used.", "GAO's analyses of inspections and complaint mechanisms offered the following insights into the care provided to pregnant women:", "ICE inspections found 79 percent or greater compliance with most of its pregnancy-related performance measures. For example, inspections found 91 percent of pregnant woman were seen by an obstetrician-gynecologist within 30 days of pregnancy confirmation, from December 2016 through March 2019. According to ICE officials and agency documentation, ICE has processes in place to address non-compliance. Additional inspections identified pregnancy-related issues at 13 facilities from January 2015 through July 2019. The facilities or ICE have taken actions to address the issues.", "CBP generally relies on offsite care for pregnant women, and as a result has limited information on care CBP provided. However, CBP has efforts underway to enhance medical support at selected facilities.", "Over 100 complaints were filed about ICE's and CBP's care of pregnant women from January 2015 through April 2019. Of these complaints, 3 were substantiated or partially substantiated, and 24 were unsubstantiated or partially unsubstantiated. In most cases there was not enough information for the investigating agency to determine whether proper care had been provided."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The health and safety of pregnant women in the custody of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been a concern in recent  years for a number of policymakers, medical associations, and advocacy  groups. For example, a March 2018 letter written to DHS by various  medical groups noted their concerns about the health risks associated  with detaining pregnant women. The letter reported that the maternal  psychological state in detention can negatively affect fetal and child  development and that shackling during pregnancy can have serious  physical and mental health impacts on pregnant women. In addition,  some Members of Congress have introduced bills to, in part, limit the use  of restraints on pregnant women, set healthcare standards, and require  the use of alternatives to detention for pregnant women.", "In 2017, the President issued a series of executive orders related to  border security and immigration, including an Executive Order that  addressed DHS\u2019s immigration enforcement priorities. Specifically, on  January 25, 2017, the President issued an Executive Order instructing  federal agencies, including DHS, to employ all lawful means to ensure the  enforcement of the immigration laws of the United States against all  removable foreign nationals. On February 20, 2017, the Secretary of  Homeland Security issued a memorandum implementing the Executive  Order. In accordance with the Executive Order and memorandum, DHS  is no longer required to allocate resources according to tiered immigration  enforcement priorities, which had previously placed threats to national  security, border security, and public safety in the highest priority category.  Instead, various categories of removable individuals are general priorities  for removal, and DHS is authorized to take action against any removable  foreign national, including pregnant women, encountered during its law  enforcement operations. The memorandum states that DHS components  may allocate resources to prioritize enforcement activities, such as by  prioritizing enforcement against convicted felons or gang members.", "DHS cannot practicably pursue immigration enforcement action against  all persons who may be subject to removal from the United States, and,  therefore, DHS must continue to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the  enforcement of U.S. immigration law, given the administration\u2019s removal  priorities and available resources. At the time the Executive Order and  February 2017 memo were issued, the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) was also operating under an August 2016 memo,  titled Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant Detainees, that stated that  pregnant women would generally not be detained except in extraordinary  circumstances or as mandated by law. For example, ICE would be  required to detain a pregnant woman if she fell within one of the law\u2019s  mandatory detention categories, which includes foreign nationals deemed  inadmissible for certain criminal convictions or terrorist activity, or those  who have been ordered removed. This August 2016 memo was  superseded in December 2017 by a memo under the same title that  removed the language stating that absent extraordinary circumstances or  a legal requirement, pregnant women will generally not be detained by  ICE. In December 2019, we reported that the number of detentions of  pregnant women increased from calendar year 2016 to calendar year  2018.", "You asked us to review issues related to DHS\u2019s detention of pregnant  women. This report examines (1) what available data indicate about  pregnant women detained or held in DHS facilities; (2) policies and  standards that DHS has to address the care of pregnant women, and the  extent to which they are applicable across all facilities; and (3) what is  known about the care provided to pregnant women in DHS facilities.", "To address all three objectives, we interviewed DHS officials from ICE  and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in headquarters and four  field locations, pregnant detainees, and non-governmental organizations  (NGO) to obtain their perspectives on the care of pregnant women in  DHS custody. We selected locations based on ICE detention facilities that  had the greatest number of detentions of pregnant women from fiscal  years 2014 through 2017, which included a mix of facility types. For  each of our site visits, we observed the facility operations and conducted semi-structured interviews with ICE and contract officials responsible for  oversight or management of the facility, as well as ICE or contract  medical staff. In addition, we interviewed 10 pregnant women who were  detained at three of the four ICE facilities we visited. We interviewed an  additional four pregnant women at a local shelter in Texas after their  release from DHS custody. We also observed facility operations and  conducted six semi-structured interviews with CBP officials at four Border  Patrol facilities and four Office of Field Operations (OFO) ports of entry  that were located in the four locations we selected. Moreover, we  conducted semi-structured interviews with officials from five local and  three national NGOs to obtain their perspectives on the care of pregnant  women in DHS custody. While these site visits and interviews with field  officials, pregnant women, and NGOs are not generalizable and may not  be indicative of the care provided at all detention facilities, they provided  us with perspectives on the care provided to pregnant women.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed data sources that ICE uses to  track pregnant women in detention from calendar years 2016 through  2018 and matched these data with various ICE databases. Specifically,  we matched ICE records for pregnant women with data from ICE\u2019s  individual-level detention dataset to determine the total number of  detentions of pregnant women, as well as the length of detention, facility  location, case status, arresting agency, gestation of pregnancy, and  whether there is an associated criminal conviction (criminality). We  reported on total detentions since a pregnant woman may have been  detained multiple times during a calendar year. Our analysis is based on  over 4,600 detainee records we were able to match, including 1,377 for  2016; 1,150 for 2017; and 2,094 for 2018. We also merged the  detention data with data from ICE\u2019s weekly facility list report, as of  February 2019, to determine characteristics of the facilities in which our  study population were detained\u2014such as who owned and operated the  facility, who provided medical services, and in what state the facility was  located. Finally, we also analyzed ICE data on pregnancy outcomes\u2014 abortions, births, stillbirths, and miscarriages\u2014from 2015 through June  2019\u2014which includes, but is not limited to, our study population of over  4,600 detentions from 2016 through 2018. To determine the number of  pregnant women held by CBP, we analyzed summary data for the most  recent data available. We also analyzed CBP\u2019s significant incident  reports to identify pregnancy outcomes from 2015 through February  2019. We assessed the reliability of the data used in each of our  analyses by reviewing relevant information about these systems,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and conducting electronic  tests to identify missing data, anomalies, or potentially erroneous values.  We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for describing general  information on pregnant women in DHS custody.", "To address the second objective, we analyzed ICE and CBP policies and  standards and training documents that address the care of pregnant  women. Policies and detention standards we analyzed included (1) ICE  policies and detention standards that govern the conditions of  confinement at ICE detention facilities, and (2) CBP policies for Border  Patrol and OFO, and CBP\u2019s national standards. Furthermore, we  developed 16 pregnancy-related topics\u2014such as pregnancy testing  requirements, prenatal care, and the use of restraints\u2014and categorized  agency policies and standards accordingly. We analyzed the extent to  which ICE facility types had a policy or detention standard that addressed  each of these 16 topics. For this analysis, facility type was based on who  owns and operates the facility and provides medical care. Further, for  each of these topics, we summarized recommended guidance published  by NGOs, professional associations, and federal agencies, and assessed  the extent to which each ICE facility type had a policy or detention  standard that generally aligned with recommended guidance. We spoke  with ICE and CBP officials in headquarters and the selected field  locations noted above to obtain their perspectives on policies, detention  standards\u2014including any planned updates\u2014and related training.", "To address the third objective, we analyzed inspections results, agency  data, and complaint information. Specifically, we analyzed reports and  data from five ICE inspections that address compliance with pregnancy- related policies and detention standards from 2015 through July 2019.  We also analyzed ICE documentation on corrective actions that facilities  reported taking to address inspection findings. Further, we reviewed and  categorized complaints that detainees, family members, NGOs, or other  parties submitted through various complaint systems from January 2015  through April 2019\u2014the latest available complaints at the time of our  review\u2014regarding ICE\u2019s and CBP\u2019s care of pregnant women. We  selected these complaint systems because they contained relevant  information on the care of pregnant women, according to DHS officials. In  addition, we analyzed agency documentation on the extent to which  complaints could be substantiated, and any corrective actions that  agencies and facilities reported taking to address complaints. We also  reviewed ICE medical data from calendar year 2016 through 2018. We  also reviewed significant incident reports that CBP documented for  incidents that involved a pregnant woman being sent to a hospital from  2015 through February 2019. We assessed the reliability of the data  used in each of our analyses by reviewing relevant information about  these systems, interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and  conducting electronic tests to identify missing data, anomalies, or  potentially erroneous values. We determined the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes of understanding what is known about the care  of pregnant women in DHS custody. Further, we interviewed ICE and  CBP officials in headquarters and selected field locations, as previously  described.
