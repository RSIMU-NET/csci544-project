For instance, while FCC obtains information about the effectiveness of its efforts from stakeholders' comments and consumers' complaints, FCC has not sought performance information from more objective sources, such as consumer research\u2014as has been done by other government entities. Further, although consumer complaints can provide FCC with valuable insights on topics of interest to the commission, FCC has acknowledged that complaints may not provide a complete picture of consumer's information needs and some industry stakeholders have questioned FCC's reliance on complaints as a basis for making decisions. In addition, although FCC's strategic plan includes strategic objectives related to informing consumers about broadband networks, FCC lacks performance goals and measures to monitor the impact and effectiveness of its efforts to provide consumers with broadband performance information. GAO has previously reported that critical elements of effective performance management include information that is complete and consistent, with performance measures linked to goals.

Broadband  speeds are described in download and upload capabilities, and are  defined as the maximum rates at which data are delivered over the  Internet. A higher speed indicates a faster information delivery rate. For  example, a 10 megabits per second (Mbps) service should deliver ten  times as much data as a 1 Mbps service in the same period of time.", "Internet service providers (ISP) have marketed and competed with one  another on the speed of their various broadband plans. Advances in  technology, such as the use of fiber (described below) and new wireless  technologies, have allowed ISPs to offer increasingly faster speeds that  support new services and applications, such as streaming video. FCC  takes those advances into account as part of its required inquiry into  whether \u201cadvanced telecommunications capability\u201d is being deployed to  all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. Pursuant to this  inquiry, FCC recently updated the minimum speed benchmark it uses to  measure the availability of advanced telecommunications capability. In  addition to speed, a number of factors can be used to evaluate  broadband performance. See table 1.", "Consumers generally subscribe to broadband in two ways:", "Fixed: In-home fixed Internet plans are often sold as a monthly  subscription by cable television or telephone companies. Service from  cable television companies is generally provided through the same  coaxial cables that deliver television programming. Service from  telephone companies is generally provided through traditional copper  telephone lines\u2014commonly referred to as digital subscriber line (DSL)  service\u2014or fiber-optic lines, which convert electrical signals carrying  data into light and send the light through glass fibers. These network  technologies generally have higher speeds than mobile networks.  Consumers can connect a variety of devices to in-home fixed  networks through a wired connection or wireless Wi-Fi connection  (see fig. 1). Consumers are increasingly using the Internet to  supplement or replace their use of traditional services, such as  traditional telephone and cable TV service.", "Mobile: Traditionally, mobile providers sold access to the Internet as  an add-on to mobile telephone service plans that may or may not  include a multiyear contract. Mobile service is provided through cell  tower coverage with data sharing through radio spectrum. A number  of devices may connect to mobile broadband networks, such as smart  phones, tablets, and mobile devices that enable laptops to connect to  mobile networks (see fig. 2).", "The 2014 American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)with respect to fixed broadband service, consumer satisfaction regarding  data speeds and video streaming increased from 2013 to 2014. However,  ACSI also found that during this time period, customer satisfaction related  to service interruptions and outages, speed and service reliability, and  peak evening-hour performance declined. With respect to mobile  broadband providers, ACSI reported that customer satisfaction related to  speed for downloading data and streaming content increased from 2013   reported that  to 2014; however, ACSI also reported that the customer satisfaction  scores indicated that improvements were still needed in speed and  reliability.", "Broadband performance problems can manifest in a number of ways,  such as slow loading of content, lost connections, and pauses in  streaming video and audio. FCC, ISPs, content providers, and  researchers have noted that a variety of factors can affect broadband  performance, such as accessing the Internet during peak usage times,  outdated equipment in the home, or multiple users in the same household  accessing the Internet simultaneously. In addition, mobile broadband  performance will vary based on the location of the phone or device.  Running multiple applications at once or having multiple users in a  household may require greater speeds. Different types of Internet  applications use varying amounts of data and require different minimum  speeds to operate properly (see table 2). For example, email and web- browsing use small amounts of data, while watching movies uses larger  amounts of data. Use of data-intensive broadband applications is  projected to grow. FCC has noted that consumers are increasingly  using broadband applications that require large amounts of data, such as  streaming video content, which can require more consistency of service  and be more visibly affected by technical problems.", "In addition, congestion at various points on the network can affect a  user\u2019s broadband performance. In order to connect their customers to the  Internet, ISPs link with other networks, including \u201cbackbone providers\u201d  that move Internet traffic long distances and interconnect with other  networks. Companies may use a number of options to deliver their  content across the Internet, such as connecting with a backbone provider  (directly, or through an ISP), connecting directly to the consumer\u2019s ISP, or  paying a content delivery network to deliver their content to ISPs. See  figure 3 for a simplified illustration of how content moves from websites  and applications to consumers. Congestion occurring within the content  provider\u2019s network, at points of interconnection between the networks, or  within the ISP\u2019s network can all affect a consumer\u2019s broadband  performance.

The rule requires that fixed and mobile providers \u201cpublicly disclose  accurate information regarding the network management practices,  performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access  services sufficient for consumers to make informed choices regarding use  of such services\u2026\u201d In response to concerns from ISPs regarding the burden associated with specific requirements, FCC did not require ISPs  to disclose specific information in a standardized format. Instead, the  2010 Open Internet Order stated that FCC expected disclosures to  include some or all of certain types of information, such as actual speed,  to be timely and prominently disclosed in plain language accessible to  consumers and to, at a minimum, be provided through a publicly  available, easily accessible website. As part of its 2014 Open Internet  NPRM, FCC proposed enhancing the transparency rule and requested  comment on a variety of options, some of which are discussed later in this  report. In the resulting February 2015 Open Internet Order, FCC adopted  enhancements to the transparency rule, and stated that ISPs are required  to disclose certain information under the transparency rule. Specifically,  FCC now states that disclosures of network performance should include  actual speed, latency, and packet loss, and disclosures should also  include network management practices applied to specific users or user  groups (for example, users in a particular service plan or geographic  location). FCC also requires ISPs to develop a mechanism for directly  notifying consumers if their individual use of a network will trigger a  network practice that is likely to have a significant impact on the  consumer\u2019s use of the service.", "Currently, ISPs\u2019 disclosures vary with respect to length, content, and  where they are placed on ISPs\u2019 websites. In addition, according to public  interest groups we spoke with, the complexity of this information and its  lack of standardization across ISPs can make it difficult for consumers to  find and use the information to compare broadband products and  services. Some groups also raised concerns that consumers have  difficulty understanding the information. However, some of the ISP and  trade associations we spoke with questioned the rationale for more  specific disclosure requirements, stating that consumers have access to  the information they need or that flexibility is important, given the  difficulties in explaining technical performance information to consumers.  In addition, some ISPs and a trade association argued in written  comments filed with the FCC that a standardized disclosure requiring  specific information from ISPs could overlook features that may be of  greater importance to consumers (such as nationwide wireless access) or  confuse consumers by providing highly technical information. However,  other ISPs were open to adopting a standardized label (as discussed  below), with one ISP stating in written comments that it might help  consumers make informed choices.", "FCC\u2019s Open Internet Advisory Committee\u2019s Transparency Working Group  studied how ISPs\u2019 present performance and pricing information and  issued a report in which it recommended that FCC promote a voluntary  labeling program to help consumers more easily compare and select  broadband service offerings. The working group suggested the program  be voluntary and result in a label that would include information on an  ISP\u2019s upload and download speed, price, and usage restrictions.  However, the report also noted a number of complexities associated with  implementing a standardized label program, such as accounting for  variability in broadband speeds, as well as for factors beyond the ISP\u2019s  control, and the potential for consumers to purchase more expensive  packages due to a lack of consumer education on what speeds they  need. FCC officials told us that they have considered standardized labels,  but developing a label that is easy to use, useful for consumers with  differing broadband needs, and relevant in a changing environment is  complicated. Researchers have noted that standardized performance  information could help third parties develop tools and information that  allow consumers to compare multiple broadband services. FCC  requested comment on the working group\u2019s label proposal as part of its  2014 Open Internet NPRM. In its 2015 Open Internet Order, FCC  established a voluntary safe harbor for the format and nature of the  required disclosure to consumers. To take advantage of the safe harbor,  a broadband provider must provide a consumer-focused, stand-alone  disclosure. FCC, however, did not mandate the exact format of such  disclosure at this time. Instead, it directed its Consumer Advisory  Committee to develop and submit to the commission a voluntary  disclosure format that ISPs could use to ensure compliance with the  transparency rule no later than October 31, 2015.", "Online third-party speed tests allow consumers to test the performance of  their broadband service by sending and receiving data between the  consumer\u2019s device (such as a laptop or smart phone) and a test server.  For example, www.speedtest.net measures users\u2019 broadband speed, and  www.pingtest.net tests other parameters and provides an overall grade  that includes information on which applications may be affected by the  user\u2019s broadband performance characteristics. FCC also released an  application that allows users to test the speed, latency, and packet loss of  their mobile broadband.to help consumers understand their broadband performance. In some  cases, third parties have created sites that rank broadband providers  based on the results of speed-test data. For example, OOKLA\u2019s  www.netindex.com uses data from its speed test and consumer surveys  to create country, state, and city-level rankings of fixed and mobile  broadband providers in terms of upload and download speed, as well as  other performance measures. This allows consumers to compare  providers based on their performance in the consumer\u2019s local area.  RootMetrics.com provides similar data on mobile broadband, including  assessments of the mobile ISPs\u2019 speed and reliability.", "In addition, ISPs may provide speed test tools  However, the information from speed tests may not provide consumers  with the information they need to understand what factors are affecting  their broadband performance. Studies we reviewed and stakeholders we  spoke with noted that speed tests can be affected by a variety of factors,  which makes it difficult for consumers to identify what specific problem is  affecting their broadband performance. For example, researchers have  noted that online speed tests can be affected by the home equipment and  the number of users accessing the Internet in the home; however, these  tests may not enable consumers to discern that these factors are  affecting their speeds. In addition, speed tests can be limited in  reflecting the end-user\u2019s actual experience because speed tests vary  methodologically, and different tests can provide differing results,  depending on the location of the speed test server. If a speed test server  is located outside the consumer\u2019s ISP network, then the results could be  affected by congestion occurring on networks outside of the ISP\u2019s control.  For example, when using third-party speed tests, a consumer\u2019s traffic  may travel over networks that are not controlled by their ISP, and  congestion on those networks may have an effect on the speed test. On  the other hand, speed tests hosted by an ISP may only test the  performance of the ISP\u2019s network, and thus do not capture congestion  that may be affecting a consumer\u2019s ability to access content outside of  their ISP\u2019s network.", "Stakeholders we interviewed noted that consumers may experience  performance problems due to disputes between ISPs and content  providers regarding interconnection (interconnection disputes) that lead to  network congestion when consumers are accessing specific sites, and  these problems may not be reflected in speed tests. Congestion at  interconnection points has been identified as a problem contributing to  poor broadband performance, particularly with respect to streaming video  content. Such congestion may not be adequately captured by third-party  or ISP speed tests, since it may be limited to a specific interconnection  point not used by the speed test server. Some content providers, such as  Google, have provided alerts to consumers when Internet congestion is  affecting their broadband performance. However, information regarding  interconnection agreements can be subject to non-disclosure  agreements, and there have been several disputes regarding who is  responsible for addressing interconnection congestion. In June 2014,  FCC released a statement asserting that these interconnection disputes  can affect consumers\u2019 broadband performance and that in the interest of  providing consumers with more transparency, FCC was obtaining copies  of interconnection agreements to further its understanding of  interconnection disputes. Separately, in the 2015 Open Internet Order,  FCC stated that it would hear interconnection disputes on a case-by-case  basis.", "ISPs\u2019 traffic management policies can also affect the results of speed  tests, making comparisons across providers difficult. In August 2014, a  public interest group announced it was filing a complaint against T- Mobile. According to the group, T-Mobile was slowing down the  broadband speeds provided to mobile broadband subscribers that had   however, T-Mobile did not slow down traffic  reached their usage limits; coming from speed test applications. Thus, if a T-Mobile customer whose  broadband was being slowed down accessed a speed test to try and  determine their broadband speed, their speed test would show a higher  speed than the customer was actually receiving. The public interest group  stated that this was a violation of the transparency rule, because  consumers were not receiving accurate information regarding network  performance. In November, FCC issued a press release stating that T- Mobile agreed to take several actions to ensure consumers were able to  obtain accurate measures of their speed, including providing a link to a  speed test that would reflect the speed reduction. There have also been  press reports that backbone networks\u2019 traffic management policies have  affected speed test results, and researchers have noted that ISPs can  design their networks to provide better speed test results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Reports on Broadband Performance, but the Reports Are Not Targeted toward Consumers", "paragraphs": ["Since 2011, FCC has published annual reports with broadband  performance results from its Measuring Broadband America (MBA)   The MBA program compares fixed ISPs\u2019 average delivered  effort.download and upload speeds against their advertised speeds (for a 24- hour period, as well as for the peak usage time of 7 PM to 11 PM on  weeknights), and provides additional information on measurements of  latency and website loading time. FCC is working to expand its MBA  effort to include mobile broadband providers and, as part of that process,  has released an app for consumers to download and test their mobile  broadband speeds.", "MBA developed out of a recommendation in the 2010 National  Broadband Plan to improve the availability of information for consumers  about their broadband service. At the time, there were concerns that ISPs  were not delivering their advertised speeds, and data were not available  to determine whether this was the case. FCC officials stated that MBA  allowed them to verify the accuracy of ISPs\u2019 advertising claims. FCC  collaborated with industry and public interest stakeholders when  designing the MBA program. The sample population is drawn from  subscribers of 14 of the largest ISPs (which serve over 80 percent of the  residential marketplace) and consists of about 6,000 volunteers. Unlike  online speed tests that consumers may access from a variety of websites,  MBA only tests elements under the direct or indirect control of a  consumer\u2019s ISP, from the consumer\u2019s gateway\u2014the modem or router  used by the consumer to access the Internet\u2014to a nearby major Internet  gateway point. Thus, the results are not affected by congestion occurring  outside of an ISP\u2019s network.", "In 2014, FCC found that the ISPs included in the report were, on average,  delivering 101 percent of advertised download speeds during the peak  usage hours. FCC, ISPs, and public interest group representatives  stated that the transparency provided through MBA spurred competition  among providers and led to improved speeds, which benefit consumers.", "In addition, ISPs that participate in the MBA effort can provide consumers  with their MBA results in order to comply with the transparency rule\u2019s  disclosure requirements. Researchers have used raw data from MBA to  conduct in-depth analyses of broadband performance. FCC officials also  told us that it uses the information from the MBA report to inform its  rulemakings on broadband, such as raising the broadband speed for  providers to be eligible for the Connect America Fund, which supports  telephone and broadband service for rural residents.", "FCC is also in the process of considering next steps for the program. As  noted above, in order to provide comparable results across ISPs, the  MBA initially only measured the ISP\u2019s network. Thus, delays incurred in  the consumer\u2019s home or in segments of the Internet outside an ISP\u2019s  network were excluded from the results. For example, in the 2014 MBA  report, FCC noted that it excluded data from the report after discovering  some testing servers (and thus, any measurements taken using these  servers) were affected by congestion at interconnection points where  ISPs exchange traffic with Internet backbone providers. FCC acknowledged that consumers accessing services and content over  the affected paths would likely see a significant degradation in their  service, but FCC stated that it did not include the results from these  servers in its report because it aims to provide an analysis of average  network performance. Two public interest groups we interviewed raised  concerns that the MBA results were not reflecting the experience of  consumers whose broadband performance was negatively affected by  interconnection disputes. In the 2014 MBA report, FCC noted that while  MBA was initially focused on measuring broadband performance from the  consumer to the end of the service provider\u2019s network, Internet services  and applications rely on a complex and variable arrangement of  interconnected networks to reach consumers. FCC stated that it is  exploring options to leverage its MBA effort to gain more insights into the  evolving performance of the Internet and provide better information to  consumers. For example, FCC officials told us that it is testing an  expansion of the MBA program to include measuring broadband  performance when a consumer is using streaming video services.", "According to FCC, this congestion was caused by business disputes between ISPs and  a backbone provider. FCC did collect results from the affected servers and released the  data for use by academics and others examining such congestion issues.", "Although the program initially was developed to provide consumers  access to broadband performance information, many of the various  stakeholders we interviewed, as well as FCC, generally agreed that most  consumers are unaware of the MBA report and do not rely on it to obtain  broadband performance information. MBA reports are highly technical  and include detailed appendices and raw data. FCC and some of the  ISPs and public interest groups we interviewed noted that information  collected through the MBA program may reach consumers through  secondary sources, such as ISPs\u2019 advertising and transparency rule  disclosures, news reports, and tech blogs. In addition, as noted above,  FCC and many of the ISPs and public interest groups stated that the  program has spurred competition among providers and led to improved  speeds. However, ISPs\u2019 offerings and performance can vary  geographically, and in the Open Internet comments we reviewed, two  stakeholders raised concerns that the MBA reports do not provide  consumers with information about broadband performance at the local  level. The National Broadband Plan recommended that FCC\u2019s broadband  performance reporting effort should include \u201cdetailed information about  the actual performance of the country\u2019s top broadband service providers  in different geographic markets (e.g., by county, city or [Metropolitan  Statistical Area]).\u201d In the 2014 MBA report, FCC stated that the data are  not collected in a way that permits meaningful conclusions about  broadband performance at the local level and that this limitation was a  result of cost issues and the finite number of measurement devices that  could be deployed over the course of the project. A report on the MBA  effort that was commissioned by FCC and conducted by the North  Carolina State University\u2019s Institute for Advanced Analytics primarily  reviewed MBA\u2019s methodology, but also made some suggestions for  making the data more consumer-friendly, including the use of a tool  developed by the group to help consumers compare ISPs\u2019 performance in  their states (when enough data were available to allow for statistically  valid comparisons)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Taken Steps to Evaluate Its Efforts to Inform Consumers, but Could Enhance Its Performance Information and Measures", "paragraphs": ["FCC has taken steps to determine whether its efforts to provide  consumers with broadband performance information\u2014such as the  transparency rule and MBA program\u2014are effective and meeting  consumers\u2019 needs.

In addition,  officials told us that consumer complaints have indicated that service  reliability is now as important to consumers as speed due to the  popularity of video-streaming services, such as Netflix, and that as a  result, they are exploring ways to further incorporate service reliability  information into the MBA program. They also told us that based on  consumer complaints, they knew that consumers could not easily  access\u2014and in some cases were not provided\u2014certain performance  information (e.g., ISPs\u2019 network management practices, data limits, etc.),  and FCC tried to address this issue through the transparency rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC\u2019s Ability to Evaluate Its Efforts Is Limited by a Lack of Useful Performance Information and Relevant Performance Goals and Measures", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCC Obtains Inconsistent and Incomplete Performance Information from Stakeholder Comments and Consumer Complaints", "paragraphs": ["We have previously found that leading organizations that have  progressed toward results-oriented management use performance  information as a basis for decision-making and that the usefulness of  performance information can be affected by its completeness, accuracy,  consistency, validity, and credibility, among other things. For example,  performance information can focus on various dimensions of  performance, such as outcomes, outputs, quality, or customer  satisfaction, and can help agencies monitor their progress in meeting  programmatic and operational goals. Although stakeholder comments  and consumer complaints can provide FCC with valuable insights on  topics of interest to the commission, the information FCC obtains from  these sources lacks some of the characteristics of useful performance  information, such as consistency and completeness.", "Our review of selected stakeholders\u2019 Open Internet comments found that  they generally provided inconsistent views regarding the effectiveness of  FCC\u2019s efforts to provide consumers with broadband performance  information. For instance, some public interest groups and content  providers argued that FCC\u2019s transparency rule was not providing  consumers the information they need to make informed decisions  regarding broadband services. In their view, FCC should have required  ISPs to provide additional technical information\u2014such as detailed  information on network congestion\u2014under the transparency rule.  However, ISPs countered that this level of technical detail would be  confusing to consumers and that the transparency rule had been effective  in providing consumers with the information they need. For example, Cox  Communications, an ISP, stated that, \u201cmost of the expanded disclosure  proposals included in the NPRM would impose burdensome obligations  that are highly unlikely to prove useful to consumers and would only  degrade the overall effectiveness of the transparency rule.\u201d FCC has  acknowledged that it has not received consistent information in response  to its requests for comments. For instance, in its 2010 Open Internet  Order, FCC states that despite broad agreement that broadband  providers should disclose information sufficient to enable end users and  content providers to understand the capabilities of broadband services,  commenters disagree about the appropriate level of detail required to  achieve this goal. As a result, FCC decided to continue to allow ISPs  flexibility in the implementation of the transparency rule while providing  guidance regarding acceptable disclosure methods. Similarly, in its 2015  Open Internet Order, FCC noted that despite its efforts to seek comment  on this issue, the record was lacking with respect to specific details on  how such a disclosure should be formatted. Thus, as previously  mentioned, FCC asked its Consumer Advisory Committee to propose a  disclosure format.", "As noted above, in the 2014 Open Internet NPRM, FCC cited consumer  complaints as a basis for tentatively concluding that the transparency rule  should be strengthened. However, in the NPRM FCC also acknowledged  that its analysis of consumer complaints provided limited insight into the  issues that consumers were experiencing. Specifically, FCC stated that  since the transparency rule took effect, it had received a \u201csignificant  number\u201d of consumer complaints about provider speeds, charges, and  other practices that the rule was designed to disclose. However, FCC  also stated that in some cases, it is difficult to discern from the complaints  \u201cwhether the consumer\u2019s frustration is with slow speeds or high prices  generally, or instead with how the service as actually provided differs from  what the provider has advertised.\u201d Moreover, because consumer  complaints reflect the perspective of a non-representative sample of  consumers\u2014i.e., those who have experienced broadband issues and  have chosen to report those issues to the FCC\u2014they do not fully capture  the effectiveness of FCC\u2019s efforts for a broader range of consumers.  Consequently, several Open Internet comments we reviewed filed by  ISPs and industry associations questioned FCC\u2019s reliance on complaints  as a basis for decision-making.", "In addition, we have previously noted concerns with FCC\u2019s complaint  process. In 2009, we found that many wireless phone service  consumers were not aware that they could file complaints with FCC when  they encountered problems. We also found that FCC did not complete in- depth analyses of consumer complaints and lacked goals and measures  that clearly identified the intended outcomes of its complaint-processing  efforts. As a result, we noted that FCC may not be aware (1) of emerging  trends in consumer problems, (2) if specific rules are being violated, or (3)  if additional rules are needed to protect consumers. We made a number  of recommendations to help address these issues, and FCC has  indicated that it is in the process of reforming the agency\u2019s complaint  process. For example, in January 2015, FCC launched a new online  consumer-help center. According to FCC, the online center will make it  easier for consumers to file complaints with FCC, improve  communications between consumers and FCC representatives, and help  streamline FCC\u2019s process for synthesizing and analyzing trends in  consumer complaints. While these steps may enhance FCC\u2019s ability to  assess the effectiveness of its efforts among the subset of consumers  who file complaints, they will not provide FCC information regarding the  effectiveness of its efforts for a broader range of consumers.", "Without consistent and complete information regarding the effectiveness  of its efforts to provide consumers with broadband performance  information, FCC\u2019s ability to evaluate its efforts and make performance- based decisions about these efforts is limited. In addition, FCC may find it  difficult to convince stakeholders that enhancements to its transparency  rule and MBA program are warranted. As we reviewed industry groups\u2019  Open Internet comments, we found many stating that FCC did not provide  adequate evidence that ISPs\u2019 disclosures under the transparency rule  were ineffective and that enhancements or changes to the rule were  needed. For example, Cisco, an equipment provider, stated that FCC\u2019s  concerns regarding the accuracy of information some consumers  received under the transparency rule do not imply that additional  disclosures are called for, but rather that the commission may need to  enforce the requirements instead.", "In contrast to the approaches FCC typically relies on to evaluate the  effectiveness of its efforts to provide consumers with broadband  performance information, other government entities have undertaken  extensive, qualitative, and quantitative consumer research to evaluate the  effectiveness of their efforts to inform consumers and ensure that  consumers\u2019 information needs are being met. For example:", "Ofcom\u2014the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) communications regulatory  agency\u2014has conducted qualitative and quantitative research to  determine consumers\u2019 use and understanding of ISPs\u2019 traffic  management information and the effectiveness of a standardized form  that all major UK ISPs voluntarily use to publish their traffic  management information. For instance, in 2013, Ofcom  commissioned a study that involved qualitative workshops with 135  participants and a representative survey of UK broadband consumers.  The study found that consumers had problems understanding some  aspects of the standardized form and suggested several potential  improvements that could make the information more understandable  to consumers, such as adding a summary to the form explaining the  relevance of traffic management policies to broadband products.", "The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) conducted  qualitative and quantitative consumer research when revamping  mortgage disclosure forms. The CFPB tested the prototype of the  revised disclosure form through 10 rounds of qualitative testing in nine  cities. After issuing the revised forms the CFPB also conducted a  large-scale quantitative validation test\u2014that included 858 consumers  in 20 locations\u2014to compare the revised forms with the disclosures  that were currently in use.", "Some stakeholders we spoke with and whose comments we reviewed  also suggested that FCC should undertake consumer research to inform  and evaluate its efforts to provide consumers with broadband  performance information. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission filed  comments with FCC stating that research has shown that well-designed  standardized disclosures can improve consumer understanding and  facilitate competition; however, to be most effective, these disclosures  should be developed and revised based on controlled, quantitative,  objective tests of consumer understanding. In addition, representatives  from one industry association we spoke with stated that FCC\u2019s analytical  framework, which largely consists of requesting and reviewing  stakeholder comments, is not consumer-centric and may not be the most  productive process for obtaining an accurate representation of  consumers\u2019 information needs. These representatives noted that given  the time, effort, and money ISPs expend to collect broadband  performance data for FCC\u2019s MBA program, it is important to make sure  that the data are presented in a way that is meaningful to consumers. In  their view, FCC should also be conducting consumer research, such as  focus groups, to make sure that its MBA effort produces a report that  consumers can understand. According to FCC officials, FCC\u2019s goal is to  improve the accessibility, accuracy, and relevance of the broadband  performance information available to consumers. Because consumers\u2019  decision-making processes are complex and can vary, FCC has not  attempted to formally evaluate whether its efforts to provide consumers  with broadband performance information are meeting consumers\u2019 needs.  Officials also told us that they do not believe this type of research has  been conducted outside of FCC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Lacks Performance Goals and Measures to Monitor Its Efforts to Inform Consumers", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s current strategic plan includes strategic objectives related to  informing consumers about broadband networks\u2014reflecting its position  that informed consumers help facilitate competition in the broadband  market.

However, FCC does not include any  performance goals under these strategic objectives that define desired  outcomes for its efforts to provide consumers with broadband  performance information, such as its transparency rule and MBA  program. Consequently, FCC also lacks relevant performance measures  under these strategic objectives that would allow it to monitor the impact  and effectiveness of its efforts. We have previously reported that effective  performance goals and measures possess certain characteristics. These  include the following: 1) performance goals should clearly define the  organization\u2019s desired outcomes, and 2) each performance goal should  have a few performance measures that clearly tie back to the goal, cover  key performance dimensions, and take different priorities into account.Without performance goals and measures that allow FCC to monitor its  progress on its goals related to providing consumers with broadband  performance information, FCC has limited assurance that its efforts to  provide consumers with broadband performance information are effective  and meeting consumers\u2019 needs.
