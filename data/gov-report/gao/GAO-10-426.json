However, clinical developments and emphasis on cost containment have prompted a shift to other settings, including the home. Home infusion requires coordination among providers of drugs, equipment, and skilled nursing care, as needed. GAO was asked to review home infusion coverage policies and practices to help inform Medicare policy. In this report, GAO describes (1) coverage of home infusion therapy components under Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), (2) coverage and payment for home infusion therapy by other health insurers--both commercial plans and Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which provide a private alternative to Medicare FFS, and (3) the utilization and quality management practices that health insurers use with home infusion therapy benefits. To do this work, GAO reviewed Medicare program statutes, regulations, policies, and benefits data. GAO also interviewed officials of five large private health insurers that offered commercial and MA plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The extent of Medicare FFS coverage of home infusion therapy depends on whether the beneficiary is homebound, as well as other factors related to the beneficiary's condition and treatment needs. Some Medicare FFS beneficiaries who are homebound have comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy, which includes drugs, equipment and supplies, and skilled nursing services when needed. For non-homebound beneficiaries with particular conditions needing certain drugs and equipment, Medicare FFS coverage of home infusion is limited to the necessary drugs, equipment, and supplies, and excludes nursing services. For other non-homebound beneficiaries, Medicare FFS coverage is further limited; infusion drugs may be covered for those enrolled in a prescription drug plan, but neither equipment and supplies nor nursing services are covered. These non-homebound beneficiaries would need to obtain infusion therapy in a hospital, nursing home, or physician's office to have all therapy components covered. The health insurers in GAO's study provide comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy under all of their commercial plans. Some insurers also provide comprehensive coverage under their network-based MA plans, which may provide benefits beyond those required under Medicare FFS. Nationwide, nearly one out of every five MA beneficiaries has comprehensive coverage through an MA plan that has chosen to cover home infusion therapy as a supplemental benefit. To pay providers of home infusion therapy, most of the insurers in GAO's study use a combination of payment mechanisms. These include a fee schedule for infusion drugs, a fee schedule for nursing services, and a bundled payment per day of therapy for all other services and supplies. Most of the health insurers in GAO's study use standard industry practices to manage utilization of home infusion therapy and ensure quality of care. Specifically, most health insurers require that infusion providers submit patient information in advance to support a request for coverage and receive payment authorization. Also, health insurers may review samples of claims postpayment to determine if claims were billed and paid appropriately. None of the insurers in GAO's study stated that they have had significant problems with improper payments or quality for home infusion therapy services. In addition, health insurers reported taking various steps to ensure the quality of services delivered in the home. These included developing a limited provider network of infusion pharmacies and home health agencies, requiring provider accreditation, coordinating care among providers, and monitoring patient complaints. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services stated Medicare covers infusion therapy at home for beneficiaries receiving the home health benefit, while other beneficiaries have access to infusion therapy in alternate settings. The Department suggested GAO reword its recommendation to clarify that a change to Medicare benefits would require statutory authority, and GAO has done so."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Infusion therapy\u2014drug treatment generally administered intravenously\u2014 was once provided strictly to patients in hospitals. However, clinical  developments and a greater emphasis on cost containment over the last   30 years have prompted a shift to providing this therapy in alternate  settings, including the home. Home infusion therapy has since become a  large industry with estimated net revenues of up to $11 billion annually,  and between 700 and 1,000 home infusion providers, ranging from small  local companies to large national ones. Industry experts project the home  infusion market will continue to grow steadily, with one expert predicting  growth to about $16 billion by 2012.", "Physicians may prescribe infusion therapy when they determine that oral  medications may not be effective. During infusion therapy, drugs are  generally administered into a vein using a device to control the rate of  drug flow. Such devices include gravity drip systems, which rely on gravity  to move the drug into the patient, and electronic infusion pumps that may  be programmed to deliver constant and precise amounts of the drug.  Commonly infused drugs include antibiotics that may be administered  multiple times each day over several weeks to treat infections and  analgesics that may be infused continuously over months or years to  relieve pain. In addition to the specialized equipment and prescribed  drugs, home infusion therapy requires other components, such as skilled  nursing care and supplies. The complex nature of home infusion therapy  also requires coordination of care among providers of these components.", "Currently, Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program for people  aged 65 and older and certain other individuals\u2014does not have a distinct  benefit for home infusion therapy that provides coverage for all  components for all beneficiaries. Efforts to extend coverage to this  treatment setting date back to the 1980s, and recently, some members of  Congress have expressed renewed interest in establishing a home infusion  therapy benefit. The proposed benefit would provide coverage of all  components of home infusion therapy for all Medicare beneficiaries  enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program as well as those in  the Medicare Advantage (MA) program\u2014in which beneficiaries enroll in  health plans offered by private entities that contract with the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).", "You asked us to review home infusion therapy coverage policies and  practices to inform the development of Medicare policy.

They then determine whether the patient is able to  understand and carry out therapy procedures, and if the patient has family  or other caregivers available to provide assistance. For certain therapies,  such as antibiotic therapy, the patient or a family member may be taught  to administer the drug. In these cases, a nurse would generally visit once  or twice at the beginning of treatment, and then once per week throughout  the course of treatment. Other therapies may require more frequent  nursing care.

Some patients receive home infusion therapy for chronic conditions that  may not require hospitalization; in these cases, a patient\u2019s physician may  order the therapy to be delivered by a home infusion provider after  diagnosis.

To be eligible  for covered home health services\u2014which include skilled nursing care,  physical therapy, and occupational therapy\u2014a beneficiary must be  homebound and have a home health plan of care approved by his or her  physician. In 2008, approximately 3.2 million, or about 7 percent of all  Medicare beneficiaries, received home health services. Medicare pays  home health agencies that provide these services using a prospective  payment system under which they receive a predetermined rate for each  60-day episode of home health care.

It also covers  durable medical equipment (DME) and supplies, including infusion  pumps and other equipment needed for infusion therapy. Medicare pays  for many Part B services and supplies using fee schedules, and  beneficiaries enrolled in Part B are generally responsible for paying  monthly premiums as well as coinsurance for services they receive.  Certain specified outpatient prescription drugs also are covered under  Part B, including drugs needed for the effective use of DME. Part B drugs  are generally paid based on a fee schedule; infusion drugs covered under  the DME benefit are paid based on a different fee schedule than other   Part B drugs.", "Medicare Part C: Since the 1970s, most Medicare beneficiaries have had  the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private health  insurance plans\u2014now known as MA plans\u2014under Medicare Part C. In  2008, nearly one out of every four Medicare beneficiaries was enrolled in  an MA plan. MA organizations enter into contracts with CMS that require  plans to cover Medicare Part A and B services. These organizations have  flexibility in designing their plan benefit packages and may offer additional  benefits.

Each Part D plan maintains a list of drugs it will cover\u2014a  formulary\u2014that must meet certain criteria, and may organize those drugs  into pricing groups or tiers. Part D plans contract with pharmacies to  create a network of participating providers. Medicare makes subsidy  payments to Part D plans, and most beneficiaries pay applicable premiums  and cost sharing. Plans negotiate drug prices with drug manufacturers and  pharmacies. As such, payment for a drug covered under Part D could be  different than payment for the same drug were it covered under Part B. In  general, Part D does not cover drugs for which payment is available under  Parts A or B.", "Both home-based services and outpatient infusion therapy have been areas  of concern for Medicare program integrity. Recently, the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice have  renewed attempts to reduce inappropriate utilization and fraudulent  activities in these areas.

The study examined trends in the  industry, the safety and efficacy of the technology, and the implications for  Medicare coverage, including various coverage and payment options  available at the time. OTA found that additional Medicare coverage of  home infusion therapy might lead to lower payments to hospitals in some  cases because of shorter stays and lower costs.

Some insurers reported that many of the  infusion drugs they cover are specialty drugs that cost more than $600 a  month. Other drugs would cost less. For example, for a typical case of a  month of antibiotic infusion therapy, a health plan could pay a home  infusion provider $300 for the drugs, $350 for nursing services, and $2,000  for the per diem. One insurer told us that the pace of development in  specialty infusion drugs is accelerating, which could add to home infusion  therapy costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Health Insurers Employ Standard Industry Practices to Manage Utilization of Home Infusion Therapy and Ensure Quality", "paragraphs": ["Most of the health insurers in our study\u2014both commercial and MA  plans\u2014use standard industry practices to manage utilization of home  infusion and ensure quality of services for their members. None of the  insurers reported significant problems with improper payments for home  infusion therapy services. While none of the insurers identified  significant quality of care problems related to home infusion therapy, they  all employ certain practices to help ensure care delivered meets quality  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Insurers Use Prior Authorization and Postpayment Claims Review to Manage Utilization of the Home Infusion Therapy Benefit", "paragraphs": ["Most health insurers we interviewed use two standard industry  practices\u2014prior authorization, postpayment claims review, or both\u2014to  manage utilization of home infusion therapy for their members. To obtain  prior authorization, providers must request and receive approval from the  health plan before the therapy is covered. The plan typically requires  providers to submit patient information in advance to support a request  for coverage and receive payment authorization. With postpayment  review, once a claim has been processed, the plan determines if it was  billed and paid appropriately, and if not, the plan may seek a refund or  adjust future payments. Generally, a health plan auditor would review a  sample of claims to see if the patients had medical conditions for which  the proposed treatment was required. None of the insurers reported  significant problems with improper payments for home infusion therapy.", "Most of the insurers we interviewed use prior authorization to curb  inappropriate use of home infusion therapy. Some insurers stated that  prior authorization is particularly effective in managing the use of more  costly infusion drugs. Some insurers stated that their plans limit their prior  authorization requirement to certain home infusion therapies and drugs.  For example, certain hemophilia drugs may require prior authorization  because they are expensive and patient needs vary substantially.  Additionally, insurers may require prior authorization for immune  globulin, checking that patients\u2019 medical conditions indicate use of the  drug. In contrast, one home infusion expert told us that prior authorization  has little utility for this type of therapy because home infusion providers  would incur too much liability risk if they treated patients who were not  appropriate for that setting.", "The denial rates for prior authorization requests are reportedly low. A  common reason given for denial of a prior authorization request was that  the therapy did not meet medical necessity requirements. Specifically,  the requested coverage may be for a treatment of longer than the  recommended duration or for a type of narcotic that may not be safe for  administration in the home. Another common reason cited for prior  authorization denials was insufficient documentation from the prescribing  physician. Insurers also cited denials for drugs prescribed for off-label  use\u2014that is, for conditions or patient populations for which the drug has  not been approved, or for use in a manner that is inconsistent with  information in the drug labeling approved by the Food and Drug  Administration. An insurance official stated that some conditions that are  difficult to treat or diagnose do not have a universally accepted treatment  approach. For example, two insurers cited denials for requests to treat  Lyme disease with long antibiotic courses that were not supported by  medical evidence.", "Most health insurers we interviewed use postpayment claims review, some  in addition to prior authorization, to manage the use of home infusion  therapy. One insurer considered postpayment review the practice most  effective in deterring inappropriate use of home infusion therapy. Such  reviews may have a sentinel effect, meaning that providers who have  erroneous claims returned may be less likely to submit such claims in the  future. That insurer and an industry expert also noted the importance of  developing very specific reimbursement guidelines for providers. An  industry expert recommended guidelines at the dosage and package level,  noting that a single infusion drug may be used for many different  diagnoses, with a different dosage regimen for each diagnosis, and  different package sizes from different manufacturers. For example, to  reduce wasteful spending, reimbursement guidelines could include the  specific package sizes that are covered for products that cannot be reused  after they are opened."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Insurers Use Provider Networks, Accreditation, and Complaint Monitoring to Ensure Quality in Home Infusion Therapy", "paragraphs": ["While none of the health insurers we spoke with identified significant  quality problems related to home infusion therapy, they all employ certain  practices to help ensure that their members receive quality care. These  include developing a limited provider network of infusion pharmacies and  home health agencies, requiring provider accreditation, coordinating care  among providers, and monitoring patient complaints.", "Most health insurers we interviewed create a network by contracting with  a set of home infusion providers and suppliers that meet certain  participation criteria, such as adherence to specified industry standards  and licensure. One insurer\u2019s participation criteria contain a set of  standards, including staffing requirements, guidelines for patient selection,  and the ability to initiate therapy within 3 hours of a referral call. The  infusion providers that insurers include in their networks range in size and  may include large national chain providers and stand-alone local home  infusion providers.", "Health insurers told us they rely on credentialing, accreditation, or both to  help ensure that plan members receive quality home infusion services  from their network providers. Home infusion accrediting organizations  conduct on-site surveys to evaluate all components of the service,  including medical equipment, nursing, and pharmacy. The three  accreditation organizations in our study reported that their standards  include CMS Conditions of Participation for home health services, other  government regulations, and industry best practices. All of their  accreditation standards evaluate a range of provider competencies, such  as having a complete plan for patient care, response to adverse events, and  implementation of a quality improvement plan. According to accreditation  organizations we interviewed, an increasing number of providers are  seeking home infusion-specific accreditation. One insurer told us that  home infusion has minimal quality issues due to strong oversight of  pharmacies through state and federal regulation and by accrediting  institutions.", "Accrediting organizations identified unique safety and quality factors that  must be considered when providing infusion therapy in the home setting.  First, home infusion providers must carefully evaluate the willingness and  ability of the patient, caregiver, or both to begin and continue home  therapy. Because infusion drugs are administered directly into a vein, the  effect of a medication error is greater and faster in infusion therapy than  with oral treatments. Providers must therefore also take steps to ensure  that patients can recognize the signs and symptoms of an emergency.  Second, providers must ensure that patients have the appropriate  infrastructure in the home to store equipment, drugs, and supplies, and to  provide the therapy. Needed infrastructure often includes a refrigerator to  store infusion drugs and sometimes safeguards to protect patients\u2019 drugs  and supplies, particularly in the case of controlled substances such as  narcotics. Home infusion providers must have emergency support services  available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in case of an adverse drug reaction  or to troubleshoot any problems with equipment, such as infusion pumps.  Officials from one accrediting organization told us that they also expect  infusion providers to have plans in place to deal with other types of  emergencies, such as a natural disaster.", "While officials from accrediting organizations did not report any pervasive  quality issues, they described several common problems among home  infusion providers that demonstrate the complexity of the treatment.  Home infusion providers may not have staff with the appropriate training  and competencies, which may be a challenge for small organizations. Also,  they may inadequately coordinate care for patients who receive multiple  medications and have multiple physicians. Furthermore, home infusion  providers may not always meet documentation and planning requirements  for accreditation. For example, officials from one accrediting organization  stated that the top two deficiencies for infusion companies are incomplete  plans of care and a lack of a comprehensive quality improvement program.", "In addition, home infusion providers may find it challenging to meet some  technical standards, including pharmaceutical requirements. An  accrediting official observed that some infusion pharmacies are still  learning to comply with recent industry standards for combining  ingredients or other processes to create a drug in a sterile environment.  Poor procedures to track recalled items is another common technical  deficiency for home infusion providers. Providers generally have recall  processes for medications, but sometimes not for every item used in the  provision of care, as required by that accreditation organization.", "Communication and coordination of care between multiple entities is  particularly important for this type of treatment. Several of the insurers we  interviewed have processes to coordinate care for home infusion therapy  and told us that they take responsibility for that function. Others rely on  the patient\u2019s physician, home infusion provider, discharging facility, or a  combination of these to coordinate care. Two of the health insurers use  the prior authorization process to coordinate care, as case managers  initiate contact with the member and home infusion provider and follow  up throughout the duration of the therapy.", "In addition to policies and procedures related to quality, all of the health  insurers and accreditation organizations we interviewed have a process  for addressing patient complaints. None of the health insurers told us that  they have received significant complaints related to home infusion. One  insurer cited a case in which a specialty pharmacy had diluted drug doses,  and suggested that such problems concerning the quality and integrity of  drugs could be overcome with information technology, such as bar coding  of drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Due to the limited coverage of home infusion therapy under Medicare FFS  and some MA plans, non-homebound beneficiaries would need to obtain  treatment in alternate and potentially more costly settings\u2014such as a  hospital, outpatient department, or physician\u2019s office\u2014to have all of the  components of infusion therapy covered. All of the health insurers in our  study provide comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy for all  members in their commercial health plans, and some do so in their MA  plans as well. Health insurers contend that the benefit has been cost- effective, that is, providing infusion therapy at home generally costs less  than treatment in other settings. They also contend that the benefit is  largely free from inappropriate utilization and problems in quality of care.
