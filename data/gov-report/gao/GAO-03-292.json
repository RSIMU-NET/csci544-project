Major contributors to the weak control environment included excessive numbers of purchase cards, with about one purchase card for every seven employees, approving official span of control that far exceeded DOD guidelines, and credit limits that were 12 to 20 times higher than actual spending. Of the five key control activities tested, the Air Force had significant control breakdowns in at least three of them (1) receiving of goods and services by someone other than the card holder, (2) cardholder reconciliation, and (3) approving official review of the cardholder's reconciled statements. The highest failure rates--69 to 87 percent--at the four locations tested related to approving official review--viewed by DOD as the first line of defense against misuse of the purchase card. The control breakdowns resulted in purchases that were potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable. GAO also identified potentially fraudulent transactions for which supporting documentation was not available to show the quantity and type of items purchased. Air Force officials could not recall the purpose of these transactions. In addition, GAO identified (1) improper transactions related to weaknesses in controls relied on to prevent splitting purchases into multiple transactions to circumvent micropurchase and cardholder transaction limits and (2) the failure to use mandated sources of supply. Finally, GAO found that cardholders who abused or improperly used the purchase card were not subject to strong disciplinary action or consequences. The Air Force has taken a number of steps to improve control over the purchase card program. For example, it implemented automated controls during fiscal year 2002 to help monitor approving official span of control, credit limits, and cardholder reconciliation and approving official review of monthly statements. If effectively implemented, these controls should help strengthen the overall Air Force purchase card control environment as well as controls over statement reconciliation and approval."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is promoting departmentwide use of  government purchase cards for obtaining goods and services.  DOD  reported that during fiscal year 2001, about 230,000 cardholders used  purchase cards to make about 10.7 million transactions for goods and  services costing over $6.1 billion.  Within these amounts, the Air Force  reported that it used about 80,000 cardholder accounts to make about   3 million purchase card transactions for goods and services costing about  $1.4 billion.  Purchase card transactions include acquisitions at or below  the $2,500 micropurchase threshold and payments on contracts.  The use of  purchase cards has increased dramatically as agencies have sought to  eliminate the lengthy process and paperwork associated with making small  purchases.  The benefits of using purchase cards versus traditional  contracting and payment processes are lower transaction processing costs  and less red tape for both the government and the vendor community.  We  support the use of a well-controlled purchase card program to streamline  the government\u2019s acquisition processes.

As a result of our initial audit of purchase card controls  at the two Navy sites and continuing concern about fraud, waste, and abuse  in DOD\u2019s purchase card program, you requested that we expand our audits  of purchase card controls.  Our audit of Army purchase card controls  identified a weak internal control environment; ineffective implementation  of key control activities; and potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive  purchases.  Our broader audit of Navy purchase card controls identified  continuing control weaknesses and discussed actions underway by the  Navy to resolve these weaknesses.  This report focuses on Air Force  purchase card controls.", "The objective of our audit of the Air Force purchase card program was to  assess the effectiveness of internal control over purchase card use and  payment of purchase card transactions during fiscal year 2001.   Specifically, we addressed whether (1) the Air Force\u2019s overall control  environment and management of the purchase card program were  effective, (2) the Air Force\u2019s key internal control activities operated  effectively and provided reasonable assurance that purchase cards were  used appropriately, and (3) indications existed of potentially fraudulent,  improper, and abusive or questionable transactions.  We also identified  management actions taken by DOD and the Air Force during fiscal year  2002 to improve purchase card controls.", "We identified four major Air Force commands that accounted for about  69 percent of total purchase card charges and 65 percent of total  transactions for fiscal year 2001 and selected one location from each of the  four commands based on the magnitude of purchase card transactions and  payments for case study analysis.  For each of the case study locations, we  tested a statistical sample of fiscal year 2001 purchase card transactions  and conducted other audit work to evaluate the design and implementation  of key internal control procedures and activities.  The results of our audit  of the transactions constituting the statistical samples can only be  projected to the individual installations where we performed the testing  and cannot be used to project the adequacy of control activities at the  command level or the Air Force as a whole.  However, the cumulative  results of our work offer significant perspective on the adequacy of the  design and implementation of purchase card controls across the Air Force.", "We also looked for indications of potentially fraudulent, improper, and  abusive or questionable purchases as part of our tests of statistical samples  of transactions and through analysis of non-representative selections of  transactions using data mining.  Our data mining focused on identifying  transactions with vendors that were likely to sell unauthorized or personal  use items for both our case study locations and Air Force-wide.  Because of  the large number of transactions that met these criteria, we did not look at  all potential abuses of the purchase card.

The coordinators at the installations we audited  had little training on what they should be doing to oversee the program and  limited time to carry out oversight activities that are called for in Air Force  Instruction 64-117, such as reviewing U.S. Bank exception reports and  following up on suspicious transaction activity as well as conducting  annual surveillances.  Effective oversight activities also would include  other management reviews and evaluations to assess risks associated with  the number of credit card accounts, credit limits, and approving official  span of control and to assess the effectiveness of controls, identify  systemic weaknesses, and determine the extent of potentially fraudulent,  improper, and abusive or questionable purchases.", "We also found that the program coordinators did not have the grade level or  organizational authority\u2014\u201cclout\u201d\u2014to routinely deal with unit  commanders, approving officials, and resource managers across the  installation, who may significantly outrank them, to enforce purchase card  guidelines and controls.  Program coordinators have the primary  responsibility for purchase card program management and significant  control over procurement activities carried out by a large number of  individuals.  For example, during fiscal year 2001, the Nellis AFB program  coordinator who was a GS-9, similar in grade to a master sergeant, had  responsibility for over 55,000 purchase card transactions totaling over  $27 million involving 638 cardholder accounts and 99 approving officials.", "Installation contracting officials told us that program coordinator staffing  had not kept pace with the growth in the purchase card program.  GSA data  show that Air Force purchase card activity has grown from 2.8 million  transactions totaling $1.3 billion at the beginning of fiscal year 2000 to 3.2  million transactions totaling about $1.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2001.   During fiscal year 2002, Lackland AFB increased the number of staff  assigned to the program coordinator\u2019s office from three staff assigned in  fiscal year 2001 to a total of six staff to provide better oversight of Wilford  Hall\u2019s purchase card program as well as to monitor purchase card use by  units transferred to Lackland AFB when Kelly AFB closed.  The other three  installations we audited had not increased their program coordinator  staffing.  As of September 2002, Edwards AFB had three staff assigned,  Nellis AFB had two staff, and Travis AFB had one and a half staff to oversee  their purchase card programs.  Further, at Travis AFB, where military  employees have held the program coordinator position, there have been  four different individuals assigned to the program coordinator position  since October 2000 due to high turnover associated with military positions.   As a result, Travis AFB program coordinators spend much of their time  learning versus overseeing the purchase card process.

Our statistical tests of approving official  review considered only documented review of statements with evidence of  reconciliation.  The high failure rates are due, in part, to approving officials\u2019  failure to date the reconciled monthly statements when they reviewed  them.  The failure rate also may be attributable to approving official duties  falling into the category of \u201cother duties as assigned\u201d and the span of  control issues discussed earlier.", "The high failure rate for approving official review is of particular concern  because the Air Force uses a \u201cpay and confirm\u201d policy, which is  inconsistent with governmentwide and DOD guidelines on reconciliation  and payment of purchase card bills.

For example, at Lackland AFB, one of our test  locations, we identified purchases of clothing for drill instructors, including  physical fitness clothing items from LL Bean costing $816 and 16 fleece  jackets from Oakley costing $880.  We also identified numerous purchases  of military clothing items from REI totaling $20,698, including paratrooper  jumpsuits and cold weather pilot jackets.  These clothing items are covered  under the military pay clothing allowance funded in the Military Personnel,  Air Force, appropriation and should not have been purchased with  Operation and Maintenance appropriations using the purchase card.", "In addition, we found purchases of what we consider to be personal  clothing and accessory items that were authorized by installation officials.   For example, Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, authorized the purchase of a  blue blazer from Filene\u2019s costing $180 and eight dresses from Dress Barn  costing $648 for civilian employees who participated in the Eubank Service  Award Competition.  Hickam AFB, in Hawaii, purchased two wool coats  from Hecht\u2019s in Waldorf, Maryland, costing $380 for a flight attendant  assigned to the 65th Airlift Squadron.  In addition, the Lackland AFB  pararescue team purchased 12 pairs of sunglasses from Oakley costing  $540 and improperly justified them as meeting the requirement for free-fall  paratrooper goggles.  Oakley sunglasses do not qualify as paratrooper  goggles.  None of these items are authorized by Air Force policy.   Therefore, we concluded that all of these purchases involved personal  items, which employees should pay for from their own salaries.", "Luggage and briefcases.  We identified numerous purchases of luggage  deemed necessary for employees who travel frequently, including 50  Samsonite suitcases costing $5,500 for members of the Thunderbirds team  and garment bags costing $2,250 for the Bolling AFB band, and purchases  of two Pathfinder Pullman suitcases costing $620 for recruiters.  In  addition, our review of a limited selection of Franklin Covey transactions  identified six purchases of leather briefcases costing $212 each (after a 20  percent discount) and purchases of 203 flight bags (similar to a briefcase)  costing from about $50 to $86 each.  Luggage and briefcases are considered  personal items that should be paid for from employees\u2019 salaries.", "Food and water for employees.  We identified purchases of meals, bottled  water, and payment for a unit luncheon.  Without statutory authority,  appropriated funds may not be used to furnish meals to employees within  their normal duty stations.  We identified improper charges for food  provided to employees during an internal government meeting and unit  luncheons.  For example, Lackland AFB scheduled a strategic planning  meeting for local employees of the Tri-Care organization at a Marriott Hotel  in San Antonio, Texas.  The total cost of the meeting was $1,052, including  $538 for breakfast and lunch for 18 individuals\u20143 consultants and 15  employees who were not on travel.  In addition, appropriated funds may  not be used to purchase bottled water for employees unless they are  assigned to a duty station without potable water.  Food and bottled water  are considered personal items that employees should pay for from their  own salaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Split Purchases", "paragraphs": ["Another category of improper transactions is a split purchase, which  occurs when a cardholder splits a transaction into more than one segment  to circumvent the requirement to obtain competitive prices for purchases  over the $2,500 micropurchase threshold or to avoid the other established  credit limits. The Federal Acquisition Regulation and Air Force  Instruction 64-117 prohibit these practices.  Once items exceed the $2,500  threshold, they are to be purchased in accordance with simplified  acquisition procedures, which are more stringent than those for  micropurchases.  Our analysis of purchases made at the four case study  locations and our Air Force-wide data mining identified numerous split  purchases.  In addition, Air Force Audit Agency auditors identified split  purchases as a continuing Air Force-wide problem.", "One split purchase we identified involved a violation of appropriations law.   The purchase was made to avoid the expiration of unused fiscal year 2001  operation and maintenance appropriations.  Our inquiries disclosed the  following events surrounding this transaction.  On September 30, 2001, at  approximately 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Air Combat Command  headquarters at Langley AFB, Virginia, determined that $100,000 in fiscal  year 2001 operation and maintenance appropriations would expire in 3  hours\u2014at midnight\u2014unless the funds could be obligated and spent quickly.   At 6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, the command contacted the USAF  Weapons School, 57th Operations Support Squadron at Nellis AFB, Las  Vegas, Nevada, with the direction to use the funds before they expired.  At  approximately 7:00 p.m., the Nellis AFB cardholder purchased 120 helmets  at more than $800 each and several other items totaling just under $100,000  from the base supply store.  The purchase was split into four separate  transactions to stay within the cardholder\u2019s single transaction limit of  $25,000 per transaction.  The items purchased were placed \u201con hold\u201d and  were not taken from the store.  Over the next few days\u2014October 1 and  October 2\u2014the cardholder \u201creturned\u201d the items, exchanging them for other  items totaling the same amounts.  In an explanatory memorandum, the  cardholder wrote that the unit had not previously identified its unfilled  requirements and, therefore, did not have a list of items for purchase if  \u201cend-of-year\u201d money was available.  The subsequent credits and reuse of  the funds in early October 2001, in effect, converted fiscal year 2001  appropriations to fiscal year 2002 budget authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improper Sources", "paragraphs": ["Another type of improper purchase occurs when cardholders do not buy  from a mandatory procurement source.  Various federal laws and  regulations, such as the Javits-Wagner-O\u2019Day Act (JWOD), require  government cardholders to acquire certain products from designated  sources.  The JWOD program is a mandatory source of supply for all  federal entities.  It generates jobs and training for Americans who are blind  or have other severe disabilities by requiring federal agencies to purchase  supplies and services furnished by nonprofit agencies, such as the National  Industries for the Blind and the National Institute for the Severely  Handicapped.  Most JWOD program supplies are small-value items such as  office supplies, cleaning products, or medical/surgical supplies that nearly  always fall into the micropurchase category.  We noted that most  cardholders at the four installations we audited made purchases from  required sources and three of the four installations had JWOD stores on  base.  However, we found numerous Air Force-wide purchases from  Franklin Covey for office supplies, such as calendars and day planners,  which could have been purchased from JWOD vendors.  We also found that  Air Force cardholders charged $2,220 for 82 high-quality pens from  Franklin Covey costing from $16 to $60 each.  Table 9 summarizes  transactions we identified that were made from other than required  sources of supply.", "The failure to purchase designated items from JWOD vendors who support  the handicapped undermines public policy objectives to support programs  for the handicapped. For example, as discussed in our Army purchase card  report, the Director of Sales for the National Industries for the Blind told  us that this program has experienced large decreases in sales over the past  2 years because cardholders were purchasing from commercial firms  rather than buying the mandated products.  Further, operating revenues of  government service organizations, such as the Defense Automated Printing  Service (DAPS), which is a required source of printing services for DOD  agencies, and Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (UNICOR), which is a required  source for furniture, are significantly reduced to the extent that  cardholders do not use these sources for mandated printing and related  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improper Use of Purchase Cards and Convenience Checks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the improper transactions discussed above, our analysis of  Air Force-wide purchase card transactions identified the following three  types of improper use of the purchase card.", "Use of the purchase card as acquisition tool where a negotiated contract   Purchase card use by a religious fund activity without authority in law,  regulation, or DOD or Air Force policy, and  Improper use of convenience checks billed to the purchase card  account.", "The following examples illustrate the types of purchases included in table  10.", "Month-to-Month Equipment Rental.  We found that a cardholder at  Whiteman AFB, Missouri, improperly used the purchase card as an  acquisition vehicle without a negotiated contract.  Specifically, the  cardholder used the purchase card to rent tractors for use by the  installation\u2019s waste treatment facility at a cost of about $10,000 during  fiscal year 2001.  Our analysis of records related to this lease showed that  an initial month-to-month rental of a tractor covered 3 years beginning in  November 1997.  In November 2000, the cardholder initiated monthly rental  of a new tractor for 2 years.  According to the installation program  coordinator, the current cost to purchase the type of tractor that was  rented during fiscal years 2000 and 2001 would be in the $35,000 to $45,000  range; however, a lease versus purchase cost-benefit analysis was never  performed.  We determined that the cost of the two rentals, which together  covered a 5-year period, totaled over $50,000.", "Unauthorized Use of the Card by Chaplain\u2019s Religious Fund.  Our analysis  of fiscal year 2001 FE Warren AFB, Wyoming, purchase card transactions  totaling over $6,600 by a Chaplain Office volunteer, who later became a  contractor, raised a number of questions about the proper use of the  purchase card.  Air Force purchase card policies state that commercial  purchase cards are provided to military members and federal civilian  employees to pay for official government purchases, and that only  employees may be cardholders.  According to the Chaplain Office officials,  these transactions were for authorized purchases.  They said they often use  parishioners and volunteers to assist them in carrying out religious  activities.  However, Air Force purchase card policies state that  commercial purchase cards are provided to military members and federal  civilian employees to pay for official government purchases.  Chaplain  Office officials told us that because the Chaplain Religious Fund did not fall  under Air Force purchase card authority as either an appropriated fund or a  nonappropriated fund activity, they believed they could set up the  government purchase card program for their office by working  independently with the bank.", "We discussed our concerns about Chaplain Office authority to use the  government purchase card with Air Force attorneys and acquisition and  Chaplain Office officials.  After reviewing Air Force policy, Air Force  attorneys advised us that the Chaplain\u2019s Office did not have authority to use  the government purchase card for Chaplain Religious Fund activities.", "Convenience Checks.  We identified improper use of convenience checks  related to payments in amounts over $2,500, payments for recurring  services, and payments to vendors who accept purchase card payments.   Air Force Instruction 64-117 limits the use of convenience checks to  amounts of no more than $2,500 per check, prohibits the use of  convenience checks for recurring services, and restricts convenience  check use to instances where vendors do not accept purchase cards.   Splitting amounts across more than one check to keep below the $2,500  limit also is prohibited.  Another area of improper use of convenience  checks related to reimbursement of employees for tuition assistance.  We  determined that reimbursement to employees is not a permitted use of  convenience checks.   Further, because there is a 1.7 percent fee for using a  convenience check, cost-benefit considerations are required when using  convenience checks.", "Our analysis of fiscal year 2001 convenience check use determined that Air  Force purchase cardholders who had convenience check authority had  issued 45 convenience checks totaling over $200,000 for amounts over  $2,500.  We also found that a cardholder at Luke AFB, Arizona, improperly  used convenience checks for recurring monthly payments on a 2-year  automobile lease for authorized use by a military officer.  It is common  knowledge that car dealerships accept credit cards.  At one of our case  study locations\u2014Travis AFB\u2014we found that a cardholder had reimbursed  employees for $12,214 in tuition expenses.  The cardholder wrote two  convenience checks\u2014one check for $2,090 and another for $500\u2014to  reimburse an employee for a total of $2,590 in tuition expenses.  The  cardholder wrote two additional convenience checks\u2014one check for  $6,125 and another for $3,500\u2014to reimburse two other employees for  $9,614 in tuition expenses.  The 1.7 percent fee on the first two checks was  $44 and the fee on the second two checks was about $163\u2014significantly  more that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service fee of  approximately $7 to process electronic payments.", "In its August 2002 purchase card report, the Air Force Audit Agency stated  that its review found that cardholders issued convenience checks to pay  salaries and wages totaling $512,378 for dieticians, nurses, and  administrative personnel, and to acquire recurring services, such as aircraft  washing totaling $84,830, local area network support costing $110,495,  equipment rentals costing $20,700, and lawn-care services costing $43,505.   Air Force auditors determined that cardholders expended $2.6 million for  recurring services and incurred unnecessary bank fees of $15,228  associated with the 1.7 percent service fee."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Abusive or Questionable Use of the Purchase Card", "paragraphs": ["We also identified abusive and questionable transactions at installations we  audited and in our Air Force-wide data mining.  We defined abusive  transactions as those that were authorized, but the items purchased were  at an excessive cost (e.g., \u201cgold plated\u201d) or for a questionable government  need, or both.  Abuse occurs when the conduct of a government  organization, program, activity, or function falls short of societal  expectations of prudent behavior.  Often, improper purchases, such as  those discussed in the previous section, are also abusive.  For example, the  purchases of personal clothing and luggage for employees were also  abusive purchases because they were for a questionable government need.", "Questionable transactions are those that appear to be improper or abusive  but for which there is insufficient documentation to conclude either.  We  deemed questionable those purchases for which there was not a reasonable  and/or documented justification.  Questionable purchases often do not  easily fit within generic governmentwide guidelines on purchases that are  acceptable for the purchase card program.  They tend to raise questions  about their reasonableness.  Many, such as gym-quality exercise equipment  for fitness centers, are common Air Force\u2014and DOD\u2014purchases because  the Air Force must provide more than merely a work environment for its  soldiers.  However, others involving excessive purchases of alcohol,  payment for taxidermy services, and purchases of expensive leather  computer cases discussed in this section, raise questions about whether  they are appropriate purchases.  Precisely because these types of  purchases tend to raise questions and subject the Air Force to criticism,  they require a higher level of advance purchase review and documentation  than other purchases.", "When we examined these types of purchases, we usually did not find  evidence of advance purchase justification.  In attempting to justify  whether purchases were acceptable, improper, or abusive, program  coordinators, approving officials, and cardholders often provided after-the- fact rationales for the purchases.  We believe that these types of  questionable purchases require scrutiny before the purchase, not after.  The  examples in table 11 illustrate our point.", "The following examples illustrate the problems associated with some of the  transactions we identified as abusive or questionable.", "At Nellis AFB, the purchase card was used to pay for dinner and a show  for 18 people costing $2,141 at Treasure Island\u2014a Las Vegas hotel and  casino.  The purpose of the event was to entertain the General of U.S.  Joint Forces Command, who was visiting the base.  Air Force  Instruction 65-603, Official Representation Funds \u2013 Guidance and  Procedures, permits the use of government funds for official  entertainment.  However, we determined that the nature of this  entertainment did not meet certain Force guidelines related to  requirements to conduct entertainment on a modest basis that is in the  interest of the taxpayer.  For example, we determined that the cost of  the dinner party, which totaled $2,141, included about $800 for alcohol  for the 18 people who attended the event\u2014over $40 per person.  We  believe the excessive cost of alcohol purchased at this event falls short  of societal expectations of prudent behavior and modest cost.", "An Air Force Academy Natural Resource office in Colorado Springs,  Colorado, used the purchase card to pay Timberline Taxidermy $375 to  prepare a shoulder mount of a mule deer head.  According to the  approving official, the deer was \u201croad kill\u201d that he found on the roadside  and brought to the Natural Resources Office.  The approving official  then approved the purchase of the taxidermy service to prepare a  stuffed shoulder mount of the deer.  The deer head was hung on the wall  in the Natural Resources Office.  The justification of the purchase of  taxidermy services provided to our auditors stated, \"The mule deer  (Odocoileus hemionus) is the most common large mammal present on  US Air Force Academy grounds.  The mount was created as an  educational/interpretive tool and is on display in the USAFA Natural  Resources office.  The mount can be removed from the office wall for  use in educational presentations to the base population (e.g., that only  males have antlers which are shed and re-grown each year.)  The deer  died after being struck by a vehicle and was salvaged by USAFA Natural  Resources personnel.\"  When our auditor asked the cardholder how  often the deer head was removed from the office wall and used for  educational purposes, the cardholder stated, \"not much.\"  The  cardholder, the approving official, and two other Natural Resource  employees occupy the office where the deer head currently hangs.", "The Edwards AFB, 412th Test Wing/Electronic Warfare used fiscal 2001  year-end funds to purchase 21 computers and monitors at a total cost of  $47,372.

At  the time of our inspection of these items in June 2002, 11 of the  computers and 9 of the monitors were located in a storage area and  many of the items were still in the original shipping boxes.  According to  the Contracting Director, the computers were purchased to support  hiring of engineers and engineering contractors.  However, recruiting  efforts were delayed because some applicants did not accept offered  positions and further recruiting efforts were suspended during  implementation of a new personnel system in the fall of 2001.  The  Contracting Director told us that the unit commander directed that the  computers be stored in their original boxes for safekeeping until  recruiting was completed and the equipment could be assigned to  engineering staff, which was accomplished in July or August 2002.  The  fact that the computers were still in their original boxes at least 9  months after they were ordered raises questions about whether there  was a legitimate need for these items to be purchased with fiscal year  2001 appropriations.  Appropriated funds are available only to meet  legitimate needs of the agency during the fiscal year for which the funds  were appropriated.", "Our testing of property items identified two Travis AFB transactions  dated October 4, 2000, for purchases of computer equipment totaling  $14,128 that involved wasteful spending.  For example, when we  attempted to observe the items to confirm their existence, we were told  that the unit had decided to convert to Dell computers.  As a result,  within 1 year of their purchase, these items, as well as a number of other  computers, were sent to the Defense Reutilization Marketing Service as  excess property.", "In addition, we questioned purchases of civilian clothing for military  assistants and costumes for regional band members.  While DOD and the  Air Force have issued policy that permits the purchase of these types of  clothing and designates them as \u201cuniforms,\u201d we believe this clothing  represents personal preference attire and should be paid for by the  employees.  For example, in addition to standard issue uniform clothing  items, military assistants are permitted to purchase slacks or skirts, shirts,  and blazers to wear while serving as aides to general officers.  In addition,  we noted purchases including two tuxedos, six dresses, and earrings as  costumes for members of regional Air Force bands.  Under Air Force  policy, regional bands are permitted to purchase tuxedos and evening  gowns to be worn as costumes during performances.  While the civilian  clothing for military assistants and band costumes are considered  government property, which may be reused as appropriate, they are not  likely to be reissued to others.

The Air Force\u2019s  purchase card program is the smallest of the three services, with fewer  transactions and dollars spent than the Army or the Navy.  We selected our  four case study locations by identifying major commands with the largest  purchase card sales volume and number of transactions.  We selected  major Air Force commands that accounted for about 69 percent of total  purchase card charges and 65 percent of total transactions for fiscal year  2001.  We then selected one installation within each of the four commands  based on the magnitude of purchase card activity (sales volume and  number of transactions).  We also considered the results of prior Air Force  Audit Agency work.   We selected the following Air Force installations for  our case study work.", "At the four Air Force installations, we evaluated the policies and  procedures used to guide the purchase card program, and we evaluated the  activities they engage in to oversee the program.  We used a case study  approach to evaluate the local purchase card program, and our work  consisted of three major segments\u2014(1) an assessment of the overall  control environment, including the adequacy of the Air Force\u2019s policies and  procedures, (2) an evaluation of the effectiveness of key internal control  activities, and (3) a determination of whether evidence existed of  potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable transactions.   Finally, we assessed management actions taken in fiscal year 2002 to  improve purchase card controls.", "To assess the overall control environment, we used as our primary criteria  applicable laws and regulations; our Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government (GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, November 1999); and our  Internal Control Standards:  Internal Control Management and  Evaluation Tool (GAO-01-1008G, August 2001).  To assess the management  control environment, we applied the fundamental concepts and standards  in GAO\u2019s Internal Control Standards to the practices followed by  management.", "To test the implementation of key control activities during fiscal year 2001  at the four installations we audited, we obtained from DOD, U.S. Bank\u2019s  database of Air Force purchase card transactions from October 1, 2000,  through September 30, 2001.  We did not verify the accuracy of U.S. Bank\u2019s  database.  We selected stratified random probability samples of 150 to 152  purchase card transactions from the population of Air Force transactions  for each case study location.  With these statistically valid samples, each  transaction in the four locations\u2019 populations had a nonzero probability of  being included, and that probability could be computed for any transaction.   Within each installation we stratified the population of transactions by the  dollar value of the transaction and by whether the transaction was likely to  be for a purchase of computers and related equipment.  Each sample  transaction for an installation was subsequently weighted in the analysis to  account statistically for all the transactions in the population of that  installation, including those that were not selected.", "For each transaction sampled, we tested whether key internal control  activities had been performed.  For each control activity tested, we  projected an estimate of the percent of transactions for which the control  activity was not performed, for each installation.  Because we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections of transactions, our  sample for each installation is only one of a large number of samples that  we might have drawn.  Since each sample could have produced different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  samples\u2019 results (that is, the sampling error) as 95 percent confidence  intervals.  These are intervals that would contain the actual population  value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  As a result, we  are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report  will include the true (unknown) values in the study populations.", "Although we projected the results of our samples to the populations of  transactions at the respective case study locations, the results cannot be  projected to the population of Air Force transactions or installations as a  whole.  Tables 13 through 20 present (1) the results of our tests for one or  more control attributes, (2) the point estimates of the failure rate for the  attributes, (3) the two-sided 95 percent confidence intervals for the failure  rates for each attribute, (4) our assessments of the effectiveness of the  controls, and (5) the relevant lower and upper bounds of a one-sided 95  percent confidence interval for the failure rate.  All numbers in these tables  are rounded to the nearest percentage point.", "We use one-sided confidence bounds to classify the effectiveness of a  control activity.  If the one-sided upper bound does not exceed 5 percent,  then the control activity is effective. If the one-sided lower bound exceeds  10 percent, then the control is ineffective.  Otherwise, we say that the  control is partially effective.  Partially effective controls may include those  for which there is not enough evidence to assert either effectiveness or  ineffectiveness.  For example, if we were 95 percent confident that the  failure rate for a particular control is less than 3 percent, we would  categorize that control activity as \u201ceffective\u201d because 3 percent is less than  the 5 percent standard.  Similarly, if we were 95 percent confident that the  failure rate for a particular control is greater than 72 percent, we would  categorize that control as \u201cineffective\u201d because 72 percent is greater than  the 10 percent standard.", "Table 13 shows the results of our tests of controls for documenting  cardholder and approving official appointments.

This  requirement is not specifically addressed in DOD policy or Air Force  purchase card program Instruction 64-117.  We believe that independent  documentation of receipt of items purchased by a cardholder is a basic  internal control activity that provides additional assurance to the  government that purchased items are not acquired for personal use and  that they come into the possession of the government.", "Table 18 presents the results of our tests for documentation of cardholder  reconciliations.   Cardholder reconciliations are key to identifying  potentially fraudulent transactions resulting from compromised accounts,  duplicate or improper vendor charges, and errors.

DOD\u2019s Purchase Card Joint  Program Management Office and Air Force Instruction 64-117 recognize  that approving official review of monthly purchase card statements is  central to ensuring that purchase card transactions are appropriate.

In testing for  evidence of a receipt, we accepted either the original or a copy of the  invoice, sales slip, or other store receipt.", "We also tested nonrepresentative selections of accountable property items  that were included in our sampled transactions.  Because some  transactions were for property items that were physically located off base,  we elected to perform our test work on property items that were assigned  to the base.  We tested whether these items had been recorded in the  installation\u2019s accountable property records, including unit-level records, in  a timely manner and whether the installation could demonstrate the item\u2019s  existence.  We confirmed existence of the items we tested through physical  observation.", "In addition to our audit of statistical samples of transactions at the four  case study installations, we also used data mining techniques to identify  other selected transactions at the four locations and throughout the Air  Force\u2019s fiscal year 2001 purchase card transactions to determine if  indications exist of potentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive or  questionable purchase card activity.  Our data mining included identifying  transactions with certain vendors were more likely to sell items that would  be unauthorized or that would be personal items.  We also based our  selection on the nature, dollar amount, date, and other identifying  characteristics of the transactions. Because of the large number of  transactions that met these criteria, we did not look at all potential abuses  of the purchase card.  For a small number of these transactions at each of  the four installations and from the Air Force-wide database, we requested  limited documentation, usually the supporting invoice, that could provide  additional indications as to whether the transactions were potentially  fraudulent, improper, or abusive or questionable.   If the additional  documentation indicated that the transactions were likely proper and valid,  we did not pursue further documentation.  If the additional documentation  was not provided, or if it indicated further issues related to the  transactions, we obtained and analyzed additional documentation or  information about these transactions.  While we identified some potentially  fraudulent, improper, and abusive or questionable transactions, our work  was not designed to identify, and we cannot determine, the extent of  potentially fraudulent, improper, or abusive transactions.", "For those potentially fraudulent transactions that had been or were being  investigated at the four audited installations, we discussed the cases with  the investigators and/or obtained records and reports on the investigations.

The airman took advantage of a co-worker\u2019s  inexperience and limited English language capability to obtain and  improperly use her purchase card.  The cardholder was a Japanese citizen  employed by the Air Force.", "In early October 2000, the cardholder gave investigators a signed, sworn  statement, in which she related that from approximately March through  September 2000, an E-4, senior airman in the Civil Engineering Squadron  had repeatedly used the cardholder\u2019s government purchase card to pay bills  and make purchases, often without the cardholder\u2019s knowledge.  While the  cardholder was aware that some of the purchases were made at the  squadron\u2019s Self Help Store, she told Air Force investigators that she had no  knowledge of the types of items purchased.  The cardholder also stated  that when she inquired as to the nature of the purchases, the senior airman  told her that he would take care of purchases using the card because of her  limited English language capabilities.  No attempt was made to correct this  misuse of the purchase card until the bank declined a large purchase of  approximately $50,000 due to the high dollar amount.  The declined  transaction flagged the account, and the contracting squadron initiated an  inquiry.", "Contracting squadron records showed that the senior airman had  purchased approximately $10,000 of merchandise using the Japanese  cardholder\u2019s account.  Air Force investigators\u2019 review of Self Help Store  records failed to identify what was purchased and/or if the items had ever  been received at the store.  As a result, investigators were unable to  determine whether criminal abuse had occurred.  However, because the  investigation did identify procedural violations, investigators referred this  matter to the command for action.  The airman subsequently was  reassigned from the civil engineering squadron.  The airman was able to  use the purchase card for unauthorized transactions because the  cardholder failed to maintain custody of the purchase card."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case #3", "paragraphs": ["On August 14, 2001, investigators assigned to the 325th Security Forces  Squadron at Tyndall AFB, Florida, received an allegation that a WG-5  maintenance employee was using his government purchase card to buy  personal use items.  According to a witness, the cardholder had bragged  about using his government purchase card to purchase tools, a television  set, and a computer for his personal use.  The witness told the investigators  that he had accompanied the cardholder to a local hardware and auto parts  stores in Panama City, Florida, and had observed the cardholder using his  government purchase card to buy tools and other items for his son\u2019s  vehicle.  The cardholder subsequently gave one of the tools to the witness  and told him to keep it for his personal use.  Squadron investigators  coordinated with a local hardware store and obtained security videotape as  evidence.  The video depicted the cardholder, who was present with the  witness, purchasing a drill bit, which the cardholder subsequently gave to  the witness.  The cardholder also allegedly used his government purchase  card to pay for major engine repairs to his son\u2019s vehicle.", "The investigators\u2019 preliminary review of the cardholder\u2019s account disclosed  several unauthorized charges for dental work totaling approximately  $1,800 and charges for an automotive engine repair for $1,181.
