Of that, State allocated over $2 billion and USAID allocated over $700 million. State and USAID funded some of these programs through the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Technical assistance to build human and institutional capacity in the  justice system. U.S. agencies provide assistance to improve rule of  law capacity in the form of trainings and exchange programs, and  through the use of embedded advisors in local institutions.

(See fig. 5.)  Multiple exchange programs provide training to enhance the rule of  law, but local government officials from all four selected countries  received training at International Law Enforcement Academies, which  provide local law enforcement and justice sector officials with rule of  law-related training and technical assistance. (See fig. 6.)  2.  Embedded advisors. Embedded advisors provide onsite advice to  local government officials and may operate in some of the selected  countries as either a supplement or the primary agents of training and  capacity building, according to agency officials. In several of our  selected countries, the U.S. government embeds advisors with local  government agencies or courts. According to U.S. officials, these  advisors simultaneously provide technical assistance to local officials,  but also can report back to the U.S. mission on the opinions and  suggestions of local government. In Colombia, DOJ officials said that  advisors now focus primarily on counter-narcotics issues but  previously worked with host government agencies on human rights  and rule of law-related work. They noted that DOJ advisors trained  thousands of Colombian judges and attorneys prior to this shift in  emphasis. Also in Colombia, USAID supports embedded advisors to  provide technical assistance to the Office of Colombia\u2019s Attorney  General on human rights defender homicides and gender-based  violence and the Inspector General\u2019s Office to support public official  disciplinary actions related to human rights protections. In Kosovo,  OPDAT and ICITAP embedded advisors provide advice and training  to their counterparts in a variety of Kosovo government agencies,  including the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of the Interior, and Kosovo  Corrections.  3.  Legislative and regulatory reform. U.S. agencies and funded  implementers work with local governments and programs to reform  specific laws and administrative procedures. For example, U.S.  programs introduced or expanded the concept of and legal structure  for plea bargaining into Colombia, Kosovo, and the Philippines,  according to U.S. officials in those countries. In the Philippines,  members of the national court system provided data showing how the  expanded use of continuous trial methods and plea bargaining,  supported by U.S.-funded programs, increased courts\u2019 ability to  process cases and begin to reduce the pre-trial detainee population.  4.  Resource and equipment provision. Programs provide resources  directly to government agencies and civil society groups that are  engaged in advocacy around rule of law issues. In the Philippines, for  example, USAID provided funds to install e-courts to improve how  courts record case information, monitor case flow, and provide public  access to the status of cases, according to USAID. They said this  productivity tool automates the tasks and functions of the courts,  improving overall efficiency, transparency and accountability. (See fig.  7.)  5.  Public outreach. Missions conduct interagency public outreach  campaigns to promote the rule of law in the host country, including  greater awareness of legal rights, responsibilities, access, and  resources, according to agency officials. Interagency coordination via  the Rule of Law working group allows the Kosovo mission to conduct  consistently voiced rule of law-themed public communication, for  example. The mission jointly publishes a rule of law tweet to update  the public on relevant issues, supports \u201canti-corruption week,\u201d and  provides feedback to host government officials to emphasize U.S.  activities and views on specific rule of law issues.

DOJ reported  obligated funds separately for its two rule of law-focused bodies, the  International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP)  and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and  Training (OPDAT). DOJ\u2019s data described all obligated funding for rule of  law assistance globally from fiscal years 2014 through July 2019.
