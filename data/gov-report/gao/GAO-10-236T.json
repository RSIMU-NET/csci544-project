In 2004 GAO identified a set of key protection practices from the collective practices of federal agencies and the private sector, which included allocation of resources using risk management, strategic management of human capital, leveraging of technology, information sharing and coordination, and performance measurement and testing. This testimony is based on past reports and testimonies and discusses (1) limitations FPS faces in protecting GSA buildings and resulting vulnerabilities; and (2) actions FPS is taking. To perform this work, GAO used its key practices as criteria, visited a number of GSA buildings, surveyed tenant agencies, analyzed pertinent laws and DHS and GSA documents, conducted covert testing at 10 judgmentally selected high-security buildings in four cities, and interviewed officials from DHS, GSA, and tenant agencies, and contractors and guards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FPS's approach to securing GSA buildings reflects some aspects of key protection practices; however, GAO found limitations in each area and identified vulnerabilities. More specifically: (1) FPS faces obstacles in allocating resources using risk management. FPS uses an outdated risk assessment tool and a subjective, time-consuming process to assess risk. In addition, resource allocation decisions are the responsibility of GSA and tenant agencies. This leads to uncertainty about whether risks are being mitigated. Also, FPS continues to struggle with funding challenges that impede its ability to allocate resources effectively. (2) FPS does not have a strategic human capital management plan to guide its current and future workforce planning efforts, making it difficult to discern how effective its transition to an inspector-based workforce will be. Furthermore, because contract guards were not properly trained and did not comply with post orders, GAO investigators concealing components for an improvised explosive device passed undetected by FPS guards at 10 of 10 high-security facilities in four major cities. (3) FPS lacks a systematic approach for leveraging technology, and inspectors do not provide tenant agencies with an analysis of alternative technologies, their cost, and the associated reduction in risk. As a result, there is limited assurance that the recommendations inspectors make are the best available alternatives, and tenant agencies must make resource allocation decisions without key information. (4) FPS has developed information sharing and coordination mechanisms with GSA and tenant agencies, but there is inconsistency in the type of information shared and the frequency of coordination. (5) FPS lacks a reliable data management system for accurately tracking performance measurement and testing. Without such a system, it is difficult for FPS to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of its efforts, allocate resources, or make informed risk management decisions. FPS is taking actions to better protect GSA buildings, in part as a result of GAO's recommendations. For example, FPS is developing a new risk assessment program and has recently focused on improving oversight of its contract guard program. Additionally, GAO has recommended that FPS implement specific actions to make greater use of key practices and otherwise improve security. However, FPS has not completed many related corrective actions and FPS faces implementation challenges as well. Nonetheless, adhering to key practices and implementing GAO's recommendations in specific areas would enhance FPS's chances for future success, and could position FPS to become a leader and benchmark agency for facility protection in the federal government."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here to discuss the Federal Protective Service\u2019s  (FPS) efforts to ensure the protection of the more than 1 million  government employees, as well as members of the public, who work in  and visit the nearly 9,000 federal facilities that are under the control and  custody of the General Services Administration (GSA). There has not been  a large-scale attack on a domestic federal facility since the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Nevertheless, the shooting  death this past year of a guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2014 though not a federal facility\u2014demonstrates the continued vulnerability of  public buildings. Moreover, the challenge of protecting federal real  property is one of the major reasons for GAO\u2019s designation of federal real  property management as a high-risk area.", "FPS\u2014within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is authorized  to protect the buildings, grounds, and property that are under the control  and custody of GSA, as well as the persons on the property; to enforce  federal laws and regulations aimed at protecting GSA buildings and  persons on the property; and to investigate offenses against these  buildings and persons. FPS conducts its mission by providing security  services through two types of activities: (1) physical security activities\u2014 conducting building risk assessments of facilities and recommending  countermeasures aimed at preventing incidents at facilities\u2014and (2) law  enforcement activities\u2014proactively patrolling facilities, responding to  incidents, conducting criminal investigations, and exercising arrest  authority. To accomplish its mission of protecting federal facilities, FPS  currently has a budget of around $1 billion, nearly 1,200 full time  employees, and about 15,000 contract security guards deployed at federal  facilities across the country.", "We have identified a set of key facility protection practices from the  collective practices of federal agencies and the private sector to provide a  framework for guiding agencies\u2019 protection efforts and addressing  challenges. The key practices essentially form the foundation of a  comprehensive approach to building protection. We have used these key  practices to evaluate how FPS protects GSA buildings and will focus on  the following five key practices for this testimony:    Allocation of resources using risk management. Identify threats, assess  vulnerabilities, and determine critical assets to protect, and use  information on these and other elements to develop countermeasures and  prioritize the allocation of resources as conditions change.", "Strategic management of human capital. Manage human capital to  maximize government performance and ensure accountability in asset  protection through, for example, recruitment of skilled staff, training, and  retention.", "Leveraging of technology. Select technologies to enhance asset security  through methods like access control, detection, and surveillance systems.  This involves not only using technology, but also ensuring positive returns  on investments in the form of reduced vulnerabilities.", "Information sharing and coordination. Establish means of coordinating  and sharing security and threat information internally, within large  organizations, and externally, with other government entities and the  private sector.", "Performance measurement and testing. Use metrics, such as  implementation timelines, and active testing, such as unannounced on-site  assessments, to ensure accountability for achieving program goals and  improving security at facilities.", "This testimony is based on past reports and testimonies and discusses (1)  limitations FPS faces in protecting GSA buildings and resulting  vulnerabilities and (2) actions FPS is taking to address challenges. Work  for these past reports and testimonies included using our key practices as  a framework for assessing facility protection efforts by FPS management  and at individual buildings. We also visited FPS regions and selected GSA  buildings to assess FPS activities firsthand. We surveyed a sample of 1,398  federal officials who work in GSA buildings in FPS\u2019s 11 regions and are  responsible for collaborating with FPS on security issues. Additionally, we  reviewed training and certification data for 663 randomly selected guards  in 6 of FPS\u2019s 11 regions. Because of the sensitivity of some of the  information in our prior work, we cannot specifically identify the locations  of the incidents discussed. We also conducted covert testing at 10  judgmentally selected high-risk facilities in four cities. For all of our work,  we reviewed related laws and directives, interviewed officials and  analyzed documents and data from DHS and GSA, and interviewed tenant  agency representatives, contractors, and guards. The previous work on  which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FPS Faces Challenges in Many Areas, Raising Concerns about Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risk Management Approach Is Inadequate and Has Limitations", "paragraphs": ["FPS assesses risk and recommends countermeasures to GSA and tenant  agencies; however, FPS\u2019s ability to influence the allocation of resources  using risk management is limited because resource allocation decisions  are the responsibility of GSA and tenant agencies, which may be unwilling  to fund the countermeasures FPS recommends. We have found that under  the current risk management approach, the security equipment that FPS  recommends and is responsible for acquiring, installing, and maintaining  may not be implemented if tenant agencies are unwilling to fund it. For  example, in August 2007 FPS recommended a security equipment  countermeasure\u2014the upgrade of a surveillance system shared by two  high-security locations that, according to FPS officials, would cost around  $650,000. While members of one building security committee (BSC) told us  they approved spending between $350,000 and $375,000 to fund their  agencies\u2019 share of the countermeasure, they said that the BSC of the other  location would not approve funding; therefore, FPS could not upgrade the  system it had recommended. In November 2008 FPS officials told us that  they were moving ahead with the project by drawing on unexpended  revenues from the two locations\u2019 building-specific fees and the funding  that was approved by one of the BSCs. Furthermore, FPS officials, in May  2009, told us that all cameras had been repaired and all monitoring and  recording devices had been replaced, and that the two BSCs had approved  additional upgrades and that FPS was implementing them. As we reported  in June 2008, we have found other instances in which recommended  security countermeasures were not implemented at some of the buildings  we visited because BSC members could not agree on which  countermeasures to implement or were unable to obtain funding from  their agencies.", "Compounding this situation, FPS takes a building-by-building approach to  risk management, using an outdated risk assessment tool to create  building security assessments (BSA), rather than taking a more  comprehensive, strategic approach and assessing risks among all buildings  in GSA\u2019s inventory and recommending countermeasure priorities to GSA  and tenant agencies. As a result, the current approach provides less  assurance that the most critical risks at federal buildings across the  country are being prioritized and mitigated. Also, GSA and tenant agencies  have concerns about the quality and timeliness of FPS\u2019s risk assessment  services and are taking steps to obtain their own risk assessments. For  example, GSA officials told us they have had difficulties receiving timely  risk assessments from FPS for space GSA is considering leasing. These  risk assessments must be completed before GSA can take possession of  the property and lease it to tenant agencies. An inefficient risk assessment  process for new lease projects can add costs for GSA and create problems  for both GSA and tenant agencies that have been planning for a move.  Therefore, GSA is updating a risk assessment tool that it began developing  in 1998, but has not recently used, to better ensure the timeliness and  comprehensiveness of these risk assessments. GSA officials told us that in  the future they may use this tool for other physical security activities, such  as conducting other types of risk assessments and determining security  countermeasures for new facilities. Additionally, although tenant agencies  have typically taken responsibility for assessing risk and securing the  interior of their buildings, assessing exterior risks will require additional  expertise and resources. This is an inefficient approach considering that  tenant agencies are paying FPS to assess building security.", "Finally, FPS continues to struggle with funding challenges that impede its  ability to allocate resources to more effectively manage risk. FPS faces  challenges in ensuring that its fee-based funding structure accounts for the  varying levels of risk and types of services provided at federal facilities.  FPS funds its operations through security fees charged to tenant agencies.  However, FPS\u2019s basic security fee, which funds most of its operations,  does not account for the risk faced by specific buildings, the level of  service provided, or the cost of providing services, raising questions about  equity. FPS charges federal agencies the same basic security fee  regardless of the perceived threat to a particular building or agency. In  fiscal year 2009, FPS charged 66 cents per square foot for basic security.  Although FPS categorizes buildings according to security levels based on  its assessment of each building\u2019s risk and size, this assessment does not  affect the security fee FPS charges. For example, level I facilities typically  face less risk because they are generally small storefront-type operations  with a low level of public contact, such as a Social Security Administration  office. However, these facilities are charged the same basic security fee of  66 cents per square foot as a level IV facility that has a high volume of  public contact and may contain high-risk law enforcement and intelligence  agencies and highly sensitive government records. We also have reported  that basing government fees on the cost of providing a service promotes  equity, especially when the cost of providing the service differs  significantly among different users, as is the case with FPS. In our June  2008 report, we recommended that FPS improve its use of the fee-based  system by developing a method to accurately account for the cost of  providing security services to tenant agencies and ensuring that its fee  structure takes into consideration the varying levels of risk and service  provided at GSA facilities. We also recommended an evaluation of  whether FPS\u2019s current use of a fee-based system or an alternative funding  mechanism is the most appropriate manner to fund the agency. While DHS  agreed with these recommendations, FPS has not fully implemented them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements Needed in Human Capital Planning and Contract Guard Management", "paragraphs": ["FPS does not have a strategic human capital plan to guide its current and  future workforce planning efforts, including effective processes for  training, retention, and staff development. Instead, FPS has developed a  short-term hiring plan that does not include key human capital principles,  such as determining an agency\u2019s optimum staffing needs. Moreover, FPS  has been transitioning to an inspector-based workforce, thus eliminating  the police officer position and relying primarily on FPS inspectors for both  law enforcement and physical security activities. FPS believes that this  change will ensure that its staff has the right mix of technical skills and  training needed to accomplish its mission. However, FPS\u2019s ability to  provide law enforcement services under its inspector-based workforce  approach may be diminished because FPS will rely on its inspectors to  provide these services and physical security services simultaneously. In  the absence of a strategic human capital plan, it is difficult to discern how  effective an inspector-based workforce approach will be. The lack of a  human capital plan has also contributed to inconsistent approaches in  how FPS regions and headquarters are managing human capital activities.  For example, FPS officials in some of the regions we visited said they  implement their own procedures for managing their workforce, including  processes for performance feedback, training, and mentoring.  Additionally, FPS does not collect data on its workforce\u2019s knowledge,  skills, and abilities. These elements are necessary for successful  workforce planning activities, such as identifying and filling skill gaps and  succession planning. We recently recommended that FPS improve how it  collects data on its workforce\u2019s knowledge, skills, and abilities to help it  better manage and understand current and future workforce needs; and  use these data in the development and implementation of a long-term  strategic human capital plan that addresses key principles for effective  strategic workforce planning. DHS concurred with our recommendations.", "Furthermore, FPS did not meet its fiscal year 2008 mandated deadline of  increasing its staffing level to no fewer than 1,200 full-time employees by  July 31, 2008, and instead met this staffing level in April 2009. FPS\u2019s staff  has steadily declined since 2004 and critical law enforcement services  have been reduced or eliminated. For example, FPS has eliminated its use  of proactive patrol to prevent or detect criminal violations at many GSA  buildings. According to some FPS officials at regions we visited, not  providing proactive patrol has limited its law enforcement personnel to a  reactive force. Additionally, officials stated that in the past, proactive  patrol permitted its police officers and inspectors to identify and  apprehend individuals that were surveilling GSA buildings. In contrast,  when FPS is not able to patrol federal buildings, there is increased  potential for illegal entry and other criminal activity. In one city we visited,  a deceased individual had been found in a vacant GSA facility that was not  regularly patrolled by FPS. FPS officials stated that the deceased  individual had been inside the building for approximately 3 months.", "FPS does not fully ensure that its contract security guards have the  training and certifications required to be deployed to a GSA building. We  have noted that the effectiveness of a risk management approach depends  on the involvement of experienced and professional security personnel.  Further, that the chances of omitting major steps in the risk management  process increase if personnel are not well trained in applying risk  management. FPS requires that all prospective guards complete about 128  hours of training including 8 hours of X-ray and magnetometer training.  However, in one region, FPS has not provided the X-ray or magnetometer  training to its 1,500 guards since 2004. Nonetheless, these guards are  assigned to posts at GSA buildings. X-ray training is critical because  guards control access points at buildings. Insufficient X-ray and  magnetometer training may have contributed to several incidents at GSA  buildings in which guards were negligent in carrying out their  responsibilities. For example, at a level IV federal facility in a major  metropolitan area, an infant in a carrier was sent through an X-ray  machine due to a guard\u2019s negligence. Specifically, according to an FPS  official in that region, a woman with her infant in a carrier attempted to  enter the facility, which has child care services. While retrieving her  identification, the woman placed the carrier on the X-ray machine.  Because the guard was not paying attention and the machine\u2019s safety  features had been disabled, the infant in the carrier was sent through the  X-ray machine. FPS investigated the incident and dismissed the guard;  however, the guard subsequently sued FPS for not providing the required  X-ray training. The guard won the suit because FPS could not produce any  documentation to show that the guard had received the training, according  to an FPS official. In addition, FPS officials from that region could not tell  us whether the X-ray machine\u2019s safety features had been repaired.  Additionally, we found that FPS does not have a fully reliable system for  monitoring and verifying guard training and certification requirements. We  reviewed 663 randomly selected guard records and found that 62 percent  of the guards had at least one expired certification, including a declaration  that guards have not been convicted of domestic violence, which make  them ineligible to carry firearms.", "We also found that some guards were not provided building-specific  training, such as what actions to take during a building evacuation or a  building emergency. This lack of training may have contributed to several  incidents where guards neglected their assigned responsibilities. For  example,    at a level IV facility, the guards did not follow evacuation procedures and  left two access points unattended, thereby leaving the facility vulnerable;    at a level IV facility, the guard allowed employees to enter the building  while an incident involving suspicious packages was being investigated;  and,   at a level III facility, the guard allowed employees to access the area  affected by a suspicious package, which was required to be evacuated.", "FPS has limited assurance that its guards are complying with post orders.  It does not have specific national guidance on when and how guard  inspections should be performed. FPS\u2019s inspections of guard posts at GSA  buildings are inconsistent and the quality varied in the six regions we  examined. We also found that guard inspections are typically completed  by FPS during regular business hours and in locations where FPS has a  field office, and seldom on nights or weekends. However, on an occasion  when FPS officials conducted a post inspection at night, they found a  guard asleep at his post after taking a pain-killer prescription drug. FPS  also found other incidents at high-security facilities where guards  neglected or inadequately performed their assigned responsibilities. For  example, a guard failed to recognize or did not properly X-ray a box  containing handguns at the loading dock at a facility. FPS became aware  of the situation because the handguns were delivered to FPS.", "Because guards were not properly trained and did not comply with post  orders, our investigators\u2014with the components for an improvised  explosive device (IED) concealed on their persons\u2014passed undetected  through access points controlled by FPS guards at 10 of 10 level IV  facilities in four major cities where GAO conducted covert tests. The  specific components for this device, items used to conceal the device  components, and the methods of concealment that we used during our  covert testing are classified, and thus are not discussed in this testimony.  Of the 10 level IV facilities our investigators penetrated, 8 were  government owned and 2 were leased facilities. The facilities included  district offices of a U.S Senator and a U.S. Representative as well as  agencies of the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Health  and Human Services, Justice, State, and others. The two leased facilities  did not have any guards at the access control points at the time of our  testing. Using publicly available information, our investigators identified a  type of device that a terrorist could use to cause damage to a federal  facility and threaten the safety of federal workers and the general public.  The device was an IED made up of two parts\u2014a liquid explosive and a  low-yield detonator\u2014and included a variety of materials not typically  brought into a federal facility by employees or the public. Although the  detonator itself could function as an IED, investigators determined that it  could also be used to set off a liquid explosive and cause significantly  more damage. To ensure safety during this testing, we took precautions so  that the IED would not explode. For example, we lowered the  concentration level of the material. To gain entry into each of the 10 level  IV facilities, our investigators showed a photo identification (a state  driver\u2019s license) and walked through the magnetometers without incident.  Our investigators also placed their briefcases with the IED material on the  conveyor belt of the X-ray machine, but the guards detected nothing.  Furthermore, our investigators did not receive any secondary searches  from the guards that might have revealed the IED material that they  brought into the facilities. At security checkpoints at 3 of the 10 facilities,  our investigators noticed that the guard was not looking at the X-ray  screen as some of the IED components passed through the machine. A  guard questioned an item in the briefcase at one of the 10 facilities but the  materials were subsequently allowed through the X-ray machines. At each  facility, once past the guard screening checkpoint, our investigators  proceeded to a restroom and assembled the IED. At some of the facilities,  the restrooms were locked. Our investigators gained access by asking  employees to let them in. With the IED completely assembled in a  briefcase, our investigators walked freely around several floors of the  facilities and into various executive and legislative branch offices, as  described above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systematic Approach for Cost-Effectively Leveraging Technology Is Lacking", "paragraphs": ["Leveraging technology is a key practice over which FPS has somewhat  more control, but FPS does not have a comprehensive approach for  identifying, acquiring, and assessing the cost-effectiveness of the security  equipment that its inspectors recommend. Individual FPS inspectors have  considerable latitude in determining which technologies and other  countermeasures to recommend, but the inspectors receive little training  and guidance in how to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of these  technologies or determine the expected return on investment. FPS  officials told us that inspectors make technology decisions based on the  initial training they receive, personal knowledge and experience, and  contacts with vendors. FPS inspectors receive some training in identifying  and recommending security technologies as part of their initial FPS  physical security training. Since FPS was transferred to DHS in 2003, its  refresher training program for inspectors has primarily focused on law  enforcement. Consequently, inspectors lack recurring technology training.  Additionally, FPS does not provide inspectors with specialized guidance  and standards for cost-effectively selecting technology. In the absence of  specific guidance, inspectors follow the Department of Justice minimum  countermeasure standards and other relevant Interagency Security  Committee standards, but these standards do not assist users in selecting  cost-effective technologies. Moreover, the document that FPS uses to  convey its countermeasure recommendations to GSA and tenant  agencies\u2014the BSA executive summary\u2014includes cost estimates but no  analysis of alternatives. As a result, GSA and tenant agencies have limited  assurance that the investments in technologies and other countermeasures  that FPS inspectors recommend are cost-effective, consistent across  buildings, and the best available alternatives.", "For example, at one location we visited, an explosives detection dog was  used to screen mail that is distributed elsewhere. In 2006, FPS had  recommended, based on the results of its risk analysis, the use of this dog  and an X-ray machine, although at the time of our visit only the dog was  being used. Moreover, the dog and handler work 12-hour shifts Monday  through Friday when most mail is delivered and shipped, and the dog  needs a break every 7 minutes. The GSA regional security officials we  spoke with questioned whether this approach was more effective and  efficient than using an on-site enhanced X-ray machine that could detect  biological and chemical agents as well as explosives and could be used  anytime. In accordance with its policies, FPS conducted a BSA of the site  in 2008 and determined that using an enhanced X-ray machine and an  explosives detection dog would bring the projected threat rating of the site  down from moderate to low. FPS included estimated one-time installation  and recurring costs in the BSA and executive summary, but did not include  the estimated cost and risk of the following mail screening options: (1)  usage of the dog and the additional countermeasure; (2) usage of the  additional countermeasure only; and (3) usage of the dog only.  Consequently, tenant agency representatives would have to investigate the  cost and risk implications of these options on their own to make an  informed resource allocation decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing and Coordination Practices Lack Consistency", "paragraphs": ["It is critical that FPS\u2014as the provider of law enforcement and related  security services for GSA buildings\u2014and GSA\u2014as the manager of these  properties\u2014have well-established lines of communication with each other  and with tenant agencies to ensure that all parties are aware of the ever- changing risks in a dynamic threat environment and that FPS and GSA are  taking appropriate actions to reduce vulnerabilities. While FPS and GSA  top management have established communication channels, the types of  information shared at the regional and building levels are inconsistent, and  overall, FPS and GSA disagree over what information should be shared.  For example, the memorandum of agreement between DHS and GSA  specifies that FPS will provide quarterly briefings at the regional level, but  FPS had not been providing them consistently across all regions. FPS  resumed the practice in October 2008, however, GSA security officials said  that these briefings mostly focused on crime statistics and did not  constitute comprehensive threat analyses. Additionally, FPS is only  required to meet formally with GSA property managers and tenant  agencies as part of the BSA process\u2014an event that occurs every 2 to 5  years, depending on a building\u2019s security level. We identified information  sharing gaps at several level III and IV sites that we visited, and found that  in some cases these deficiencies led to decreased security awareness and  increased risk.", "At one location, we observed during our interview with the BSC that the  committee members were confused about procedures for screening  visitors who are passengers in employees\u2019 cars that enter the building via  the parking garage. One of the tenants recounted an incident in which a  security guard directed the visitor to walk through the garage to an  appropriate screening station. According to the GSA property manager,  this action created a safety hazard. The GSA property manager knew the  appropriate screening procedure, but told us there was no written policy  on the procedure that members could access. Additionally, BSC members  told us that the committee met as needed.", "At one location, FPS had received inaccurate square footage data from  GSA and had therefore overcharged the primary tenant agency for a guard  post that protected space shared by all the tenants. According to the GSA  property manager, once GSA was made aware of the problem, the agency  obtained updated information and worked with the tenant agencies to  develop a cost-sharing plan for the guard post, which made the primary  tenant agency\u2019s security expenses somewhat more equitable. BSC  members told us that the committee met regularly.", "At one location, members of a BSC told us that they met as needed,  although even when they hold meetings, one of the main tenant agencies  typically does not participate. GSA officials commented that this tenant  adheres to its agency\u2019s building security protocols and does not  necessarily follow GSA\u2019s tenant policies and procedures, which GSA  thinks creates security risks for the entire building.", "At one location, tenant agency representatives and officials from FPS told  us they met regularly, but GSA officials told us they were not invited to  these meetings. GSA officials at this location told us that they invite FPS to  their property management meetings for that location, but FPS does not  attend. GSA officials also said they do not receive timely incident  information for the site from FPS and suggested that increased  communication among the agencies would help them be more effective  managers of their properties and provide tenants with better customer  service.", "At one location, GSA undertook a major renovation project beginning in  April 2007. FPS, GSA, and tenant agency representatives did not all meet  together regularly to make security preparations or manage security  operations during construction. FPS officials told us they had not been  invited to project meetings, although GSA officials told us that they had  invited FPS and that FPS attended some meetings. In May 2008, FPS  discovered that specific surveillance equipment had been removed. As of  May 2009, FPS officials told us they did not know who had removed the  equipment and were working with tenant agency representatives to  recover it. However, in June 2009 tenant agency representatives told us  that they believed FPS was fully aware that the equipment had been  removed in December 2007.", "Additionally, we conducted a survey of GSA tenant agencies and found  that they had mixed views about some of the services they pay FPS to  provide. Notably, the survey results indicated that the roles and  responsibilities of FPS and tenant agencies are unclear, primarily because  on average about one-third of tenant agencies could not comment on how  satisfied or dissatisfied they were with FPS\u2019s level of communication of its  services, partly because they had little to no interaction with FPS officers.  Although FPS plans to implement education and outreach initiatives to  improve customer service to tenant agencies, it will face challenges  because of its lack of complete and accurate contact data. During the  course of our review, we found that approximately 53 percent of the e-mail  addresses and 27 percent of the telephone numbers for designated points  of contacts were missing from FPS\u2019s contact database and the database  required a substantial amount of revising. Complete and accurate contact  information for FPS\u2019s customers is critical for information sharing and an  essential component of any customer service initiative. Therefore, to  improve its services to GSA and tenant agencies, we recommended that  FPS collect and maintain an accurate and comprehensive list of all facility- designated points of contact, as well as a system for regularly updating  this list; and develop and implement a program for education and outreach  to GSA and tenant agencies to ensure they are aware of the current roles,  responsibilities, and services provided by FPS. DHS concurred with our  recommendations.", "Furthermore, while FPS and GSA acknowledge that the two organizations  are partners in protecting and securing GSA buildings, FPS and GSA  fundamentally disagree over how much of the information in the BSA  should be shared. Per the memorandum of agreement, FPS is required to  share the BSA executive summary with GSA and FPS believes that this  document contains sufficient information for GSA to make decisions  about purchasing and implementing FPS\u2019s recommended  countermeasures. However, GSA officials at all levels cite limitations with  the BSA executive summary saying, for example, that it does not contain  enough contextual information on threats and vulnerabilities to support  FPS\u2019s countermeasure recommendations and justify the expenses that  GSA and tenant agencies would incur by installing additional  countermeasures. Moreover, GSA security officials told us that FPS does  not consistently share BSA executive summaries across all regions.  Instead, GSA wants to receive BSAs in their entirety so that it can better  protect GSA buildings and the tenants who occupy them. According to  GSA, building protection functions are an integral part of its property  preservation, operation, and management responsibilities.", "In a post-September 11th era, it is crucial that federal agencies work  together to share information to advance homeland security and critical  infrastructure protection efforts. Information is a vital tool in fighting  terrorism, and the timely dissemination of that information to the  appropriate government agency is absolutely critical to maintaining the  security of our nation. The ability to share security-related information can  unify the efforts of federal agencies in preventing or minimizing terrorist  attacks. However, in the absence of comprehensive information-sharing  plans, many aspects of homeland security information sharing can be  ineffective and fragmented. In 2005, we designated information sharing for  homeland security as a governmentwide high-risk area because of the  significant challenges faced in this area\u2014challenges that are still evident  today. It is critical that FPS and GSA\u2014which both have protection  functions for GSA buildings, their occupants, and those who visit them\u2014 reach consensus on sharing information in a timely manner to support  homeland security and critical infrastructure protection efforts.", "We recently recommended that FPS reach consensus with GSA on what  information contained in the BSA is needed for GSA to fulfill its  responsibilities related to the protection of federal buildings and  occupants, and accordingly, establish internal controls to ensure that  shared information is adequately safeguarded; guidance for employees to  use in deciding what information to protect with sensitive but unclassified  designations; provisions for training on making designations, controlling,  and sharing such information with GSA and other entities; and a review  process to evaluate how well this information sharing process is working,  with results reported to the Secretary of Homeland Security. While DHS  concurred with this recommendation, we are concerned that the steps it  described in its response were not comprehensive enough to address the  intent of the recommendation. For example, DHS did not explicitly  commit to reaching consensus with GSA in identifying building security  information that can be shared, or to the steps we outlined in our  recommendation\u2014steps that in our view comprise a comprehensive plan  for sharing and safeguarding sensitive information. Therefore, it is  important that FPS engage GSA in identifying what building security  information can be shared and follow the information sharing and  safeguarding steps we included in our recommendation to ensure that  GSA acquires the information it needs to protect the 9,000 buildings under  its control and custody, the federal employees who work in them, and  those who visit them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measurement Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that FPS is limited in its ability to assess the  effectiveness of its efforts to protect GSA buildings. To determine how  well it is accomplishing its mission to protect GSA buildings, FPS has  identified some output measures that are a part of the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Performance Assessment Rating Tool. These  measures include determining whether security countermeasures have  been deployed and are fully operational, the amount of time it takes to  respond to an incident, and the percentage of BSAs completed on time.  Some of these measures are also included in FPS\u2019s federal facilities  security index, which is used to assess its performance. However, FPS has  not developed outcome measures to evaluate the net effect of its efforts to  protect GSA buildings. While output measures are helpful, outcome  measures are also important because they can provide FPS with broader  information on program results, such as the extent to which its decision to  move to an inspector-based workforce will enhance security at GSA  facilities or help identify the security gaps that remain at GSA facilities and  determine what action may be needed to address them. In addition, FPS  does not have a reliable data management system that will allow it to  accurately track these measures or other important measures such as the  number of crimes and other incidents occurring at GSA facilities. Without  such a system, it is difficult for FPS to evaluate and improve the  effectiveness of its efforts to protect federal employees and facilities,  allocate its limited resources, or make informed risk management  decisions. For example, weaknesses in one of FPS\u2019s countermeasure  tracking systems make it difficult to accurately track the implementation  status of recommended countermeasures such as security cameras and X- ray machines. Without this ability, FPS has difficulty determining whether  it has mitigated the risk of GSA facilities to crime or a terrorist attack."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FPS Is Taking Steps to Better Protect GSA Buildings, but Has Not Fully Implemented Actions and Faces Significant Challenges", "paragraphs": ["FPS is taking some steps in each of the key practice areas to improve its  ability to better protect GSA buildings. Additionally, GAO has  recommended that FPS implement specific actions to promote greater  usage of key protection practices and otherwise improve security.  However, FPS has not completed many related corrective actions and FPS  faces implementation challenges as well."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FPS Is Developing a New Program to Assess Risk, Manage Human Capital, and Measure Performance", "paragraphs": ["FPS is developing the Risk Assessment and Management Program  (RAMP), which could enhance its approach to assessing risk, managing  human capital, and measuring performance. With regard to improving the  effectiveness of FPS\u2019s risk management approach and the quality of BSAs,  FPS believes RAMP will provide inspectors with the information needed to  make more informed and defensible recommendations for security  countermeasures. FPS also anticipates that RAMP will allow inspectors to  obtain information from one electronic source, generate reports  automatically, enable FPS to track selected countermeasures throughout  their life cycle, address some concerns about the subjectivity inherent in  BSAs, and reduce the amount of time inspectors and managers spend on  administrative work. Additionally, FPS is designing RAMP so that it will  produce risk assessments that are compliant with Interagency Security  Committee standards, compatible with the risk management framework  set forth by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, and consistent  with the business processes outlined in the memorandum of agreement  with GSA. According to FPS, RAMP will support all components of the  BSA process, including gathering and reviewing building information;  conducting and recording interviews; assessing threats, vulnerabilities,  and consequences to develop a detailed risk profile; recommending  appropriate countermeasures; and producing BSA reports. FPS also plans  to use RAMP to track and analyze certain workforce data, contract guard  program data, and other performance data such as the types and  definitions of incidents and incident response times.", "Although FPS intends for RAMP to improve its approach to risk  assessment, human capital management, and performance measurement,  it is not clear that FPS has fully addressed some implementation issues.  For example, one issue concerns the accuracy and reliability of the  information that will be entered into RAMP. According to FPS, the agency  plans to transfer data from several of its legacy systems, including the  Contract Guard Employment Requirements Tracking System (CERTS),  into RAMP. In July 2009, we testified on the accuracy and reliability issues  associated with CERTS. FPS subsequently conducted an audit of CERTS  to determine the status of its guard training and certification. However, the  results of the audit showed that FPS was able to verify the status for about  7,600 of its 15,000 guards. According to an FPS official, one of its regions  did not meet the deadline for submitting data to headquarters because its  data were not accurate or reliable and therefore about 1,500 guards were  not included in the audit. FPS was not able to explain why it was not able  to verify the status of the remaining 5,900 guards. In 2008, we  recommended that FPS develop and implement specific guidelines and  standards for measuring its performance and improve how it categorizes,  collects, and analyzes data to help it better manage and understand the  results of its efforts to protect GSA facilities and DHS concurred with our  recommendations. RAMP could be the vehicle through which FPS  implements these recommendations, but the use of inaccurate and  unreliable data will hamper performance measurement efforts.", "Furthermore, it is unclear whether FPS will meet the implementation goals  established in the program\u2019s proposed timeline. FPS began designing  RAMP in early 2007 and expects to implement the program in three  phases, completing its implementation by the end of fiscal year 2011.  However, in June 2008, we reported that FPS was going to implement a  pilot version of RAMP in fiscal year 2009, but in May 2009, FPS officials  told us they intend to implement the first phase in the beginning of fiscal  year 2010. Until RAMP components are fully implemented, FPS will  continue to rely on its current risk assessment tool, methodology, and  process, potentially leaving GSA and tenant agencies dissatisfied.  Additionally, FPS will continue to rely on its disparate workforce data  management systems and CERTS or localized databases that have proven  to be inaccurate and unreliable. We recently recommended that FPS  provide the Secretary of Homeland Security with regular updates on the  status of RAMP including the implementation status of deliverables, clear  timelines for completion of tasks and milestones, and plans for addressing  any implementation obstacles. DHS concurred with our recommendation  and stated that FPS will submit a monthly report to the Secretary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS\u2019s Actions to Improve Guard Management May Be Difficult to Implement and Maintain", "paragraphs": ["FPS took on a number of immediate actions with respect to contract guard  management in response to our covert testing.", "For example, in July 2009, the Director of FPS instructed Regional  Directors to accelerate the implementation of FPS\u2019s requirement that two  guard posts at Level IV facilities be inspected weekly.", "FPS, in July 2009, also required more X-ray and magnetometer training for  inspectors and guards. For example, FPS has recently issued an  information bulletin to all inspectors and guards to provide them with  information about package screening, including examples of disguised  items that may not be detected by magnetometers or X-ray equipment.  Moreover, FPS produced a 15-minute training video designed to provide  information on bomb component detection. According to FPS, each guard  was required to read the information bulletin and watch the video within  30 days.", "Despite the steps FPS has taken, there are a number of factors that will  make implementing and sustaining these actions difficult. First, FPS does  not have adequate controls to monitor and track whether its 11 regions are  completing these new requirements. Thus, FPS cannot say with certainty  that it is being done. According to a FPS regional official, implementing  the new requirements may present a number of challenges, in part,  because new directives appear to be based primarily on what works well  from a headquarters or National Capital Region perspective, and not a  regional perspective that reflects local conditions and limitations in  staffing resources. In addition, another regional official estimated that his  region is meeting about 10 percent of the required oversight hours and  officials in another region said they are struggling to monitor the delivery  of contractor-provided training in the region. Second, FPS has not  completed any workforce analysis to determine if its current staff of about  930 law enforcement security officers will be able to effectively complete  the additional inspections and provide the X-ray and magnetometer  training to 15,000 guards, in addition to their current physical security and  law enforcement responsibilities. According to the Director of FPS, while  having more resources would help address the weaknesses in the guard  program, the additional resources would have to be trained and thus could  not be deployed immediately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FPS Is Developing a Program to Standardize Equipment and Contracting", "paragraphs": ["FPS is also taking steps to implement a more systematic approach to  technology acquisition by developing a National Countermeasures  Program, which could help FPS leverage technology more cost-effectively.  According to FPS, the program will establish standards and national  procurement contracts for security equipment, including X-ray machines,  magnetometers, surveillance systems, and intrusion detection systems.  FPS officials told us that instead of having inspectors search for vendors  to establish equipment acquisition, installation, and maintenance  contracts, inspectors will call an FPS mission support center with their  countermeasure recommendations and the center will procure the  services through standardized contracts. According to FPS, the program  will also include life-cycle management plans for countermeasures. FPS  officials said they established an X-ray machine contract and that future  program contracts will also explore the use of the schedule as a source for  national purchase and service contracts. According to FPS, the National  Countermeasures Program should provide the agency with a framework to  better manage its security equipment inventory; meet its operational  requirement to identify, implement, and maintain security equipment; and  respond to stakeholders\u2019 needs by establishing nationwide resources,  streamlining procurement procedures, and strengthening communications  with its customers. FPS officials told us they believe this program will  result in increased efficiencies because inspectors will not have to spend  their time facilitating the establishment of contracts for security  equipment because these contracts will be standardized nationwide.", "Although the National Countermeasures Program includes improvements  that may enhance FPS\u2019s ability to leverage technology, it does not  establish tools for assessing the cost-effectiveness of competing  technologies and countermeasures and implementation has been delayed.  Security professionals are faced with a multitude of technology options  offered by private vendors, including advanced intrusion detection  systems, biotechnology options for screening people, and sophisticated  video monitoring. Having tools and guidance to determine which  technologies most cost-effectively address identified vulnerabilities is a  central component of the leveraging technology key practice. FPS officials  told us that the National Countermeasures Program will enable inspectors  to develop countermeasure cost estimates that can be shared with GSA  and tenant agencies. However, incorporating a tool for evaluating the cost- effectiveness of alternative technologies into FPS\u2019s planned improvements  in the security acquisition area would represent an enhanced application  of this key practice. Therefore, we recently recommended that FPS  develop a methodology and guidance for assessing and comparing the  cost-effectiveness of technology alternatives, and DHS concurred with our  recommendation.", "Another concern is that FPS had planned to implement the program  throughout fiscal year 2009, but extended implementation into fiscal year  2010, thus it is not clear whether FPS will meet the program\u2019s milestones  in accordance with updated timelines. Until the National Countermeasures  Program is fully implemented, FPS will continue to rely on individual  inspectors to make technology decisions. For example, FPS had  anticipated that the X-ray machine and magnetometer contracts would be  awarded by December 2008, and that contracts for surveillance and  intrusion detection systems would be awarded during fiscal year 2009. In  May 2009, FPS officials told us that the X-ray machine contract was  awarded on April 30, 2009, and that they anticipated awarding the  magnetometer contract in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and an  electronic security services contract for surveillance and intrusion  detection systems during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. We  recently recommended that FPS provide the Secretary of Homeland  Security with regular updates on the status of the National  Countermeasures Program, including the implementation status of  deliverables, clear timelines for completion of tasks and milestones, and  plans for addressing any implementation obstacles.

Therefore, we have used  our key protection practices as criteria to evaluate the security efforts of  other departments, agencies, and entities and have made  recommendations to promote greater usage of key practices in ensuring  the security of public spaces and of those who work at and visit them. For  example, we have examined how DHS and the Smithsonian Institution  secure their assets and identified challenges. Most recently, we evaluated  the National Park Service\u2019s (Park Service) approach to national icon and  park protection. We found that although the Park Service has  implemented a range of security program improvements in recent years  that reflected some aspects of key practices, there were also limitations.  Specifically, the Park Service (1) does not manage risk servicewide or  ensure the best return on security technology investments; (2) lacks a  servicewide approach to sharing information internally and measuring  performance; and (3) lacks clearly defined security roles and a security  training curriculum. With millions of people visiting the nation\u2019s nearly 400  park units annually, ensuring their security and the protection of our  national treasures is paramount. More emphasis on the key practices  would provide greater assurance that Park Service assets are well  protected and that Park Service resources are being used efficiently to  improve protection.", "FPS faces challenges that are similar, in many respects, to those that  agencies across the government are facing. Our key practices provide a  framework for assessing and improving protection practices, and in fact,  the Interagency Security Committee is using our key facility protection  practices as key management practices to guide its priorities and work  activities. For example, the committee established subcommittees for  technology best practices and training, and working groups in the areas of  performance measures and strategic human capital management. The  committee also issued performance measurement guidance in 2009.  Without greater attention to key protection practices, FPS will be ill  equipped to efficiently and effectively fulfill its responsibilities of  assessing risk, strategically managing its workforce and contract guard  program, recommending countermeasures, sharing information and  coordinating with GSA and tenant agencies to secure GSA buildings, and  measuring and testing its performance as the security landscape changes  and new threats emerge. Furthermore, implementing our specific  recommendations related to areas such as human capital and risk  management will be critical steps in the right direction. Overall, following  this framework\u2014adhering to key practices and implementing  recommendations in specific areas\u2014would enhance FPS\u2019s chances for  future success and could position FPS to become a leader and benchmark  agency for facility protection in the federal government.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our testimony.
