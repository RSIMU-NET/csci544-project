However, the Army did not fully complete certain tasks in accordance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Guidance to ensure that its FIP adequately considered the scope of efforts required for audit readiness. For example, the Army did not consider the risks associated with excluding current year activity associated with legacy systems and did not adequately identify significant SBR activity attributable to service provider business processes and systems. These activities may continue to represent material portions of future SBRs and, if not auditable, will likely affect the Army's ability to achieve audit readiness goals as planned.", "For GFEBS-related audit readiness activities within the scope of its FIP for budget execution, the Army documented controls in narratives and flowcharts and performed monthly tests to assess their effectiveness.

However, this analysis did not show the linkage of key  SBR financial statement line items to all significant assessable units  and therefore was incomplete. Specifically, the Army\u2019s analysis  focused only on obligations-incurred activity processed in GFEBS,  which, as of September 30, 2013, represented about 52 percent, or  $119 billion, of total reported General Fund obligations, as shown in  figure 2.", "Assessable units and related amounts associated with remaining  obligations incurred activity processed in non-GFEBS systems,  totaling $109 billion for fiscal year 2013, were not included in the  Army\u2019s analysis. Further, other SBR activity attributable to service  provider business processes and systems was also excluded.  According to Army officials, they excluded these amounts because of  the Army\u2019s expectation that (1) service providers will ensure the  readiness of their systems and processes and (2) the Army\u2019s reliance  on certain legacy systems will decline significantly in connection with  its further implementation of GFEBS. In addition, unobligated and  unpaid obligated amounts carried forward from prior years\u2014or  beginning balances\u2014were excluded from its analysis, which,  according to Army officials, was consistent with the March 2013 FIAR  Guidance revision to narrow the focus of initial audits to SBAs.  Further, Army officials indicated that devoting significant resources to  ensure the readiness of these legacy systems and beginning  balances was not cost effective, and accordingly, they excluded  efforts to ensure their auditability from the scope of the Army\u2019s  readiness strategy.", "The Army\u2019s consideration of the cost-effectiveness of its readiness  efforts is important.

In addition, documentation provided by FIAR  Directorate officials supporting the rationale for revising the FIAR  Guidance concerning beginning balances specifies that the revision  was not intended to affect Discovery Phase requirements. Further, the  FIAR Guidance also requires reporting entities to identify processes  and systems supporting existing \u201cas-is\u201d environments, in addition to  planned \u201cto-be\u201d environments associated with implementing new  financial systems. This requirement also recognizes the complexities  and challenges associated with implementing large-scale financial  systems, such as GFEBS, and the importance of identifying and  addressing risks associated with legacy systems and related business  processes. Addressing such risks is to be performed during Discovery  Phase Task 2 and is essential for developing a cost-effective  readiness strategy.", "Service provider assessable units and MOU. The Army\u2019s analysis  did not identify activity attributable to assessable units associated with  service provider business processes and systems, as required by the  FIAR Guidance, despite the significant impact they have on the  Army\u2019s SBR and its reliance on them to help achieve readiness. Also,  the Army had not established an MOU with its service providers to  formally document a shared understanding of roles and  responsibilities affecting audit readiness efforts as required by the  FIAR Guidance. For example, an MOU would include roles and  responsibilities for the authorization, initiation, processing, recording,  and reporting of transactions affected by the service provider,  including requirements for the retention of supporting documents.  Army officials stated they had established a Mission Work Agreement  with DFAS, a document that defines the terms of work, describing  various types of services DFAS provides to the Army, including those  associated with financial reporting, civilian and military pay, contract  pay, and other processes. However, it does not contain the level of  detail needed in an MOU to help ensure coordination, performance,  and accountability of the parties, such as a clear linkage between the  services described and specific control activities DFAS is required to  perform that affect the Army\u2019s financial reporting objectives. According  to Army officials, efforts to coordinate with service providers to obtain  sufficient information on their business processes and systems and  establish MOUs has been challenging as relationships and audit  readiness interdependencies with the service providers are very  complex. They also indicated that the FIAR Directorate has been  taking a lead role in coordinating efforts of service providers to help  facilitate the development of MOUs but that time frames for finalizing  them had not been determined.

Additional  details concerning these risks are highlighted below.", "Reliance on service providers. The Army relies heavily on service  providers, such as DFAS, to process accounting and payment  transactions as well as ensure the effectiveness of the controls and  information systems they use in providing support to the Army.", "Accordingly, the FIAR Guidance requires service providers to ensure the  readiness of their systems and business processes that have a material  impact on reporting entity SBRs. However, as previously discussed, the  Army\u2019s efforts to better understand and document complex relationships  and audit readiness interdependencies with service providers have not  been completed, hampering its ability to obtain sufficient information  concerning risks associated with their activities. Further, the Army\u2019s ability  to rely on service providers remains unclear since, as discussed later in  this report, IPA or DOD OIG assessments of the audit readiness of  service provider systems and processes have not been completed. As a  result, the Army is at increased risk that it may not meet its audit  readiness goals.", "Limitations in scope of audit readiness efforts. As previously  discussed, the Army\u2019s strategy did not include efforts to ensure the audit  readiness of (1) SBR beginning balances and (2) certain legacy systems  and business processes the Army relies on to support significant portions  of its SBR. Risks associated with these scope limitations, if not properly  addressed, could adversely affect the Army\u2019s ability to achieve audit  readiness goals as highlighted below.", "Beginning balances. The Army reported beginning balances (as of  October 1, 2012) of $44.3 billion and $138.7 billion for unobligated  and unpaid obligated balances, respectively, on its General Fund SBR  for fiscal year 2013, representing amounts associated with prior year  funding brought forward from fiscal year 2012. While the FIAR  Guidance provides for limiting the focus of initial audits to current year  budget activity and expenditures contained in SBAs, it does not  eliminate the requirement to identify and assess risks associated with  these beginning balances for achieving full SBR auditability.  Accordingly, assessing the extent to which amounts associated with  prior year funding may affect efforts to achieve this goal is essential.  Also, apart from the FIAR requirements, the Army continues to be  responsible for the accuracy of reported balances relating to current  and prior year budget activity in order to comply with appropriations  law, and to accurately report them by appropriation for inclusion in the  President\u2019s annual budget request. Recognizing the need to ensure  the accuracy of information contained in agency budget requests,  agencies are also required to include information in their audited  financial statements showing material differences between key  amounts contained in their SBRs and related amounts contained in  the President\u2019s Budget. However, the Army\u2019s most recent financial  statements for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 remain unaudited and,  importantly, do not provide information regarding material differences,  if any, between comparable amounts reported in its SBR and the  President\u2019s Budget. As a result, the extent to which the Army can  provide needed assurance regarding the accuracy of reported  balances and activity related to prior budget years contained in the  President\u2019s Budget is limited.", "Despite these requirements, Army officials told us that the Army had  not identified risks associated with beginning balances reported on its  SBR or assessed how and when efforts to prepare auditable SBAs  would result in full SBR audit readiness. Specifically, at the time of our  review, the Army had not determined how achieving audit readiness  would be affected by expenditures or other activity associated with  beginning balances that are expected to occur in future years. The  Army has various appropriated funds that are available for obligation  for 1, 2, 3, and 5 fiscal years. After these periods of availability expire,  the accounts remain open for 5 additional fiscal years to adjust or  liquidate obligations before the accounts are closed and any  remaining balances are canceled. For example, the fiscal year 2012  ending balances included five 3-year procurement appropriation  accounts containing $12.3 billion that had not been obligated for  payment, and $39.2 billion that the Army had obligated to pay but had  not yet disbursed. The Army will potentially be required to account for  these procurement appropriations into fiscal year 2019, beyond the  current audit readiness plan as well as the September 30, 2017,  deadline for achieving auditability of its full SBR and other financial  statements for fiscal year 2018. Additional analysis documenting and  supporting the Army\u2019s expectations concerning the extent to which  future SBRs may include significant activity and balances associated  with these multiyear appropriation funds would assist in assessing  risks that could impede audit readiness.", "Legacy systems. According to the FIAR Guidance, reporting entities  involved in system transformation initiatives are required to assess the  target dates of their to-be environments against their audit-ready  assertion dates to determine whether existing systems, to-be  systems, or both should be included in their current readiness efforts.  In this regard, based on transformation efforts associated with  implementing GFEBS and other key ERP systems intended to replace  certain existing legacy systems, the Army excluded tasks to ensure  the readiness of these legacy systems and related business  processes from the scope of its readiness efforts. The Army expects  the appropriation accounts that would continue to generate  transaction data from such systems to be expended or expired and  thus amounts would become immaterial over time. However, officials  told us that they were uncertain as to how continued reliance on these  systems may affect initial audits. For example, officials told us that a  timeline for transitioning funding for classified and other associated  activity from legacy systems to a GFEBS-based environment has not  been determined. Until this transition occurs, ongoing activity  accounted for in legacy systems could have a major impact on the  Army\u2019s SBAs and SBR. Also, processing billions of dollars in  unobligated balances and unpaid obligations in the Army\u2019s five  procurement appropriation accounts that are accounted for in legacy  systems as previously discussed could take several years. Therefore,  this ongoing activity will likely affect initial examinations of incremental  SBAs currently expected to begin with fiscal year 2015 as well as full  SBRs to be examined in subsequent years.", "Army officials acknowledged these risks and that the Army had not  documented its assessment of them. Despite the uncertainty associated  with how these risks may affect the auditability of the Army\u2019s incremental  SBAs and full SBRs, according to Army officials, the scope of their efforts  and plans for adhering to established audit readiness assertion and  examination milestones have remained unchanged. However, without  sufficient documentation identifying these risks and assessing their  potential impact on producing auditable SBAs and full SBRs within  established time frames, the Army is unable to provide needed assurance  that its strategy will achieve audit readiness or when it will be achieved.", "Further, as discussed earlier, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 requires that  DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan Status Reports include the Army\u2019s determination on  whether it will achieve an auditable SBR by September 30, 2014.  Recognizing the potential impact of audit readiness challenges, the NDAA  also requires that the FIAR Plan Status Report include an alternative date  for achieving SBR audit readiness if the Army determines that it is unable  to meet this deadline. However, the Army\u2019s determination, as presented  in the November 2013 FIAR Plan Status Report, did not meet these  requirements. Specifically, while the Army\u2019s determination stated that it  would achieve SBA audit readiness by September 30, 2014, it did not  address whether full SBR auditability would be achieved by that date or, if  not, clearly indicate an alternative deadline for doing so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Army Did Not Effectively Implement Key Tasks in Its Budget Execution FIP in Accordance with FIAR Guidance", "paragraphs": ["For those budget execution audit readiness activities the Army  determined to be within the scope of its FIP for budget execution, the  Army has made progress toward implementing the first three phases of  Discovery, Corrective Action, and Assertion/Evaluation.

According to  documentation provided by Army officials, the Army identified 16 of 66  systems as key systems affecting SBR audit readiness. This included  GFEBS and other systems used to process detailed transactions and  provide accounting data to be recorded in GFEBS, such as the Army\u2019s  key military pay system. Army officials told us that its determination  that a system was key was based on the number and value of  transactions initiated or processed by the system and by other factors,  such as whether the system would be replaced. While its  assessments were discussed in various meetings with FIAR  Directorate and DFAS officials, the Army did not document the  specific criteria and assessment process used to support its  determination.

Further, the Army has determined  that individual commands are responsible for the implementation of  controls within their command. Therefore, the effectiveness of controls  Army-wide depends largely on efforts to ensure that they are  operating effectively at each command. However, Army officials told  us that assessments of the effectiveness of controls at specific  commands were not always reliable. The results of assessments  performed by commands in 2012 using a checklist indicated that 64  percent of controls assessed were operating effectively. However,  Army officials stated that the checklist was to help commands  understand their roles and responsibilities, and acknowledged that the  Army could not rely on self-reporting by commands as a useful  measure of audit readiness. While a checklist can provide guidance  and assist in identifying weaknesses, officials at the commands we  visited told us that users may not be sufficiently knowledgeable to  accurately complete it. Also, officials at all three commands we visited  told us that their ability to review and assess the effectiveness of  controls has been hampered by a lack of funding and staffing. For  example, an official in the organization responsible for reviewing  control assessments at one command told us that its ability to perform  this function was limited because of a 34 percent vacancy rate in  staffing. In addition, this official told us that internal control  assessments prepared at the specific garrison level within a command  were not always reliable. Officials attributed this, in part, to those  preparing them not having appropriate skills or not performing  sufficient testing to adequately assess whether controls were  operating effectively.", "Command officials also explained that much of the information they  have on control assessments relates to results associated with the  Army\u2019s centralized testing of the operating effectiveness of manual  controls. In connection with this testing, the Army established a failure  rate of 5 percent or less as its goal for assessing the effectiveness of  controls. Results of this testing on the number of commands tested  through May 2013, when the Army was completing its Discovery  Phase efforts, indicated failure rates that averaged 56 percent, as  shown in figure 3.", "Army officials attributed the November 2012 drop in failure rates to 28  percent, in part, to the experience gained by the use of GFEBS by the  four commands that were tested that month. As indicated in figure 3,  beginning in January 2013, Army greatly expanded its testing to  include all remaining installations migrating to GFEBS. With the  substantial increase in new users, test results indicated failure rates  for January and February 2013 of 46 percent and 64 percent,  respectively. Also, the Army found that all the controls tested for  February and March 2013 (14 and 15 controls, respectively) were  operating ineffectively. As installations become more experienced with  GFEBS, the Army expects the failure rate to decrease.", "However, the methodology for the Army\u2019s centralized testing was  designed to produce reliable results Army-wide, and as command  officials pointed out, it was not designed to produce reliable  assessments of controls at the specific command level. Further, these  officials highlighted how Army-wide assessments can vary  significantly from more detailed assessments performed at the  command level. For example, controls tested for 6 of 15 Army  Reserve Command sample items associated with two business  processes (i.e., temporary duty travel and supply) were found to be  ineffective during the Army\u2019s February 2013 centralized testing  process, equating to a 40 percent failure rate. Army Reserve  Command conducted its own tests using a larger sample of 412 items  across eight business processes that resulted in a much higher (77  percent) failure rate. Command officials described plans for  performing additional assessments to better understand the  effectiveness of their controls; however, they acknowledged that  insufficient information on the effectiveness of controls has hampered  their ability to develop and execute appropriate corrective actions to  address control deficiencies.", "The FIAR Guidance requires reporting entities to document their  understanding of business processes, systems, and related control  activities with narratives, flowcharts, risk assessments, and internal  control worksheets. However, documentation describing Army SBR- related processes and systems was incomplete. The documentation  did not address complete end-to-end processes, including those  related to legacy systems and service provider activities and feeder  systems, thus limiting the Army\u2019s ability to perform complete control  assessments. Service providers are responsible for the systems  they operate and processes they perform on behalf of reporting  entities, and tasks for preparing process and system narratives and  assessing controls associated with four service providers are included  in the Army\u2019s FIP for budget execution. However, we found that the  Army had not completed these tasks and, as a result, did not have  sufficient information to effectively assess how service provider- related activities may affect its ability to achieve SBR audit readiness.  Army officials told us that except for DFAS, service providers had not  provided sufficient documentation of their control activities as required  by the FIAR Guidance. Such documentation is needed for a clear  understanding of how the Army\u2019s financial reporting objectives may be  affected by service provider controls and documentation. According to  the FIAR Guidance, to assess and provide assurance on the  effectiveness of their controls, service providers are to undergo  annual examinations in accordance with Statement on Standards for  Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a  Service Organization.", "Army officials told us that they are participating in a FIAR Directorate  working group established to direct and coordinate service provider- related audit readiness efforts.

In addition, Army officials told us that the group is working to  facilitate and monitor service provider efforts to prepare for SSAE   No. 16 examinations to be conducted by IPA firms to provide an  independent assessment on the effectiveness of service provider  control activities. Because of the Army\u2019s reliance on service provider  controls to achieve its General Fund SBR financial reporting  objectives, Army officials told us that their readiness efforts greatly  depend on the results of service provider SSAE No. 16 examinations.

However, for  actions taken through this date, we found that the Army\u2019s efforts did not  effectively address the FIAR Guidance requirements for the Corrective  Action Phase tasks for the budget execution FIP of identifying appropriate  corrective actions, validating their effectiveness, and adequately tracking  progress. As a result, the Army is at increased risk that problems  identified during the Discovery Phase may not be addressed and may  therefore hinder its ability to ensure that audit readiness goals are  effectively achieved.", "As defined in the FIAR Guidance, the Corrective Action Phase comprises  five tasks: (1) design of the audit-ready environment, to include  requirements for remediating deficiencies in internal controls and  supporting documentation; (2) development of corrective actions, to  include concrete corrective action plans (CAP) to resolve each deficiency  identified during the Discovery Phase; (3) development of resource  requirements, to include budget estimates of funding and staffing to  execute the CAPs; (4) execution of the CAPs, to include performing  procedures to verify that the CAPs have successfully remediated the  deficiencies; and (5) notification to the FIAR Directorate that the reporting  entity is ready for an examination of its assessable unit.

However,  for the Corrective Action Phase, the Army was unable to clearly  demonstrate the extent to which (1) CAPs had been developed containing  specific actions to resolve each identified deficiency (Task 2) and   (2) required actions had been completed and deficiencies had been  resolved (Task 4). These limitations resulted from a corrective action  strategy and related oversight activities that were not designed to provide  sufficient detail on corrective action efforts and to ensure their  effectiveness. Additional information on these limitations is discussed  below.", "Extent to which CAPs were developed to resolve identified  deficiencies unclear. The effectiveness of the Army\u2019s corrective  actions depends on its efforts to ensure the completeness and  effectiveness of CAPs containing specific actions planned to resolve  identified deficiencies and their underlying causes. Recognizing the  need to ensure the completeness of corrective actions and provide a  means for tracking their status, the FIAR Guidance requires reporting  entities to include corrective actions to resolve each deficiency  identified in the corrective action sections of their FIP status reports.  However, actions listed in the Army\u2019s report were not linked to specific  CAPs developed to address identified deficiencies, and as a result,  the Army\u2019s ability to demonstrate the completeness of its corrective  actions was limited. Rather than listing specific tasks or references to  specific CAPs, actions listed on the Army\u2019s report largely consisted of  references to specific control activities that were not effectively  implemented based on the results of monthly control testing. Further,  in many instances these references were outdated, as they cited  controls in existence prior to the Army\u2019s realignment of controls in  February 2013. Additionally, we found that the Army\u2019s FIP status  report did not include corrective actions for addressing other known  deficiencies and assessing the severity of each as a deficiency, a  significant deficiency, or a material weakness, as required by the  FIAR Guidance. For example, we found that the Army\u2019s FIP status  reports did not indicate the severity or include actions to correct  deficiencies associated with (1) service provider controls and  systems, (2) GFEBS system issues, and (3) the lack of supporting  documentation identified through substantive testing.", "In addition, the effectiveness of the Army\u2019s corrective actions for  resolving deficiencies largely depends on the effectiveness of its  discovery efforts. However, as previously discussed, the Army had not  effectively implemented Discovery Phase tasks, including efforts to  document processes and assess controls. Consequently, its ability to  ensure the effectiveness of corrective actions was limited. Further, we  found that CAPs at the command level were not always effective. For  example, at one of the commands we visited, corrective actions  contained in the commander\u2019s checklist were not specific enough to  address the extensive weaknesses reported. Command officials  explained that this occurred, in part, because sufficient efforts to  assess controls had not been completed to effectively determine the  causes of identified deficiencies, thus limiting their ability to develop  effective corrective actions to remediate the deficiencies. In addition,  command officials told us that other issues hampering their discovery  efforts also adversely affected their ability to effectively develop and  execute corrective actions. These issues included the lack of sufficient  resources and personnel with appropriate skills.", "Also, identifying the underlying causes of identified deficiencies is  essential for developing specific tasks to remediate them. As part of  its centralized monthly testing, the Army identified the reasons for  each sample-item failure and communicated them to affected  commands. In Leadership Briefs summarizing test results, the primary  reason provided for these failures was documents not being signed  and dated as evidence of review. However, other reasons contributed  to sample-item failures but the Army had not analyzed them to better  understand their relative significance and assist in identifying  underlying causes. Accordingly, we analyzed the reasons for the  failures for January 2013 through March 2013 by grouping them into  four categories based upon data provided at the time of our review in  May 2013. (See fig. 4.)", "Our analysis showed that over half of the failures identified were due  to supporting evidence not being provided. This category also  included samples for which a command had not provided a response   Officials  to requests for documentation within required time frames.at the three selected commands we visited told us that providing the  supporting documentation within 15 days as required by the Army\u2019s  monthly testing schedule was often difficult because they needed to  coordinate with other entities to obtain the documentation. Also, Army  officials stated that they have been analyzing the nonresponses to  better understand why they occurred and attributed them, in part, to  the need to more timely obtain documentation from third-party  stakeholders, such as DFAS. They also acknowledged that some  deficiencies extended across commands and, in some instances,  were outside the control of individual commands. For example,  command officials told us that their test failures sometimes resulted  from following the Army\u2019s guidance for executing business process  activities that had not been updated to reflect changes in procedures  resulting from previously implemented systems changes. However,  the ability to assess the extent to which the Army\u2019s corrective actions  are targeted at addressing the underlying causes contributing to  sample-item failures is limited as corrective actions to address  identified deficiencies were not linked to specific tasks or references  to specific CAPs.", "Extent to which required actions were completed and effective  unclear. Recognizing the need for information to measure efforts to  execute corrective actions, the FIAR Guidance requires reporting  entities to (1) verify that CAPs have been effectively implemented and  have remediated identified deficiencies and (2) update FIP status  reports to reflect corrective action progress each month. These  updates are to include any scope and timeline changes resulting from  their efforts. However, we found that the Army was unable to  effectively demonstrate its verification that CAPs had been effectively  implemented. This occurred because corrective actions listed in its  FIP status report were not linked to CAPs containing specific tasks  and time frames for their completion to remediate deficiencies. Army  officials explained that the Army was relying on the results of its  centralized monthly control testing as its primary means to monitor the  effectiveness of corrective actions. These results indicated failure  rates of 56 percent on average, raising questions concerning the  effectiveness of the Army\u2019s corrective actions. Further, while such  results may be a useful indicator of progress, they do not identify the  root causes for testing failures or provide needed assurance that  deficiencies have been resolved. Verification that tasks have been  completed and have effectively remediated deficiencies would enable  the Army to better demonstrate that it has sufficient assurance  concerning the effectiveness of its efforts.", "In addition, the Army\u2019s progress toward completing corrective actions  as reported in its FIP status reports was not accurate and the  reliability of its estimates for completing them was unclear.  Specifically, Army status reports indicated the status of many  corrective action tasks as zero percent complete. According to Army  officials, this status was based largely on results associated with its  monthly control testing. They also explained that although the Army  has been working on corrective actions since 2011, it had difficulties  in estimating interim percentages to accurately reflect the extent of  progress achieved. In addition, Army FIP status reports indicated that  corrective actions would be completed by March 2014. This estimate,  according to Army officials, was based largely on dates previously  established to meet audit readiness assertions. However, since the  Army\u2019s reported progress and estimates for completing corrective  actions are not linked to CAPs containing specific actions already  taken and time frames for completing those still remaining to  remediate deficiencies, their accuracy and reliability remain unclear.", "According to its corrective action strategy, the Army placed responsibility  on commands to resolve identified deficiencies. However, the limitations  we identified resulted from insufficient oversight steps to clearly  demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of the Army\u2019s efforts to  resolve deficiencies within planned time frames. Such steps would  include linking corrective actions on its FIP status report to CAPs  containing specific tasks required to resolve identified deficiencies and  their underlying causes and time frames for their completion.

These  actions include identifying and defining service providers\u2019 responsibilities,  systems, and controls; assessing risks and additional feeder systems;  and updating its FIP status reports to accurately reflect the status of its  current and planned efforts. Generally, these actions, if effectively  implemented, will help improve the Army\u2019s implementation of its General  Fund SBR FIP for budget execution and facilitate remaining efforts to  achieve SBR audit readiness.", "The Army\u2019s comments did not fully address our recommendation that the  Army update its determination for achieving SBR audit readiness included  in DOD\u2019s FIAR Plan Status Report. Specifically, as indicated in its  comments, the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer\u2019s determination  included in the May 2014 FIAR Plan Status Report stated that most of the  Army is well postured to achieve audit readiness of the Schedule of  Budgetary Activity by September 30, 2014. The Schedule of Budgetary  Activity is expected to reflect the amount of budgetary resources and  associated activity related only to funding approved on or after October 1,  2014, and therefore represents an incremental step building toward an  audit-ready SBR. As discussed in our report, the NDAA for Fiscal Year  2013 included requirements for the FIAR Plan Status Report to include a  determination by the Chief Management Officer of each military  department concerning its ability to achieve an auditable SBR by  September 30, 2014, and, if unable to meet this deadline, provide an  explanation as to why it is unable to meet the deadline as well as an  alternative deadline and a description of the plan for achieving an  auditable SBR by the alternative deadline. The Army\u2019s response did not  address the deadline for full SBR auditability, and the May 2014 FIAR  Plan Status Report does not presently comply with the NDAA  requirements. Updating the FIAR Plan Status Report as required would  provide Congress and DOD decision makers with important information  on DOD\u2019s progress toward meeting auditability and financial management  improvement goals.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Secretary of the Army, and  the Chief Management Officer of the Army.

To address our objectives, we reviewed the Department  of Defense (DOD) FIAR Guidance and selected provisions of the National  Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) for fiscal years 2013 and 2010 to  understand the methodology the Army is required to use, and related  responsibilities, for achieving audit readiness. We analyzed the Army\u2019s  FIP to determine whether it contained elements, such as audit readiness  tasks, required by the FIAR Guidance for the portions of the Discovery,  Corrective Action, and Assertion/Evaluation Phases completed at the time  of our review.
