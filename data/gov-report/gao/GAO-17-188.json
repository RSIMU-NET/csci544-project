GAO also reviewed documentation and interviewed regulatory staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal financial regulators reported conducting the required regulatory analyses for rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) as part of the rulemaking process. For example, of the 30 rules GAO reviewed, which became effective between July 2015 and July 2016, the regulators analyzed the paperwork burden imposed for 12 rules for which they determined this analysis was required. For the remaining 18 rules, they determined that this analysis was not required or applicable. For instance, in some cases they determined that no new collection of information was required. As independent regulatory agencies, the federal financial regulators are not subject to executive orders requiring federal agencies to conduct detailed cost-benefit analysis in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, but regulators told GAO that they generally follow this guidance in spirit. GAO reviewed five of the nine rules considered major\u2014that is, rules likely to result in an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more, among other things\u2014and found that regulators addressed most key elements of OMB guidance in their regulatory analyses. For instance, these agencies generally quantified some costs related to these rules. However, they did not quantify benefits in each rule and noted data and other limitations to doing so. In 2011, GAO recommended that the regulators more fully incorporate OMB's regulatory guidance into their written rulemaking policies, but not all regulators have implemented this recommendation.", "Regulators reported coordinating, as required or voluntarily, on 19 of the 30 rules GAO reviewed. The Dodd-Frank Act and the rulemaking process did not require regulators to coordinate on the remaining 11 rules. GAO focused in particular on coordination efforts involving three rulemakings: the Commodity Futures and Trade Commission's and the prudential regulators' rules on margin requirements for over-the-counter swaps, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection's (CFPB) rule on integrated mortgage disclosures. For the swaps rules, regulators coordinated domestically and internationally and, according to regulators, they largely harmonized their respective rules. For the integrated mortgage disclosure rule, CFPB followed its internal guidance for coordinating with relevant agencies throughout the rulemaking process.", "The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain because some of its rules have not been finalized and insufficient time has passed to evaluate others. As of December 2016, regulators had issued final rules for about 75 percent of the 236 provisions of the act that GAO is monitoring. Using recently released data, GAO updated indicators from its prior reports, including those that monitor systemic risk characteristics of large U.S. bank holding companies. These indicators track changes in characteristics of these companies such as size, interconnectedness, leverage, and liquidity since the passage of the act to examine if the changes have been consistent with the goals of the act. While changes in the indicators are not necessarily evidence of the impacts of the act's provisions, trends in indicators suggested large bank holding companies have become larger but less vulnerable to financial distress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no new recommendations but continues to monitor the implementation of five prior recommendations intended to improve, among other things, financial regulators' cost-benefit analysis, interagency coordination, and impact analysis associated with Dodd-Frank regulations.

Many of the  rulemakings include some form of regulatory analysis, which provides a  formal way of organizing evidence to help in understanding the potential  effects of new regulations. Certain statutes and executive orders require  varying regulatory analyses, and the extent to which independent  regulatory agencies, such as some of the federal financial regulators  (financial regulators), are subject to the requirements varies. For  example, Executive Order (E.O.) 12,866 requires executive federal  agencies to assess costs and benefits of proposed regulatory action and  any alternatives. This order does not apply to independent regulatory  agencies such as banking, securities, or futures regulators, or the Bureau  of Consumer Financial Protection (commonly known as the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB). However, CFPB has a separate  requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act to consider the potential benefits  and costs to consumers and covered persons as part of a rulemaking  under a federal consumer financial law.

This report discusses  the regulatory analyses conducted by the federal financial regulators  in their Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings, including their assessments of  which rules they considered to be major rules;  the coordination between and among federal regulators on these  rulemakings; and  indicators of the impact of selected Dodd-Frank Act provisions and  their implementing regulations on financial market stability.", "To examine the regulatory analyses conducted by the federal financial  regulators, we focused our analysis on the final rules issued pursuant to  the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective from July 23, 2015, through  July 22, 2016, a total of 30 rules (see app. II). To identify the rules, we  used a website maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that  tracks Dodd-Frank Act regulations.

We reviewed federal statutes, regulations, and GAO  studies on these rules as well as Federal Register releases that contain  information on the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) and  Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) analyses conducted by agencies and  their coordination efforts.  For PRA and RFA analyses, we reviewed  Federal Register releases of the final rules for the regulator\u2019s  determinations about whether they were required to conduct the analyses  and the results of the analyses. Using GAO\u2019s Federal Rules database, we  found that 9 of the 30 rules were identified as major rules, per the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, under the Congressional  Review Act. We developed a data collection instrument to compare and  assess the regulatory analyses conducted for a judgmental sample of five  of the major rules against the principles outlined in OMB Circular A-4,  which provides guidance to federal agencies on the development of  regulatory analysis.

We also updated our  indicators monitoring the extent to which certain swap reforms are  consistent with the act\u2019s goals of reducing risk. For those parts of our  methodology that involved the analysis of computer-processed data from  Bloomberg, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Federal Reserve,  the National Information Center, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,  we assessed the reliability  of these data by reviewing relevant  documentation and electronically testing the data for missing values,  outliers, and invalid values.

PRA analysis on  all of the 12 rules included a discussion of the analysis the agencies performed and provided estimates of the paperwork burden on entities.  For instance, for the joint rule on the registration and supervision of  appraisal management companies, the regulators provided estimates on  the total number of states and appraisal management companies affected  and estimated total burden hours for reporting and recordkeeping  requirements for these entities. In another rule, CFPB determined that  permitting electronic filing of reports would result in a minimal one-time  burden associated with a new method of submission but it estimated  savings over time due to the reduction of paper filings each year. The rule  allows land developers to choose whether to submit certain filings, such  as annual reports, either by paper or via electronic means.

In some cases, they determined that they were not  required to conduct regulatory analyses pursuant to PRA because they  determined no new collection of information would be required. For  instance, CFTC\u2019s rule on trade options stated that for PRA, CFTC  determined that the final rule would not impose any new information  collection requirements that require OMB\u2019s approval under PRA. In other  cases, the agencies determined that the PRA was not applicable. For  example, the Federal Reserve\u2019s rule on unfair or deceptive acts or  practices stated that the final rule contains no requirements subject to the  PRA.", "Under the RFA, when an agency proposes a rule that would have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, the  rule must be accompanied by an impact analysis, known as an initial  regulatory flexibility  analysis (IRFA) when it is published for public  comment.

It conducted the regulatory flexibility  analysis and estimated the number of affected entities in certain  mortgage transactions and the benefits and costs to small entities. For 6  rules, the regulators conducted a FRFA and concluded that the rule would  not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  entities. For example, the Federal Reserve, in a rule that established  minimum margin and capital requirements for certain swap entities,  considered the potential impact on small entities in accordance with a  FRFA, and based on its analysis, believed that the rule would not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.", "For 10 rules, the regulators stated that RFA was not applicable. For  example, CFPB stated in its rule amending certain filing requirements  under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act that because no  notice of proposed rulemaking is required, RFA does not require an initial  or final regulatory flexibility  analysis. In another example, FDIC  determined that its rule on assessments relates directly to the rates  imposed on insured depository institutions for deposit insurance. For this  reason, it determined that the requirements of RFA do not apply.

In doing so, each regulator  provided a basis supporting its certification. For example, SEC\u2019s rule on  business conduct standards for swap dealers and participants noted that  because (1) large financial institutions generally were the entities  engaged in the dealing activity involving security-based swaps, and (2)  major security-based swap participants were not small entities, its  security-based-swap entity registration rules and forms, as adopted,  would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of  small entities for purposes of RFA.", "Finally, of the 30 regulations that were issued and became effective  between July 23, 2015, and July 22, 2016, the agencies identified 9 as  being major rules.

For example, the preamble stated that the higher  degree of harmonization between various regulators and jurisdictions  in the final rule should result in lower administrative costs.  Additionally,  CFTC stated that longer lead times for industry to build  compliance systems provided in the final rule will result in less  operational error and costs.", "The joint rule on margin and capital requirements for uncleared swaps  estimated the annual cost associated with initial margin requirements  that will be required of U.S. swap entities and their counterparties  once the requirements are fully implemented to range from $672  million to roughly $46 billion, depending on the specific initial margin  estimate and incremental funding costs that is used to compute the  estimate.

SEC discussed direct compliance costs paid by  registrants that are subject to the pay ratio disclosure. For example,  SEC estimated that the average initial cost of compliance for a  registrant with foreign operations is expected to be approximately  $700,000 and for a registrant with U.S.-based operation only is  expected to be approximately $150,000. In its pay ratio disclosure  rule, SEC allows a company, in identifying the median employee, to  use a cost-of-living adjustment for employees living in a jurisdiction  other than the jurisdiction in which the chief executive officer resides.  Thus, where a company has employees in countries whose cost-of- living differs from the cost-of-living in the chief executive officer\u2019s  country of residence, the cost-of-living adjustment may have an effect  on the determination of the median employee and on the calculation  of the pay ratio. SEC noted that it was limited in its ability to quantify  the impact of the adjustment on the pay ratio calculation by lack of  data on the countries where employees are located, the actual  distribution of employee pay and the specific cost-of-living measure  used. SEC stated that it qualitatively  analyzed the main factors that  may contribute to more significant effects of the cost-of-living  adjustment on the determination of the median employee  compensation and on the calculation of the pay ratio. It found that the  effect of the cost-of-living adjustment could be potentially larger for  registrants with a larger percentage of employees outside the chief  executive officer\u2019s country of residence and for registrants with  employees in countries with a cost-of-living that differs significantly  from the chief executive officer\u2019s country of residence.", "In addition, two of the five rules quantified some benefits and all of the  rules included some qualitative information on benefits, such as their  nature, timing, likelihood, location, and distribution. In one example,  CFPB quantified some benefits in connection with its integrated  disclosure rule. For example, CFPB estimated that the rule could result in  savings of $130 million per year for employee time saved for mortgage  transactions and stated that most of these savings are likely to be passed  on to consumers. FDIC\u2019s assessment rule also quantified some benefits.  FDIC stated that it will collect approximately $10 billion in surcharges and  award approximately $1 billion in credits to small banks, although actual  amounts will vary from these estimates. The three remaining rules did not  quantify benefits and noted data and other limitations to not doing so.", "The five rules provided a discussion of some qualitative benefits. FDIC\u2019s  rule on assessments stated that imposing surcharges on assessments so  that the deposit insurance fund reaches its target reserve ratio promptly  strengthens the fund more quickly so that it can better withstand an  unanticipated spike in losses from bank failures or the failure of one or  more large banks. FDIC stated that reaching the target ratio early also  reduces the risk of the banking industry facing unexpected, large  increases in assessment rates in a period of stress. In another example,  SEC stated in its rule on pay ratio disclosures that providing additional  executive compensation information to shareholders provides new data  points that shareholders may find relevant and useful when exercising  their certain voting rights. However, SEC also stated that it could not  quantify in monetary terms the benefit to shareholders. SEC stated that  pay ratio disclosure is not tied to an immediate economic transaction,  such as a sale of a security, and that the pay ratio disclosure is but one  data point among many considerations that shareholders might find  relevant when exercising their say-on-pay votes."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators Coordinated on Rulemakings as Required", "paragraphs": ["The agencies reported coordinating as required or voluntarily on 19 of the  30 regulations that became effective between July 23, 2015, and July 22,  2016.

CFTC staff said that one of the goals of  coordinating with the other regulators was to harmonize the rules to the  extent possible and avoid the potential for regulatory arbitrage. Staff  from CFTC and the banking regulators noted that the coordination  process allowed them to resolve several areas where they had  differences.

In their respective final rules,  CFTC and the prudential regulators came to a similar position regarding  whether to allow entities to comply with comparable margin requirements  in a foreign jurisdiction. The prudential regulators\u2019 rule permits certain  swap entities to comply with a foreign regulatory framework for non- cleared swaps if the regulators jointly determine that the foreign  regulatory framework is comparable to the regulators\u2019 rule. Similarly,  CFTC allows entities, under certain circumstances, to rely on compliance  with a foreign jurisdiction\u2019s margin requirements if CFTC determines they  are comparable to CFTC\u2019s.

Both final  rules require swap entities covered by the rules to collect and post  variation margin for uncleared swaps with affiliates on the same basis as  for nonaffiliated counterparties. However, the final rules are different with  respect to the collection of initial margin for interaffiliate transactions.  While the prudential regulators\u2019 rule does require a swap entity to collect  initial margin from an affiliate, subject to a threshold amount, CFTC  generally does not impose a similar requirement to collect initial margin  from an affiliate (although it stipulates such swaps must be subject to a  centralized risk-management program that is designed to monitor and to  manage the risks associated with such transactions). CFTC\u2019s Chairman  said in his statement of record that interaffiliate transactions are  transactions within the consolidated entity, and not with a third party. As  such, they do not increase the overall risk exposure of the consolidated  entity.

CFTC and two banking  regulators\u2019 staff noted that it was unclear at this time as to whether this  difference in the final rules was going to affect interaffiliate transactions.  Two regulators said the regulators will need to monitor potential effects as  the margin rules are implemented.

This set of indicators may shed light on changes in the use  of margin collateral associated with Dodd-Frank Act swap reforms as they  are implemented, but the indicators have several key limitations, as  described later in this section.", "Our margin indicators measure the fair value of collateral pledged by  counterparties to secure over-the-counter derivatives contracts as a  percentage of net current credit exposure for those counterparties for  bank holding companies. To protect itself from the loss it would incur if a  counterparty defaulted on a derivatives contract, a swap entity could  require counterparties to post margin collateral in an amount equal to or  greater than its exposure to the contracts. An increase in collateral as a  percentage of credit exposure suggests that holding companies have  required their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against  their credit exposure due to derivatives contracts overall, which would be  consistent with the purposes of the act\u2019s swap reforms.", "Figure 2 shows trends in our margin indicators from the second quarter of  2009 through the second quarter of 2016. The rate of collateralization of  net current credit exposure for all counterparties has increased from  about 71 percent in the third quarter of 2010 to about 91 percent in the  second quarter of 2016, suggesting that holding companies generally  required their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against  their derivatives contracts.

However, the rate of collateralization consistently  differed by the type of counterparty, with hedge funds consistently posting  more collateral as a percentage of credit exposure than other types of  counterparties. As we reported in December 2013, according to OCC, the  rates differ partly because swaps dealers may require certain  counterparties to post both initial and variation margin and other  counterparties to post only variation margin. Under the prudential  regulators\u2019 2015 final rule and CFTC\u2019s 2016 final rule for uncleared  swaps, minimum floors are set for both initial and variation margins and  as a result, the final rules may further contribute to higher rates of  collateralization.", "Our margin indicators, while suggestive, are subject to important  limitations. First, they do not identify causal links between changes in  collateralization and the Dodd-Frank Act, including its regulations. Rather,  the set of indicators tracks changes in collateralization since the act\u2019s  passage to examine if the changes were consistent with the act\u2019s goals  for increasing collateralization. Second, both net current credit exposure  and the fair value of collateral are as of a point in time because the fair  values of derivatives contracts and collateral can fluctuate over time.  Third, an average collateralization of 100 percent does not ensure that all  current counterparty exposures have been eliminated because one  counterparty\u2019s credit exposure may be overcollateralized and another\u2019s  undercollateralized. Fourth, our indicators measure the fair value of the  collateral held against net current credit exposures but do not necessarily  measure the risk of uncollateralized losses. The fair value of net current  credit exposure does not fully account for the riskiness of any single swap  contract. If a party has entered into riskier swaps, it is possible for the rate  of collateralization to increase while the risk of uncollateralized losses  also increases. Fifth, our indicators are market aggregates that may not  reflect the collateralization rate for any single company. Finally, these  indicators do not reflect collateralization rates for companies, such as  stand-alone broker-dealers, which have credit exposure to counterparties  in over-the-counter derivatives contracts but are not affiliated with a bank  holding company."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CFPB, Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC,  NCUA, SEC, and CFTC for review and comment.

This report discusses the  regulatory analyses conducted by federal financial regulators  (financial regulators) in their Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings, including  their assessments of which rules they considered to be major rules; coordination between and among federal regulators on these  indicators of the impact of selected Dodd-Frank Act provisions and  their implementing regulations on financial market stability.", "The financial regulators are the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection,  also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve),  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA),  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC).", "To examine the regulatory analyses conducted by the regulators, we  focused our analysis on final rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act  that were effective between July 22, 2015, and July 23, 2016, a total of 30  rules (see app. II). We compiled these rules from a website maintained by  the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that tracks Dodd-Frank Act  regulations, which we corroborated with officials from the agencies under  review. In examining the regulatory analyses of the agencies in our  review, we reviewed federal statutes, regulations, GAO studies, and other  material to identify the regulatory analyses the agencies had to conduct  as part of their Dodd-Frank rulemakings, focusing on those analyses  required under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and the Regulatory  Flexibility Act (RFA). We reviewed Federal Register notices of final rules  for the agencies\u2019 determinations of the applicability of PRA and RFA. In  some instances, the regulators determined that the analysis was not  required or not applicable and indicated this in their final rulemaking. Two  analysts recorded the agencies\u2019 determination of whether PRA and RFA  were required in a spreadsheet. Using GAO\u2019s Federal Rules database,  we found that 9 of the 30 rules were identified as major rules, per the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, under the  Congressional Review Act because they resulted in or are likely to result  in an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more; a major  increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition,  employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.- based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic  and export markets. For agencies subject to Executive Order (E.O.)  12,866, such major rules would be considered significant regulatory  actions and subject to formal cost-benefit analysis.", "We also developed a data collection instrument to compare and assess  the regulatory analysis conducted for the major rules against the  principles outlined in OMB Circular A-4, which provides guidance to  federal agencies on the development of regulatory analysis. To conduct  our analyses, we reviewed Federal Register releases of the final rules  and the cost-benefit analyses they included in the final rules, and we  interviewed agency staff from CFPB, CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve,  FDIC, NCUA, and OCC. We selected five rules for in-depth review,  comparing the cost-benefit or similar analyses to specific principles in  OMB Circular A-4. To narrow the list from 9 major rules to the 5 rules  subject to in-depth review, we selected rules that were from a variety of  agencies, including one joint rule, and that covered varied topics. In  conducting each individual analysis, we reviewed Federal Register  notices prepared by agencies during the course of the rulemaking.", "To examine interagency coordination among the regulators, we reviewed  the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Register releases, and GAO reports to  identify the interagency coordination and consultation requirements for  the 30 rules in our scope. As part of this review, analysts looked for key  words relating to consultation and coordination in the Federal Register  releases and recorded this information in a spreadsheet. An attorney then  independently evaluated each determination documented in the  spreadsheet to reach concurrence on the assessment. (See app. III  for a  list of rules and determination of whether coordination was required). We  also interviewed officials or staff from CFPB, CFTC, SEC, FDIC, NCUA,  the Federal Reserve, and OCC to identify changes in the nature of  interagency coordination and consultation. We also asked the financial  regulators\u2019 staff to identify any instances of interagency coordination not  specified in the Federal Register releases, and if they did not coordinate,  to discuss the reasons why. We did not examine the effects of  noncoordination on rulemakings, which was beyond the scope of our  review.", "We also selected three rules for in-depth review of interagency  coordination: CFTC\u2019s and the prudential regulators\u2019 respective rules on  margin requirements for uncleared swaps and CFPB\u2019s rule on integrated  mortgage disclosures. We selected these rules based on the opportunity  for extensive interagency coordination. We selected the rules on margin  requirements for uncleared swaps because the prudential regulators and  CFTC issued rules that required coordination among the prudential  regulators as well as between the prudential regulators and CFTC. We  selected the integrated mortgage disclosure rule because of CFPB\u2019s  requirement to consult with the appropriate prudential regulators and  other federal agencies on consistency with prudential, market, or  systemic objectives administered by such agencies before proposing a  rule. We interviewed the responsible agencies to discuss the outcomes of  coordination and specific areas where coordination or harmonization of  rules was a priority and obtained documentation of specific examples of  interagency coordination and consultation.", "To analyze the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on financial market stability,  we updated several indicators developed in our prior reports with data  through the second quarter of 2016. The indicators display trends in both  banks that are systemically important financial institutions (bank SIFI) and  nonbank financial institutions designated by the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) for supervision by the Federal Reserve. We  updated indicators monitoring changes in size, interconnectedness,  complexity, leverage, and liquidity of bank SIFIs. Since we began  developing and tracking indicators for bank SIFIs, FSOC has designated  three nonbank institutions for enhanced supervision by the Federal  Reserve. As such, we updated indicators developed in our December  2015 report that are associated with the size, interconnectedness,  leverage, and liquidity of these institutions. Finally, we updated our  indicators that monitor the extent to which certain swap reforms are  consistent with the act\u2019s goals of reducing risk. For those parts of our  methodology that involved the analysis of computer- processed data from  Bloomberg, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Federal Reserve,  the National Information Center, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,  we assessed the reliability  of these data by reviewing relevant  documentation and electronically testing the data for missing values,  outliers, and invalid values. We determined the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes of monitoring changes in bank SIFIs and  designated nonbanks and assessing the amount of margin collateral that  over-the-counter derivatives counterparties used.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to December 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

However, other factors\u2014including the economic downturn,  international banking standards agreed upon by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), and monetary policy actions\u2014 also affect bank holding companies and, thus, the indicators. These  factors may have a greater effect on bank SIFIs than the Dodd-Frank Act.  In addition, some rules implementing provisions related to bank SIFIs  have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. Thus, changes in our  indicators include the effects of these rules only insofar as bank SIFIs  have changed their behavior in response to issued rules and in  anticipation of expected rules.

Also, asset size alone is not an  accurate determinant of systemic significance because an institution\u2019s  systemic significance also depends on other factors, such as its  complexity and interconnectedness. Furthermore, some bank SIFIs are  U.S.-based bank holding company subsidiaries of foreign banking  organizations, and the size of these bank SIFIs may not reflect the  potential for the parent company\u2019s financial distress to affect the financial  system and the economy.", "We observed the following changes in our size indicators over the period  from the third quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2016 (see table 9):", "The number of bank SIFIs decreased by one between the third  quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2016.

We developed  two indicators of liquidity: (1)\u2014short-term liabilities as a percentage of  total liabilities and (2) liquid assets as a percentage of short-term  liabilities. Short-term liabilities reflect an institution\u2019s potential need for  liquidity in the immediate future. We measure short-term liabilities as the  sum of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, trading  liabilities (less derivatives with negative fair value), other borrowed funds,  deposits held in foreign offices, and jumbo time deposits (deposits of  $100,000 or more) held in domestic offices. Liquid assets are assets that  can be sold easily without affecting their price and, thus, can be  converted easily to cash to cover debts that come due. Accordingly, liquid  assets as a percentage of an institution\u2019s short-term liabilities are a  measure of an institution\u2019s capacity to meet potential upcoming  obligations. We measure liquid assets as the sum of cash and balances  due from depository institutions, securities (less pledged securities),  federal funds sold and reverse repurchases, and trading assets.", "A limitation of both indicators is that they do not include off- balance-sheet  liabilities, such as callable derivatives or other potential derivatives-  related obligations. The second indicator also does not include off-  balance-sheet liquid assets, such as short-term income from derivative  contracts.
