However, CBP\u0092s Office of Internal Affairs (IA) does not have a mechanism to maintain and track data on which of its screening tools (e.g., background investigation or polygraph examination) provided the information used to determine which applicants were not suitable for hire. Maintaining and tracking such data is consistent with internal control standards and could better position CBP IA to gauge the relative effectiveness of its screening tools. CBP IA is also considering requiring periodic polygraphs for incumbent officers and agents; however, it has not yet fully assessed the feasibility of expanding the program. For example, CBP has not yet fully assessed the costs of implementing polygraph examinations on incumbent officers and agents, including costs for additional supervisors and adjudicators, or factors such as the trade-offs associated with testing incumbent officers and agents at various frequencies. A feasibility assessment of program expansion could better position CBP to determine whether and how to best achieve its goal of strengthening integrity-related controls for officers and agents. Further, CBP IA has not consistently conducted monthly quality assurance reviews of its adjudications since 2008, as required by internal policies, to help ensure that adjudicators are following procedures in evaluating the results of the preemployment and periodic background investigations. CBP IA officials stated that they have performed some of the required checks since 2008, but they could not provide data on how many checks were conducted. Without these quality assurance checks, it is difficult for CBP IA to determine the extent to which deficiencies, if any, exist in the adjudication process.", "CBP does not have an integrity strategy, as called for in its Fiscal Year 2009-2014 Strategic Plan.

In particular, there have been a number of cases in which  individuals, known as infiltrators, pursued employment at CBP solely to  engage in mission-compromising activity. For example, in 2007, a CBPO  in El Paso, Texas, was arrested at her duty station at the Paso Del Norte  Bridge for conspiracy to import marijuana into the United States from  June 2003 to July 2007, and was later convicted and sentenced to 20  years in prison. OFO reported that she may have sought employment  with CBP to facilitate drug smuggling. CBP officials view this case as an  example of the potential impact of corruption\u2014if the officer had  succeeded in facilitating the importation of 5,000 pounds of marijuana per  month, this would amount to a total of 240,000 pounds over 4 years with  a retail value of $288 million dollars. In another case, a former BPA  previously stationed in Comstock, Texas, was arrested in 2008 for  conspiracy to possess, with intent to distribute, more than 1,000  kilograms of marijuana. The agent was convicted in 2009 and sentenced  to 15 years in prison and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. CBP is also  concerned about employees who may not be infiltrators, but began  engaging in corruption-related activities after joining the agency. For  example, CBP IA officials stated that some employees may have  experienced personal hardships after being hired, such as financial  challenges, which made them vulnerable to accepting bribes to engage in  corrupt activity.

Because we selected a nonprobability sample  of sites, the information we obtained from these interviews and visits  cannot be generalized to all OFO, USBP, and CBP IA field locations.", "However, observations obtained from these visits provided us with a  greater understanding of CBP\u2019s integrity-related initiatives.", "To evaluate CBP\u2019s integrity strategy, including how the agency  incorporates lessons learned from prior misconduct and corruption cases,  we reviewed documentation on integrity initiatives from CBP IA, OFO,  and USBP, as well as from the Integrity Integrated Planning and  Coordination Committee (IPCC), which CBP convened in 2011 as a  forum to discuss integrity-related issues and ideas and to share standard  practices among the members. In particular, we analyzed these  documents against the requirements set forth in the CBP Fiscal Year  2009-2014 Strategic Plan. In addition, we analyzed all available  postcorruption analyses reports, which identify deficiencies that may have  enabled CBP employees to engage in corruption-related activities,  against OFO and USBP program requirements. We interviewed officials  in Washington, D.C., from the Office of Policy and Planning, CBP IA,  USBP, OFO, and IPCC, as well as officials during our site visits,  regarding CBP\u2019s integrity strategy and the extent to which CBP is using  lessons learned from prior corruption and misconduct cases to guide  changes in policies and procedures, as appropriate.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2011 to December  2012, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kathryn Bernet, Assistant  Director; David Alexander; Nanette J.
