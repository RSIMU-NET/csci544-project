GAO's findings focused on seven countries where network activities reportedly occurred."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The United States has advocated several multilateral actions to counter nuclear proliferation networks. Although multilateral bodies have adopted some U.S. proposals, they have not adopted others. For example, the United States negotiated passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution that obligated all member states to adopt laws and regulations prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It also led the development of watch lists of nuclear technologies that are not formally controlled by states and formation of a multilateral unit intended to analyze covert nuclear trade activities. However, one multilateral body has not adopted two key U.S. proposals made in 2004 to commit its members to add new restrictions on exporting sensitive nuclear technologies. Also, one multilateral organization has not adopted a recommendation for member states to provide it with more export data that would allow it to better detect covert nuclear activities. The impact of U.S. bilateral assistance to strengthen countries' abilities to counter nuclear networks is uncertain because U.S. agencies do not consistently assess the results of this assistance. The impact of this assistance is difficult to determine because the Department of State did not evaluate either (1) the proliferation risk for all of the countries in which network activities are alleged to have occurred or (2) the results of its assistance efforts. Between 2003 and 2006, State and the Department of Energy provided about $9 million to improve the export controls of seven countries in which nuclear proliferation network activities reportedly occurred. State did not evaluate either (1) the proliferation risk for all of the countries in which network activities are alleged to have occurred or (2) the results of its assistance efforts. State did not perform risk analyses for 11 of the 56 countries in its program for those years and did not document the basis for each country's proliferation threat level or explain how the risk analyses were done. Of the six countries in our study to which State provided assistance, State performed risk analyses for five. Also, State did not conduct program assessments for about 60 percent of its participating countries and for two of the six countries in our study that received assistance. Moreover, while State's program assessments characterize a country's export control system and its weaknesses, they do not assess how U.S. training efforts contributed to correcting weaknesses. Relevant U.S. agencies are impaired from judging their progress in preventing nuclear networks because they cannot readily identify basic information on the number, nature, or details of all their enforcement activities involving nuclear proliferation. The U.S. government identified the prevention of nuclear proliferation as a high priority. U.S. agencies collect information, maintain lists of companies and individuals that they sanction, and maintain case files on investigations of suspected violations of U.S. law. However, most of these agencies cannot readily identify which enforcement activities involve nuclear proliferation as they cannot ensure that searching their case file databases for words, such as nuclear, would reveal all relevant cases."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the United States has tried to impede the efforts of state-run  nuclear proliferation networks that provide equipment or components to  nuclear weapons development programs in countries such as Pakistan,  India, Iraq, and more recently, North Korea and Iran. These networks use  business and commercial practices to circumvent national and  international restrictions against procuring the technologies necessary for  developing nuclear weapons programs. The A.Q. Khan nuclear  proliferation network, operated by the former head of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear  weapons program, was the first private network to be run for profit rather  than state purposes. The exposure of the network in 2003 illustrated how  determined proliferators can effectively avoid export controls to acquire  sensitive nuclear-related and dual-use technologies, which are  technologies that can have both commercial and military applications. The  network also highlighted the role that companies in several countries  unwittingly played in facilitating sales as suppliers of technology or points  of transit.

First, the United States has conducted activities with  multilateral bodies such as the United Nations (UN), the Nuclear  Suppliers Group (NSG), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  and the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to help curtail nuclear  proliferation. Second, it has provided bilateral assistance in the form of  training and equipment to foreign governments to help them establish or  strengthen laws and regulations to control exports of technology that  could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Principal U.S. programs  include the Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance  Program (EXBS) and the International Nonproliferation Export Control  Program (INECP), which are managed by the Departments of State and  Energy, respectively. Third, on the national level, U.S. laws control the  export of dual-use items from the United States to other countries. The  U.S. government enforces these laws through activities such as  inspections and investigations that may result in criminal or administrative  penalties.", "We examined the (1) status of U.S. efforts to strengthen multilateral  controls to counter nuclear proliferation networks, (2) impact of U.S.  bilateral assistance to help other countries improve their legal and  regulatory controls against nuclear proliferation networks, and (3) impact  of U.S. efforts to strengthen its national enforcement activities to combat  nuclear proliferation networks.", "To meet these objectives, we reviewed program documentation and  interviewed knowledgeable officials from key U.S. agencies: the  Departments of Commerce, Defense (DOD), Energy, Homeland Security  (DHS), Justice, State, and Treasury.

These include Malaysia, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Singapore,  South Africa, Turkey, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We  did not travel to these countries because State cited foreign policy  sensitivities of ongoing diplomatic discussions in these countries. It is  important to note that the level of cooperation State provided on this  review was erratic and resulted in a delay of several months in completing  our work. Nonetheless, with information available from other sources, we  were able to address the review\u2019s objectives. For the purposes of this  report, we reviewed U.S. programs and activities that involved export  controls and their enforcement, as nuclear networks typically engage in  acts that violate or circumvent national and international export controls.

The  regime also includes multilateral and national assistance programs and  national export controls and laws.", "Entered into force on March 5, 1970, NPT obligates nuclear weapon states  not to transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices to any  recipient, and not to assist, encourage, or induce any nonnuclear weapon  state to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other  nuclear explosive devices. Under the treaty, each nonnuclear weapon state  pledges not to receive, manufacture, or otherwise acquire nuclear  weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and not to seek or receive  assistance in their manufacture. NPT also obliges each nonnuclear  weapon state to accept comprehensive international safeguards, including  inspection, through agreements negotiated with IAEA. The intent of these  safeguards is to deter and detect the diversion of nuclear material for  nuclear explosive purposes.", "Relevant U.S. assistance programs on export and border controls include  EXBS and INECP.

On a national level, the United States endeavors to  counter nuclear proliferation by enforcing laws that control the export of  materials\u2014including dual-use items\u2014that could be used to make a  nuclear weapon and by applying criminal or administrative penalties to  proliferators. The Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice,  State, and Treasury have responsibilities for enforcing various laws that  relate to nuclear proliferation. The U.S. government\u2019s control over the  export of defense nuclear and dual-use items is primarily divided between  two departments\u2014State and Commerce, respectively. Support for  enforcement activities comes primarily from Commerce, through its  Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement; DHS,  through its Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE); and Justice, through the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) and the United States Attorneys Office.

For example, in May 2004, NSG noted its concern over the  discovery of a covert international proliferation trafficking network,  through which sensitive nuclear-related equipment had found its way to  Libya. To address this concern, the United States developed national  procurement watch lists for all supplier states as a means to help block  further procurement of nuclear-relevant items that are not formally  controlled by placement on export control lists. To slow down North  Korea\u2019s and Iran\u2019s work on their nuclear programs, the watch lists focus  on items of interest to those countries, according to Energy.

However,  officials from both programs said some positive change occurred during  this period. For example, officials from both EXBS and INECP cited some  improvements in assistance recipients\u2019 export controls that occurred after  training or other types of assistance were provided. In 2006, after  exchanges and consultations regarding licensing and regulations with  EXBS program officers, Pakistan strengthened its export controls by  further expanding its control lists, according to State officials. In addition,  officials reported that Malaysia, UAE, and Pakistan drafted export control  legislation during the period of EXBS engagement in each of these  countries. Pakistan passed its export control law in 2004.", "Furthermore, INECP officials reported that their engagement with  Singapore has led its government to amend its control list to adhere to all  the multilateral control lists, and INECP also helped Pakistan complete  adoption of the European Union control list.

This makes it difficult  for agencies to determine the level of resources expended in countering  nuclear proliferation networks, as well as the results obtained from these  efforts. Since 2005, Commerce and ICE have taken steps to facilitate more  reliable identification of their enforcement activities involving nuclear  proliferation.", "Most of the agencies engaged in export control enforcement activities\u2014 DHS, Justice, and Treasury\u2014could not readily produce reliable data  representing their respective agency\u2019s enforcement actions related to  nuclear proliferation. Enforcement data, such as data collected on  inspections, seizures, investigations, arrests, indictments, and penalties  applied, were often stored according to the law that had been violated or  by a category or code describing the item corresponding to the  enforcement action, such as the type of good seized. Consequently,  agencies compiling enforcement data related to nuclear proliferation often  depended on conducting searches of agency databases using key words  (e.g., \u201cnuclear\u201d) or key codes (e.g., the ICE code for dual-use items is \u201c06\u201d).  An accurate compilation of such data depends on several factors,  including (1) selecting appropriate key words or key codes for searching  the database, (2) use of appropriate words or codes to describe the nature  of the enforcement action when agency officials record it in the database,  and (3) mandatory completion of the data fields that would identify the  enforcement action as being related to nuclear proliferation. For example,  we asked agencies engaged in export control enforcement activities for  data on their activities related to nuclear proliferation, with the following  results:    CBP compiled data on enforcement activities (seizures) related to nuclear  proliferation by engaging in keyword searches of its database. However, a  CBP official noted there is not a specific category for dual-use seizures, so  these seizures would not be included in the statistics. Moreover, the  official stated that one would need to look beyond seizures, for example to  inspections, to get a complete picture of CBP activities conducted to  combat nuclear proliferation. However, CBP does not have data on  inspections conducted for nuclear or WMD proliferation purposes unless  the inspection led to a seizure of goods or involved nuclear material,  according to DHS officials.", "ICE performed a key-code search of its database to produce statistics on  closed investigations involving nuclear proliferation. An ICE official said  the statistics that ICE compiled likely undercounted the number of  investigations involving nuclear proliferation because there is not one  single code agents can use to represent nuclear proliferation cases. Rather,  there are multiple codes that represent nuclear proliferation, but agents  are not required to enter all of them. The ICE official concluded that it  would be difficult to correctly identify all nuclear proliferation-related ICE  investigations.", "In response to our request for enforcement statistics, FBI produced two  conflicting sets of statistics on open investigations related to nuclear  proliferation. One Bureau official noted that identifying enforcement  actions related to nuclear proliferation is not straightforward; rather, it  requires Bureau analysts to interpret information about the enforcement  action to judge whether it involves nuclear proliferation. In technical  comments on a draft of this report, Justice stated that FBI has a  classification which defines proliferation investigative activities. This  classification can be used to search the FBI\u2019s automated case system to  determine the exact number of investigative activities and obtain a report  on the nature and details of these activities, according to Justice. However,  two FBI officials told us that it is not possible to search the database to  identify all cases related to nuclear proliferation. Compiling data such as  the number of cases involving nuclear proliferation and deciding whether  cases are related to WMD or nuclear proliferation requires an  interpretation of the data.", "Finally, Justice (Executive Office for United States Attorneys) stated its  case management database could not sort cases according to nuclear  proliferation networks, nuclear proliferation, or WMD proliferation, due to  the way the data are stored, but can sort export enforcement data.", "Furthermore, some agencies that maintain lists of individuals and  companies that have violated export control laws or engaged in WMD  proliferation could not identify which parties were placed on the lists for  nuclear proliferation reasons. For example, Treasury, which maintains a  specially designated nationals list containing the individuals and entities  that have been designated under its Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s  (OFAC) various sanctions programs, reported it cannot identify all  entities that have been placed on the list for nuclear proliferation reasons.  Treasury officials said that they maintain records on the rationale for  placing an entity on the list, but do not necessarily denote the type of  WMD proliferation entities are engaged in or support. In addition,  Treasury confirmed that none of the entities publicly identified in relation  to the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network appears on the specially  designated nationals list or in the Annex to Executive Order 13382.  Commerce stated that it does not maintain readily available information  that would allow it to identify individuals or entities placed on its denied  persons list for nuclear proliferation reasons. This list includes individuals  and entities that have been denied export privileges. In contrast, State  reported periodically to Congress that, between 2003 and 2006, it had  sanctioned foreign persons for engaging in nuclear proliferation activities  with Iran or Syria.", "Several agencies stated they use their enforcement data to make resource  allocation decisions. However, without enforcement data that accurately  reflect actions taken to prevent nuclear proliferation, agencies would not  be able to make informed resource decisions. Without the ability to  reliably identify their enforcement activities involving nuclear  proliferation, it is difficult for agencies to accurately track the amount of  time and resources expended in countering nuclear proliferation  networks, as well as the results obtained from these efforts. Most of these  agencies lack performance metrics for assessing the results obtained from  their efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. In contrast, federal  standards for internal control state that management should have  procedures in place to create performance indicators, monitor results,  track achievements in relation to agency plans, and ensure adequate  communications with external stakeholders that may significantly impact  achieving the agency\u2019s goals.", "Since 2005, two agencies have taken steps to facilitate more reliable  identification of their enforcement activities involving nuclear  proliferation. In fiscal year 2005, Commerce began classifying enforcement  data to identify enforcement actions involving nuclear proliferation. In  June 2007, an ICE official proposed modifying ICE\u2019s case data collection  process to more precisely identify investigations involving nuclear  proliferation.

U.S. persons and entities are prohibited from  providing support to these proliferators and can be punished with criminal  or civil penalties if they are found to be in violation of this prohibition. The  executive order is designed to cut off support to proliferators from front  companies, financiers, logistical supporters, and suppliers. As of June 15,  2007, 43 persons or entities were on Treasury\u2019s specially designated  nationals list pursuant to the executive order.", "Second, the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005  increased the maximum penalties that can be imposed on certain export  control violations from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation. Maximum prison  sentences increased from 10 years to 20 years. However, according to  Commerce statements, these increased penalties are not high enough to  deter violators or to provide incentives for violators to cooperate with law  enforcement. The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export  Enforcement recently noted that significantly increased penalty provisions  are needed.", "Third, the congress enacted a law that that increased penalties and the  executive branch drafted a legislative proposal intended to further  increase penalties and provide some new authorities for one enforcement  organization. The International Emergency Economic Powers  Enhancement Act was enacted into law on October 16, 2007, and  increased the civil and criminal penalties applicable to the violation of  OFAC sanctions. In addition, the executive branch drafted a legislative  proposal, the Export Enforcement Act of 2007, to revise and enhance the  Export Administration Act (EAA) and be in effect for 5 years after the  date of its enactment. The legislative proposal would increase penalties for  export control violations while enhancing Commerce\u2019s law enforcement  authorities to combat illicit exports of dual-use items. For example,  criminal penalty amounts in the proposal would be increased to $1,000,000  per violation or a fine and imprisonment for not more than 10 years, for  each violation by an individual, and $5,000,000 or up to 10 times the value  of the exports involved, whichever is greater, per violation by a person  other than an individual. The civil penalty amounts would be increased to  $500,000 for each violation of EAA or any regulation, license, or order  issued under that act. According to Commerce, the increased penalty  amounts would provide an enhanced deterrent effect.

We agree with State\u2019s comment that its program planning takes into  account other information, including open source information,  diplomatic reporting from posts, intelligence community products, and  assessments and information from other U.S. government agencies. We  have added language to the report to reflect this.  4.  State commented that EXBS officials have access to and factor into  their planning process assessments by other U.S. agencies, such as  Energy\u2019s INECP which receives some EXBS funding. While we  commend such interagency collaboration, we note that any Energy  program assessments are relevant only to its training and courses  provided in support of EXBS, not to the EXBS program as a whole.  Furthermore, the evidence that State provided in its meetings with us,  its written response to our questions, and its EXBS strategic plan  discusses interagency coordination in planning, but not in assessing  the contributions made by the EXBS program to particular countries.  5.  We disagree with State\u2019s comment that risk analyses have been  conducted and documented for each country that received or is  receiving assistance under EXBS and that we based our findings solely  on the EXBS strategic plan. In addition to the strategic plan, we relied  on State\u2019s written response to questions we posed on the subject and  meetings with State EXBS officials. As we stated in our report, the  EXBS strategic plan did not identify a risk level for 11 of the 56  countries to which it provided assistance between fiscal years 2003  and 2006.  6.  We disagree with State\u2019s comment that our report was inconsistent  because it included information on EXBS assistance to six of the seven  countries where A.Q. Khan network activity was reported to have  occurred as well as other countries receiving EXBS assistance. We  included statistical information on the total number of EXBS program  assessments to place the data on the seven countries into an overall  perspective.  7.  We partially agree with State\u2019s comment that it would be more clear to  say that the EXBS country risk assessment summary did not include  two of the countries in which network activities are alleged to have  occurred. We cannot confirm State\u2019s assertion that a risk analysis was  done for one of these countries. State provided no documentation to  support this point.  8.  We disagree with State\u2019s comment that the absence of a country from  the risk summary table in the EXBS strategic plan does not mean a risk  analysis was not done. State provided no evidence that it had  conducted a risk analysis for this country, and the State official  designated to speak for the program said there was no documentation  for the analyses.  9.  We disagree with State\u2019s comment that State subsequently requested  and received missing program assessment data in December 2006 that  the contractor had not initially provided to support assessment results.  State provided no evidence to support this comment and it directly  contradicts information provided to us by the cognizant State official.  10. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that its EXBS program assessments  generally highlight the relationship between assistance efforts and  progress in specific countries. In a written response to our questions in  February 2007, State highlighted the difficulties in doing so. Also,  during the course of our review, State said that EXBS does not  systematically track information on changes to a country\u2019s laws for the  purpose of showing the effectiveness of the EXBS program because it  is difficult analytically to create a good design for doing so.  Nonetheless, State said in its comments on a draft of this report that  formal reassessments of countries are needed to more accurately and  regularly measure progress.  11. We disagree that State made a sincere and good faith effort to  cooperate with our review of nuclear proliferation networks. The level  of cooperation State provided on this review was erratic and resulted  in a delay of several months in completing our work. While State  agreed after months of negotiation to facilitate our proposed travel to  Vienna, it did not do so within any acceptable time frames and delayed  providing some requested documents for several months. Nonetheless,  with information available from other sources, we were able to  address the review\u2019s objectives.  12. These findings were not directed to State. The agencies to which they  were directed did not raise a concern about access to classified  information and none of these agencies disagreed with our  recommendation.  13. State commented that our draft should note that Pakistan passed its  export control law in 2004. We have added this language to the report.  14. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that referring to PSI as a  multilateral body ascribes a formality to the PSI that does not exist and  that the U.S. has never sought to create. Given our previous classified  report on PSI, we would not ascribe any more formality to PSI than  appropriate. We recognized that this lack of formality contributed to  management deficiencies in U.S. PSI activities, and congress legislated  in Public Law 110-53 that corrective action be taken.  15. We agree with State\u2019s statement that certain states or their  governments were not involved in proliferation network activities; only  private entities in these countries were reported to have been allegedly  involved in proliferation network activities in open sources. We  included clarifying language, accordingly.  16. We disagree with State\u2019s comment that we should report that more  than 80 countries are PSI participants. As we reported in an  unclassified section of our report on PSI, State did not provide us with  documentation to demonstrate any precise number of countries that  expressed support for PSI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The following are GAO comments on the Department of Treasury\u2019s letter dated October 24, 2007.", "paragraphs": ["1.  We disagree with Treasury\u2019s statement that because the scope of our  study covered countries where A.Q. Khan operated, it likely skewed the  results. The request for our review directly asked us to assess the U.S.                    government response to the A.Q. Khan network. Therefore, it was                    methodologically appropriate to focus on countries where such network                    activities reportedly occurred and would have been fruitless to focus a                     review of the U.S. response to nuclear networks on countries where                    such activity has not occurred.  2.  We disagree with Treasury\u2019s assertion that it is able to identify which of  its designations are related to nuclear proliferation and could similarly  identify any civil penalties imposed based on the violation of OFAC  sanctions. Treasury officials stated to us that they could not conduct a  keyword search to identify entities that had been designated for nuclear  proliferation reasons. One official emphasized that Treasury lacks the  ability to definitively identify whether a given entity was designated for  nuclear proliferation reasons. Treasury officials noted that they keep  records on the rationale for an entity\u2019s designation, but they do not  necessarily record what type of WMD proliferation the entity is involved  in, if any. Despite its assertion, Treasury could not readily retrieve this  information when we requested it and did not provide us with a  complete list of entities designated for nuclear proliferation reasons.  3.  Treasury\u2019s statement that it can and does identify which entities have  been designated for nuclear proliferation reasons at the time of  designation misses our point. It stated that entities or individuals  designated under Executive Order 13382 are listed on OFAC\u2019s web site  and specially designated nationals\u2019 list with the specific identification of  \u201cNPWMD.\u201d During our review, Treasury could not readily retrieve this  information specifically for nuclear proliferation designations.  4.  In commenting on our finding that Treasury did not designate entities  publicly identified with the A.Q. Khan network, Treasury stated that its  designation decisions involve an interagency process that identifies,  assesses, and prioritizes targets. Given the absence of these names,  Treasury\u2019s statement suggests that the interagency process did not  identify and assess entities of the A.Q. Khan network as priority targets.  5.  We agree with Treasury\u2019s comment on the footnote on OFAC\u2019s sanctions  programs and have added clarifying language, accordingly.  6.  We have modified the language in the draft to reflect Treasury\u2019s  comment.  7.  We have changed this language, accordingly.  8.  We believe that the language of our draft accurately reflects the meaning  of Treasury\u2019s proposed rewording in a more concise fashion. Thus, we  have not modified the language of our report.  9.  We have modified language in the report to reflect Treasury\u2019s updated  information on enactment of the International Emergency Economic  Powers Enhancement Act."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Muriel J.
