It also reviews (1) the nature and purpose of activities that had been initiated under TARP as of March 27, 2009; (2) the Department of Treasury's Office of Financial Stability's (OFS) hiring efforts, use of contractors, and progress in developing an internal control system; and (3) TARP performance indicators. For this work, GAO reviewed signed agreements and other relevant documentation and met with officials from OFS, contractors, and federal agencies. As of March 27, 2009, Treasury had disbursed $303.4 billion of the $700 billion in TARP funds. Most of the funds (almost $199 billion) went to purchase preferred shares of 532 financial institutions under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), Treasury's primary vehicle under TARP for stabilizing financial markets."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has continued to improve the integrity, accountability and transparency of TARP. For example, it recently expanded monthly surveys of the largest institutions' lending activity to cover all CPP participants, as GAO recommended. These surveys should provide additional important information about how the capital investments are impacting participants' lending activities and capital levels. Treasury also continues to develop a process to monitor compliance with the terms of the agreements but has not yet hired asset managers. Treasury officials told GAO that these managers will have a role in helping ensure that institutions were honoring dividend and stock repurchase requirements. In February 2009, Treasury announced its broad strategy for using the remaining TARP funds and in the following weeks provided details for its major components. While articulating its plan was an important step, Treasury continues to struggle with developing an effective overall communication strategy that is integrated into TARP operations. Without such a strategy, Treasury may face challenges should it need additional funding for the program. Finally, as Treasury finalizes the terms of the agreement with American International Group, Inc. (AIG) for $30 billion in additional assistance, it should require that AIG seek additional concessions from employees and existing derivatives counterparties, as appropriate. GAO's January 2009 report also included recommendations about OFS's management infrastructure, including hiring, contract oversight, and internal controls. Treasury has continued to take steps to address GAO's recommendations. First, it has continued to hire additional permanent staff to address OFS's long-term organizational needs. Second, Treasury has enhanced its capacity to manage vendors by using trained oversight personnel and looking for opportunities to use fixed-price arrangements. Further actions are needed to complete its review of existing vendor conflict-of-interest mitigation plans and to improve documentation of decisions relating to potential conflicts. Third, OFS continued to refine, develop, and document its internal control framework over financial reporting and compliance, including its risk assessment activities. However, GAO noted that certain internal control procedures and the guidance pertaining to determining warrant exercise prices had not been updated to be consistent with actual practice. GAO also noted that Treasury had not publicly reported that through March 20, 2009, it had received dividends totaling almost $2.9 billion from TARP participants. Further steps in these areas are needed to improve the program's transparency and integrity. GAO again notes the difficulty of measuring the effect of TARP's activities. Developments in the credit markets have generally been mixed since the January 2009 report. Some indicators revealed that the cost of credit has increased in interbank and corporate bond markets and decreased in mortgage markets, while perceptions of risk have declined in interbank and mortgage markets and risen in corporate debt markets. In addition, although Federal Reserve survey data suggest that lending standards remained tight, the largest CPP recipients extended roughly $245 billion in new loans to consumers and businesses in both December 2008 and January 2009, according to the Treasury's new loan survey. However, attributing any of these changes directly to TARP continues to be problematic because of the range of actions that have been and are being taken to address the current crisis. While these indicators may be suggestive of TARP's ongoing impact, no single indicator or set of indicators can provide a definitive determination of the program's impact."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  (the act) was signed into law.

We  also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from OFS  responsible for selecting financial institutions to participate in CPP.  Additionally, we contacted officials from the four federal banking  regulators\u2014the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and the Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS)\u2014to obtain information on their process for reviewing  CPP applications, the status of pending applications, and their  examination process for reviewing uses of CPP funds and compliance with  TARP requirements. Also, we have developed an approach to determine  the extent to which the review and approval process for CPP applications  has been consistently applied across financial institutions. Specifically, we  have collected documentation supporting all funding decisions for the  period covering October 28, 2008, through January 31, 2009, and are in the  process of reviewing these decisions. For SSFI and TALF, we reviewed  program revisions and agreements, as appropriate, and contacted officials  from OFS.", "To describe Treasury\u2019s efforts to preserve homeownership, we reviewed  announcements, fact sheets, and program guidelines issued by Treasury  and held meetings to discuss these documents with OFS. To describe how  Treasury estimated the cost of the loan modification program and the  number of borrowers it expected to reach, we reviewed written  explanations of OFS\u2019s projections. To discuss the cross-agency effort to  design and plan the implementation of the loan modification program, we  reviewed Financial Agent Agreements that Treasury executed with Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac, and met with representatives of Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Federal  Housing Administration (FHA), OCC, and OTS.", "To assess the progress of OFS\u2019s hiring efforts, we reviewed OFS\u2019s  workforce planning documents, updated organizational chart, and OFS job  announcements posted on USAJOBS.

In addition, we met with  a variety of Treasury and OFS officials to discuss their approach to staffing  the office in the near and long terms and their strategies for recruiting  qualified individuals. We also discussed Treasury\u2019s efforts to coordinate its  recruitment and hiring efforts, including its use of human capital  flexibilities, with officials from the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM).", "To assess OFS\u2019s use of contractors and financial agents to support TARP  administration and operation for the period of January 21 through March  13, 2009, we reviewed information from Treasury for new   (1) contracts and financial agency agreements and (2) task orders,  modifications, and amendments involving ongoing contracts and financial  agency agreements. We also identified any small and/or disadvantaged  business contractors or subcontractors providing TARP services and  supplies. To obtain information concerning (1) the progress of ongoing  actions taken by OFS and Treasury in response to our recommendation to  improve oversight of TARP contractors and financial agents and (2) OFS\u2019s  reliance on contractors and financial agents to perform a range of  professional and financial services in support of key TARP programs, we  reviewed applicable documents and interviewed officials from Treasury  and two TARP contractors and one financial agent. To assess OFS\u2019s  progress responding to our recommendation for addressing potential  conflicts of interest for new contractors and financial agents, we reviewed  solicitation and contract documentation describing organizational and  personal conflicts-of-interest issues and mitigation plans to address those  issues. We interviewed officials and senior managers from Treasury and  the TARP contractors and financial agent to obtain information on OFS\u2019s  and contractor\u2019s policies and processes to ensure compliance with TARP  conflicts of interest requirements.", "To assess the status of internal controls related to TARP activities and the  status of TARP\u2019s consideration of accounting and reporting topics, we  reviewed documents provided by OFS and conducted interviews and made  inquiries with officials from OFS, including the Chief Financial Officer,  Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Cash Management Officer, Director of  Internal Controls, and their representatives. Additionally, we made  inquiries with contractor personnel, including PricewaterhouseCoopers.  To evaluate selected internal control activities related to the CPP and SSFI  programs, we designed tests using the OFS\u2019s process flows, narratives,  risk matrices, and high-level operational procedures. For CPP, we made a  statistical selection of 45 unique transactions for the 4 months ending  January 31, 2009, using a monetary unit sampling (probability  proportionate to size) methodology. For this sample, we tested selected  CPP control activities related to asset purchases and dividend receipts.  For SSFI, we tested the only SSFI transaction completed as of March 27,  2009, including selected control activities related to dividends.", "In our initial report under the mandate, we identified a preliminary set of  indicators on the state of credit and financial markets that might be  suggestive of the performance and effectiveness of TARP. We consulted  Treasury officials and other experts and analyzed available data sources  and the academic literature. We selected a set of preliminary indicators  that offered perspectives on different facets of credit and financial  markets, including perceptions of risk, cost of credit, and flows of credit to  businesses and consumers.  We assessed the reliability of the data upon  which the indicators are based and found that, despite certain limitations,  they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To update the indicators  in this report, we primarily used data from the Federal Reserve. As these  data are widely used, including by GAO and the Federal Reserve, and are  considered to be a reliable and often definitive source for banking sector  data, we conducted only a limited review of the data but ensured that the  trends we found were consistent with other research. We also relied on  data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Inside Mortgage  Finance, Treasury, and Global Insight. We have relied on CBOE and  Global Insight data for past reports, and we determined that, considered  together, these auxiliary data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  presenting and analyzing trends in financial markets. The data from  Treasury\u2019s survey of lending at the top 20 CPP recipients (as of December  31, 2008) are based on internal reporting from participating institutions,  and the definitions of loan categories may vary across banks. Because the  data are unique, we are not able to benchmark the origination levels  against historical lending or seasonal patterns at these institutions. Based  on discussions with Treasury and our review of the data, we found that the  data are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of documenting trends in  lending. The survey data will prove valuable for more thorough analyses of  lending activity in future reports.", "We plan to continue to monitor the issues highlighted in our prior reports,  as well as future and ongoing capital purchases, other more recent  transactions undertaken as part of TARP, and the status of other aspects  of TARP.

They noted that asset managers  will have a limited role in the area of executive compensation. To date,  they had not yet hired any asset managers. Without a more structured  mechanism in place, and with a growing number of institutions  participating in the program, ensuring compliance with these important  aspects of the program will become increasingly challenging.

Institutions with  less than $100 billion in risk-weighted assets do not have to complete a  stress test but are also eligible to obtain capital under CAP. In a process  similar to the one used for CPP, institutions interested in CAP must submit  their CAP applications to their primary banking regulators by May 25,  2009. The regulators are to submit recommendations to Treasury regarding  an applicant\u2019s viability. CAP is currently available only to publicly traded  institutions, but Treasury is developing terms for privately held  institutions, subchapter S-corporations, and mutuals.", "All approved institutions will have 6 months to raise capital from the  private sector, or Treasury will purchase convertible preferred shares to  help the institution absorb losses and raise private capital. Any capital  investments made by Treasury under CAP will be managed by a separate  entity\u2014the Financial Stability Trust. Under CAP, an institution can receive  an investment of 1 to 2 percent of its risk-weighted assets. These  institutions can also receive additional capital to redeem senior preferred  shares issued under CPP, enabling them to replace the existing preferred  shares with convertible preferred shares. If applicable, the proceeds from  the sale of the convertible preferred also may be used to redeem the  preferred stock sold to Treasury under TIP. Issuance of the convertible  preferred stock to Treasury under CAP is considered Tier 1 regulatory  capital for holding companies and a \u201cqualified equity offering\u201d for CPP  purposes. In addition, the issuance of convertible preferred stock in  excess of 1 to 2 percent of the institution\u2019s risk-weighted assets may be  available on a case-by-case basis and will constitute \u201cexceptional  assistance\u201d requiring additional terms and conditions. CAP convertible  preferred stock shares will carry a 9 percent dividend yield that may  increase to 20 percent if the necessary shareholder approvals are not  received by the 6-month anniversary after issuance. Subject to the  approval of the primary bank regulator, such shares can be redeemed at  their face value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends prior to 2 years.  These shares are convertible into common stock at a price equal to 90  percent of the average closing price for the 20 trading-day period ending  February 9, 2009. The convertible preferred stock mandatorily converts  to common equity after 7 years, and after the mandatory conversion date,  Treasury must make reasonable efforts to sell, on an annual basis, an  amount of common stock equal to at least 20 percent of the amount of  stock owned on the mandatory conversion date.", "Under CAP, Treasury will also receive warrants to purchase a number of  shares of common stock of the financial institution equaling 20 percent of  the convertible preferred stock amount on the date of the investment. If  any necessary shareholder approvals are not received, the exercise price  will be reduced by 15 percent of the original exercise price on each 6- month anniversary of the issue date of the warrants, subject to a  maximum reduction of 45 percent of the original exercise price. Treasury  requires that participants be subject to restrictions on executive  compensation, payment of common stock dividends, repurchase of shares,  and cash acquisitions. Institutions also must comply with Treasury rules,  regulations, and guidance regarding executive compensation,  transparency, accountability, and monitoring, as published and in effect at  the time of the investment closing. In addition, as part of the application  process institutions must submit a plan showing how they intend to use  this capital to support their lending activities and how lending will  increase over what would have been possible without government  assistance. Collecting this information from CAP applicants addresses  concerns we raised in our January report about the need to ensure an  appropriate level of accountability and transparency for those institutions  receiving TARP funds.

Treasury currently expects to  approve approximately five fund managers, although more may be added,  depending on the quality of applications received. Approved fund  managers for the public-private investment funds will raise the private  equity capital and make control decisions, including asset selection,  pricing, liquidation, trading, and disposition.

One of its components\u2014the Home  Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)\u2014will use $50 billion in TARP  funds to modify mortgages. According to OFS officials, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac will provide an additional $25 billion, for a total of $75 billion,  to help up to 3 million to 4 million homeowners avoid potential  foreclosure. The goal of modifying these mortgages is to reduce  participants\u2019 monthly mortgage payments to affordable levels (a mortgage  debt-to-income ratio of 31 percent). Treasury will share the cost of  restructuring the mortgages with lenders (if financial institutions hold the  whole loans) or investors (if the loans have been securitized).  The lender  or investor must first reduce the borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage payment  down to 38 percent of income.  For these mortgages, Treasury will then  match further reductions on a dollar-for-dollar basis down to the target of  31 percent. For eligible loans where the borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage  payment is already below 38 percent, Treasury matches reductions in  mortgage payments from the borrower\u2019s current monthly payment.  According to Treasury, loan servicers could begin modifying mortgages  consistent with HAMP guidelines as of March 4, 2009. However, Treasury  will not make payments under HAMP until it has executed contracts,  which are currently in draft form, with the servicers. Treasury has  announced a series of financial incentives for loan servicers, mortgage  holders/investors, and borrowers that are intended to encourage servicers  to modify loans, borrowers to continue paying on time under the modified  loans, and servicers and mortgage holders/investors to modify at-risk loans  before borrowers miss payments. Within OFS, the Office of  Homeownership Preservation is responsible for administering HAMP and  is led by a new interim chief. The structure and initial hiring for this office  are in progress, and its efforts are supported by other personnel within  OFS and Treasury. The Making Home Affordable program also includes a  non-TARP funded initiative to help up to 4 million to 5 million  homeowners refinance loans owned or guaranteed by Freddie Mac and  Fannie Mae at current market rates. According to Treasury, this initiative  could help homeowners save thousands of dollars in annual mortgage  payments.", "Treasury worked with other agencies to estimate the cost and number of  borrowers who would be eligible for loan modifications under HAMP and  to design program parameters. Treasury stated that it used data from  commercial vendors, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to estimate the  potential universe of homeowners who were in default or likely to be in  imminent danger of default from April 2009 to March 2012 and the number  of homeowners eligible and likely to participate in HAMP during the  program\u2019s 3-year application period. Treasury then estimated the cost of  the key parameters of HAMP, including the monthly payment subsidy,  incentive payments, and other payments\u2014for example, payments to  homeowners for signing over deeds instead of going through foreclosure  proceedings, and payments to lenders for eliminating second liens for  HAMP participants. According to Treasury officials, HAMP parameters  were designed to provide incentives to servicers, investors, and borrowers  to modify mortgage payments quickly and efficiently without using  government funds to pay for modifications that servicers would already  complete without government assistance. Treasury officials told us that  the principal goal of HAMP was to get mortgage payments to an affordable  level and avoid foreclosures. Treasury officials said that they recognized  that, for some borrowers, an affordable mortgage payment was not the  only concern and that negative equity was also an issue. Treasury\u2019s  HAMP guidelines allow servicers to reduce the amount of mortgage  principal, in addition to reducing interest rates to reach an affordable  payment. To reach borrowers, Treasury launched its Making Home  Affordable Web site on March 19, 2009, that, among other things, provides  program, eligibility, and housing counseling information.", "As we have previously stated, some of the challenges that loan  modification programs face include making transparent to investors the  analysis supporting the value of modification over foreclosure, designing  the program to limit the likelihood of redefault, and ensuring that the  program does not encourage borrowers who otherwise would not default  to fall behind on their mortgage payments. Treasury pointed to a number  of HAMP features designed to address these challenges. According to  Treasury, requiring the use of a standardized net present value test will  provide greater transparency to investors about the value of modification  over foreclosure. Treasury officials stated that HAMP contained features  designed to limit the likelihood of redefault, including a 90-day trial  modification period, the reduced monthly payment, and incentives to keep  borrowers current on their modified loan payments. Treasury stated that  the likelihood that performing borrowers would intentionally default on  their mortgages to access HAMP (e.g., moral hazard) was limited. For  instance, servicers are required to obtain information on borrowers\u2019  current income to verify that the debt-to-income ratio without loan  modification is greater than 31 percent, and borrowers must also represent  and warrant that they do not have sufficient liquid assets to make their  monthly mortgage payments. To reduce adverse selection (the risk that  servicers would selectively choose loans for HAMP), Treasury requires  that servicers consider all the loans that they service for participation in its  loan modification program, unless prohibited by the rules of the applicable  servicing agreements. Treasury has begun developing a data reporting  system that will be used, among other things, to monitor servicers\u2019  compliance with HAMP requirements, as well as the performance of loans  that have been modified.", "While the basic structure of HAMP has been announced, Treasury has not  specified several critical components\u2014including a system of internal  control over TARP funds used for loan modification\u2014as of March 23,  2009. Treasury officials said that they plan to have a system of internal  control in place when the first payments are due to servicers. As we noted  in our first TARP report, the absence of appropriate internal control  heightens the risk that the interests of the government and taxpayers may  not be adequately protected and that the program objectives may not be  achieved in an efficient and effective manner. Treasury\u2019s loan  modification proposal calls for payments to be made to offset probable  losses from home price declines in the event of failed modifications.  However, Treasury officials told us that the specifics of how this HAMP  feature would work were still being developed as of March 20, 2009.  Additionally, incentive payments to servicers and mortgage  holders/investors to offer alternatives to foreclosure to homeowners who  fail to qualify for or default under HAMP had not been specified as of  March 20, 2009. Treasury has selected Fannie Mae to administer, maintain  records for, and serve as the paying agent for its homeowner assistance  programs, including HAMP, and Freddie Mac as the compliance agent to  oversee servicers\u2019 modifications. Fannie Mae\u2019s responsibilities include  developing and implementing a marketing plan, call center for borrowers,  standard agreements with servicers, standardized modification  documentation, modification reporting systems, processes for servicer  data reporting and collection of data, and fraud monitoring and detection.  Freddie Mac\u2019s compliance responsibilities include conducting  examinations, reviewing servicer compliance with HAMP\u2019s published  rules, and reporting the results of the examinations to Treasury. According  to representatives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government- sponsored enterprises (GSE) are establishing separate internal  organizations and firewalls, as well as appropriate procedures and  controls\u2014all of which must be approved by Treasury\u2014to avoid conflicts  of interest in carrying out their compliance responsibilities.

Generally, in the event  that an institution does not declare a dividend for cumulative preferred  stock during the dividend period, the unpaid dividends accumulate, and  the institution must pay the cumulative accrued dividends before making  dividend payments to other classes of shareholders. But if the institution  does not declare a dividend for noncumulative preferred stock during the  dividend period, the noncumulative preferred shareholders generally have  no right to receive any dividend for the period, and the issuer has no  obligation to pay a dividend for the period, whether or not dividends are  declared for any subsequent dividend period.", "Treasury did not receive all possible dividend payments under two  programs. First, the sole participant in SSFI\u2014AIG\u2014notified Treasury that  the board of directors did not declare a dividend of approximately $733  million for the February 1, 2009, dividend payment date. The agreement  detailing the terms of Treasury\u2019s November 25, 2008, $40 billion  investment in AIG\u2019s senior preferred stock states that dividends will be  payable at an annual rate of 10 percent when and if declared by the AIG  Board of Directors. Under this agreement, accrued but unpaid dividends  compound quarterly. The agreement further states that if dividends on the  senior preferred stock are not paid in full for four dividend periods,  whether or not consecutive, the senior preferred stockholders have the  right to appoint at least two directors to the board. As discussed earlier in  our report, on March 2, 2009, the Federal Reserve and Treasury announced  plans to restructure and expand AIG\u2019s assistance. Under the announced  plans, Treasury is to receive noncumulative preferred stock equal to the  sum of the $40 billion in cumulative preferred stock previously issued to  Treasury on November 25, 2008, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  related to those shares.", "Second, Treasury did not receive approximately $150,000 in possible  noncumulative dividends related to eight CPP participants. According to  Treasury officials, these eight banks informed Treasury that they lacked  the necessary regulatory or shareholder approvals to declare dividends on  their preferred stock. Federal banking laws and regulations include  minimum capital requirements and limitations on the use of capital to pay  dividends. In addition, some state laws impose similar limitations and  require shareholder approval for certain reductions of capital.", "OFS officials told us they consulted with Treasury\u2019s Office of the General  Counsel to address these CPP dividends that were not declared. Since the  $150,000 in undeclared dividends are noncumulative and were not  declared during the dividend period, these institutions are not obligated to  pay, and Treasury has no right to receive the dividends for the period.  According to the standard terms of CPP, after six nonpayments by a CPP  institution (whether or not consecutive), Treasury and other holders of  preferred securities equivalent to Treasury\u2019s can exercise their right to  appoint two members to the board of directors for that institution at the  institution\u2019s first annual meeting of stockholders subsequent to the sixth  nonpayment. Although OFS indicated that they were aware of the dividend  restrictions for certain banks, Treasury officials told us that Treasury had  not directly suggested to any institution that it seek the approvals  necessary to declare dividends.

In discussing the roles of contractors  and financial agents in TARP operations and administration, OFS program  managers we spoke with generally characterized contractors\u2019 involvement  as providing technical and operational input into program execution.  Table 5 provides a summary of the types of services provided, based on  our analysis of selected TARP contracts and a financial agency agreement.", "OFS officials told us that the use of contractors and financial agents for  the above professional services was critically important given the  technical nature of the tasks, the need for expertise, and the speed with  which OFS must act regarding TARP. OFS officials believe they retain  control over the direction of TARP and have sufficient management  oversight of the advice and assistance provided by TARP contractors and  financial agents. For example, an OFS program manager noted that the  advice provided by the Bank of New York Mellon did not equate to a  policy decision but rather supported OFS officials\u2019 development and  execution of policy decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFS Has Made Progress in Strengthening Oversight of Contractors and Financial Agents", "paragraphs": ["In response to the recommendation in our January 2009 report that  Treasury improve its oversight of contractors, Treasury has taken steps to  help ensure that sufficient personnel are assigned to facilitate effective  management and oversight of TARP contracts and financial agency  agreements. As shown in table 6, except for one key position that is to be  filled as Treasury enters into financial agency agreements for asset  managers, key contract staffing positions were filled through new hiring  and reassignment actions.", "OFS also made progress responding to our recommendation to help  ensure that staff were appropriately trained to oversee contractors\u2019  technical performance. In particular, it made progress on certifications  and formal training for OFS\u2019s roster of Contracting Officers\u2019 Technical  Representatives (COTR). OFS has now replaced all the executive-level  COTRs who earlier had been assigned COTR responsibilities without  receiving requisite formal training and certifications in their acquisition- related responsibilities. Consistent with Treasury\u2019s internal guidance and  our prior recommendation, OFS ensured that the replacement COTRs  received the appropriate formal training and certification.", "Given the constantly evolving and financially complex TARP program  requirements, we reviewed OFS\u2019s technical oversight of contractors\u2019  performance. We found that OFS exercises oversight consistent with good  practices we have identified when using contractors for more complex  professional services. Specifically, information discussed with COTRs,  OFS program officials, and senior contractor officials responsible for three  key TARP areas demonstrated that an interactive working environment  exists between OFS and its TARP contractors and financial agents. For  example, OFS officials, as well as Bank of New York Mellon managers,  told us that they talk daily, and often many times a day, regarding the  execution of the end-of-week closings on capital investments through  CPP\u2014a complex undertaking that involves many transactions that can  total in the billions of dollars. According to Treasury officials, this level of  interaction provides frequent opportunities for oversight and helps them  to ensure that their needs are met.", "Since January 2009, the Office of the Chief Operating Officer has hired an  executive-level contract administration manager, another action  responsive to and consistent with our prior recommendation. His job, in  part, is to apply contract management best practices to TARP contracts  and financial agency agreements, and provide leadership and guidance to  COTRs and financial agent managers. Based on information we reviewed  from the contract administration manager, as well as COTRs and financial  agent managers in three program offices, these efforts should better  position OFS to strengthen contract management. Other OFS actions to  facilitate the oversight of TARP contractor and financial agent  performance are listed in table 7.", "Finally, in response to and consistent with our recommendation, Treasury  has made further progress in using fixed-price contracting arrangements  when the parties possess sufficient knowledge of the requirements.  Although Treasury has awarded new time-and-materials contracts since  January, it also converted work under two time-and-materials task orders  for legal services to fixed-price arrangements after determining that there  were clearly defined requirements (i.e., transactional legal services for  which the parties could estimate accurately the level of performance  required). In addition, in response to GAO\u2019s recommendation, Treasury  negotiated a firm fixed price for two workstreams making up about 20  percent of the new $5 million task order for internal control services  performed by a contractor. Treasury and OFS officials have worked  closely to analyze the use of time-and-materials arrangements for follow- on requirements to ensure such arrangements are only used when other  contract types are not suitable. Treasury officials said that their reviews  indicate that, given the nature of the services OFS is procuring,  opportunities may be limited for the foreseeable future to use fixed-price  mechanisms when placing orders for follow-on work or awarding future  contracts. According to these officials, fixed-price arrangements may not  be appropriate for many TARP contracts. Considering the still-evolving  nature of TARP\u2019s requirements, the ability of the parties to accurately  anticipate the performance requirements and estimate costs, as required  for fixed-price arrangements, is limited. This limitation places Treasury at  risk of paying a higher fixed price for the services than it might otherwise  pay under a time-and-materials contract. Treasury is gathering cost data  from existing time-and-materials and labor-hour contracts to identify costs  of recurring transactions to support the future negotiation of reasonable  fixed pricing for follow-on work where appropriate. In our view,  Treasury\u2019s actions since January in response to our recommendation  generally indicate it is placing a high priority on making individualized  assessments of the nature of each requirement in order to identify those  requirements that may effectively utilize a fixed-price contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFS Has Made Further Progress Implementing a Compliance System for Potential Conflicts of Interest Among Contractors and Financial Agents", "paragraphs": ["Since issuing an interim conflicts-of-interest rule in January 2009, and  consistent with our prior recommendation, OFS continued to make  progress implementing a system of compliance for conflicts of interest  that may arise with vendors seeking or performing work under TARP.   Consistent with the framework the interim rule provides, OFS is  formalizing its process for reviewing and addressing potential or actual  organizational and personal conflicts of interest disclosed by contractors  and financial agents. Specifically, OFS is making progress (1) developing  and applying its compliance system under the interim rule, and (2)  reviewing existing contracts that predate the interim rule to determine  what changes may be needed.", "Regarding OFS\u2019s progress in further developing and applying its conflicts-  of-interest compliance system, discussions with OFS program and  compliance officials, two TARP contractors, and a financial agent\u2019s senior  contracts manager indicate that a mutual environment for sustained  attention and control is taking root. Specifically, our discussions with OFS  and TARP contractor officials indicate that all parties have a range of  formal and informal processes in place, under which TARP contractors are  expected to detect potential conflicts of interest. Once detected, the  interim rule requires that potential conflicts be disclosed to Treasury  within 5 business days. A disclosure can trigger a formal review by the  OFS compliance officer, who is responsible for making a final  determination. The processes include an ongoing dialogue among OFS  officials and officials from TARP contractors and financial agents about  new potential conflicts and, as needed, discussions about changes to  contractors\u2019 mitigation plans to increase their effectiveness and conform  with the interim rule.", "We note, however, that OFS does not have fully developed procedures for  capturing its decisions on potential conflicts of interest. For example,  concerning the regular discussions of new potential conflicts that may  arise and require OFS\u2019s compliance review, it is not clear that all  discussions are documented, or that all information is captured, such as  information supporting OFS\u2019s determination that a conflict does not exist  or has been satisfactorily mitigated. TARP contractors told us that they did  not routinely retain records from their discussions with OFS officials  about potential conflict disclosures and mitigations. These discussions  frequently entail phone conferences but do not always result in formal  correspondence addressing the matter. In the absence of documentation,  there is no record of how issues were addressed and resolved, should the  need to revisit those issues arise in the future. OFS compliance officials  acknowledged that they needed to enhance the procedures for  documenting conflicts discussions in order to better demonstrate  compliance with the interim rule. OFS officials stated they were drafting  new policy and procedure instructions to do so. As conflict disclosures  and proposed mitigations involving TARP contractors and financial agents  continue to emerge, we will need to revisit OFS procedures to ensure that  it maintains appropriate documentation.", "OFS has made progress since January, in response to our recommendation  that it review its existing contracts to determine whether changes are  needed in light of the interim rule. Specifically, OFS has reviewed six  contracts that predate the interim rule. As of March 13, 2009, this process  has resulted in the renegotiation of two contractors\u2019 mitigation plans. OFS  compliance officials expect to finish reviewing the remaining four  mitigation plans within the next several months. We plan to continue  monitoring OFS\u2019s progress to ensure that it fully implements our prior  recommendation.", "Although the above efforts indicate that progress is being made related to  potential conflicts of interest, there may be an opportunity, going forward,  for streamlining OFS oversight in this area. For example, the portion of the  interim rule focusing on personal conflicts of interest requires that certain  contractors obtain financial disclosures in writing from management  officials and key individuals working on TARP that are no less extensive  than those that are required of new high-level federal government  officials. Specifically, the interim rule requires that before working on a  TARP matter, management officials and key individuals at firms involved  with the acquisition, valuation, management, or disposition of troubled  assets must disclose information, in writing, on their and their family\u2019s  personal, business, and financial relationships. We recognize the  importance of collecting such information to detect and deter conflicts of  interest. However, the selected use of a more streamlined approach, in  appropriate circumstances, could reduce the burden of providing this  information and promote compliance. Treasury officials acknowledged  that an alternative financial disclosure process could offer a less  burdensome way for TARP contractors to obtain required written  disclosures from employees but said that any consideration of an  alternative would occur only in the context of evaluating public comments  on the interim conflicts rule. In finalizing the TARP conflicts-of-interest  rule, OFS officials told us that they would be reviewing various options to  the current requirement in the interest of striking a balance between  Treasury\u2019s need to protect the government\u2019s interests and the burden the  requirement placed on TARP contractors and financial agents."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OFS Is in the Process of Building TARP\u2019s Financial Reporting Structure", "paragraphs": ["Treasury must annually prepare and submit to Congress and the public  audited fiscal year financial statements for TARP that are prepared in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

However, several factors  will complicate efforts to measure any impact, including contemporaneous  changes in monetary and fiscal policy; other programs introduced by  Treasury, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and FHFA, and general market  forces. As a result, any changes in credit markets cannot be attributed  solely to TARP. Similarly, slow recovery does not necessarily reflect its  failure. However, if TARP is having its intended effect, a number of  developments might be observed in credit and other markets over time,  such as reduced risk spreads, declining borrowing costs, and more lending  activity than there would have been in the absence of TARP. Credit market  indicators we have been monitoring suggest the cost of nonmortgage  credit has risen, and perceptions of risk (as measured by premiums over  Treasury securities) have declined in mortgage and interbank markets,  while rising in corporate debt markets. While lending standards remained  tight, according to Federal Reserve data, the largest CPP recipients  continued to extend loans to consumers and businesses of at least $200  billion a month since October, based on our analysis of Treasury\u2019s new  loan survey.

In our previous reports we  focused on CPP, detailing the expected effects, as well as the tension  between promoting lending and improving the capital position of banks.  As indicated above, CAP, as proposed by the new administration, aims to  eliminate uncertainty about the solvency of financial institutions through  stress tests and by infusing capital into the financial system to the point  where participating banks can absorb losses even worse than expected  scenarios. The intent is to improve confidence in financial institutions,  allowing the banks to borrow on more favorable terms, attract private  capital and continue lending to creditworthy businesses and households.  Like CPP, if CAP is effective we should also see improvement in credit  market conditions, including declining risk premiums (the difference  between risky and risk-free interest rates, such as rates on U.S. Treasury  securities) for interbank lending and bank debt and lower borrowing costs  for business and consumers. Improved market conditions may permit  some borrowers to avoid foreclosures by enhancing the capacity and  willingness of banks to refinance loans or modify others. HAMP is  intended to reduce foreclosures by directly modifying and refinancing  mortgages and, therefore, may also indirectly improve the balance sheets  of banks by restoring value to mortgage-related securities. However, as we  discussed in our December 2008 and January 2009 reports, to the extent  that credit quality in the economy is deteriorating, confidence remains low  and the economy continues to experience a downturn, during which  lending and borrowing levels normally drop. Low interest rates and lower  premiums may not translate into increased lending immediately.  Nevertheless, lending may still be higher than it would have been if the  equity injections had not taken place. Similarly, market forces may  continue to force a correction in housing prices and result in additional  foreclosures, albeit fewer than would have occurred in the absence of  TARP.", "Similarly, TARP activities could improve credit market conditions by  supporting securitization markets through the expansion of TALF. As  indicated above, TALF will provide funding to certain holders of Aaa-rated  ABS backed by newly and recently originated small business, student,  automobile, and credit card loans. By increasing demand and prices for  these securities, TALF should reduce the rates faced by borrowers in the  associated loan categories and increase the availability of new credit to  consumers and businesses. Moreover, by providing support to  securitization markets, TALF may encourage private investors to return to  asset-backed securities, thereby increasing liquidity and improving general  market conditions. However, as we discussed in our previous reports,  other important policies and interventions by government agencies (some  collaborative efforts) that are undertaken to restore financial stability, as  well as general market forces, will complicate a determination of TARP\u2019s  specific effectiveness.

Improvements in these measures would indicate improving  conditions, even though those changes cannot be exclusively linked to any  one program. Table 8 lists the indicators we have reported on in previous  reports, as well as the changes since the last report and the changes since  the announcement of CPP, the first TARP program. In general, the  indicators illustrate that the cost of nonmortgage credit has risen and that  perceptions of risk have declined in mortgage and interbank markets,  while rising in corporate debt markets since January 2009. For example,  while the cost of interbank credit (LIBOR) has risen slightly since our  January 2009 report, the TED spread, which captures the risk perceived in  interbank markets, has declined. Since the announcement of CPP, the TED  spread has fallen 350 basis points. Since the announcement of CPP,  corporate bond spreads are up, and there have been increases of 38 and 27  basis points for high quality (Aaa) and moderate quality (Baa) corporate  spreads, respectively, since our January 2009 report, indicating heightened  risk perceptions. Like the LIBOR, Aaa and Baa bond rates have increased,  indicating an increase in the cost of credit for businesses. However, the  improvement in the mortgage market is consistent across rates and  spreads. Mortgage rates were down 9 basis points, and the mortgage  spread is down 45 basis points. (See our December and January reports  for a more detailed description and motivation for the indicators.) As  discussed above, changes in credit market conditions may not provide  conclusive evidence of TARP\u2019s effectiveness, as other important policies,  interventions, and changes in underlying economic conditions can  influence these markets. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced\u2014in  addition to further interventions in the GSE mortgage-backed security and  debt market\u2014that it intended to improve conditions in private credit  markets by purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury  securities over the next 6 months.

While  the volume of new mortgage lending may reflect changes in credit risk or  the demand for credit, it may also indicate the availability of credit as  well. As table 9 indicates, mortgage originations fell from $300 billion in  the third quarter to $250 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. To the extent  that credit and economic conditions improve over time, we would expect  mortgage originations to stop declining and eventually rise, although it is  not clear that this measure would or should return to the level seen in the  period leading up to the credit market turmoil. Similarly, foreclosure data  should provide an indication of the effectiveness of the recently  implemented HAMP program going forward. The percentage of loans in  foreclosure had reached an unprecedented high of 3.3 percent at the end  of the fourth quarter of 2008, up from 2.97 percent the previous quarter.

This change should provide Treasury with the information necessary to begin to track the effectiveness of the program and  effectively implement our recommendation. Treasury also has expedited  efforts to ensure that trained and certified personnel oversee the  performance of all contracts and moved toward fixed-price arrangements, when appropriate. These actions were consistent with our  recommendations for improved contractor oversight in these areas.  Moreover, Treasury continued to make progress in several o including ensuring that future agreements entered into under its new programs better enable it to determine what institutions plan to do with any capital infusions and to track the resulting lending activity of  participating institutions on a regular basis.

Treasury officials  told us that asset managers are to play a role in monitoring the  participating institutions\u2019 compliance with the agreements. In the interim,  Treasury has taken some steps to help ensure that institutions are  complying with dividend, stock repurchase, and executive compensation  restrictions. Treasury relies on participants\u2019 representations and  warranties in the agreements, and if it finds reason to believe that these  representations can not be relied upon, it can pursue the available  remedies for any false representations. At this point, Treasury has not  taken steps to verify the information or require the institutions to provide  any additional documentation. As recommended in our December 2008  report, we continue to believe that Treasury should develop a formal  system to help ensure compliance with the agreements. For example,  leverage the oversight activities of the bank regulators by having them  include compliance with the agreements as part of their ongoing  examinations. This type of compliance activity is generally consistent with  ensuring the safety and soundness of institutions.  The regulators  previously told us that they were taking steps to build such oversight into  their examination procedures. However, without a consistent oversight  approach, Treasury runs the risk of receiving inconsistent or incomplete  information from the regulators.", "Treasury has also continued to take steps to articulate a more clearly  defined vision for TARP, and in February 2009, provided its strategy for  using its remaining funds. This strategy defined the existing problems and  how the various programs would begin to address them. While the initial  plan provided a broad vision and strategy, in the subsequent weeks,  Treasury provided additional details for the various components of the  program. In particular, it announced its plans to participate in the  purchase of troubled assets through public-private partnerships and  launched a homeownership protection program, activities that are  consistent with the original plans for TARP. Given that only 60 days have  passed since our last report, we acknowledge the significance of these  accomplishments. Yet, Treasury continues to be hampered by questions  about its overall strategy and OFS\u2019s activities, raising questions about the  effectiveness of its existing communication strategy. Treasury\u2019s strategy  has largely been one of posting information to its Web site; issuing press  releases, speeches, and testimonies; and reaching out to Congress on an ad  hoc basis; and it continues to face ongoing communication challenges.", "Given the complexity of the issues involved and the heightened public  scrutiny, an effective communication strategy continues to be critical, but  Treasury has yet to develop a means of regularly and routinely  communicating its activities to relevant congressional committees and  members, the public, and other critical stakeholders. For example, TARP  had received approximately $2.9 billion in dividend payments through  March 20, 2009, but this information has not been reported to the Congress  and the public. To improve transparency, Treasury should publicly  announce the amounts, such as dividends, it has received from TARP  participants. By not sharing this information, Treasury is missing an  important opportunity to provide information about the returns it is  receiving on its investments. An effective communication strategy should,  among other things, build understanding and support for the program  through regular and routine outreach, including confidential member  briefings; integrate communications and operations by making  communication integral to the program; and increase the impact of  communication tools such as electronic and print media and video. Given  that the President\u2019s proposed budget contemplates additional funding, an  effective communication strategy is critical for ensuring the support  necessary to obtain such funding.", "Treasury has taken appropriate actions to bolster the conditions or  requirements for assistance that is deemed exceptional, but certain  assistance may require that it go farther to repair damage caused to the  program. Controversies about the actions of some TARP participants  continue to surround the program, in general, and AIG, in particular. While  Treasury announced $70 billion dollars in assistance to AIG\u2014more  assistance than has been provided to any other single institution to date\u2014 it has yet to disperse the up to $30 billion of additional assistance  announced on March 2, 2009, or finalize the agreement. Therefore,  Treasury has an opportunity to further improve the integrity and  accountability associated with this additional assistance. Based on our  previous work on government assistance to the private sector, as well as  the Treasury Secretary\u2019s position, as articulated in the Financial Stability  Plan that government support must come with strong conditions, Treasury  has an opportunity to take additional steps to strengthen its agreement  with AIG by requiring AIG seek to negotiate concessions from  management, employees, and counterparties, as appropriate, before the  agreement is finalized. For example, Treasury could require that AIG seek  to renegotiate contracts with its employees, such as existing contracts  similar to the contract for retention bonuses with AIG Financial Products\u2019  employees, and with existing counterparties that would face substantial  losses were AIG to have its credit downgraded or fail. While we  understand that Treasury is making an investment in AIG, Treasu failure to act in this instance could cause additional harm to its reputa and impair its ability to seek additional funding for TARP that might be  needed in the future.", "Next, Treasury has also made progress in establishing its management  infrastructure and has responded to our five open recommendations tha are related to hiring, contracting, and establishing its internal controls.", "In the hiring area, Treasury has continued to make progress in  establishing its management infrastructure, including hiring mo re staff.  In accordance with our prior recommendation that it expeditiously hire  personnel to OFS, Treasury continued to use direct-hire and various  other appointments to bring a number of career staff on board quickly .   Since our January 2009 report, Treasury has increased the total number of OFS staff overall and the balance has shifted from mostly detailees  to more permanent staff, indicating that the workforce has become  more stable over time. In our last report, we recognized that the  changing nature of OFS had made it difficult for officials to deter its long-term organizational needs but that such considerations  continued to be vital to retaining institutional knowledge within  the o  organization as programs evolved. Treasury has taken further steps t align OFS\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals. For example, as outlined in its dr aft  workforce plan, Treasury has taken steps to identify the critical skills  and competencies needed to operate OFS and plans to develop  strategies to address gaps in these areas. These actions will be c ritical  to OFS\u2019s ability to monitor its progress in building and developing the  OFS workforce. reasury has continued to build a network of contractors and financial  T agents to support TARP administration and operations. At the same  time, Treasury has continued to build its capacity to manage these  vendors by putting into place the people and processes necessary toenhance its oversight of contractor and financial agent performance.  Given the still-evolving nature of TARP requirements, we recognize th opportunities for using fixed-price arrangements may be limited.   Nonetheless, Treasury has a process that should help it determine where those opportunities exist. In developing this process, Treasu has addressed our prior recommendation in this area, and we will  monitor continued progress. In addition, Treasury could enhance it efforts to safeguard the TARP program from conflicts of interest  involving its contractors and financial agents by completing its review  of mitigation plans to ensure conformity with the new conflicts-of- s  interest rule and by requiring that decisions on potential conflicts b documented.", "FS has begun to build a financial reporting structure, including  O addressing the key accounting and financial reporting issues nece to enable it to prepare financial statements and to assess the  effectiveness of TARP\u2019s system of internal control. Consistent previous recommendations, OFS is continuing to develop a  comprehensive system of internal control and has establishe d plans for  finalizing formal policies and procedures to govern TARP activities and  assess its risks. In the interim, OFS has developed and documented  process flows and narratives describing internal control procedures  TARP transactions. While OFS applied adequate control procedures  over selected CPP and SSFI transactions we tested, it has not taken  steps to provide consistency between the documented descriptions a the actual procedures for certain controls that were applied to the  transactions. Inconsistencies in the application of a control procedu complicate review of the transactions and increase the risk that the  transactions may not be recorded completely, properly, or consisten Similarly, OFS needs to address inconsistencies in guidance pertaining  to determining warrant exercise prices. Inconsistencies in guidance  available to the public for these price determinations may create  confusion about the actual terms and conditions executed by Trea for its investments.  tly. inally, we again note that while isolating the effect of TARP\u2019s activities  F continues to be difficult, developments in the credit markets have  generally been mixed since our January 2009 report. Some indicato demonstrate that the cost of credit has increased in interbank and  corporate bond markets and decreased in mortgage markets, while perceptions of risk (as measured by premiums over Treasury securit ies)  have declined in interbank and mortgage markets and risen in corporate  debt markets. In addition, although Federal Reserve survey data suggest  that lending standards remained tight, the largest CPP recipients extende over $240 billion in new loans to consumers and business in both  December 2008 and January 2009, according to the Treasury\u2019s new survey. Attributing any of these changes directly to TARP continues to beproblematic because of the range of actions that have been and are being  taken to address the current crisis. While these indicators may be  suggestive of TARP\u2019s ongoing impact, no single indicator or set of  indicators will provide a definitive determination of the program\u2019s  impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["While Treasury continues to take action to address our recommendations  and has begun to make progress in many areas, we identified new areas  that warrant ongoing attention and focus.
