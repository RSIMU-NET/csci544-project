For example, of the 34 areas on our 2017 High-Risk list  (excluding strategic human capital management), skills gaps played a  role in making 15 areas high-risk, and included information technology  management, and acquisitions, and veterans\u2019 health care, among others.", "In my remarks today, I will discuss (1) lessons learned in creating a more  market-driven, results-oriented approach to federal pay, and (2)  opportunities in addition to pay and benefits that OPM and agencies could  use to be more competitive in the labor market and address skills gaps.", "The bottom line is that, while the federal compensation system may need  to be re-examined, it will also be important for agencies to make better  use of the management tools already available to them. Indeed, more  effective use of hiring flexibilities, adopting leading human capital  management practices, and strengthening the capacity of agencies\u2019  human resource offices could significantly improve executive branch  personnel management, and thus help agencies to better carry out their  missions in an era of highly constrained resources.", "My testimony is based on our large body of work on federal human capital  management issued primarily between June 2012 and March 2017. In  addition, we conducted follow-up on recommendations made in prior  reports through interviews with agency officials.

Regardless of whether  the shortfalls are in such government-wide occupations as cybersecurity  and acquisitions, or in agency-specific occupations such as nurses at the  Veterans Health Administration, skills gaps impede the federal  government from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving results.", "Agencies can have skills gaps for different reasons: they may have an  insufficient number of people or their people may not have the  appropriate skills or abilities to accomplish mission-critical work.  Moreover, current budget and long-term fiscal pressures, the changing  nature of federal work, and a potential wave of employee retirements that  could produce gaps in leadership and institutional knowledge, threaten to  aggravate the problems created by existing skills gaps.", "According to our analysis of OPM data, government-wide more than 34  percent of federal employees on-board by the end of fiscal year 2015 will  be eligible to retire by 2020 (see figure 1). Some agencies, such as the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, will have particularly  high eligibility levels by 2020. Various factors can affect when individuals  actually retire, and some amount of retirement and other forms of attrition  can be beneficial because it creates opportunities to bring fresh skills on  board and it allows organizations to restructure themselves to better meet  program goals and fiscal realities. But if turnover is not strategically  monitored and managed, gaps can develop in an organization\u2019s  institutional knowledge and leadership.", "While numerous tools are available to help agencies address their talent  needs, our past work has identified problems across a range of personnel  systems and functions.

Across-the-board pay adjustments are to be based on private  sector salary growth. Locality adjustments are designed to reduce the  gap between federal and nonfederal pay in each locality to no more than  5 percent. The President\u2019s Pay Agent is the entity charged with  determining the disparities between federal and nonfederal pay in each  locality; it measures federal pay based on OPM records that identify GS  employees by occupation and grade level, and nonfederal pay based on  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data (BLS). In 2012, the Pay Agent has  recommended that the underlying model and methodology for estimating  pay gaps be reexamined to ensure that private sector and federal sector  pay comparisons are as accurate as possible. As of December 2016, no  such reexamination has taken place.", "The across-the-board and locality pay increases may be made every  year, and are not linked to performance. Pay increases and monetary  awards that are linked to performance ratings as determined by the  agencies\u2019 performance appraisal systems include within-grade increases,  ratings-based cash awards, and quality step increases, and are available  to GS employees. Within-grade increases are the least strongly linked to  performance, ratings-based cash awards are more strongly linked to  performance depending on the rating system the agency uses, and  quality step increases are also more strongly linked to performance.", "The composition of the federal workforce has changed over the past 30  years, with the need for clerical and blue collar roles diminishing and  professional, administrative, and technical roles increasing. As a result,  today\u2019s federal jobs require more advanced skills at higher grade levels  than in years past. Additionally, we have found that federal jobs, on  average, require more advanced skills and degrees than private sector  jobs. This is because a higher proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal  are in skilled occupations such as science, engineering, and program  management, while a lower proportion of federal jobs than nonfederal are  in occupations such as manufacturing, construction, and service work.  The result is that the federal workforce is on average more highly  educated than the private sector workforce.", "As we reported in 2014, a key federal human capital management  challenge is how best to balance the size and composition of the federal  workforce so that it is able to deliver the high quality services that  taxpayers demand, within the budgetary realities of what the nation can  afford. Recognizing that the federal government\u2019s pay system does not  align well with modern compensation principles (where pay decisions are  based on the skills, knowledge, and performance of employees as well as  the local labor market), Congress has provided various agencies with  exemptions from the current system to give them more flexibility in setting  pay. Thus, a long-standing federal human capital management question  is how to update the entire federal compensation system to be more  market based and performance oriented.

Moreover, representatives of  public, private, and nonprofit organizations, in discussing the successes  and challenges they have experienced in designing and implementing  their own results-oriented pay systems, told us at the time they had to  shift from a culture where compensation is based on position and  longevity to one that is performance-oriented, affordable and sustainable.", "As we have reported in the past, these organizations\u2019 experiences with  their own market-based and performance-oriented pay systems provide  useful lessons learned that will be important to consider to the extent the  federal government moves toward a more results-oriented pay system.

Focus on a set of values and objectives to guide the pay system.", "Values represent an organization\u2019s beliefs and boundaries, and  objectives articulate the strategy to implement the system.  2.  Examine the value of employees\u2019 total compensation to remain  competitive in the labor market. Organizations consider a mix of base  pay plus other monetary incentives, benefits and deferred  compensation, such as retirement pay, as part of a competitive  compensation system.  3.  Build in safeguards to enhance the transparency and ensure the  fairness of pay decisions. Safeguards are the precondition to linking  pay systems with employee knowledge, skills, and contributions to  results.  4.  Devolve decision-making on pay to appropriate levels. When  devolving such decision making, overall core processes help ensure  reasonable consistency in how the system is implemented.  5.  Provide training on leadership, management, and interpersonal skills  to facilitate effective communication. Such skills as setting  expectations, linking individual performance to organizational results,  and giving and receiving feedback need renewed emphasis to make  such systems succeed.  6.  Build consensus to gain ownership and acceptance for pay reforms.  Employee and stakeholder involvement needs to be meaningful and  not pro forma.  7.

While there is no  one right way to design a classification system, in 2014, we identified  eight key attributes that are important for a modern, effective classification  system.

They also may miss the opportunity to  observe and correct poor performance.", "Among other things, we found effective performance management helps  agencies establish a clear \u201cline of sight\u201d between individual performance  and organizational success and using core competencies helps to  reinforce organizational objectives. Agencies should also make  meaningful distinctions in employee performance levels. However, we  found that 99 percent of permanent, non-senior executive service  employees in 2013 received a rating at or above fully successful, with  around 61 percent rated as \u201coutstanding\u201d or \u201cexceeds fully successful.\u201d", "Importantly, in 2015 we found that good supervisors are key to the  success of any performance management system. Supervisors provide  the day-to-day performance management activities that can help sustain  and improve the performance of more talented staff and can help marginal performers to become better. As a result, agencies should  promote people into supervisory positions because of their supervisory  skills (in addition to their technical skills) and ensure that new supervisors  receive sufficient training in performance management. Likewise, a  cultural shift might be needed among agencies and employees to  acknowledge that a rating of \u201cfully successful\u201d is already a high bar and  should be valued and rewarded and that \u201coutstanding\u201d is a difficult level to  achieve.", "Further, in 2015 we found that probationary periods for new employees  provide supervisors with an opportunity to evaluate an individual\u2019s  performance to determine if an appointment to the civil service should  become final. However, some Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCO) said  supervisors often do not use this time to make performance-related  decisions about an employee\u2019s performance because they may not know  that the probationary period is ending or they have not had time to  observe performance in all critical areas. In our prior work, we  recommended that OPM educate agencies on ways to notify supervisors  that an individual\u2019s probationary period is ending and that the supervisor  needs to make a decision about the individual\u2019s performance and also to  determine whether there are occupations in which the probationary period  should extend beyond 1-year to provide supervisors with sufficient time to  assess an individual\u2019s performance.

As a result, officials said agency  decision makers often did not seek out and draw upon the expertise of  human capital experts to inform their deliberations. Perhaps further  reflecting the varying capabilities of agency human capital offices across  government, some CHCOs at the time said that agency leaders did not  fully understand the potential for strategic human capital management  and had not elevated the role of the human capital office to better support  an agency\u2019s operations and mission.", "The human resources specialist occupation continues to be one of six  government-wide, mission-critical skills gap areas identified by OPM.

Among other things, we found that the  recruitment and retention challenges VHA is experiencing with its clinical  workforce are due, in part to attrition among its human resource  employees and unmet staffing targets within medical center personnel  offices. We concluded that until VHA strengthens its human resource  capacity, it will not be positioned to effectively support its mission to serve  veterans\u2019 healthcare needs. We made 12 recommendations to Veterans  Affairs (VA) to improve the human resource capacity and oversight of  human resource functions at its medical centers; develop a modern,  credible employee performance management system; and establish clear  accountability for efforts to improve employee engagement.
