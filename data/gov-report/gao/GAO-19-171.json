For example, OEC's and FEMA's memorandum of agreement and standard operating procedures articulate their agreement in formal documents, define their respective responsibilities, and include relevant participants. During this review, the agencies established a process to monitor and assess grantees' compliance with the grant guidance. However, because the grants for 2018 were not yet awarded at the time of GAO's review, GAO was unable to assess the effectiveness of the new process.", "OEC incorporates the First Responder Network Authority's (FirstNet) nationwide public-safety broadband network and other emerging technologies into various offerings such as written guidance, governance planning, and technical assistance.

According to federal internal control standards, management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives and periodically assess its methods of communication so that the organization has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information on a timely basis. Some SWIC survey respondents and public-safety representatives identified an opportunity for OEC to improve its methods of communication. For example, 26 of the 54 SWICs responded that OEC could use additional tools or approaches, such as social media, for improving communication with its stakeholders. In addition, public-safety officials reported that they have missed training because they were unaware of opportunities.

For example, first responders  use public-safety communications systems to gather information,  coordinate a response, and request additional resources and assistance  from neighboring jurisdictions and the federal government. OEC has  taken a number of steps aimed at supporting and promoting the ability of  public-safety officials to communicate in emergencies and work toward  operable and interoperable emergency communications nationwide. OEC  develops policy and guidance supporting emergency communications  across all levels of government and across various types of emerging  technologies such as broadband, Wi-Fi, and NextGen 911, among others.  OEC also provides technical assistance\u2014including training, tools, and  online and on-site assistance\u2014for federal, state, local, and tribal first  responders. First responders use different communications systems,  such as land mobile radio (LMR), commercial wireless services, and  FirstNet\u2019s network.", "LMR: These systems are the primary means for first responders to  use voice communications to gather and share information while  conducting their daily operations and coordinating their emergency  response efforts. LMR systems are intended to provide secure,  reliable voice communications in a variety of environments, scenarios,  and emergencies. Across the nation, there are thousands of  separate LMR systems.", "Commercial wireless services: Public-safety entities often pay for  commercial wireless services to send data transmissions such as  location information, images, and video. Some jurisdictions also use  commercial wireless services for voice communications.", "Nationwide dedicated-broadband network: Consistent with the law,  FirstNet is working to establish a nationwide dedicated network for  public-safety use that is intended to foster greater interoperability,  support important data transmissions, and meet public-safety officials\u2019  reliability needs. In creating FirstNet in 2012, Congress provided it  with $7 billion in federal funds for the network\u2019s initial build-out and  valuable spectrum for the network to operate on. Unlike current LMR  systems, the devices operating on FirstNet\u2019s network will use the  same radio frequency band nationwide. It is expected that these  devices will be interoperable among first responders using the  network because the devices will be built using the same open, non- proprietary, commercially available standards.", "Communications systems must work together, or be interoperable, even  though the systems or equipment vendors may differ. The interoperability  of emergency communications enables first responders and public-safety  officials to use their radios and other equipment to communicate with  each other across agencies and jurisdictions when needed and as  authorized, as shown in figure 1.", "OEC is tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive  national approach to advance interoperable communications  capabilities. For example, according to OEC, it supports and promotes  communications used by emergency responders and government officials  and leads the nation\u2019s operable and interoperable public-safety and  national security/emergency preparedness communications efforts. OEC  notes that it plays a key role in ensuring federal, state, local, tribal, and  territorial agencies have the necessary plans, resources, and training  needed to support operable and interoperable emergency  communications. To help in this effort, OEC instituted a coordination  program that established regional coordinators across the nation.  According to OEC, its coordinators work to build trusted relationships,  enhance collaboration, and stimulate the sharing of best practices and  information between all levels of government, critical infrastructure  owners and operators, and key non-government organizations.", "OEC developed the National Emergency Communications Plan in 2008  and worked with federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions to update it in  2014 to reflect an evolving communications environment. The long-term  vision of the plan\u2014which OEC views as the nation\u2019s current strategic plan  for emergency communications\u2014is to enable the nation\u2019s emergency- response community to communicate and share information across all  levels of government, jurisdictions, disciplines, and organizations for all  threats and hazards, as needed and when authorized.", "To help it accomplish this mission, OEC works with three emergency  communications advisory groups: SAFECOM, the Emergency  Communications Preparedness Center (ECPC), and the National Council  of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (NCSWIC). These  organizations promote the interoperability of emergency communications  systems by focusing on technologies including, but not limited to, LMR  and satellite technology.", "SAFECOM: According to the 2018 SAFECOM Strategic Plan,  SAFECOM develops products and completes a range of activities  each year in support of its vision and mission, including providing a  national view of public-safety priorities and challenges, developing  resources and tools aligned to the 2014 National Emergency  Communications Plan, and collaborating with partner organizations to  promote the interoperability of emergency communications. One of  the products developed by SAFECOM each year is the Guidance on  Emergency Communications Grants. SAFECOM consists of more  than 50 members that represent local, tribal, and state governments;  federal agencies; state emergency responders; and intergovernmental  and national public-safety organizations.", "ECPC: The ECPC is an interagency collaborative group that provides  a venue for coordinating federal emergency-communications efforts.  The ECPC works to improve coordination and information sharing  among federal emergency-communications programs. The ECPC  does this by serving as the focal point for emergency communications  issues across the federal agencies; supporting the coordination of  federal programs, such as grant programs; and serving as a clearing  house for emergency communications information, among other  responsibilities. The ECPC has 14 member agencies that are  responsible for setting its priorities.", "NCSWIC: This council consists of SWICs and their alternates from 50  states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. According to  SAFECOM, NCSWIC develops products and services to assist the  SWICs with leveraging their relationships, professional knowledge,  and experience with public-safety partners involved in interoperable  communications at all levels of government.", "Additionally, in 2013, FirstNet established the PSAC to provide advice to  FirstNet. The committee is composed of members who represent local,  tribal, and state public-safety organizations; federal agencies; and  national public-safety organizations.", "FEMA is responsible for coordinating government-wide disaster response  efforts, including on-the-ground emergency communications support and  some technical assistance. For example, FEMA\u2019s regional emergency- communications coordinator is responsible for providing emergency  communications assistance on an as-needed basis and coordinating  FEMA\u2019s tactical communications support during a disaster or emergency.  FEMA also provides a range of grant assistance to state, local, tribal, and  territorial entities, including preparedness grants that can be used for  emergency communications.", "As noted above, in November 2018, legislation was signed into law that  reorganized and renamed NPPD and OEC. Previously, OEC was one of  five divisions under the Office of Cyber Security and Communications  which in turn was one of five divisions within NPPD. However, NPPD has  been renamed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and  OEC was renamed the Emergency Communications Division and was  elevated to one of three direct reporting divisions within the new agency.

Specifically, OEC and FEMA officials told us  FEMA is responsible for administering the grants, and OEC coordinates  emergency communications grant guidance annually through  SAFECOM\u2019s Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants. We  reviewed OEC\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s collaborative efforts related to grant  guidance and found that their efforts generally follow our previously  identified leading practices for effective interagency collaboration, as  described below.", "Written Guidance and Agreements. Agencies that formally  document their agreements can strengthen their commitment to  working collaboratively. OEC and FEMA formalized their  coordination efforts for interoperable emergency communications  grants in a memorandum of agreement in 2014. This memorandum  assigned OEC and FEMA responsibilities and established a joint  working group to develop standard operating procedures, which OEC  said were drafted the following year but not formally approved by  FEMA, that govern coordination between the agencies. We also  reported that written agreements are most effective when the  collaborators regularly monitor and update them. When we started  our review, OEC and FEMA officials told us that they had not updated  the memorandum of agreement, which included the draft standard  operating procedures as an appendix. However, the agencies  approved an updated memorandum of agreement and standard  operating procedures, and OEC provided them to us in July 2018.", "Leadership. When buy-in is required from multiple agencies,  involving leadership from each can convey the agencies\u2019 support for  the collaborative effort. According to OEC and FEMA officials, their  grants coordination efforts include high-level leadership. Specifically,  senior leaders from both agencies signed the 2014 and 2018  memorandums of agreement. Also, OEC officials told us that their  leaders in the grants program office are responsible for overseeing  the collaborative effort.", "Bridging Organizational Culture. Collaborating agencies should  establish ways to operate across agency boundaries and address  their different organizational cultures. OEC and FEMA operate  across agency boundaries in several ways. First, both agencies told  us that they participate in the ECPC Grants Focus Group, whose  members coordinate across federal grant programs to support  interoperable emergency communications. The group reviews  SAFECOM guidance and, according to FEMA officials, meets on a  quarterly basis. Second, OEC officials said the agencies foster open  lines of direct communication via conference calls, e-mail  correspondence, and in-person meetings. OEC and FEMA officials  told us their communications include sharing and reviewing language  in FEMA\u2019s notices that announce grant opportunities and OEC\u2019s  SAFECOM guidance. Third, the agencies said that OEC officials  conduct emergency-communications-related trainings and briefings  for FEMA at least once a year. According to OEC officials, these  trainings have included a discussion on the movement toward  broadband and FirstNet. Finally, FEMA officials told us that their  program analysts have attended conferences with OEC to speak to  the SWICs about grant programs. They said the program analysts  explained how the grant money can be leveraged to support projects  within the individual states and answered questions about the grants.  OEC officials said having FEMA attend conferences to discuss  specific grant information is useful for public-safety stakeholders.", "Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities. Collaborating agencies can  get clarity when they define and agree upon their respective roles and  responsibilities. As part of the 2014 and 2018 memorandums of  agreement, OEC and FEMA established clear responsibilities for how  each agency will support the grants coordination effort. For example,  both offices were responsible for assigning experienced program staff  and contributing to the development of standard operating procedures  by attending meetings and conducting research. Also, the standard  operating procedures clarify how OEC and FEMA will share  information, solicit input on grants guidance language, and review  grant applications.", "Participants. Including relevant participants helps ensure individuals  with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities will contribute to the  collaborative effort. OEC and FEMA identify points of contact in their  memorandums of agreement. According to OEC officials, they did not  always work with the correct FEMA staff before the 2014  memorandum was developed. Also, FEMA officials told us that their  grants program staff who participate in the coordination effort with  OEC perform those specific responsibilities as a collateral duty on an  as needed basis. According to OEC officials, OEC\u2019s performance  plans outline coordination with FEMA and areas related to the  agencies\u2019 memorandum of agreement for the staff who handle grant  issues. OEC and FEMA officials said participants\u2019 responsibilities  include serving as technical subject matter experts and reviewing  language for grants guidance and notices of funding opportunities.", "Resources. Collaborating agencies should identify the human,  financial, and technological resources they need to initiate or sustain  their efforts. OEC and FEMA staff their collaborative effort with  employees from their grants offices to address their human resource  needs. These employees perform work related to emergency  communications grants as outlined in their performance plans or as a  collateral duty. The agencies also provide OEC access to FEMA\u2019s  non-disaster grants system to share grantee information. According to  OEC and FEMA officials, their collaboration efforts do not require  either agency to obligate funds or use special technology, such as  online information-sharing tools.", "Outcomes and Accountability. Collaborating agencies that create a  means to monitor and evaluate their efforts can better identify areas  for improvement. According to OEC and FEMA documentation, the  primary goal of the draft standard operating procedures was to  prevent grantees from improperly using federal funds, such as  purchasing equipment that is not interoperable. OEC officials said the  biggest gap in those standard operating procedures was that they did  not include a monitoring program to ensure grantees were compliant  with grant guidance, which include requirements for interoperability.  OEC\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s July 2018 standard operating procedures  established a process to track and monitor grantee compliance. They  also identified a process for assessing the information they collect and  how it will be shared among OEC and FEMA, and when appropriate,  other stakeholders. At the time of our review, OEC and FEMA officials  told us they had not implemented the monitoring procedures because  the grants for the 2018 grant cycle were not yet awarded. Accordingly,  we could not evaluate the effectiveness of the new procedures to  monitor and assess grantee compliance, and without conducting such  an evaluation, we could not determine whether OEC\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s  efforts align with the key practice in this area. Senior officials from  both agencies said the monitoring procedures would be updated if  they do not work as intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OEC Incorporates FirstNet\u2019s Network and Emerging Technologies into Its Plans and Offerings", "paragraphs": ["After being established in 2007, OEC initially focused on enhancing the  interoperability and continuity of LMR systems.

Additionally, OEC\u2019s technical assistance offerings for emergency  communications technology have evolved over time as new technologies  have come into use. For example, OEC\u2019s technical assistance catalog  contains new or enhanced offerings on topics related to broadband issues  such as FirstNet\u2019s network, Next Generation 911, alerts and warnings,  and incident management.", "In 2014, DHS released its second National Emergency Communications  Plan, which identified the need to focus on broadband technologies,  including FirstNet\u2019s nationwide public-safety broadband network. One of  the plan\u2019s top priorities is \u201censuring emergency responders and  government officials plan and prepare for the adoption, integration, and  use of broadband technologies, including the planning and deployment of  the nationwide public-safety broadband network.\u201d To meet this priority,  OEC officials told us that they provide stakeholders with a wide range of  products and services to help prepare for the adoption, integration, and  use of broadband. For instance, officials said that they leverage OEC\u2019s  governance groups\u2014SAFECOM, NCSWIC, and ECPC\u2014to develop  products and services and to identify specific challenges and  requirements regarding broadband. Additionally, OEC officials told us that  they coordinate regularly with FirstNet staff and invite FirstNet to meet  and brief the stakeholder community on the latest deployment  information. However, OEC officials told us that FirstNet\u2019s network is one  option available to public-safety and government officials to access  broadband communications and information sharing and explained that  OEC maintains a neutral position for all technologies and vendors.  Accordingly, OEC is not responsible for promoting any vendor solutions,  including FirstNet\u2019s network, and there is no requirement for OEC to do  so. Additionally, five of six OEC coordinators we interviewed told us that  FirstNet\u2019s network is only one of several emergency-communications  technology options and that OEC should continue to provide information  to public-safety stakeholders regarding other providers. For example,  there are commercial carriers that provide wireless broadband services,  and we have previously reported that these commercial carriers could  choose to compete with FirstNet.", "According to OEC officials, prior to the start of each fiscal year, OEC  engages with stakeholders to gather feedback on new or revised  technical assistance offerings, as well as updates to existing plans and  documents. OEC officials told us that they expect an increase in technical  assistance requests that focus on issues related to mobile data use,  broadband governance, standard operating procedures, and policies and  procedures. According to OEC officials, OEC has delivered more than  2,000 technical-assistance-training courses and workshops since 2007,  and OEC will continually update its technical assistance offerings to  incorporate new modes of communications and technologies into training,  exercises, and standard operating procedures for its stakeholders.", "The majority (7 of 10) of public-safety organizations that we interviewed  told us that OEC sufficiently incorporates information regarding FirstNet\u2019s  network into its guidance and offerings. For example, officials from 6 of 10  organizations that we interviewed told us that OEC must strike a balance  between FirstNet\u2019s network and other emerging technologies, and that  OEC has successfully accomplished this task. Additionally, the majority of  SWICs responded to our survey that it is at least moderately important for  OEC to incorporate the FirstNet network and emerging technologies into  its written guidance, technical assistance offerings, training opportunities,  workshops, and grant guidance, Furthermore, in most cases, SWICs  responded that OEC has incorporated FirstNet\u2019s network and emerging  technologies into these areas, as follows:", "FirstNet network.

For example, 45 of 54 (83 percent) of  SWICs we surveyed reported that OEC will likely have a large or  moderate role for ensuring interoperable emergency communications  once FirstNet\u2019s network is fully operational. Additionally, nearly all (9 of  10) of public-safety organizations we interviewed said that they believe  OEC will continue to play an important role in ensuring interoperable  emergency communications after the implementation of FirstNet\u2019s  network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OEC Has Not Assessed Its Methods for Communicating with External Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["OEC is required to conduct extensive nationwide outreach to support and  promote interoperable emergency-communications capabilities by state,  regional, local, and tribal governments and public-safety agencies in the  event of natural disasters and acts of terrorism and other man-made  disasters. According to federal standards for internal control,  management should externally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. This includes  communicating with external parties and using the appropriate methods  of communication. The federal standards state that management should  periodically assess the entity\u2019s methods of communication so that the  organization has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information  throughout and outside of the entity on a timely basis.", "Most public-safety organizations we interviewed told us that OEC  communicates with their organization frequently through committee  meetings and other means. For example, 9 of the 10 organizations told us  that a key form of communication between their organization and OEC is  participation in emergency-communications advisory groups such as  SAFECOM, NCSWIC, and PSAC. Furthermore, OEC officials reported  that OEC\u2019s guidance documents, plans, tools, and technical assistance  offerings are formally provided to the public-safety community through the  SAFECOM, NCSWIC, and ECPC distribution lists. Governing body  representatives then distribute the information to their organizations and  stakeholders. These documents are also available on DHS\u2019s website.

For example,  approximately one quarter (26 percent) of SWICs said that OEC does not  communicate training well, and these SWICs reported that they are either  unaware of OEC training opportunities related to FirstNet\u2019s network and  other emerging technologies, or that they mostly learn about OEC training  opportunities from other sources. See figure 5 below for additional survey  information regarding SWICs\u2019 views on how well OEC communicates  training opportunities related to FirstNet\u2019s network and other emerging  technologies.", "Also with respect to OEC\u2019s communication efforts with stakeholders, four  of six OEC coordinators and 3 of 10 public-safety organizations we  interviewed, along with 26 of 54 (48 percent) of the SWICs we surveyed,  identified the need for OEC to use additional tools or approaches for  improving communication with SWICs and the public-safety community.  For example, one coordinator said that there are public-safety  stakeholders who are unaware of OEC. Similarly, representatives from a  public-safety organization we interviewed told us that OEC should help  public-safety stakeholders better understand what OEC does. Both the  OEC coordinator and public-safety stakeholders in these examples  identified the need for OEC to use social media to improve public-safety  stakeholders\u2019 understanding of OEC and its offerings. Additionally, an  OEC coordinator told us that each region is different, and unless there is  an OEC coordinator who is proactive about communicating information to  the public-safety community, then important information does not get out  to the appropriate people. The coordinator also said that it is difficult to  communicate information to all of the needed stakeholders because he is  solely responsible for communicating with many public-safety entities and  jurisdictions within multiple states. Furthermore, a SWIC reported that  other organizations use social media for communicating during disasters  and for notifying interested parties about events and trainings, and that  OEC should do the same. OEC officials told us that NPPD recently  established a Twitter account that OEC has used to increase awareness  of programs, products, and services. However, since the establishment of  the account in February 2018 through September 2018, only 23 of  NPPD\u2019s 280 tweets and retweets (8.2 percent) made mention of OEC, 15  of which occurred in March 2018.", "In addition to social media, some public-safety organizations and SWICs  identified additional tools or approaches that OEC could use to improve  communication with the public-safety community. These tools and  approaches include designating an intergovernmental specialist or liaison  within OEC to coordinate with public-safety stakeholders, developing  additional regional-focused meetings such as conferences and  workshops, and creating online or distance-learning opportunities (e.g.,  online training, webinars, online chat or bulletin board services, etc.).", "Although OEC officials told us that they employ mechanisms to  understand the effectiveness of OEC\u2019s programs, products, and services,  we found OEC has not specifically assessed its methods of  communication. For example, OEC analyzes feedback forms provided at  meetings and stakeholder engagements, gathers direct input from  stakeholders through in-person and phone discussions and e-mail, tracks  the open rate of e-mails and website and blog post traffic, and reviews  social media analytics for specific event campaigns. At the time of our  review, OEC officials told us that they were developing a formal  performance-management program to measure the impact of OEC\u2019s  programs on the public-safety and national security/emergency  preparedness communities. However, these broad efforts aimed at  reviewing the overall programs are not designed for the specific purpose  of assessing OEC\u2019s methods of communication, and OEC does not have  any plans in place for doing so.", "Lacking an assessment of its methods of communication, OEC may be  missing opportunities to learn which tools and approaches are the most  effective and to use those to deliver timely information to public-safety  stakeholders. As noted above, this can result in public-safety officials  missing trainings or not receiving other helpful information. Furthermore,  not using additional methods of communication or tools could contribute  to uncertainty among the public-safety community about OEC\u2019s mission  and its efforts to improve the interoperability of emergency  communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OEC has multiple efforts supporting interoperable emergency  communications that the public-safety community relies on to better  respond to emergency situations.

We  assessed OEC\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s actions against the seven key  considerations for interagency collaborations. We also interviewed OEC  and FEMA Grant Programs Directorate officials who have responsibilities  for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants. We asked them to  discuss their approach to interagency collaboration, including the process  to jointly develop grant guidance language. We asked agency officials  questions that were based on the key considerations for implementing  interagency collaborative mechanisms that we identified in a prior report.", "To determine how OEC has incorporated FirstNet\u2019s network and other  emerging technologies into its plans and offerings, we reviewed relevant  OEC documentation, including fact sheets and technical assistance  guides. We also reviewed the 2014 National Emergency Communications  Plan (NECP) and OEC\u2019s March 2017 biennial report to Congress on the  progress toward meeting NECP goals. We interviewed OEC  headquarters officials about the agency\u2019s efforts to date, including how  OEC develops its offerings and workshops and communicates this  information to the public-safety community. We also interviewed 6 of 10  OEC coordinators using a semi-structured interview format to get on-the- ground perspectives from OEC staff who serve as points of contact for  public-safety stakeholders. We selected OEC coordinators to achieve  variety across geography, population density, tribal presence, and  territory representation. We interviewed OEC coordinators to obtain their  perspectives as subject matter experts, but their views should not be  attributed to OEC\u2019s official agency position.", "In addition, to obtain stakeholders\u2019 views on OEC\u2019s efforts to incorporate  FirstNet\u2019s network and other emerging technologies into plans and  offerings, we surveyed all 54 statewide interoperability coordinators  (SWIC) from 48 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. We  obtained a list of SWICs from DHS and confirmed additional contact  information via e-mail. We conducted a web-based survey to learn  SWICs\u2019 perspectives on issues including the importance of incorporating  FirstNet\u2019s network and other emerging technologies into OEC\u2019s plans and  offerings, OEC\u2019s communication with the public-safety community, and  SWICs\u2019 level of satisfaction with OEC\u2019s efforts. To ensure the survey  questions were clear and accurately addressed the relevant terms and  concepts, we pretested the survey with SWICs from three states: Illinois,  Massachusetts, and Texas. These SWICs were selected to get  perspectives from officials who have served in the role for at least several  years and SWICs who are new to the position. We administered our  survey from May 2018 to July 2018 and received 54 responses for a 100  percent response rate.", "We also used a semi-structured interview format to obtain views from  representatives from 10 public-safety organizations who have expertise in  public-safety and federal emergency-communications efforts (see table  1). To identify relevant organizations, we reviewed our prior report that  identified 34 organizations that are members of both OEC\u2019s SAFECOM  advisory group and FirstNet\u2019s Public Safety Advisory Committee (PSAC).  We researched the members to help determine the extent to which each  organization is involved in issues related to our review. We selected 10  public-safety organizations to interview on the basis of: (1) this research,  (2) information from DHS, and (3) a literature review. Because one  association declined our request for an interview, we contacted and  interviewed another relevant organization from the original list of 34  member organizations. The views shared by the representatives we  interviewed are not generalizable to all public-safety organizations that  interact with OEC; however, we were able to secure the participation of  organizations that focus on various public-safety issues across federal,  state, local, and tribal jurisdictions and thus believe their views provide a  balanced and informed perspective on the topics discussed.", "To evaluate the extent that OEC has assessed its methods of  communication, we reviewed OEC\u2019s documentation for collecting  stakeholders\u2019 feedback.
