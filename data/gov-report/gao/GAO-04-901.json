Individual projects have suffered cost increases, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls of large proportions, leading GAO to designate the program a high-risk information technology initiative in 1995. Because the program remains a high risk initiative, GAO was requested to assess FAA's progress in several information technology management areas. This report, one in a series responding to that request, has two objectives: (1) to evaluate FAA's capabilities for developing and acquiring software and systems on its ATC modernization program and (2) to assess the actions FAA has under way to improve these capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FAA has made progress in improving its capabilities for acquiring software-intensive systems, but some areas still need improvement. GAO had previously reported in 1997 that FAA's processes for acquiring software were ad hoc and sometimes chaotic. Focusing on four mission critical air traffic projects, GAO's current review assessed system and software management practices in numerous key areas such as project planning, risk management, and requirements development. GAO found that these projects were generally performing most of the desired practices: of the 900 individual practices evaluated, 83 percent were largely or fully implemented. The projects were generally strong in several areas such as project planning, requirements management, and identifying technical solutions. However, there were recurring weaknesses in the areas of measurement and analysis, quality assurance, and verification. These weaknesses hinder FAA from consistently and effectively managing its mission critical systems and increase the risk of cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. To improve its software and system management capabilities, FAA has undertaken a rigorous process improvement initiative. In response to earlier GAO recommendations, in 1999, FAA established a centralized process improvement office, which has worked to help FAA organizations and projects to improve processes through the use of a standard model, the integrated Capability Maturity Model. This model, which is a broad model that integrates multiple maturity models, is used to assess the maturity of FAA's software and systems capabilities. The projects that have adopted the model have demonstrated growth in the maturity of their processes, and more and more projects have adopted the model. However, the agency does not require the use of this process improvement method. To date, less than half of FAA's major ATC projects have used this method, and the recurring weaknesses we identified in our project-specific evaluations are due in part to the choices these projects were given in deciding whether to and how to adopt this process improvement initiative. Further, as a result of reorganizing its ATC organizations to a performance-based organization, FAA is reconsidering prior policies, and it is not yet clear that process improvement will continue to be a priority. Without a strong senior-level commitment to process improvement and a consistent, institutionalized approach to implementing and evaluating it, FAA cannot ensure that key projects will continue to improve systems acquisition and development capabilities. As a result, FAA will continue to risk the project management problems--including cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls--that have plagued past acquisitions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The accompanying report is one in a series of reports responding to your  request that we review the information technology management processes  that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses to manage its air  traffic control modernization.

In fact, FAA\u2019s iCMM served  as a demonstration for the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s effort to  integrate various models into its own Capability Maturity Model Integration  (CMMI).", "The Chief Information Officer\u2019s process improvement office also developed  and sponsored iCMM-related training, and by late 2003, it had trained over  7,000 participants. The training offered ranges from overviews on how to  use the model to more focused courses in such specific process areas as  quality assurance, configuration management, and project management.  The office also guides FAA organizations in using the model and leads  appraisal teams in evaluating the process maturity of the projects and  organizations that adopted the model.", "In addition to the Chief Information Officer\u2013sponsored process  improvement efforts, several of FAA\u2019s business areas, including the  business areas with responsibility for air traffic control (ATC) system  acquisitions and operations, endorsed and set goals for process  improvement activities using the iCMM. As a result, there has been a  continuing growth over the years in the number of individual projects and  umbrella organizations that adopted process improvement and the iCMM  model. Specifically, the number of projects and organizations (which  account for multiple projects) undergoing iCMM appraisals grew from 1  project in 1997, to 28 projects and 3 organizations by 2000, to 39 projects  and 11 organizations by 2003.", "These projects and organizations have demonstrated improvements in  process maturity. Under the iCMM model, in addition to achieving  capability levels in individual process areas, entities can achieve successive  maturity levels by demonstrating capabilities in a core set of process  areas.

To date,  14 projects and three organizations have achieved iCMM maturity level 2,  and one project and two organizations have achieved iCMM maturity level  3.

These findings are  reiterated by the Software Engineering Institute in its recent study of the  benefits of using the CMMI model for process improvement. According to  that study, organizations that implement such process improvements can  achieve better project cost and schedule performance and higher quality  products. Specifically, of the 12 cases that the Software Engineering  Institute assessed, there were   nine examples of cost related benefits, including reductions in the cost  to find and fix a defect, and in overall cost savings;  eight cases of schedule related benefits, including decreased time  needed to complete tasks and increased predictability in meeting  schedules;  five cases of measurable improvements in quality, mostly related to  reducing defects over time;  three cases of improvements in customer satisfaction; and  three cases showing positive return on investment from their CMMI- based process improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Not Yet Institutionalized Process Improvement in Its ATC Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations have found that in order to achieve advanced system  management capabilities and to gain the benefits of more mature  processes, an organization needs to institutionalize process improvement.

Specifically, FAA\u2019s acquisition  policy calls for continuous process improvement and endorses the use of  the iCMM model. Also, the former air traffic organizations set annual goals  for improving maturity using the iCMM model in selected projects and  process areas. For example, in 1997, the former ATC acquisition  organization set a goal of having 11 selected projects achieve iCMM  maturity level 2 by 1999 and maturity level 3 by 2001. While the projects did  not meet the 1999 goal, several projects achieved level 2 in 2000, and most  made improvements in selected process areas.", "However, FAA did not institutionalize the use of the iCMM model  throughout the organization and, as a result, individual projects\u2019 use and  application of the model has been voluntary.

Some of the mission critical  systems that have not sought appraisals include an advanced radar system  and air traffic information processing system.", "Another result of this voluntary approach is that individual projects are  making uneven progress in core areas. For example, the four projects that  we appraised ranged from capability levels 0 to 2 in the risk management  process area: in other words, projects varied from performing only part of  the basic process, to performing the basic process, to actively managing the  process. As another example, all four of the projects we appraised captured  some metrics on their performance. However, these metrics varied greatly  from project to project in depth, scope, and usefulness.
