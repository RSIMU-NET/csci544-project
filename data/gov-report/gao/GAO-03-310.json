It represents a foundation of the nation's retirement income system and provides millions of Americans with disability insurance and survivors' benefits. Over the long term, as the baby boom generation retires, Social Security's financing shortfall presents a major solvency and sustainability challenge. Numerous reform proposals have been put forward in recent years, and in December 2001 a commission appointed by the President presented three possible reform models. Senator Breaux, Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, asked GAO to use its analytic framework to evaluate the Commission's models. This framework consists of three criteria: (1) the extent to which a proposal achieves sustainable solvency and how it would affect the economy and the federal budget; (2) the balance struck between the twin goals of income adequacy and individual equity; and (3) how readily such changes could be implemented, administered, and explained to the public."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Applying GAO's criteria to the Commission models highlights key options and trade-offs between efforts to achieve sustainable solvency and maintain adequate retirement income for current and future beneficiaries. For example, the Commission's Model 2 proposal reduces Social Security's defined benefit from currently scheduled levels through various formula changes, provides enhanced benefits for low-wage workers and spousal survivors, and adds a voluntary individual account option in exchange for a benefit reduction. Model 2 would provide for sustainable solvency and reduce the shares of the federal budget and the economy devoted to Social Security compared to currently scheduled benefits (tax increase benchmark) regardless of how many individuals selected accounts. However, with universal account participation, general revenue funding would be needed for about 3 decades. GAO's analysis of benefit adequacy and equity issues relating to Model 2 found that (1) across cohorts, median monthly benefits for those choosing accounts are always higher, despite a benefit offset, than for those who do not; this gap grows over time. In addition, benefits assuming universal account participation are higher than payment of a defined benefit generally corresponding to an amount payable from future Social Security trust fund revenues (benefit reduction benchmark). However, benefits received by those without accounts fall below the benchmark over time. (2) for the lowest quintile, median monthly benefits with universal participation in the accounts tend to be higher than GAO's benefit reduction benchmark, likely due to the enhanced benefit for full-time \"minimum wage\" workers. This pattern becomes more pronounced across the cohorts analyzed. (3) regardless of whether an account is chosen, many people could receive monthly benefits under Model 2 that are higher than the benefit reduction benchmark. However, a minority could fare worse. Some people could also receive a benefit greater than under the tax increase benchmark although a majority could fare worse. Benefits for those choosing individual accounts will be sensitive to the actual rates of return earned by those accounts. Adding individual accounts would require new administrative structures, adding complexity and cost. Public education will be key to help beneficiaries make sound decisions about account participation, investment diversification, and risk. Finally, any Social Security reform proposal must also be looked at in the context of both the program and the long-term budget outlook. A funding gap exists between promised and funded Social Security benefits which, although it will not occur for a number of years, is significant and will grow over time. In addition, GAO's long-term budget simulations show, difficult choices will be required to reconcile a large and growing gap between projected revenues and spending resulting primarily from known demographic trends and rising health care costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we apply our criteria for  assessing Social Security reform proposals to the reform models  developed by the President\u2019s Commission to Strengthen Social Security.  Each of the Commission\u2019s three reform models represents a different  approach to including a voluntary individual account option to Social  Security. Model 1 does not restore solvency and accordingly is not  analyzed in this report. In April 2002, we provided your staff with a  briefing on our preliminary results for Model 2. This report contains our  final results, focusing on Model 2, with results for Model 3 presented in  Appendix I.", "We based our interpretation of the Commission\u2019s reform models in large  part on the memorandum provided by the Office of the Chief Actuary at  the Social Security Administration (SSA) dated January 31, 2002, that  estimated the reform models\u2019 effects on the Social Security program. Our  interpretation also draws on the Commission\u2019s final report. As agreed with  your office, our report is based on the analytic framework we have used in  past work to evaluate Social Security reform proposals. That framework  consists of three basic criteria:  the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency and how it  would affect the U.S. economy and the federal budget,  the balance struck between the twin goals of income adequacy (level and  certainty of benefits) and individual equity (rates of return on individual  contributions), and    how readily such changes could be implemented, administered, and  explained to the public.  In evaluating proposals against the three basic criteria, we used a set of  detailed questions that help describe potential effects of reform models on  important policy and operational aspects of public concern. These  questions are displayed in the report.", "Our analysis of the Commission reform models included comparison with  three benchmarks:    The \u201cbenefit reduction benchmark\u201d assumes a gradual reduction in the  currently scheduled Social Security defined benefit beginning with those  newly eligible for retirement in 2005. Current tax rates are maintained.", "The \u201ctax increase benchmark\u201d assumes an increase in the OASDI payroll  tax beginning in 2002 sufficient to achieve an actuarial balance over the  75-year period. Currently scheduled benefits are maintained.", "The \u201cbaseline extended\u201d benchmark is a fiscal policy path developed in  our earlier long-term model work that assumes payment in full of currently  scheduled Social Security benefits and no other changes in current  spending or tax policies.", "To show the range of possible outcomes given the voluntary nature of  individual accounts in the Commission models, we simulated each model  assuming (1) no participation (0%) in the individual account option and   (2) universal participation (100%) in the account option. Actual experience  would likely fall between these bounds but cannot be predicted with any  degree of certainty.", "As you requested, we used our long-term economic model in assessing  Commission reform models against the first criterion, that of financing  sustainable solvency. Although any proposal\u2019s ability to achieve and  sustain solvency is sensitive to economic and budgetary assumptions,  using a common framework can facilitate comparisons of alternative  reform proposals. Our sustainable solvency standard encompasses several  different ways of looking at the Social Security program\u2019s financing needs.  While 75-year actuarial balance is generally used in evaluating the long- term financial outlook of the Social Security program and reform  proposals, it is not sufficient in gauging the program\u2019s solvency after the  75th year. For example, under the Trustees\u2019 intermediate assumptions,  each year the 75-year actuarial period changes, and a year with a surplus is  replaced by a new 75th year that has a significant deficit. As a result,  changes made to restore trust fund solvency only for the 75-year period  can result in future actuarial imbalances almost immediately. Reform  plans that lead to sustainable solvency would be those that consider the  broader issues of fiscal sustainability and affordability over the long term.", "To examine how the Commission reform models balance adequacy and  equity concerns, we used the GEMINI model, a dynamic microsimulation  model for analyzing the lifetime implications of Social Security policies for  a large sample of people born in the same year. GEMINI can simulate  different reform features, including individual accounts with an offset, for  their effects on the level and distribution of benefits. To avoid having the  extremely high returns of a small portion of participants skew the average,  we present most of our statistics as medians. To assess benefit adequacy,  we display median monthly benefit levels for the 1955, 1970, and 1985 birth  cohorts to enable comparisons over time; initial benefits by earnings  quintile, comparing the lowest and highest quintiles; and the effects on the  distribution of initial benefits within each cohort.", "To examine how the Commission reform models provide for reasonable  implementation and communication of any changes, we used qualitative  analysis based on GAO\u2019s issued and ongoing body of work on Social  Security reform. This work addresses various issues raised by reform  approaches, including establishing individual accounts, raising the  retirement age, and the impact of reforms on minorities and women.", "Models 2 and 3 restore solvency to the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance  and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds through a combination of  changes in the initial benefit calculation, general revenue transfers, and/or  benefit offsets for those who choose to participate in the individual  account option. Model 3 requires an additional contribution equal to 1  percent of taxable payroll under the voluntary individual account option.

However, this  would not begin until the middle of this century. Relative to both GAO\u2019s  benefit reduction benchmark and tax increase benchmark, unified  surpluses would be lower and unified deficits higher throughout the  simulation period under Model 2-100%. Model 2-0% would reduce  budgetary pressures due to Social Security beginning around 2015 relative  to baseline extended. This fiscal outlook under Model 2-0% is very similar  to the fiscal outlook under GAO\u2019s benefit reduction benchmark.", "Under Model 2-100%, the government\u2019s cash requirement (as a share of  GDP) to fund the individual accounts and the reduced defined benefit  would be about 20 percent higher initially than under both the baseline  extended and tax increase benchmarks. This differential gradually  narrows until the 2030s, after which less cash would be required under  model 2-100%. By 2075, Model 2-100% would require about 40 percent less  cash than the baseline extended and tax increase benchmarks.", "Viewed from the perspective of the economy, total payments (Social  Security defined benefits plus benefit from individual accounts) as a share  of GDP would gradually fall under Model 2-100% relative to the baseline  extended and tax increase benchmarks. In 2075, the share of the economy  absorbed by payments to retirees from the Social Security system as a  whole under Model 2-100% would be roughly 20 percent lower than the  baseline extended or tax increase benchmark and roughly the same as  under the benefit reduction benchmark.", "With regard to national saving, Model 2 increases net national saving on a  first order basis primarily due to the proposed benefit reductions. The  individual account provision does not increase national saving on a first  order basis; the redirection of the payroll taxes to finance the individual  accounts reduces government saving by the same amount that the  individual accounts increase private saving.  Beyond these first order effects, the actual net effect of a proposal on  national saving is difficult to estimate due to uncertainties in predicting  changes in future spending and revenue policies of the government as well  as changes in the saving behavior of private households and individuals.  For example, the lower surpluses and higher deficits that result from  redirecting payroll taxes to individual accounts could lead to changes in  federal fiscal policy that would increase national saving. However,  households may respond by reducing their other saving in response to the  creation of individual accounts.", "Model 3 results are presented in Appendix I. Because the benefit  reductions in Model 3 are smaller than in Model 2, long-term unified  deficits are larger under Model 3. Model 3 requires an additional  contribution equal to 1 percent of taxable payroll for those choosing  individual accounts.

While the Commission had the benefit  of prior thinking on these issues, many implementation issues remain,  particularly in ensuring the transparency of the new system and educating  the public to avoid any gaps in expectations. For example, an education  program would be necessary to explain the changes in the benefit  structure, model features like the benefit offset and how accounts would  be split in the event of divorce. Education and investor information is also  important as the system expands and increases the range of investment  selection. Questions about the harmonization of such features with state  laws regarding divorce and annuities also remain an issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The use of our criteria to evaluate approaches to Social Security reform  highlights the trade-offs that exist between efforts to achieve sustainable  solvency and to maintain adequate retirement income for current and  future beneficiaries. These trade-offs can be described as differences in  the extent and nature of the risks for individuals and the nation as a whole.  For example, under certain individual account approaches, including  those developed by the Commission, some financial risk is shifted to  individuals and households to the extent that individual account income is  expected to provide a major source of income in retirement.", "At the same time, the defined benefit under the current Social Security  system is also uncertain. The primary risk is that a significant funding gap  exists between currently scheduled and funded benefits which, although it  will not occur for a number of years, is significant and will grow over time.  Other risks stem from uncertainty in, for example, future levels of  productivity growth, real wage growth, and demographics. Congress has  revised Social Security many times in the past, and future Congresses  could decide to revise benefits in ways that leave those affected little time  to adjust. As Congress deliberates approaches to Social Security, the  national debate also needs to include discussion of the various types of  risk implicit in each approach and in the timing of reform.", "Public education and information will be key to implementing any changes  in Social Security and especially so if individuals must make choices that  affect their future benefits. Since the Commission options were published,  there has been limited explanatory debate. As Congress and the President  consider actions to be taken, it will be important as well to consider how  such actions can be clearly communicated to and understood by the  American people.", "Finally, any Social Security reform proposal must also be looked at in the  context of the nation\u2019s overall long-range fiscal imbalances. As our long- term budget simulations show, difficult choices will be required of  policymakers to reconcile a large and growing gap between projected  revenues and spending resulting primarily from known demographic  trends and rising health care costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided SSA an opportunity to comment on the draft report. The  agency provided us with written comments, which appear in Appendix II.  SSA acknowledged the comprehensiveness of our analysis of the  Commission\u2019s proposals. The agency also concurs with our reform  criterion of achieving sustainable solvency and with our report\u2019s overall  observations and conclusions. SSA\u2019s comments and suggestions can be  grouped into a few general categories.", "GAO Benchmarks and Their Relationship to Sustainable Solvency - The  agency commends our use of multiple benchmarks with which to compare  alternative proposals. However, they note that our definition of  sustainable solvency differs from that used by SSA in assessing trust fund  financial status. In addition, although they note that our benchmarks are  solvent over the 75-year projection period commonly used by SSA\u2019s Office  of the Chief Actuary in its preparation of the annual trustees report, they  do not achieve sustainable solvency. SSA expresses a concern that unless  carefully annotated, the comparisons made in our report could be  misunderstood. Finally, SSA also suggests the use of several alternative  benchmarks, of which one would provide additional revenue to pay for  currently scheduled benefits.", "We agree with SSA that sustainable solvency is an important objective;  indeed it is one of our key criteria with which we suggest that  policymakers evaluate alternative reforms. SSA correctly points out that  GAO\u2019s benchmarks do not achieve sustainable solvency beyond the 75- year period. We believe our standard is a more encompassing one. SSA\u2019s  definition relies on analyzing trends in annual balances and trust fund  ratios near the end of the simulation period. Consequently the definition  needs to be supplemented, for example, in cases where proposals use  general revenue transfers or other unspecified sources of revenue that  automatically rise and fall to maintain annual balance or a certain trust  fund ratio. In addition, SSA\u2019s definition does not directly consider the  resources needed to fund individual accounts. Our standard includes other  measures in an effort to gain a more complete perspective of a proposal\u2019s  likely effects on the program, the federal budget, and the economy.", "We share SSA\u2019s emphasis on the importance of careful and complete  annotation. The report explicitly addresses the issue of sustainable  solvency and states that the comparison benchmarks used, while solvent  over the 75-year projection period, are not solvent beyond that period.  Given SSA\u2019s concerns, we have revised our report to clarify our analyses,  where appropriate, to minimize the potential for misinterpretation or  misunderstanding.", "Regarding SSA\u2019s suggestion about the use of alternative benchmarks, we  already use a benchmark that provides additional revenue to pay currently  scheduled benefits. Our other benchmark maintains current tax rates,  phasing in benefit reductions over a 20-year period. In our view, the set of  benchmarks used provide a fair and objective measuring stick with which  to compare alternative proposals, particularly the many proposals that  introduce reform elements over a number of years. Both of the  benchmarks are explicitly fully funded and in their design we worked  closely with Social Security\u2019s Office of the Chief Actuary to calibrate them  to ensure their solvency over the 75-year period.", "Additional Analysis \u2013 Many of SSA\u2019s comments suggest additional or more  detailed analyses of some of our findings. For example, SSA suggested  additional analyses of the characteristics of those beneficiaries who fare  better or worse under each of the Commission\u2019s models, further  distributional analyses on groups of beneficiaries who claim benefits at  ages other than 65 and that we conduct analyses on rates of participation  other than the polar cases of 0 percent and 100 percent individual account  participation. The agency also suggested that substantial analysis on  implementation and administration issues is necessary, given the  complexity of administering the commission\u2019s models. Although we tried  to address most of the critical issues given our limited time and resources,  we agree with SSA that many of their suggested analyses could provide  additional useful insights in understanding the distributional implications  of adopting the Commission\u2019s proposals.", "Distributional Analysis - SSA expressed a number of concerns about the  SSASIM-GEMINI simulation model that we use to conduct our  distributional analysis of benefits. One concern addresses future cohorts\u2019  benefit levels reported in our draft. In this regard, we were already  reviewing the level of benefits received by the 1985 cohort and the highest  quintile of that cohort with outside experts, and our subsequent analysis  suggests findings that are more consistent with SSA\u2019s observations: we  have made these changes to the report.", "Some of SSA\u2019s concerns also appear to result from confusion over the  structure, design and limitations of the SSASIM-GEMINI model. We have  included some additional documentation in the report that we believe will  help both the layperson as well as a more technical audience understand  the model more easily. We note that while ancillary benefits can be  calculated through the model and are included in our analysis, we utilize  the model to focus on the individual beneficiary and not the household as  the unit of analysis. The model also includes marriage and divorce rates  and their implication for earnings. These marriage and divorce rates and  other key parameters are expressed by probability rules that drive the  lifetime dynamics of the synthetic population. These rules are not  heuristically generated but are validated through a comparison with data  from the Social Security Administration and the Current Population  Survey, among others. We also note that in certain of instances, for  example in specifying the calculation of annuities as well as the  specification of rates of return used in the modeling, we consulted with  SSA\u2019s Office of the Chief Actuary in an effort to reflect their projection  methodology to extent that it was feasible.", "Measures of Debt - SSA notes that unfunded obligations may be  considered a kind of implicit debt and should be considered in the  analysis. In analyzing reform plans, however, the key fiscal and economic  point is the ability of the government and society to afford the  commitments when they come due. Our analysis addresses this key point  by looking at the level and trends over 75 years in deficits, cash needs, and  GDP consumed by the program.", "Technical Comments \u2013 SSA also provided technical and other clarifying  comments about the minimum benefit provision, our characterization of  stochastic simulation as well as other minor aspects of the report, which  we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Larry E.
