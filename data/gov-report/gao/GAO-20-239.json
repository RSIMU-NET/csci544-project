GAO found that personnel in the Office of Investigations spent 11.2 million hours supporting protective operations from fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Most of the 40 current and former special agents GAO interviewed said that their investigative duties did not negatively affect protection. However, over half identified that they were frequently or sometimes required to work on investigations while assigned to temporary protective operations. Details associated with this topic are sensitive and have been omitted from this report.", "In December 2017, the Secret Service developed a plan to align its resources to combat what it identified as priority criminal threats (e.g., criminal activity with significant economic and financial impacts). However, available documentation of efforts taken does not consistently demonstrate synchronized efforts across the agency to counter the priority criminal threats, as envisioned in the plan. Further, the Secret Service does not have a systematic approach for identifying cases that address priority criminal threats. Absent a documented process for aligning resources and identifying cases, Secret Service will continue to lack assurance that its resources are aligned to combat its priority threats.", "The Office of Investigations employs a staffing model to determine how many special agents are needed in its field offices. The staffing model takes into account the number of law enforcement premium pay and standard overtime hours special agents are expected to work.

The Secret Service also  investigates certain financial and electronic crimes, such as  counterfeiting, identity theft, credit card fraud, and network intrusions. To  execute its protective and investigative responsibilities, the Secret  Service\u2014a component agency of the Department of Homeland Security  since 2003\u2014relies on thousands of special agents and other personnel.  In fiscal year 2019, Secret Service was appropriated around $2.1 billion.", "After a September 2014 security incident in which an intruder was able to  enter the White House, the Secretary of Homeland Security established  an independent panel of experts\u2014the U.S. Secret Service Protective  Mission Panel\u2014to review the Secret Service\u2019s protective activities.

Since the 2014 incident,  Congress has also examined the Secret Service\u2019s dual areas of  responsibility. For example, in December 2015 the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform issued the committee report United  States Secret Service: An Agency in Crisis. The committee report stated  that Secret Service investigations place an additional burden on its  special agents and distract the agency from providing protection. The  committee report also recommended the Secret Service take steps  related to agency leadership, personnel and staffing, and budgeting.  Finally, in response to Secret Service special agents not being fully  compensated for all of their overtime hours worked, Congress held  hearings and legislation was passed to provide additional pay for certain  special agents in calendar years 2016 through 2020.", "You requested that we review the Secret Service\u2019s areas of responsibility,  with a focus on how investigative operations affect the agency\u2019s  protective operations.

We also conducted semi- structured interviews with 40 Secret Service special agents, including 30  current and 10 former special agents, to discuss their views on  investigation and protection activities. The information obtained from our  interviews cannot be generalized across all current and former special  agents; however, the information provided examples and perspectives on  how investigative operations can support or negatively affect protective  operations. In addition, we reviewed the Secret Service\u2019s December 2017  Office of Investigations Priorities and Roadmap (Roadmap) to assess  whether the agency is leveraging the expertise it has developed for  investigative purposes to advance special agents\u2019 ability to perform  protective responsibilities.", "To determine the extent that the Secret Service and selected federal  agencies conduct similar investigations, we analyzed federal prosecutor  data from the Department of Justice\u2019s Legal Information Office Network  System (LIONS). We analyzed the data to identify the six LIONS  categories wherein Secret Service referred the highest number of active  financial crime cases to federal prosecutors during fiscal years 2013  through 2017. We further analyzed the data to identify other federal law  enforcement agencies that referred the highest number of cases in the  same six LIONS categories during fiscal years 2013 through 2017.

In the course of our work, LIONS  data from 2018 became available, so we used data from 2014 through  2018 to describe the number of cases in each offense category that each  agency referred to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices (USAO). The information  obtained from selected federal agencies cannot be generalized across all  federal agencies. However, the information provides examples of how  federal law enforcement agencies can conduct similar types of  investigations. In addition, the data may not account for all financial  crimes cases each agency contributed investigative resources to. This is  because the data only includes cases referred by each investigative  agency wherein the agency was identified as the lead investigative  agency as determined by the U.S. Attorneys who entered the data into  LIONS. To assess the reliability of the data, we discussed LIONS quality  controls with Department of Justice officials and reviewed the data for any  obvious errors and anomalies, among other things. Based on our  assessment, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of describing the extent to which selected federal law  enforcement agencies conducted investigations similar to those  conducted by the Secret Service during fiscal years 2014 through 2018.", "In addition to analyzing LIONS data, we held semi-structured interviews  with federal prosecutors from 12 USAOs to gather federal prosecutors\u2019  views on Secret Service investigations. We selected USAOs with the  highest number of ongoing cases of the types Secret Service investigates  the most during fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (the latest year for which  data was available when making our selections), among other criteria.

For example, between 2014 and 2018, U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Offices prosecuted 608 aggravated identity theft cases for  which the Secret Service was the lead investigating agency, while the FBI  led 484 prosecuted cases, U.S. Postal Inspections Service led 454  prosecuted cases, and IRS Criminal Investigations led 383 prosecuted  cases.", "All 12 of the federal prosecutors we interviewed told us that the benefits  of the Secret Service and selected agencies investigating similar crimes  outweigh the drawbacks. These prosecutors highlighted the following  three benefits: (1) additional staff resources; (2) agency-specific  expertise; and (3) value added by having agencies work together on  cases. For instance, three federal prosecutors we interviewed said that  the occurrence of financial and cybercrimes in their district was pervasive,  and that the number of criminal complaints they received far exceeded  the number of federal agents available to investigate. With regard to  agency-specific expertise, one federal prosecutor noted that although  multiple agencies may conduct counterfeiting investigations, the Secret  Service has expertise in this area that is appreciated by local businesses,  such as casinos. Finally, agency collaboration can benefit criminal  investigations, as in a June 2018 case in which the Department of Justice  announced a coordinated effort to disrupt schemes designed to intercept  and hijack wire transfers from businesses and individuals. The effort  included an investigation by Secret Service and the FBI in which 23  individuals were charged in the Southern District of Florida with  laundering at least $10 million.", "In addition, although the Secret Service and selected federal agencies  can investigate similar crimes, federal prosecutors told us that federal  agencies prioritize different types of crimes or cases. For example, eleven  federal prosecutors told us that the Secret Service was the only agency  that referred counterfeiting cases to their district, and 6 federal  prosecutors said the Secret Service was the only agency that referred  protective intelligence or threat cases. Further, according to senior FBI  officials, they generally investigate large-scale financial crimes. On the  other hand, the Secret Service may be willing to investigate financial  crimes with smaller losses than the FBI, according to senior FBI officials  and two federal prosecutors we spoke with. Table 1 below includes the  mission and investigative priorities of the Secret Service and selected  federal agencies.", "Although nine of 12 federal prosecutors we interviewed stated that there  are no drawbacks to the Secret Service investigating crimes similar to  those investigated by selected federal agencies, two of 12 federal  prosecutors and one federal agency official identified drawbacks related  to deconfliction and case assignment. Specifically, one prosecutor told  us that, in the past, there was a greater need for deconfliction between  the Secret Service and the FBI, but that deconfliction had not been an  issue in the last 18 months. In addition, FBI officials in one field office told  us that although the Secret Service and the FBI generally coordinated  and worked well together, sometimes there were instances in which they  could have deconflicted earlier in an investigation. Another federal  prosecutor told us that it may be difficult to know what federal law  enforcement agency would be best to assign an investigation since in the  early stages of an investigation, the federal prosecutor\u2019s office may lack  adequate case information to know what law enforcement agency would  be best positioned to conduct an investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Secret Service Developed a Plan to Combat Priority Criminal Threats, but Does Not Know the Extent to Which Resources Are Dedicated to Each Priority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Secret Service Has Defined Priority Criminal Threats, but Lacks a Documented Process to Consistently Ensure Resources Align with these Priorities", "paragraphs": ["In December 2017, the Secret Service released the Office of  Investigations Priorities and Roadmap (Roadmap).

As described in the  Roadmap, the campaign plans were to synchronize the efforts of the  Secret Service to counter the targets. They were also to identify  government and non-government partners for countering investigative  targets. In addition, the campaign plans to counter the most significant  criminal threats to the financial and payment systems of the United States  were to be reviewed, updated, discontinued, or newly developed on an  annual basis.", "The Secret Service has not, however, employed the practices as  identified in the Roadmap because, according to Office of Investigations  officials, the approach outlined in the Roadmap is not beneficial given the  dynamic nature of the crimes they investigate. Instead, rather than  identifying investigative targets based on the most significant threats on a  yearly basis and developing campaign plans for each target as originally  planned, Secret Service officials report that their Global Investigations  Operations Center helps identify individual cases with national  significance and coordinate resources necessary to investigate these  cases throughout the year. In addition, every two weeks Office of  Investigations leadership meets with field office management to discuss  their significant cases, including discussions about resource demands for  these cases.", "However, available documentation of efforts taken does not consistently  demonstrate synchronized efforts across the agency to counter  investigative targets, as envisioned in the Roadmap. This is in part  because the process for identifying cases with national significance and  coordinating related resources is not documented. The Office of  Investigations provided us with campaign plans it developed since the  Roadmap was released, and based on our review, there were  inconsistencies in the type of information provided. For example, one  campaign plan identified gas station pumps that may have been  compromised by skimming devices\u2014that is, devices that steal credit card  related information. The plan also identified field offices responsible for  executing investigations of the gas pumps, timeframes for the  investigations, and potential partners. A different campaign plan was an  informational alert regarding business email compromises, including  details about how the attacks are executed and examples of information  the attacker is attempting to steal. However, this plan did not identify  offices responsible for combatting the attacks, timeframes, or potential  partners. The plan also does not specify what resources would be  necessary to combat the identified threat.", "The Roadmap states that fiscal constraints require the Secret Service to  prioritize its efforts and take steps to ensure that resources are aligned  with its priorities. This is consistent with the recommendation of an  independent panel established by the Secretary of Homeland Security to  assess the Secret Service\u2019s operations, which in 2014 recommended that  the Secret Service \u201cclearly communicate agency priorities, give effect to  those priorities through its actions, and align its operations with its  priorities.\u201d Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government require that management should implement control activities  through policies and define objectives clearly.

However, Secret Service  officials told us the significant case database does not currently have the  capability to identify whether a case addresses one of the three priority  criminal threats, and acknowledged that the criteria of a significant case  differ from the criteria of a priority threat outlined in the Roadmap. For  example, as stated in the significant case database guidance, \u201csignificant  cases are those that represent a significant economic or community  impact, as well as those that involve multi-jurisdictional districts or  schemes that employ emerging technologies.\u201d However, as described  earlier in this report, the Roadmap identifies three priority criminal threats,  one of which is described as \u201ccriminal activity, such as cybersecurity  threats, that operate at scale and present emergent or systemic risks to  financial and payments systems.\u201d", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  relevant, reliable, and timely information is needed throughout an agency  in order to achieve its objectives.

The staffing model takes  into account the number of hours special agents are expected to work  under LEAP and standard overtime, but does not consider annual caps  on federal employee salaries.", "According to the Secret Service\u2019s Human Capital Strategic Plan for Fiscal  Years 2018 through 2025, the special agent staffing model is used to  analyze the protective workload of the field offices. In addition, the plan  stated that the model is used to determine the appropriate levels of  investigative and intelligence output while keeping travel and overtime at  \u201ctolerable levels.\u201d To fulfill the requirements to qualify for LEAP, Secret  Service special agents regularly work a 10-hour day, inclusive of 2 hours  of LEAP premium pay, for an annual total of 520 hours beyond the  standard work year of 2,080 hours. The Office of Investigations staffing  model also assumes special agents will work an estimated standard  overtime of 200 hours, among other hours. As a result, the staffing model  assumes that each special agent will work an estimated 2,600 hours per  year. See Figure 8.", "However, if certain special agents work the hours projected under the  staffing model, they may not be compensated for all of their work time  because they may exceed the annual caps on federal employee salaries.  For example, in calendar year 2018, using the Secret Service\u2019s pay scale  for the Washington, D.C. metro area, the standard pay cap was  $164,200. Special agents at pay grade GS 13 Step 9 would have lost  compensation if, in addition to their regular hours, they worked 520 hours  of LEAP and 200 hours of standard overtime (see table 2). Special agents  at pay grade GS 14 Step 6 would have lost compensation if, in addition to  their regular hours, they worked 520 hours of LEAP alone. Although  legislation was enacted in recent years to address compensation for  Secret Service special agents by temporarily raising the pay cap, special  agents at higher pay levels may still exceed the temporary pay cap under  the current staffing model. For instance, under the temporary cap  implemented for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, special agents at the GS 15  Step 5 pay grade would have been uncompensated for some hours if  they worked the hours projected under the staffing model. See table 2 for  additional details.", "According to data received from the Secret Service, some special agents  did work time that was uncompensated despite the pay cap waivers. In  calendar years 2016 through 2018, between 8 and 80 special agents  assigned to the Office of Investigations worked some hours without being  compensated for their time each year. This resulted in more than $1  million in lost wages (see table 4). Without the pay cap waiver, between  426 and 819 special agents would have worked some hours without  being compensated for their time, which would have resulted in a total of  $15.4 million in lost wages. See Table 3 for more details.", "Due to the limits on special agent compensation, the Office of  Investigation\u2019s special agent staffing model currently plans for individuals  to work hours for which they cannot be compensated. Without adjusting  its staffing model to ensure compensation limits are accounted for when  estimating staffing needs, certain Secret Service special agents will  continue to be under-compensated for their work. Additionally, the Secret  Service-specific waiver does not apply after 2020, at which point special  agents in the Office of Investigations may further exceed the pay caps  and work some hours without compensation.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks, such as those related to the management of human  capital and the entity\u2019s workforce. Internal control standards also call for  the consideration of excessive pressures, noting that excessive pressure  can result in personnel \u201ccutting corners\u201d to meet the established goals,  and that management can adjust excessive pressures using tools such as  rebalancing workloads. The standards further state that management  should recruit, develop, and retain competent personnel to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives. Retention can be pursued by, among other things,  providing incentives to motivate and reinforce expected levels of  performance and desired conduct among staff. Working long hours  without being fully compensated may cause special agents to be less  focused when providing protection or to seek employment elsewhere.", "Because the Secret Service\u2019s staffing model does not consider maximum  pay cap allowances, the Secret Service will continue to overestimate the  number of hours each special agent should work and underestimate the  number of staff needed to meet its workload demands. In addition,  maximum pay cap allowances are subject to change if legislation does  not continue to increase them on an annual basis. As a result, absent  developing an updated staffing model that accounts for compensation  limits and using that model to estimate staffing needs, the Secret Service  risks special agents continuing to work some hours without  compensation, and continuing to underestimate staffing needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Secret Service plays a critical role in safeguarding both the  leadership of the United States and its financial resources.

However, the Secret Service could better leverage its investigative  responsibilities for supporting protective operations by identifying the  types of investigative activities that best prepare special agents for  protection, and developing a framework to help ensure special agents  participate in those activities to the extent possible.", "In addition, selected federal prosecutors reported that the Secret  Service\u2019s financial investigations are helpful to the law enforcement  community as a whole, bringing specialized expertise to investigations  and complementing investigations performed by other federal law  enforcement agencies. However, although the Secret Service has  identified priority criminal threats in its Roadmap, it has not employed the  actions identified in its Roadmap to pursue these threats. Rather, the  agency relies on its Global Investigations Operations Center to identify  individual cases with national significance and coordinate resources  because, according to current Office of Investigations officials, the  approach outlined in the Roadmap is not beneficial given the dynamic  nature of the crimes they investigate. Documenting the process of  identifying priority criminal threats and developing campaign plans would  help the agency better direct investigative resources towards priority  criminal threats. In addition, until the Secret Service identifies cases that  address priority criminal threats and captures data on resources used,  agency management will not be able to determine the extent to which  resources and operations are aligned with priority criminal threats.", "Finally, special agents can work long hours in carrying out their  investigative and protective duties. Unless the Secret Service updates its  staffing model to account for compensation limits, the agency risks  continuing to underestimate staffing needs and having special agents  work some hours without compensation.

For example, we analyzed Secret Service time and attendance data to  determine the number of hours special agents spent on investigation and  protection activities. We focused on special agents in the Office of  Investigations, as these personnel are responsible for conducting criminal  investigations and temporary protective assignments. Further, the data  we analyzed focused on special agents in a field location (e.g., field office  or resident office), and thus did not include special agents at  headquarters. We focused on field staff because that is how the agency  captures and reports the hour-related data in its annual reporting. In  addition, we analyzed data on the number of investigative cases opened  and closed. We focused on fiscal years 2014 through 2018 as it was the  most recent data available at the time of our review; included a fiscal year  in which the Secret Service experienced the operational tempo of a  presidential campaign (i.e., fiscal year 2016); and included data from two  administrations. To assess the reliability of the data, we discussed with  Secret Service officials how the data are entered and maintained in their  Manhours Reporting System, which tracks special agent workload and  tasks, and their Field Investigative Reporting System, which maintains  data on field office staffing and investigations. In addition, we compared  the data to recent Secret Service annual reports and congressional  budget justifications, and inquired about any differences. We also  reviewed the data for any obvious errors and anomalies. Based on our  review of the data and related controls, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting the number of hours that  special agents in the Office of Investigations expended on different  activities and the number of cases opened and closed during fiscal years  2014 through 2018.", "We also interviewed Secret Service officials at headquarters and selected  field offices. We selected office locations using the following criteria:  highest number of criminal investigation and protection hours, diversity in  types of offices, geographic diversity, and presence of other federal law  enforcement agencies.

Specifically, we randomly selected and interviewed 10 special agents  from each of the Secret Service\u2019s three career phases (30 special agents  in total). We also interviewed 10 former special agents, including those  that retired from the Secret Service and others that left the agency for  other reasons. To select these 10 special agents, we asked special  agents that we interviewed to recommend former special agents to  participate in our study (i.e., snowball sampling) and contacted an  association for former Secret Service personnel to help identify recently  retired special agents. The information obtained from our interviews  cannot be generalized across all current and former special agents;  however, the information provided examples and perspectives on how  investigative operations can support and negatively affect protective  operations.", "To determine the extent to which the Secret Service and selected federal  agencies conduct similar investigations, we analyzed federal prosecutor  data from the Legal Information Office Network System (LIONS)\u2014a  system maintained by the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for  United States Attorneys. We analyzed the data to determine the number  and types of cases referred by the Secret Service during fiscal years  2013 through 2017, the latest years for which data was available when  making the determination. Specifically, based on our data analyses, we  identified the six LIONS categories wherein Secret Service (1) was  identified as the lead investigative agency by the US Attorney\u2019s Office and  (2) referred the highest number of financial crime cases to federal  prosecutors during fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The categories were  counterfeiting and forgery, other white collar crime/fraud, financial  institution fraud, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and other fraud  against businesses. Next, we identified federal law enforcement agencies  that referred the highest number of cases in these categories. Based on  our data analyses, we selected the following four law enforcement  agencies: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Postal  Inspection Service (USPIS), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and  Internal Revenue Service \u2013 Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). In the course  of our investigation, data from fiscal year 2018 became available, and we  analyzed data from fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to determine the  extent to which our selected federal law enforcement agencies referred  similar types of cases to U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices as those referred by  Secret Service.", "The information obtained from selected federal agencies cannot be  generalized across all federal agencies. However, the information  provides examples of how federal law enforcement agencies can conduct  similar types of investigations.

Specifically, we interviewed officials at the headquarters and the Miami  and New York field office locations for each selected agency in  conjunction with site visits to Secret Service field offices in those areas. In  addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with one  representative with a high-level understanding of the office\u2019s activities  (e.g., criminal chief) at 12 U.S. Attorney Offices (USAO). To select U.S.  attorney districts, we established the following criteria to help ensure that  we gathered a range of perspectives and interviewed USAOs that were  likely to have experience working with Secret Service: highest number of  ongoing cases of the types Secret Service investigates the most during  fiscal years 2013 through 2017, size of USAO district (as designated by  the Department of Justice), geographic diversity, and USAOs located in a  state with a Secret Service field office.

Secret Service officials told us that in fiscal years 2017 and 2018,  the Secret Service changed the way it collected and reported expenditure  data. Specifically, Department of Homeland Security management  directed all agency components to use the Common Appropriations  Structure (CAS). As a result, the Secret Service implemented CAS in  fiscal year 2017. In addition, the officials told us the Secret Service  updated its accounting software in fiscal year 2018, resulting in additional  changes to the accounting structure. Secret Service officials told us that  because of these changes, it is not possible to accurately compare  expenditure data across fiscal years 2014 through 2018. However, Secret  Service officials noted that in the future they will be able compare year- over-year fiscal data starting with fiscal year 2018 and beyond using a  tool within the new accounting system. A description of the expenditure  data for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 is provided below.", "Secret Service officials told us that in fiscal years 2014 through 2016,  expenditure data was collected and reported according to the task being  performed. For example, a special agent\u2019s salary was reported under the  investigation category if the special agent was performing investigation- related tasks, and it was reported under the protection category if the  special agent was performing protection-related tasks. See table 4.", "According to Secret Service officials, in fiscal year 2017, the agency  implemented CAS and began to collect and report expenditure data  according to location. For example, a special agent\u2019s salary was reported  under the investigation category if the special agent was assigned to an  Office of Investigations field office even if the special agent was  performing a protection-related task. See table 5.", "In fiscal year 2018, Secret Service transferred its financial reporting to the  Oracle R12 system, which tracks data according to both location and  task. In addition, officials noted that other accounting structure changes  were made in 2018, such as changes to what activities were classified as  protection.

Over the course of the next 50 years, the Secret Service\u2019s role  within the department continued to evolve as additional duties, such as  Presidential protection, were assigned to it. During this time, the  authorities exercised by the Secret Service were those delegated to it  within the Department of the Treasury and, on occasion, authorities  enacted through annual appropriations, which expired at the end of the  applicable fiscal year.", "In 1916, the Secret Service received its first grant of authority enacted by  permanent legislation\u2014 the Federal Farm Loan Act\u2014which authorized  the Secret Service to investigate counterfeiting, embezzlement, fraud,  and certain other offenses in the federal farm loan system. Ten years  later, the Secret Service received another grant of authority to investigate  the counterfeiting of government requests for transportation by common  carrier. Later, the Banking Act of 1933 and its 1935 amendments  charged the Secret Service with investigating offenses similar to those  under the Federal Farm Loan Act, but as applied to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC).", "In 1948, the Secret Service\u2019s investigative authorities under the above  statutes were consolidated into a single provision of law, 18 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3056 (\u201cthe Secret Service Statute\u201d). However, the 1948 codification  effort did not account for the investigative or protective activities that the  Secret Service was authorized to perform under a delegation of authority  or annual appropriations acts. The authorizing legislation for these  activities came three year later, with the 1951 revision of the Secret  Service Statute. As originally enacted, the Secret Service\u2019s protective  duties extended to the President and his immediate family, the President- elect, and, upon request, the Vice President. On the investigative side,  the 1951 statute authorized the Secret Service to investigate any federal  offense related to U.S. or foreign coins, obligations and securities,  thereby expanding its jurisdiction beyond the enumerated offenses  enacted in 1948.", "Over the next three decades, a series of amendments to the Secret  Service Statute added new investigative and protective duties. In 1984, a  revised version of the Secret Service Statute was enacted, which  incorporated all prior amendments while adding a new investigative  responsibility.
