The budgetary impact of seigniorage is interest avoided from the borrowing it displaces and is not visible because it is neither quantified nor shown in the budget. The government also generates earnings by issuing currency, but it is handled differently. The difference between the face value of currency issued and its production cost goes to the Fed. The Fed buys collateral, usually Treasury securities, to back up the currency issued. The interest collected on those Treasury securities is used to pay for Fed costs, and the remainder is returned to Treasury. The budgetary impact of issuing currency comes from the interest returned by the Fed, which is shown as a budgetary receipt and counted in the calculation of the deficit or surplus. Production costs of both coins and currency are shown as costs of operations in Treasury's financial statements. According to the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, seigniorage should be shown as a source of financing in Treasury's statement of changes in net position, whereas interest returned by the Fed for currency is shown as revenue in Treasury's statement of custodial activity. Treasury has not been reporting seigniorage this way but made the correction beginning with its fiscal year 2003 financial statements. Both the Mint and the Bureau have had operational problems in recent years in contracting and acquiring property and equipment. The Mint has also had problems with forecasting demand, monitoring costs, and reporting to Congress. The Mint and Bureau have generally taken or started to take actions to address the problems.

The Mint was  originally part of the Department of State and became part of the  Department of the Treasury in 1873.", "In 1846, the government separated its finances from commercial banks.  Government monies were to be deposited in the main Treasury or in one of  nine Subtreasuries\u2014branches of the main Treasury\u2014located throughout  the United States. By 1863, when the national banking system was  established, the government relied more on national banks than on the  Subtreasuries, but the Subtreasuries and the main Department of the  Treasury in Washington, D.C., were the only channels used to distribute  coins and Treasury currency. Congress gave responsibility for designing  U.S. currency to the Department of the Treasury and established the Secret  Service as a Treasury bureau to guard against counterfeiting. In 1920, the  Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to delegate the duties of  distributing currency and coin that had been handled by the Treasury and  the Subtreasuries to the Fed.", "The responsibilities of the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the  United States, fall into four general areas: conducting the nation\u2019s monetary  policy; supervising and regulating banking institutions; fostering the  stability of the financial system; and providing certain financial services to  the U.S. government and to financial institutions, including playing a major  role in operating the nation\u2019s payments system. The Fed\u2019s operations are  carried out by 12 Federal Reserve district banks that are overseen by the  Board of Governors. Federal Reserve notes in circulation are recorded as  liabilities of the Federal Reserve district banks that issue them, and they  are the banks\u2019 largest liabilities. Treasury securities are the largest assets of  the Federal Reserve district banks. The Fed forecasts the amount of  currency that will be needed to meet demand each year and submits an  order to BEP for new Federal Reserve notes. On the basis of the new  currency order, BEP establishes a billing rate to be paid by the Fed for the  cost of manufacturing Federal Reserve notes. The Fed pays BEP the costs  of developing and printing the currency. The Fed, through its district banks,  distributes Federal Reserve notes to depository institutions to meet  demand throughout the United States and the world.", "The Fed has a more limited role with coins than it does with currency.  Unlike Federal Reserve notes, coins are not liabilities of the Federal  Reserve banks. The Mint determines its annual coin production and  monitors Fed coin inventories to identify trends in coin demand. The Fed  buys coins from the Mint for face value. Upon receiving coin orders from  the Fed, the Mint distributes coins to the Federal Reserve banks from its  Philadelphia and Denver production facilities, and the Federal Reserve  banks distribute coins to satisfy depository institutions demand. In  addition to the Federal Reserve banks and their branches, the Fed also  contracts with about 175 coin terminals to distribute coins to the banking  system. The terminals are generally operated by armored carrier  companies, which may be paid by depository institutions and retailers to  wrap coins and perform other services.", "The primary mission of the Mint is to produce circulating coins in  Philadelphia and Denver for trade and commerce. The Mint also produces  and sells numismatic (collectors) coins and medals and gold and silver  bullion coins and operates the government\u2019s primary gold bullion storage  facility in Fort Knox, Kentucky. BEP, which was established in 1862,  operates facilities in Washington, D.C., and Ft.

When Congress established the Mint\u2019s Public Enterprise Fund in  1996, the Senate Appropriations Committee noted that the production of  coins was driven by demand and that the variability of annual  appropriations placed a burden on production operations, so the Mint was  allowed to operate without annual appropriations. All Mint revenues are  deposited into its Public Enterprise Fund, including receipts from the Fed  from the sale of circulating coins at face value, and all expenses for making  coins are paid out of the Public Enterprise Fund. However, only the  revenue sufficient to cover the Mint\u2019s costs of producing coins is included  as a collection from the Fed in the federal budget, not the full face value of  the coins.

If outlays during the year are higher than what is in  the budget, the Mint and BEP must notify Treasury and request an  apportionment from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but  congressional approval of the request is not necessary.

Because of their  convenience, coins commonly had a substantial premium\u2014more than  enough to cover the costs of minting\u2014to pay for the authentication.

This special budgetary status stems from the desire to protect the flexibility  and independence of the central bank. On a weekly basis, the Fed transfers  its interest earnings on government securities, net of its expenses such as  payments to BEP for Federal Reserve note production, to the Treasury.

First, the federal  government gave the Fed the sole and exclusive function of note issuance,  from which all other banks were prohibited. Second, the government\u2019s  deposit of public funds with the Fed was larger than that of any other  depositor. The committee anticipated that after the national bank notes  that were in existence at that time had been replaced with Federal Reserve  notes, the function of issuing currency would result in large earnings for  the Fed that it could not earn were it to share this privilege with other  banks.

In several regions, the demand for pennies (and  later in the year, for all other denominations) at times exceeded the Fed\u2019s  ability to meet orders. The average number of coins flowing out of reserve  banks during 1999 was nearly 30 percent higher than it was in 1998. That  number, in turn, was about 27 percent higher than 1997. The Fed said the  strong economy and the public\u2019s interest in collecting state quarters were  likely contributing factors to the higher coin demand. The Mint said the  shortages were caused by an unanticipated increase in coin demand  beginning in 1999; the requirement to produce the 50 state quarters  beginning in 1999; and the Fed not consolidating all of its coin orders  during this period, which resulted in some Fed branches ordering coins  when other Fed branches had a surplus of coins.", "The Mint has recently added additional capacity to produce coins and has  worked with the Fed to consolidate its coin orders.

For coins,  both the Fed and Mint now use statistical models to estimate future coin  demand and combine the results to predict demand. Fed and Mint officials  said there are limits to statistical models, and there is always some risk the  models will not be accurate for coin demand, given the volatility in coin use  and demand.

From fiscal year 1998 through  2002, the Mint\u2019s production cost per thousand coins, excluding metal costs,  increased 31 percent after adjusting for inflation, and BEP\u2019s cost to  produce a thousand notes, excluding paper and ink costs, increased 4  percent after adjusting for inflation. BEP said the primary reason for its  increased cost was a 25 percent decrease in note volume during that  period, and fixed costs had to be allocated to a lower number of notes in  fiscal year 2002. The Mint said its increased cost per thousand coins was  due to higher depreciation costs and a change in the mix of coins produced  from fiscal year 1998 through 2002. Mint officials provided documentation  showing that during this period, new machinery and equipment were  bought to replace old equipment and to increase coin production capacity.  The Mint said that depreciation costs also increased because it found the  expected life of coin manufacturing equipment was shorter than what had  been estimated. According to Mint data, depreciation expenses were $9.5  million in 1998 and $19.8 million in 2002. The Mint also provided data that  showed a 17.5 percent increase in the number of full-time staff from 1998  through 2002, and that the mix of coins changed during that period.

Treasury officials in the Office of Procurement said that they planned to  review BEP\u2019s acquisition system in the future; however, due to a loss of  staff who were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, they  did not know specifically when the BEP review would be scheduled.", "In August 1998 we reported that because of statutory restrictions and the  unique market for currency paper, there was no competitive market in  which a number of responsible sources could compete for BEP\u2019s currency  paper requirements. BEP said that for the most recent paper contract, it  took steps to obtain more competition, such as offering multiyear contracts  instead of contract options and allowing offerers more time to gear up for  production; nevertheless, only one proposal was received for the most  recent solicitation.", "The Mint and BEP both conducted reviews from 1999 to 2003 to determine  if it would be advantageous to outsource selected operations. The Mint  provided data showing that 13 areas were identified for review and, as of  February 9, 2004, 4 Mint reviews were in progress, 5 were on hold or  canceled, 3 had not been started, and 1 was completed. The completed  review resulted in 2 custodial positions at the West Point Mint being  outsourced. The reviews in progress involve Mint-wide human resource,  accounting, and finance functions, and coin blanking/annealing/upsetting  and forklift operations at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints. BEP provided  data showing that 16 areas were identified for public-private competition  review from 1999 to 2003 and, as of February 12, 2004, 13 studies were  completed and 3 were in progress. Of the 13 completed studies, 11 resulted  in 115 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions going to private-sector sources  and 2 resulted in 40 FTE positions remaining in-house. Operations that  went to private-sector sources included tour operations, personnel  administrative support, law enforcement support services, and pest  control.

We also reviewed two Treasury IG  reports concerning the acquisition of property and equipment at the Mint  and BEP.", "Both the Mint and BEP have systems in place to monitor the efficiency of  machines and detect machine problems and to determine if property is no  longer needed. Each quarter, plant managers at the Mint production  facilities review and report on excess personal property to Mint  headquarters. They report on excess, damaged, and obsolete equipment  that has not been disposed of, as well as assets that are being used and not  performing up to specifications. The Mint\u2019s Office of Management Services  prepares a monthly space utilization report to track vacancy statistics for  each floor of the Mint headquarters. BEP prepares an annual status report  on the utilization and disposal of excess personal property. BEP also  performs annual reviews and semiannual updates to identify use and needs  of all capital assets used in currency production, production support,  facilities, information technology, and security. BEP also has a policy to  annually update a master space plan and a 5-year space utilization plan. In  addition, the Treasury Department reviews major Mint and BEP capital  projects. A major project is generally the acquisition of land, structures, or  equipment that have an estimated life of 2 or more years, require an  investment of $1 million or more each year, or have a total life-cycle cost of  $10 million or more. For these projects, the Mint and BEP are required to  submit to Treasury\u2019s Capital Investment Review Board a description of the  project, an explanation of how the project meets organizational objectives,  a description of how performance will be measured, an explanation of  project costs, and a description of what alternatives were considered.", "The Mint made eight acquisitions of property and equipment that cost more  than $1 million each in the period we reviewed. For seven of the eight, the  Mint acquired the same amount of property and equipment that it had  originally planned to acquire. In one acquisition, the amount of equipment  ultimately acquired was only 3 percent more than originally planned. Mint  officials said the increase was due to an accelerated requirement for  equipment needed to produce the new dollar coin, and they had not taken  the time to revise the requisition. BEP made seven acquisitions of property  and equipment that cost over $1 million each during this period. For five of  the seven, BEP acquired the same amount of property and equipment that  it originally planned to acquire. In one, BEP had planned to acquire four  offset presses but actually acquired five, and in another it had planned to  upgrade two currency inspection systems but actually made six upgrades.  BEP said that the additional presses and additional upgrades were added  because the Fed\u2019s needs for the new currency with anti-counterfeiting  features increased while the procurements were under way, and BEP  exercised options to meet that demand. In addition, BEP noted that the  currency inspection upgrades were set up as a pilot project to minimize  risks, and that additional upgrades were ordered after the successful  completion of the pilot project. Fed officials said they encouraged BEP to  improve its automated currency inspection system capacity, and BEP  acquired an additional press to satisfy production requirements.", "In March 2002, the Treasury IG reported that the Mint leased about 257,000  more square feet of space for its headquarters in Washington, D.C., than it  had originally requested. The IG recommended that the Mint Director  analyze space needs for headquarters to identify excess space and develop  a plan to use the space. The IG also recommended that the Mint Director  improve record keeping for space acquisitions; make more use of  competition; train staff in procurement; and develop a policy to use the  expertise of other agencies, such as the General Services Administration,  when making future space acquisitions. Mint officials showed us a revised  space needs analysis and revised procedures. The Mint also said that it had  leased out space it did not need. The space analysis showed that of the  381,647 square feet of space the Mint has leased in the two headquarters  buildings, 139,910 square feet, or 36.7 percent, has been subleased to other  agencies. The Mint also provided a report showing that as of February 1,  2004, 14,217 square feet of the total square feet in the two headquarters  buildings, or 3.7 percent, was vacant. The leases and subleases showed  that the Mint was recouping its leasing costs in its charges to the other  tenants. In addition, the General Services Administration (GSA) provided  data showing that a 2002 GSA lease rate for space in one of the buildings  occupied by the Mint was $4.39 per square foot higher than the 1999 lease  rate that the Mint had negotiated for space in the same building. Mint  officials said they did not develop a policy to use other agencies in future  space acquisitions because the Mint would not be leasing additional space.", "In June 1999, the Treasury IG reported that BEP had purchased four  intaglio currency presses and three overprinting and packaging machines  costing about $50 million that were unnecessary and subsequently had to  be placed into storage. The IG said that BEP had acquired the presses  before it completed a study of the use of the new presses and had not  analyzed the labor union opposition to the presses. After the audit was  completed, the IG noted that demand for currency increased, and the least  expensive option would be for BEP to install the presses in the Washington,  D.C., facility. The IG recommended that the BEP Director improve its  evaluations of equipment needs, perform pilot studies before making major  manufacturing operations changes, better protect the stored equipment,  and reconsider where to use the presses. In response to the report, BEP  established a capital investment committee to evaluate equipment  requirements and justify the need for future equipment; agreed to perform  pilot studies, when applicable; and installed the presses in the Washington,  D.C., facility.

In general, staff were satisfied with  BEP\u2019s reporting of budget and program information, but some said the Mint  had not provided timely information on significant programs and activities  in the past. An example cited was the Mint\u2019s failure to give Congress  advance notice of closing the Philadelphia Mint in February 2002 for  repairs. However, the staff also stated that the Mint\u2019s reporting had  improved in the last 2 years under the new Director of the Mint.", "The Mint and BEP are both required to disclose the results of their  operations in a number of reports to Congress and have done so. For  example, they are required to estimate costs and revenues in the Treasury  budget submissions annually and to issue financial statements that are  subsequently audited. The Mint and BEP have historically prepared  financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting  principles set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the body  that sets accounting standards for private sector entities. The Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board, which sets accounting standards  for federal entities, has stated that federal government corporations and  certain other federal entities, such as the Mint and BEP, can continue to  follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance.", "When Congress established the Mint\u2019s Public Enterprise Fund in 1996 and  exempted the Mint from government procurement rules, the House  Appropriations Committee noted that Congress was not abdicating its  oversight of Mint operations. The committee report stated that the Mint  was required to submit quarterly reports on the implementation of the fund  and its impact on operations. The law stated that the Mint was required to  provide an annual report on the amounts it transferred to Treasury for  deposit as miscellaneous receipts, a statement of the amount in the fund  that exceeds the estimated operating costs for the following year, and an  explanation of the specific purposes for which amounts were being  retained. In explaining this requirement, the House report accompanying  the legislation did not refer to the following year and stated that the report  submitted to Congress shall include an explanation of the specific purposes  for which the excess amounts in the fund shall be used. Mint officials said  the annual reports required by the act have not been filed separately, but  the information is provided in the Mint\u2019s annual reports on operations and  that any seigniorage collected that was not transferred to Treasury was  retained for future operational costs. In reviewing the annual Mint reports,  we noted they included the amount of seigniorage collected and the  amount that was transferred to Treasury, but they did not include  information on how retained amounts will specifically be used. Mint  officials agreed that the total amount of seigniorage collected could be  better reconciled with how seigniorage was used.", "The annual Mint and BEP reports also include opinions on their financial  statements from their independent auditors and reports on their internal  controls and compliance with laws and regulations. The Mint and BEP both  issued annual reports containing financial statements for fiscal years 1998  through 2002, and both received unqualified (clean) audit opinions from  their independent auditors. The reports for all 5 years contained the  auditors\u2019 reports on internal controls and compliance with laws and  regulations for the Mint and BEP. BEP audit reports had no reportable  conditions and no reported instances of noncompliance with laws and  regulations. The Mint, however, had one reportable condition of internal  controls in the 1998, 1999, and 2000 audit reports and three reportable  conditions in the 2001 and 2002 reports. Most of the reported problems at  the Mint dealt with various information system controls, such as  inadequate disaster recovery plans, inadequate access controls, unclear  definitions of business processes, and inadequate system documentation.  In addition, because of these internal control weaknesses, the independent  auditor reported that the Mint did not comply with Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) circulars on federal financial management in 1998, 2001,  and 2002. Mint officials said they have taken action to correct each of the  reported weaknesses and believe they were all mitigated by the end of  fiscal year 2003. The Mint provided copies of directives, procedures, risk  assessments, and other documentation of actions it has taken or started  that, if effectively implemented, should address the problems that have  been reported. The Mint also provided a copy of the independent auditor\u2019s  report for the fiscal year 2003 audit that stated no material internal control  weaknesses were found.", "As we reported in September 2002, the act that authorized the new dollar  coin required Treasury to report to Congress by March 31, 2001, on the  progress of the new dollar coin marketing program.

In reports accompanying the 2002  Treasury and general government appropriations bill, the Senate and House  Committees on Appropriations expressed concern that the Mint\u2019s 2001  report to Congress did not adequately describe the nature and extent to  which the new dollar coin was being used. The House report directed the  Mint to submit a new report by March 31, 2002.

We  reported that the 2002 report gave much more information on the  marketing efforts for the dollar coin and the barriers to increasing use of  the new coin that the 2001 report had failed to provide, but the 2002 report  did not address what would be done to overcome the barriers or how  efforts to overcome the barriers would affect circulation. Mint officials said  that they had contracted for a study of the barriers to the dollar coin and  expected the study to be done later this year.

In contrast, the issuance of currency results in the Fed holding  securities that would otherwise be held by the public. The amount of  interest paid to the Fed, and subsequently returned by the Fed to Treasury,  is quantified and visible in the budget.

For each operational area, we obtained and reviewed  relevant GAO, Treasury Inspector General, Treasury Office of  Procurement, financial audit, and other reports to Congress. Because we  did not have the resources to extensively review all areas, we also selected  commonly used measures of performance and obtained information from  BEP and the Mint to determine how they performed for each measure. In  selecting the performance measures, we judgmentally selected indicators  that would generally address the cost/efficiency, quality/effectiveness,  customer satisfaction, and financial reporting. For example, in contracting,  we selected as performance measures the agencies\u2019 use of competition for  major acquisitions and how they determined that the prices paid were fair  and reasonable. Because of resource constraints, we used judgmental  samples for some of the measures. For forecasting demand, we selected a  5-year period to determine if there were any coins or currency shortages.  We selected 5 years as the period to review for monitoring production  costs. For contracting, we looked at the 10 largest procurements made by  the Mint and BEP during the last 3 years. We looked at property and  equipment purchases made over the last 7 years that individually cost over  $1 million.

Money serves as a convenient way to exchange goods and  services by creating a medium of exchange, establishing a common unit of  account, and creating a store of value that allows transactions to be  deferred into the future. Money is what people will accept to carry out  these functions.", "Before the United States declared its independence from Great Britain in  1776, the United States followed the British monetary system. British  money, as a medium of exchange, was scarce, and the individual colonies  began to issue their own currency. Public warehouses in some of the  colonies issued certificates representing that a specified amount and  quality of commodities, such as tobacco, had been weighed and graded.  These certificates, as well as certificates for other commodities, circulated  from hand to hand. These bearer certificates were an early form of paper  money and avoided the need for each owner to sign over a note for the  payment of debts. The commodity backing the certificates became a  reserve currency that did not pass from hand to hand, but could be  delivered on demand if required. The colonies tried a variety of paper  money arrangements, but in many cases the paper money was a promise to  pay in coin at a future date or was backed by land. Also, foreign coins were  used. In 1764, the British completely banned paper money in the colonies  because some colonies had issued excessive quantities of paper money,  which caused inflation. The constitutional struggle between Britain and the  colonies over the right to issue paper money was a factor in provoking the  American Revolution. To finance the Revolutionary War, the Continental  Congress issued paper continental dollars, as well as some coins. The  continental dollar, as well as paper money issued by the colonies,  depreciated rapidly during the war.", "Although under the Constitution the federal government has the exclusive  right to issue coins, most money used until the Civil War was in the form of  paper promissory notes, known as banknotes, issued by private banks that  were chartered by the states. Banknotes were generally issued in a bearer  form, promising to pay to the holder gold or silver on demand. Individuals  with surplus stocks of gold deposited, or lent, their commodity to banks,  which paid interest. Banks created both assets and liabilities by creating  and issuing bearer notes, or money, to borrowers, who in turn issued  interest-bearing notes back to the bank in the form of a loan agreement.", "For the bank, the notes became a liability and the loan agreement an asset.  Generally, banks were allowed to create paper money on their physical  reserve of about 5 times greater than they actually possessed. Therefore,  the total amount of money in the system became much larger than the gold  used for monetary purposes.", "The banknotes were supposed to be convertible, on demand, to gold or  silver. State bank examiners were to assure and certify that banks had  enough gold or silver on hand to redeem their outstanding currency.  However, this was not always done and many banknote holders found  themselves stuck with worthless paper. Each state-chartered bank could  issue currency with its own design. Because designs were not consistent  and there was no central control over the issuance of currency,  counterfeiters saw opportunities to deceive the public. By 1860, as much as  one-third of currency in circulation may have been counterfeit, leading to  the creation of the U.S. Secret Service.", "Partly because of the counterfeit problem and partly to obtain financing,  four different laws were enacted during the Civil War: (1) an 1862 act  establishing Treasury notes, (2) an 1863 National Banking Act, (3) an 1864  National Banking Act, and (4) an 1865 act imposing a 10 percent tax on  state banknote issues. The 1862 act authorized the Treasury to issue  currency notes in such form as the Secretary directed; the notes were  printed in green ink and commonly referred to as greenbacks. Greenbacks  were not backed by gold or silver but by the federal government, which put  the U.S. on a fiat monetary standard.", "The 1863 National Bank Act established a system of federally chartered  national banks, each of which was given the power to issue standardized  national banknotes secured by the deposit of United States bonds. It also  established the Comptroller of the Currency, whose job was to supervise  the new banking system through regulations and periodic bank  examinations. For each $90 of notes they issued, national banks were  required to purchase $100 in government bonds to be deposited for  safekeeping. In contrast to the banknotes issued by the private banks  supervised by the states, the national banknotes were uniform in design.", "The 1864 National Banking Act required banks to hold reserves of gold or,  in some cases, deposits at other banks as a fraction of their liabilities.  Government bonds continued to be required to back note issues.", "The 1865 act imposed a 10 percent tax on state-chartered banknotes and  assured that state banks could no longer deprive the federal government of  potential revenues from bond sales to federally chartered banks. However,  checking accounts were developed around this period, substantially  reducing the need for banknotes and allowing to a great extent the state- chartered banks to avoid the banknote tax.", "By 1866, the U.S. currency supply consisted of legal tender money issued  by the federal government in the form of greenbacks and banknotes issued  by national banks and secured by U.S. government bonds. From the Civil  War to 1879, Congress made greenbacks and national banknotes  redeemable in gold and silver coin. The Coinage Act of 1873 set the terms  of convertibility and moved the U.S. from a bimetallic (gold and silver)  standard to a gold standard. Another type of paper currency, the silver  certificate, was authorized in 1878 when the country\u2019s economy was  booming and the demand for silver coins in daily business surpassed the  supply. A silver certificate certified to the holder that there was a specified  amount of silver on deposit in the United States Treasury that would be  paid to the bearer of the bill on demand.", "In 1913, the Federal Reserve Act established the Federal Reserve Board of  Governors, as well as Federal Reserve banks as the nation\u2019s central bank  and gave the Fed authority to issue Federal Reserve notes as currency for  the United States. National banks became members and shareholders of  the Federal Reserve System. At that time, the law stipulated that Federal  Reserve notes were obligations of the United States and were redeemable  in gold on demand at the Treasury Department, or in gold or lawful money  at any Federal Reserve bank. Initially, Federal Reserve notes were not legal  tender in private debts. The Federal Reserve banks were required to  maintain reserves in gold of not less than 40 percent of Federal Reserve  notes in circulation. Today, each Federal Reserve bank must hold  collateral equal to at least 100 percent of the value of the currency it issues.  The reserve banks back up the notes primarily with Treasury securities.  Therefore, the Fed issues noninterest bearing obligations (currency) and  uses the proceeds to acquire interest-bearing assets.", "Before the Federal Reserve Act was passed, currency in circulation could  not always accommodate changes in demand that arose from changes in  seasonal and cyclical factors and periods of financial crisis. For example, in  the economic panic of 1907, national banks were not able to issue more  currency because they were not able to obtain further bonds until the  government issued more bonds tied to the backing of the currency, but the  Treasury at the time had a surplus of currency and did not need to borrow  money. The Federal Reserve Act remedied this problem by mandating an  elastic currency that would expand and contract based on public demand.  As public demand changed, depository institutions would either order  currency from or deposit surplus currency with the Federal Reserve banks.", "In 1920, Federal Reserve notes constituted about half of the currency in  circulation. The other half was made up of gold certificates and national  banknotes (which were retired in the 1930s), silver certificates (which  were retired in the 1960s), and U.S. notes (which were last produced in  1971). Since 1971, the Federal Reserve has been the sole note-issuing  authority in the United States.", "During the 19th century, many countries introduced laws to regulate the  activities of commercial banks and restrict some of their freedoms due to  bank panics and failures. The appearance of government-issued banknotes  reflects these changes.", "The National Emergency Banking Act of 1933 declared that Federal  Reserve notes were to be considered legal tender for all public and private  debts. The dollar was no longer tied to any commodity, such as gold. In  1934, the Gold Reserve Act stipulated that all gold coin be withdrawn from  circulation and formed into gold bars. The Coinage Act of 1965 restated  earlier legislation making all coins and currencies of the U.S., regardless of  when coined or issued, legal tender for all debts, public and private, public  charges, taxes, duties, and dues. The law was intended to eliminate silver  as a component of our coinage system.
