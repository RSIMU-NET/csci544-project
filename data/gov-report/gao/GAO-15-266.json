For most non-disability mental condition separations, these services use the broad separation code, \u201ccondition, not a disability,\u201d which mixes non-disability mental conditions with non-disability physical conditions, such as obesity, making it difficult to distinguish one type of condition from the other. In contrast, the Air Force is able to identify such servicemembers because it uses all five of the separation codes specific to non-disability mental conditions. DOD policy requires the military services to use a separation code so that DOD can track and analyze separations. Moreover, federal standards for internal control state that all transactions need to be clearly and accurately documented and readily available for examination when needed. The three services had varying reasons as to why they use the broad separation code. For example, Army officials believed that stating in servicemembers' discharge papers that they were discharged for non-disability mental conditions might stigmatize them with future employers. However, DOD stated that there are ways to protect servicemembers in this regard by providing them with discharge papers that are more general and that do not disclose specific reasons for discharge. By not systematically identifying or periodically evaluating the number of separations for non-disability mental conditions, DOD and the services cannot assess how well the separation policy and process are working or inform key stakeholders, including the Congress, about separation frequency, trends, and other data.", "The military services lack separation policies that address all of DOD's eight requirements for separating servicemembers with non-disability mental conditions; both DOD and the services also lack oversight over such separations. From fiscal years 2008 through 2012, DOD required the services to report on their compliance with DOD requirements for personality disorder separations, one of the non-disability mental conditions. Most of the services reported by fiscal year 2012 that they were not compliant with all eight requirements and many of the 20 reports contained incomplete and inconsistent information. For example, 19 reports were missing information on reserve members. DOD discontinued these reports and did not institute any other oversight, which is inconsistent with the internal control standard for monitoring. GAO also found, based on a review of the services' separation policies, that the services have not updated their policies to meet all DOD requirements for non-disability mental condition separations. For example, Navy officials stated that they were unaware that DOD separation policies had changed since 2008 until GAO's review. DOD officials stated that the military services are responsible for conducting oversight of their separation processes; however, GAO found that the military services do not have processes to oversee non-disability mental condition separations. Without up-to-date and consistent policies and oversight processes, DOD and the military services cannot ensure that servicemembers separated for non-disability mental conditions have been afforded the protections intended by DOD's separation requirements and that servicemembers have been appropriately separated for such conditions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD and the military services develop a method to identify the number of servicemembers separated for non-disability mental conditions and take a number of actions to ensure that their policies and processes can ensure that servicemembers are appropriately separated for non-disability mental conditions in accordance with DOD's separation requirements.

Army officials had a similar concern, stating that they use the broad  separation code for most non-disability mental condition separations to  protect enlisted servicemembers after they leave the service. Army and  Marine Corps officials told us they were concerned that employers may  request the servicemember\u2019s copy of the DD Form 214 that has the  separation code on it, and having a code specific to a mental condition  might stigmatize the servicemember.

Likewise, DOD officials told us that they have not  heard that this is a problem.

By including the  characterization of service on both of the servicemember\u2019s copies of the  DD Form 214, DOD believes that the servicemember could provide an  employer with the copy that does not contain the reason for the  separation and the employer will be satisfied because the  characterization of service is indicated.", "Because the three military services are using the broad separation code  \u201ccondition, not a disability\u201d for most separations, the resulting data cannot  be used to identify the number of servicemembers separated for non- disability mental conditions.

However, DOD officials stated that they have not required the military  services to conduct any review of their compliance with DOD\u2019s separation  requirements for all non-disability mental conditions to determine whether  they are being followed. As noted previously, the internal control standard  for monitoring states that controls should be designed to assure that  ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations.", "According to DOD officials, the military services are responsible for  conducting oversight of their separation processes, not DOD. However,  while some of the military services have review steps within their process  for separating servicemembers for non-disability mental conditions, none  of the services have an entity-wide oversight process, such as conducting  an annual review, to oversee separations and provide reasonable  assurance that the review steps they have in place are effective at  ensuring DOD separation requirements are met. Specifically, we found  their review processes are the following:", "The Air Force separation process includes reviews of separation  packages\u2014which is prepared by a commanding officer\u2014by the Air  Force central personnel office and a Judge Advocate General (JAG)  Corps attorney prior to separation. Officials from these offices told  us that the purpose of the reviews is to ensure that the appropriate  documentation is present to support the separation.", "The Army\u2019s JAG Corps also reviews all separation packages prior to  separation to ensure documentation is present and is consistent with  law and policy, according to Army officials. While this is the current  practice, Army officials also told us that they have plans in place to  start conducting oversight of separations for non-disability mental  conditions. Specifically, Army officials stated that separations for non- disability mental conditions will be included as part of the Army  Organizational Inspection Program, which will review a sample of  active duty servicemember separations at local commands to see if  documentation is present that indicates that DOD separation  requirements have been met. These inspections will not include  reserve and National Guard member separations. Army officials  stated they plan to conduct the first inspection in January 2015.", "The Marine Corps Judge Advocates review the separation packages  for personality disorder separations\u2014but not for other non-disability  mental conditions separations\u2014to ensure documentation is present  and is consistent with law and policy, according to Marine Corps  officials.", "The Navy does not conduct any review of the separation package  prepared by a commanding officer prior to the servicemember\u2019s  separation.", "The absence of a routine and comprehensive entity-wide oversight  mechanism\u2014such as an annual compliance review\u2014prevents the military  services from knowing if they are complying with all of DOD requirements  and appropriately separating servicemembers with non-disability mental  conditions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The inability to easily identify the number of enlisted servicemembers  separated for non-disability mental conditions hinders oversight by DOD  and the military services to ensure that servicemembers are being  separated appropriately.

Further, lack  of such data prevents DOD from being able to conduct analyses\u2014such  as trends in non-disability mental condition separations over time\u2014that  are important for determining whether the separation policy is working,  and if not, how it should be changed.", "Absent an effective process for monitoring and reporting compliance,  DOD and the military services cannot assure that the military services are  complying with DOD requirements for separating servicemembers with  non-disability mental conditions. The fact that some military services were  not aware of or had not yet aligned their policies or processes with  updated DOD requirements for separating servicemembers with non- disability mental conditions is of particular concern. Because the services  have been separating servicemembers based on outdated DOD policy,  the military services may not have been affording all servicemembers with  the protections that DOD intended through its recent updates of  separation requirements for non-disability mental conditions. As a result,  some servicemembers may have been separated for non-disability  mental conditions inappropriately. It is also of concern that, although the  Air Force reported its inability to separate National Guard members for  non-disability mental conditions in 2013, it has made no progress in  correcting this issue.
