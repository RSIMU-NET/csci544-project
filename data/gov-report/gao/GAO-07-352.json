In 2000 and 2003, two federal statutes, known as AIR-21 and Vision 100, permitted DOT to award 44 new slots to airlines, 24 of which could be used for flights to cities more than 1,250 miles, which was the statutorily mandated limit for non stop flights from Reagan National. The DOT awards went to airlines serving six cities (Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, and Seattle). For this year's reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), GAO was asked for an update on the capacity of Reagan National to accommodate additional slots and the effect of relaxing the perimeter rule. GAO updated its 1999 study to answer these key questions: (1) To what extent can Reagan National accommodate additional flights? (2) Since AIR-21 and Vision 100, what changes have occurred in market share and fares for flights operating between the six beyond-perimeter cities and the three Washington, D.C., area airports? In commenting on this report, DOT and the airports authority generally agree with our findings but with one exception, the airports authority disagrees with DOT's estimate of slots because it disputes their methodological assumptions. We believe the department's methodology for estimating airport capacity is appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Reagan National Airport can accommodate some additional in capacity, but airport infrastructure constrains how much can be added. FAA officials believe that some additional slots can be added, while airport officials have not made an estimate. FAA, using the results of a 1995 DOT capacity study, determined that the airport's airside infrastructure (e.g., runways) could accommodate four additional slots per hour. Airport officials said they were unsure how many additional slots, if any, the airport could accommodate but cited several factors that could limit the airport's capacity to absorb additional slots including the limited number of gates currently available for loading airplanes and other infrastructure constraints. GAO's work shows that even if the number of slots is not increased, there is some opportunity to expand current capacity by filling unused slots and increasing the size of aircraft on existing slots to increase the number of flights and the number of passengers served. Currently, nearly 80 slots are unused because they are at early morning or late evening times and airlines have not applied to use these time slots. In addition, many of the slots reserved for large passenger jets are currently being used by smaller regional jets. Airlines awarded slots for direct flights between Reagan National and the six beyond-perimeter cities gained significant market share in those selected cities, but the effect of these slots on competing flights operating between these cities and the other Washington, D.C. area airports is not evident. For each of the six beyond-perimeter cities, the direct flights to and from Reagan National captured the majority of passengers flying between that city and Reagan National. In most cases, the airlines charged higher fares than competing connecting flights. GAO did not find evidence in passengers or fare data that would indicate that the new service between Reagan National and the six beyond perimeter cities had substantially affected service from Dulles or Baltimore-Washington International airports to these cities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\u2019s (Reagan National) central  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\u2019s (Reagan National) central  location in the Baltimore-Washington D.C.\u2013Northern Virginia region and  location in the Baltimore-Washington D.C.\u2013Northern Virginia region and  proximity to the Nation\u2019s capital makes it very popular for airlines and  proximity to the Nation\u2019s capital makes it very popular for airlines and  passengers.

Reagan National currently has three runways and two  terminals with a total of 44 gates or passenger loading ramps for use by air  carriers. The airport currently handles 400 daily departures to 75 cities,  offered by 20 different airlines (this includes commuter airlines, which  operate solely for the major carriers). Terminal A, the original terminal,  has 9 gates, and Terminal B/C, which opened in 1997, has 35 gates, 100  ticket counters, and 12 baggage claim areas. In 2005, 17.8 million  passengers used Reagan National. The airline with the largest number of  flights at Reagan National is US Airways, which controls 44 percent of the  commercial slots. The next largest operators are Delta Airlines and  American Airlines, which have 14 percent of the commercial slots each.  During 2005, these three airlines together accounted for nearly 60 percent  of total passenger enplanements at the airport.", "In 1969, FAA applied special air traffic rules to certain airports facing  increasing delays and congestion that it designated as high-density  airports: Chicago-O\u2019Hare; New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Kennedy; Newark,  New Jersey; and Reagan National (DOT dropped Newark\u2019s designation as  a high-density airport in October 1970). Because of the restricted number  of allowable flights, these airports are generally known as slot-controlled,  and the special air traffic rules governing the allowable number of flights  are referred to as slot rules, or high-density rules.", "The number of hourly slots at Reagan National is controlled by the federal  government. Since 1969, the federal government has restricted the number  of commercial takeoffs and landings at Reagan National. Currently, the  number allowed is 48 per hour: 37 for air carriers and 11 for commuter  aircraft. Table 1 shows the number of slots per hour by type of aircraft  permitted under the slot rule. FAA authorizes general aviation or  unscheduled aircraft to make an additional 12 takeoffs or landings during  each hour for a total of 60 slots per hour.", "A perimeter rule has been in place at Reagan National since May 1966  restricting airlines from operating nonstop flights between Reagan  National and airports further than a specified distance. The FAA  previously had concerns that allowing long-range jets to fly into Reagan  National would create a noise problem and hamper growth of the newly  built Dulles International Airport. As a result, with the airlines agreeing,  the Civil Aeronautics Board approved a 650-mile perimeter, with  exceptions of seven cities between 650 and 1,000 miles away that enjoyed  grandfather status as of December 1, 1965.", "In 1986, the Congress codified the slot and perimeter rules into federal  statute as part of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986. The  act led to the transfer of authority over Reagan National and Dulles from  the federal government to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority  and set the perimeter at 1,250 miles, which allowed nonstop flights as far  as Houston and Dallas.", "Two federal statutes enacted in 2000 and 2003 modified the slot and  perimeter rules at Reagan National Airport. AIR-21 and Vision 100  effectively added up to three commercial slots per hour and for the first  time designated some slots for flights beyond the 1,250 mile perimeter.  AIR-21 and Vision 100, combined, allowed the Secretary of Transportation  to award 22 roundtrips, 12 with service to airports beyond the perimeter  and 10 with service to airports within the perimeter.

Airport officials stated any measurement of capacity should be based on  poor weather conditions and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). FAA and  GAO believe balanced capacity is a more appropriate method for  determining an airport\u2019s capacity than the method suggested by the  airports authority. The 1995 DOT study points out that estimating capacity  under IFR conditions, when the airfield is at the lowest level of available  capacity does not ensure steady airfield availability. In practice, this  approach would leave large amounts of airfield capacity unused because a  significantly higher capacity could be achieved during the better weather  conditions under which Visual Flight Rules (VFR) apply. According to  data from DOT, less than 1 percent of air traffic operations at Reagan  National from November 2005 to November 2006 were delayed because of  weather conditions.", "Assuming capacity under IFR conditions, airport officials raised two issues  that would limit growth at the airport. The first issue is the potential return  of general aviation flights. Airport official said the absence of general  aviation flights helped the airport to absorb the additional slots that were  authorized under AIR-21 and Vision 100. After September 2001, DHS  banned general aviation flights around the national capital region. Prior  to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the airport handled 40,000 to 50,000  unscheduled aircraft flights including general aviation, annually.", "Since October 2005, general aviation flights have been allowed to return,  but only under very restrictive conditions, resulting in very little activity at  Reagan National. According to airport officials, between October 2005  and August 2006, for example, the airport had fewer than 200 general  aviation flights. Figure 3 shows the level of flights of all types of aircraft  since January 2001. As the figure shows, traffic for all types dropped after  September 11, 2001, but commercial traffic (commuter and air carrier) has  basically returned to pre-September 11 levels. By contrast, general aviation  has not done so.", "According to airport officials, as a result of the significantly diminished  presence of general aviation, some airside capacity remains, but  commercial aviation might not be able to use it all. A key reason is that  commercial aircraft require the longer main runway for takeoff and  landings, while many general aviation aircraft can use the shorter runways  for takeoff and landing.", "The second issue airport officials raised as limiting capacity is  infrastructure limitations. These limitations involve several aspects of the  airport\u2019s infrastructure.", "Passenger Loading Gates. According to airport officials, the number of  gates affects the ability to add more slots. Every gate at the airport is  currently leased to airlines with flights at the airport, known as tenant  airlines. Airlines wishing to begin flights at the airport, known as new  entrants, can make arrangements with tenant airlines to share a gate, but a  tenant airline is not required to share its gate if its schedule does not allow  it. A recent analysis by the airport shows that some gates are available  during certain parts of the day. For example, during October 2006, some  gates were unused during both peak and nonpeak times, primarily those in  the older and less desirable terminal A. During the 18-hour operating  period, gates in terminal A were unused 46 percent of the time, while gates  in terminal B/C were unused 22 percent of the time. Most of the available  time periods are during nonpeak hours.", "Terminal Facilities. Officials said Reagan National has limited capacity to  expand terminal facilities such as ticket counters and baggage handling  areas due to the lack of space on the airport property. If additional slots  are permitted, existing tenant airlines might be able to use their existing  facilities more fully, but new entrant airlines may have difficulty obtaining  the necessary terminal facilities, especially at peak periods during the day.  For the recent slots awarded under AIR-21 and Vision 100, the airports  authority has been able to accommodate new entrants with gates and  other facilities. However, airport officials said that such accommodation  has become increasingly difficult. Officials from Alaska Airlines, one of the  newer airlines at Reagan National, told us that its experience in getting the  needed facilities has been positive.", "Parking Facilities. According to airport officials, limited parking at the  airport could make it difficult to accommodate additional passengers,  resulting from increased slots. Passengers have a variety of ways to access  the airport terminal, including rail transit, taxis, shuttle services, and  private car. For those who drive their own cars, the airport provides over  7,900 parking spaces. According to airport officials, the parking facility is  running at or near capacity with the existing flight schedule. For example,  over a 12-month period from November 2005 to October 2006, two of the  four parking garages reached capacity 100 days or more. In order to help  mitigate some of this pressure, the airport plans to add an additional deck  to the current parking structure. This additional parking deck would  provide 850 more spaces and is slated for completion in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Expand Current Capacity at Reagan National", "paragraphs": ["In two ways, Reagan National\u2019s current capacity under the existing slot  limits could be expanded. First, the airport has available slots during  certain parts of the day, though they are for less desirable times. Of the  total 912 daily slots available for airlines, 834 are currently allocated and  approximately 78 slots are unused. Each of these unused slots falls either  in the early morning (between 6:00 and 7:00) or in the late evening  (between 9:00 and midnight), which suggests that no existing airlines and  most likely no new entrants wish to initiate new service with a schedule  limited to these hours. According to airport officials, these slots remain  unallocated because there is less demand for passenger service during  these hours and because noise restrictions after 10 p.m. require quieter  aircraft.", "The second way in which current capacity could be expanded is to reduce  the number of smaller commuter planes using slots that are allocated for  larger jet planes that carry more passengers. For example, FAA data show  that in August 2006, commuter flights used nearly double the slots that  were designated for commuter flights (see table 2). For example, on one  route, between Raleigh-Durham and Reagan National, DOT data show that  in November 2006, two carriers operated an average of 26 daily flights  using commuter jets, which have a maximum capacity of 76 seats,  although larger jets were designated for the slots used for the commuter  flights.

We  received comments from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Aviation and International Affairs, Department of Transportation. DOT  acknowledges that all available slots at Reagan National Airport are not  used to maximum effect and agreed that there are a number of reasons for  this, including curfew restrictions, the commercial viability of slots in the  early morning or late evening under current regulations, and the  concentration of the majority of slot holdings among a relatively small  number of carriers. DOT also recognizes that the underutilization of slots  is exacerbated by the fact that carriers can use commuter aircraft in slots  designated for large aircraft but are legally prohibited from using large  aircraft in slots designated for commuter aircraft. In addition, other  statutory restrictions, such as the perimeter rule, contribute to the  underutilization of slots and prevent market forces from producing the  maximum public benefit from these scarce assets. For example, the early  departure and late arrival times at other airports are often used by airlines  to operate overnight \u201cred eye\u201d or other long-haul flights. Regulations  governing operations at Reagan National, such as the perimeter rule,  prevent carriers from using such scheduling and fleet assignment  techniques to maximize the value of slots and facilities at that airport.  While we do not disagree with DOT\u2019s observations, we also recognize that  any changes in the commuter slot or perimeter rules at Reagan National  would have competitive implications for airlines and the communities they  serve.

The airports authority believes  that maximum capacity should be based on IFR conditions, that is,  capacity under adverse weather conditions. Instead, DOT bases its  estimate of maximum capacity on a mix of IFR and VFR traffic, a  methodology that we endorsed in 1999 and still do today. We believe, as  does DOT, that balanced capacity is a superior method for determining the  airport\u2019s capacity because it accounts for the operation of aircraft during  all weather conditions.

To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the quality  control procedures applied to these data, and subsequently determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted our  review from July 2006 through February 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority", "paragraphs": ["The following is GAO\u2019s comment on the Metropolitan Washington Airports  Authority\u2019s (airports authority) February 1, 2007, letter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comment", "paragraphs": ["We believe, as does DOT, that \u201cbalanced capacity\u201d is a more appropriate  method for determining an airport\u2019s capacity than the method suggested  by the airports authority. While the airports authority contends that  Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) should be used to measure capacity, DOT\u2019s  Technical Supplement No. 3 to its 1995 report points out that IFR airfield  capacity is indicative of the lowest level of available capacity, and thus  virtually ensures constant availability of an airfield. In practice, this  approach would leave large amounts of airfield capacity unused because a  significantly higher capacity could be achieved during the better weather  conditions under which Visual Flight Rules apply. According to data from  FAA, less than 1 percent of all air traffic operations at Reagan National  from November 2005 to November 2006 were delayed because of weather  conditions. Because setting the number of slots on the basis of balanced  capacity reflects both bad and good weather conditions, we did not revise  our report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Ed Laughlin, Assistant Director;  Paul Aussendorf; Jay Cherlow; Dave Hooper; Nick Nadarski; Josh  Ormond; and Stan Stenersen made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
