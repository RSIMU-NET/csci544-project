Specifically, we determined whether NAIS was an effective mechanism for disseminating procurement information to industry, including small businesses. In addition, we identified the status of efforts to develop a governmentwide electronic procurement information system similar to NAIS.", "In 1993, NASA began an initiative called the Midrange Pilot Program for procurements between $25,000 and $500,000. The purpose of the program was to test new processes and tools to streamline the acquisition process while maintaining or improving the quality of procurements. A key objective of the program was to develop and test an alternative to paper documents as the primary means of communicating procurement information to prospective contractors. After researching available options, NASA chose to implement an Internet-based electronic procurement notice and publication system, which ultimately became NAIS.", "In December 1996, the Department of Commerce, in partnership with the Government Printing Office, introduced CBDNet, an Internet version of the Commerce Business Daily (CBD), which is available to the public free of charge. Many other agencies have developed a variety of other electronic posting systems to help improve access to, and the visibility of, their contracting opportunities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the early 1990s, federal agencies and Congress recognized that doing business electronically could save resources, streamline the procurement process, and improve the private sector\u2019s access to federal contracting opportunities. NASA first used NAIS at its Marshall Space Flight Center in 1994 to post midrange procurement opportunities on the Internet. NAIS services and features expanded rapidly, and the system began to be used NASA-wide in 1995. It was the first agencywide procurement information system on the Internet.", "With some exceptions, federal agencies must publish notices of competitive contracting opportunities above $25,000 in the CBD. To accommodate timely delivery of notices through a paper-based mail delivery system, the law generally prescribes a 15-day minimum interval between publication of a notice in the CBD and the issuance of a solicitation by an agency. After a solicitation is issued, agencies generally must give contractors a minimum of 30 days to prepare and deliver bids or offers. In support of NASA\u2019s test of alternatives to the use of paper documents for communicating business opportunities to prospective contractors, FASA authorized NASA to waive the CBD notice and waiting period requirements for 4 years (until Oct. 13, 1998) and for up to $100 million in procurement life-cycle costs.", "Congress has supported the use of federal electronic commerce and electronic access to procurement information. Under FASA, this capability was to be provided through the Federal Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET), a governmentwide systems architecture for acquisitions based on electronic data interchange, which is the computer-to-computer exchange of routine business documents using standardized data formats. FACNET implementation proved to be problematic, however, and in 1997, section 850 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 replaced the preference for FACNET with a more flexible policy that promotes the use of electronic commerce techniques whenever practicable or cost-effective.", "Section 850 also requires that in implementing electronic commerce, agencies apply standards consistent with nationally and internationally recognized standards that broaden interoperability and ease of use. Agency notices of procurement opportunities must be provided in a form that allows convenient and easy user access through a single governmentwide point of entry. While CBDNet satisfies the requirement with respect to notices, neither it nor other currently available electronic procurement posting systems satisfy the requirement for a single governmentwide point of entry for access to solicitations and other procurement information.", "The law also requires that the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) submit to Congress yearly reports through 2003 on the progress being made in implementing section 850. The reports must include a strategic plan for implementation of governmentwide electronic commerce and an assessment of compliance with the requirement for a single point of entry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAIS Is an Effective Information Service", "paragraphs": ["Since 1994, NAIS has evolved into a procurement information system with many operational features that are effective, easy to use, and beneficial to NASA and vendors. By eliminating many of the steps in the paper-based process of publicizing contract opportunities and issuing solicitations, NAIS has contributed to a more streamlined agency acquisition process. Feedback from NAIS users, particularly small businesses, has generally been positive. However, the lack of data makes it very difficult to quantify specific benefits of NAIS, such as the amount of time it actually saves. NASA exceeded the $100-million ceiling authorized by FASA for the test.

For example, in November 1995, NASA added an on-line procurement reference library. In March 1997, NASA completed the NAIS Electronic Posting System (EPS), which enables procurement staff anywhere in the agency to prepare and post notices and place solicitation files directly onto the NAIS Internet site. In March 1997, NASA also added an e-mail notification service that automatically notifies subscribers of new procurement information available on NAIS.", "We found that the system\u2019s operational features were easy to use and worked as described. Procurement staff demonstrated how they use the EPS to generate, edit, and post notices and place solicitation files directly onto the Internet. The EPS automatically formats each NAIS posting, inserts links to other relevant documents and external information, updates the business opportunities index library, and constructs and feeds messages to the NAIS e-mail notification service. Appendix I provides more information on the development and evolution of the EPS and the approach NASA used to design, develop, and operate the system.", "By going to the NAIS Internet site, users can identify, at one location, notices of and solicitations for competitive business opportunities and awards over $25,000 at all NASA centers; search for business opportunities by type of product and/or service, NASA center, or posting date; locate and download documents related to a specific procurement; and view summaries of NASA\u2019s current contracts (with contractor name, value, obligations, and description) and search current contracts by state, congressional district, business type, or type of product and/or service.", "The e-mail notification service automatically transmits announcements to subscribers immediately after new procurement information is posted on NAIS. This allows subscribers to track developments in the solicitation cycle and learn of new releases. Subscribers can register free of charge by providing an e-mail address and selecting the types of contracting opportunities in which they have the greatest interest. Thus, instead of having to search for information, subscribers can have it selected and delivered to their desktop electronically. As of July 1998, there were over 7,100 subscribers to the e-mail notification service. According to NASA, user feedback showed that this service was the most popular feature of NAIS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAIS Contributes to a Streamlined and Accessible Procurement System", "paragraphs": ["One of NASA\u2019s goals in establishing NAIS was to streamline and standardize the agency\u2019s procurement process by using the Internet as the gateway to contracting opportunities for businesses. NAIS streamlined or eliminated many of the steps required by the paper-based process for publicizing synopses of contracting opportunities and issuing solicitations.", "The NAIS process involves fewer steps for procurement staff than the paper process. The EPS, for example, automatically formats notices, performs edit checks, automatically posts notices on the Internet through the NAIS server, and transmits them to the Government Printing Office for publication in the CBD. Using the paper process, procurement staff have to perform analogous functions manually and must also respond to requests for copies of solicitations by preparing mailing labels and mailing the copies. With NAIS, the solicitation files are available for review and retrieval (\u201cdownloading\u201d) through the Internet.", "We believe the NAIS process is also easier for contractors to use. Using the paper-based system, contractors must either scan the CBD or periodically call or visit each of NASA\u2019s procurement offices to identify contracting opportunities. In contrast, using NAIS, contractors can search for and view as many synopses and solicitations as they wish on-line. They can search by specific commodity, service, or location; view and provide comments on draft solicitations; and access the Federal Acquisition Regulation, NASA procurement policies and procedures, and NASA procurement forms.", "NASA officials point to the absence of protests from contractors concerning NAIS and the lack of complaints about NAIS to the NASA Ombudsman Program as evidence that the contractor community approves of NAIS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "User Feedback Was Positive", "paragraphs": ["Both businesses and NASA procurement staff have provided positive feedback about NAIS. Overall, industry responses to specific NAIS operational features were positive. In a tally of on-line comments from NAIS users, 87 percent of respondents said they found NAIS to be beneficial. The respondents identified themselves primarily as small, small disadvantaged, or women-owned businesses. For the most part, feedback from the procurement staff was positive, and comments were often similar to those made by businesses. Federal electronic commerce officials from other agencies and industry representatives told us that systems with the operational features of NAIS can benefit both industry and government, especially when all buying organizations are using the same system.", "An on-line NAIS feedback system was established in 1995 to obtain input, especially from businesses, about the system. The NAIS team also requests feedback from the procurement staff at NASA centers. This feedback was compiled in December 1997 and again in June 1998.

However, NASA did not collect data on or evaluate individual procurements advertised through NAIS. The information needed to determine how much time NAIS actually saved or to quantify other NAIS benefits, such as cost avoidance for the procurement process, was not available.

NASA officials told us that when the waiver authority was originally requested, they anticipated that NAIS, though not yet developed, would be used primarily by the Marshall Space Flight Center, the focal point of the pilot test, and that the $100-million ceiling would be adequate to cover Marshall\u2019s procurements. However, the Internet posting capability was rolled out to all NASA centers by April 1995 and was being used agencywide for all competitive procurements over $25,000 1 month before NASA began waiving the CBD notice requirements in October 1995.", "In early 1997, NASA officials realized that the $100-million ceiling authorized by FASA for the test would not cover agencywide use of NAIS. In May 1997, the Administration submitted a legislative proposal to increase the ceiling for NASA\u2019s use of the waiver authority and extend the test period from 4 to 6 years. Congress did not act on the proposal. NASA used the CBD waiver authority through the end of the fiscal year\u2013September 30, 1997.

As table 1 shows, the average number of offers received per acquisition increased from 6.1 to 7.2 after NAIS implementation. NASA said in the NAIS Business Case that the increase in the average number of offers received per acquisition was especially promising because the majority of these acquisitions were set aside for small businesses.", "We also calculated and compared the percentages of contract actions and dollars awarded to small businesses in fiscal years 1994 and 1997, respectively. Table 1 shows these calculations. The percentage share of awards to small businesses did not change significantly after NAIS implementation, but the percentage share of dollars awarded to small businesses increased substantially in 1997.

Prior to agencywide use of EPS, each NASA center had its own unique process for preparing and posting procurement notices and solicitations on the Internet. Some centers used word processors while others used some form of automated document generation system. The completed files were then provided to a Web curator at the center who would post them on an Internet server and manually update a readable index of files. Changes to the posting process occurred spontaneously at various centers with little central control or agreement. The 10 centers\u2019 differing processes required 10 separate efforts to implement a single change that had to be agreed on by the larger NAIS team. These process differences also made it difficult to maintain a standard \u201clook and feel\u201d when searching out business opportunities. A vendor was faced with 10 different entry points to search.", "NAIS operated for a year in this fashion. Then an ad-hoc group of NAIS team members began to study ways to make the centers\u2019 posting processes more uniform. The team concluded that the NAIS posting process should be centralized to a single server and that the application for posting and maintaining documents should be standardized by using on-line forms to be completed by users.
