Experts' evaluation of this category included whether medical pediatric exams and evidence-based therapies\u2014which are interventions shown to produce measureable improvements\u2014were provided as needed, according to records. Experts found in 22 of 24 cases that medical pediatric exams were mostly supported by documentation. For example, in one case with mostly supporting documentation, experts found that a child with a history of behavioral and emotional problems had records documenting a medical pediatric exam and thorough psychological assessments, with comprehensive discussions of diagnostic issues and medication rationale. With regard to evidence-based therapies, experts found that 3 of 15 children who may have benefitted from such therapies were mostly provided such services, while 11 of 15 cases were scored as partial in this category, and in 1 of 15 cases there was no documentation that evidence-based therapies were provided.", "Medication Monitoring. Experts' evaluation of this category included the appropriateness of medication dosage and the rationale for concurrent use of multiple medications, according to records. Experts found appropriateness of medication dosages was mostly supported by documentation in 13 of 24 cases and partially supported in the other 11 cases. The rationale for concurrent use of multiple medications was mostly supported in 5 of the 20 cases where multiple medications were used, but 14 of 20 cases included documentation that partially supported concurrent use, and 1 case did not include documentation to support concurrent use. For example, experts found for one case that a child was prescribed four psychotropic drugs concurrently, when nonmedication interventions could have been considered. The rationale for the actions taken was partially supported by documentation.", "All of the five selected states\u2014two of which pay health care providers directly through fee-for-service, and three of which use or are transitioning to a third-party managed-care organization (MCO) for prescription-drug benefits to some extent\u2014have policies intended to address oversight of psychotropic medications for foster children. According to state officials, all five of the states require medical examinations for children in foster care. Since GAO's 2011 report, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has, among other things, worked with other federal agencies to provide informational webinars and technical guidance for states to improve oversight of psychotropic medications, but this guidance does not address third-party MCOs administering medications. Officials from two of the three states relying on MCOs described limited state planning for MCOs to monitor psychotropic medications. Because there are indications MCO use is increasing, additional HHS guidance that helps states implement oversight strategies within the context of a managed-care environment could help ensure appropriate monitoring of psychotropic medications prescribed to children in foster care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS issue guidance to states regarding oversight of psychotropic medications prescribed to children in foster care through MCOs.

Early detection and treatment of emotional and behavioral  disturbances can improve a child\u2019s symptoms and reduce potentially  detrimental effects on a child, such as difficulties with relationships,  dropping out of school, and involvement with the juvenile justice system.  Children with mental-health conditions, such as attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression, can be treated with  psychosocial therapies (sessions with a provider designed to reduce  symptoms and improve functioning); psychotropic medication  (medications that affect mood, thought, or behavior); or a combination of  both.", "Child mental-health advocates, providers, and researchers have  expressed concern about the increase in the prescription of psychotropic  medications to children, due in part to limited evidence available  regarding short- and long-term safety and efficacy for some types of  medications, particularly when used in combination. Some state Medicaid  and mental-health officials have expressed concern about the relatively  high rates of off-label use of antipsychotics, particularly among groups of  special concern such as children in foster care.", "Several agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) have responsibilities related to children\u2019s mental health. The  Administration for Children and Families (ACF) provides funding for and  oversees states\u2019 child-welfare programs, which are responsible for  monitoring and coordinating mental-health services for children in foster  care, among other things. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) oversees, and jointly finances with the states, Medicaid and the  State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provide health  coverage for low-income children. State Medicaid programs are required  by federal law to provide coverage for certain health services, which may  include mental-health services, for children through the Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit. The Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) works to  increase the quality and availability of mental-health services, such as by  awarding grants that support the development of community-based  services for children with mental-health conditions, including children in  foster care.", "Children in foster care who are enrolled in Medicaid may receive services  generally through one of two distinct service-delivery and financing  systems\u2014managed care or fee-for-service. Under a managed-care  model, states contract with a managed-care organization (MCO) and  prospectively pay the plans a fixed monthly fee per patient to provide or  arrange for most health services, which may include prescription-drug  benefits. Plans, in turn, pay providers. In the traditional fee-for-service  delivery system, the Medicaid program reimburses providers directly and  on a retrospective basis for each service delivered.", "In December 2011, we reported that children in foster care in the five  states analyzed were prescribed psychotropic medications at higher rates  than nonfoster children in Medicaid during 2008. According to research,  experts consulted, and certain federal and state officials interviewed as  part of our December 2011 report, this could be due in part to foster  children\u2019s greater exposure to traumatic experiences, and the challenges  of coordinating their medical care and records due to frequent changes in  placement. Prescriptions to foster children in these states were also more  likely to have indicators of potential health risks. According to the experts  we consulted for our December 2011 report, no evidence supports the  concurrent use of five or more psychotropic medications in adults or  children, yet hundreds of both foster and nonfoster children in the five  states had such a drug regimen. Similarly, in our December 2011 report,  we found thousands of foster and nonfoster children were prescribed  doses higher than the maximum levels cited in guidelines developed by  the state of Texas, based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2013 approved or medical literature maximum dosages for children and  adolescents, which experts said increases the risk of adverse side effects  and does not typically increase the efficacy of the medications to any  significant extent. We also found that the monitoring programs of these  states for psychotropic medications provided to children in foster care  varied and fell short of best-principles guidelines published by the  American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP). This  variation was expected because states set their own guidelines and HHS  had not endorsed specific measures for state oversight of psychotropic  prescriptions for children in foster care. In our December 2011 report we  recommended, and HHS agreed, to consider endorsing guidance for  states on best practices for overseeing psychotropic prescriptions for  children in foster care. The status of this recommendation is discussed  later in this report.", "You asked us to continue our review of psychotropic medications  provided to children in foster care.

Thus, the results of our case-study analysis are not generalizable  to the foster-child population within each of the five states we examined,  or to those of other states.", "For each state included in our review, we randomly selected four cases;  each case represented one of the following four categories:  children prescribed any psychotropic medication during calendar year  2008 and in foster care as of January 2010;  children with prescriptions exceeding dosage guidelines developed by  the state of Texas, which were based on FDA-approved or medical  literature maximum dosages for children and adolescents, during  calendar year 2008 and in foster care as of January 2010;  children prescribed five or more medications concurrently during  calendar year 2008 and in foster care as of January 2010; and  children less than 1 year old prescribed any psychotropic medication  during calendar year 2008 and in foster care as of January 2010.", "In addition to the 20 cases above, we also nonrandomly selected all  children less than 1 year old prescribed an ADHD, antipsychotic, or  antidepressant medication during calendar year 2008, totaling 8 infants.  These additional 8 cases were selected because, according to experts, it  is not standard practice to prescribe psychotropic medications to infants,  and these medications carry significant risks when prescribed to young  children.", "After preliminary analysis, we excluded four selected cases from our  review. One case removed was a nonrandomly selected infant case in  which the prescription was identified as potential Medicaid fraud and the  case was referred to the state Medicaid Office of Inspector General for  follow up. Two other nonrandomly selected infant cases were removed  due to data-entry errors that indicated children received psychotropic  medications, when they had not. The fourth case removed was a  randomly selected infant case. In this case, the records provided did not  include any mental-health or prescription information for experts to  review. State officials confirmed the psychotropic medication prescribed  to the infant was for non-mental-health purposes. Thus, 24 cases were  included in our final case-file review.", "To provide a clinical perspective on our cases, we contracted with two  child psychiatrists who are board certified in child and adolescent  psychiatry, have conducted clinical research regarding mental illness in  children, and who are working on issues related to psychotropic  medication use among children in foster care. For additional information  on experts and the criteria that informed our selection, see appendix I. To  review the cases, the two experts collaborated to develop categories that  are applicable to the administration of psychotropic medications, as  informed by AACAP guidelines and their clinical experience. The  categories include, but are not limited to, the quality of documentation  related to psychiatric evaluations, monitoring and efficacy of medications,  and changes in medication doses. GAO obtained medical and child- welfare documentation spanning the children\u2019s time in foster care, and  redacted personally identifiable information prior to experts\u2019 review of  cases. For each case, experts reviewed the child\u2019s medical and foster  care information (such as case-file notes, medical history, and  prescriptions) covering the entire period the child was in foster care, and  provided an opinion on the categories reviewed, as well as a summary  narrative describing the facts and circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s  use of psychotropic medication. Experts noted any potential issues  related to the use of psychotropic medications based on supporting  documentation, which was reviewed from a quantitative and qualitative  standpoint.

We also  interviewed officials from ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA, as well as child- welfare and Medicaid officials from selected states, to understand their  approach to providing oversight of psychotropic medications.

The  agency may place the foster child in the home of a relative, with unrelated  foster parents, or in a group home or residential treatment center,  depending on the child\u2019s needs. The agency is also responsible for  arranging needed services, including mental-health services.  Coordinating mental-health care for children in foster care may be difficult  for both the medical provider and the caseworker depending on the  complexity of the child\u2019s needs, and because multiple people are making  decisions on the child\u2019s behalf. In addition, caseworkers in child-welfare  agencies may have large caseloads, making it difficult for them to ensure  each child under their authority receives adequate mental-health services.", "In 2011, the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act  amended the Social Security Act to require states to identify protocols for  monitoring foster children\u2019s use of psychotropic medications and to  address how emotional trauma associated with children\u2019s maltreatment  and removal from their homes will be monitored and treated. ACF  requires states to address these issues in their required Annual Progress  and Services Reports (APSR) and has provided guidance detailing how  states are to address protocols for monitoring foster children\u2019s use of  psychotropic medications as part of the state\u2019s APSR. Among other  things, state monitoring protocols are to address  screening, assessment, and treatment planning to identify children\u2019s  mental-health and trauma-treatment needs, including a psychiatric  evaluation, as necessary, to identify needs for psychotropic  medications; effective medication monitoring at both the client and agency level;  informed and shared decision making and methods for ongoing  communication between the prescriber, the child, caregivers, other  health care providers, the child-welfare worker, and other key  stakeholders.", "According to ACF, child-welfare systems that choose to pursue  comprehensive and integrated approaches to screening, assessing, and  addressing children\u2019s behavioral and mental-health needs\u2014including the  effects of childhood traumatic experiences\u2014are more likely to increase  children\u2019s sense of safety and provide them with effective care. In  particular, ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA noted the role of evidence-based  practices\u2014interventions shown to produce measureable improvements or  promising results\u2014in decreasing emotional or behavioral symptoms. In  addition, according to ACF, psychotropic medication use with young  children, including infants, is of special concern since this population may  be especially vulnerable to adverse effects, necessitating careful  management and oversight.", "As we reported in December 2011, oversight procedures such as  prescription monitoring help states to identify and review potentially risky  prescribing practices in the foster-care population. Monitoring for  appropriate dosage can be beneficial as it is important for any medication  or combination of medications prescribed to use appropriate dosages to  maximize the likelihood of effectiveness while also minimizing the chance  of potential adverse effects. Monitoring for concurrent use of multiple  psychotropic medications can be beneficial because, according to ACF,  there is little evidence of the effectiveness of using multiple psychotropic  medications at the same time and no research to support the use of five  or more psychotropic medications.", "According to AACAP, treatment planning should include discussions by  key stakeholders, such as prescribers and caregivers, about the  assessment of target symptoms, behaviors, function, and potential  benefits and adverse effects of treatment options.
