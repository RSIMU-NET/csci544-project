At one site on the San Jacinto River in  Texas, floodwater eroded part of the structure containing such  substances, including dioxins, which are highly toxic and can cause  cancer and liver and nerve damage. That same year, the Fourth National  Climate Assessment (NCA) stated that many temperature and  precipitation extremes have become more frequent, more intense, or  longer in duration. The NCA reported that climate models are consistent  with these trends continuing, which may make certain natural disasters  more frequent or more intense. Further, the NCA reported that some  climate change effects, including sea level rise and increased coastal  flooding, could lead to the dispersal of pollutants, which could pose a risk  to public health.", "The Superfund program\u2014the federal government\u2019s principal program to  address sites with hazardous substances\u2014was established by the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). EPA is responsible for administering the  program. EPA coordinates the cleanup of Superfund sites by identifying  sites potentially requiring cleanup action and placing eligible sites on its  National Priorities List (NPL), which includes some of the most seriously  contaminated sites. As of September 2019, there were 1,336 active sites  on the list, and 421 sites that EPA had determined need no further  cleanup action (deleted sites). About 90 percent of these active and  deleted NPL sites are nonfederal sites, where EPA generally carries out  or oversees the cleanup conducted by one or more potentially  responsible parties (PRP). The other NPL sites\u2014approximately 10  percent\u2014are located at federal facilities, and the federal agencies that  administer those facilities are responsible for their cleanup.", "CERCLA authorizes EPA to take various types of cleanup actions to  prevent human and environmental exposure to contamination from  nonfederal NPL sites, including remedial actions, which are long-term  cleanups. As part of the Superfund cleanup process, EPA identifies,  analyzes, and selects remedial actions that seek to protect human health  and the environment and meet site-specific remediation goals. In  September 2015, we found that annual EPA expenditures for remedial  actions at nonfederal NPL sites could be considerable\u2014about $400  million for all such sites. EPA is also required to conduct or oversee  reviews at least every 5 years at sites where remedial actions are  complete but contaminants remain, including at deleted sites, if  contaminants remaining on those sites exceed certain levels. Under  EPA\u2019s regulations, the agency may take additional remedial actions to  address releases at deleted sites if warranted under future conditions.", "Climate change may impact Superfund sites in various ways. For  example, extreme precipitation events may impact Superfund sites that  have contaminated sediments in aquatic environments. Specifically, in a  2007 report, the National Research Council noted that buried  contaminated sediments at Superfund sites may be transported during  storms or other high-flow events, becoming a source of future exposure  and risk. As a result of the significant risks posed by climate change and  the nation\u2019s fiscal condition, in February 2013, we added Limiting the  Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate  Change Risks to our list of areas at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, or most in need of transformation.

We reviewed agency documents and  interviewed officials from agencies including EPA, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Forest Service. Based on our review  of the NCA, we identified potential climate change effects and, based on  our review of EPA documents, determined which of these effects may  impact nonfederal NPL sites. For these potential effects, we identified  available national-level federal data sets from FEMA, NOAA, and the U.S.  Forest Service on flooding, storm surge, and wildfires, respectively, which  are based on current or past conditions. The NCA reported that flooding,  storm surge, and wildfires will be exacerbated by climate change in some  parts of the country, but we did not identify federal data on the extent to  which these effects would vary from current or past conditions.

To the  extent that data were available, we analyzed a range of these potential  climate change effects. For example, we used the maximum extent of  storm surge from Category 1 hurricanes (the lowest possible category) as  well as Category 4 or 5 hurricanes (the highest possible categories), as  modeled by NOAA. The full range of our results can be viewed in an  interactive graphic, which is available here. We focused on a range because, for three of the four effects, we had data on current hazards,  which may become more intense and frequent in the future, according to  the NCA. Additionally, CERCLA directs EPA to give preference to  remedies that would result in the permanent and significant decrease in  toxicity, mobility, or volume of the contamination.

We analyzed these data using mapping software to identify  nonfederal NPL sites located in areas that may be impacted by selected  potential climate change effects. To do so, we determined whether there  are areas that may be impacted by flooding, storm surge, wildfires, and  sea level rise within a 0.2-mile radius of the primary geographic  coordinate of each nonfederal NPL site, which we used to represent the  site boundaries. We reviewed this analytical approach with EPA  officials. To assess the reliability of all of the data for our analysis, we,  among other things, assessed the timeliness and accuracy of the data  and related controls and found the data from EPA, FEMA, NOAA, and the  U.S. Forest Service to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

However,  the NCA stated that there is uncertainty in the projected increase in  frequency or intensity of Atlantic hurricanes, and other factors may affect  the potential for flooding because of storm surge, such as changes in  overall storm frequency or tracks. The full results of our analysis, which  include information on the number of sites in areas that may be inundated  by storm surge from Category 1 and from Category 4 or 5 hurricanes, are  available in our interactive map, which can be viewed here.

Further, EPA officials do not  always have direction to ensure that they consistently integrate climate  change information into site-level risk assessments and risk response  decisions, according to EPA documents and officials.

In  its comments, reproduced in appendix II, EPA stated that it recognizes  the importance of ensuring Superfund sites cleanups are resilient in the  face of existing risks and extreme weather events. EPA added that it has  taken actions to include vulnerability analyses and adaptation planning in  its Superfund activities. We acknowledge that EPA has taken some action  to manage risks. However, EPA has not clarified how its risk-related  actions align with agency goals and objectives. Further, it has not  provided direction to ensure that officials consistently integrate climate  change information into site-level risk assessments and risk response  decisions.", "Regarding our recommendations, EPA agreed with one and disagreed  with the other three. We continue to believe that all recommendations are  warranted.", "In response to our recommendation that the Director of the Office of  Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation establish a schedule  for standardizing and improving information on the boundaries of  nonfederal NPL sites, EPA noted that it agrees with our finding and  acknowledges a lack of consistent standards to identify site boundaries at  the national level. According to EPA, it has taken initial steps to develop  an approach to standardize and improve information on nonfederal NPL  site boundaries. EPA stated that it expects to establish a schedule for this  effort by the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, with the aim to have  collected an initial set of site boundaries for all NPL sites by the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2021.", "In response to our recommendation that EPA clarify how its actions to  manage risks to human health and the environment from the potential  impacts of climate change effects at nonfederal NPL sites align with the  agency\u2019s current goals and objectives, EPA said that it believes managing  risks from exposure to contaminants in the environment is integral to  EPA\u2019s current strategic goal 1.3, Revitalize Land and Prevent  Contamination. We agree that protectiveness is a key part of strategic  objective 1.3. However, this strategic objective does not include any  measures related to climate change or discuss strategies for addressing  the impacts of climate change effects. An essential element of enterprise  risk management is to align risk management processes with goals and  objectives. Consequently, we believe that our recommendation is still  warranted.", "In response to our recommendations that the Director of the Office of  Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation provide direction on  how to integrate information on the potential impacts of climate change  effects into risk assessments and risk response decisions at nonfederal  NPL sites, EPA said that it strongly believes the Superfund program\u2019s  existing processes and resources adequately ensure that risks and any  effects of severe weather events are woven into risk assessments and  risk response decisions at nonfederal NPL sites. However, as we noted in  our report, EPA\u2019s current direction does not address all types of cleanup  actions or climate change effects. Further, EPA officials from some  regions told us that current EPA practice for assessing risks at NPL sites  does not always include consideration of climate change and that they  have not consistently integrated climate change information into site- specific remedy selection and design. EPA noted that it may issue a  memorandum to reinforce the tools and resources available to NPL site  teams and would determine whether to issue this memorandum by the  end of January 2020.", "EPA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Based on  our review of the NCA, we identified the following potential climate  change effects: sea level rise, which may lead to increased frequency and  extent of extreme flooding from coastal storms; greater frequency and  magnitude of drought; increased intensity and frequency of heavy  precipitation events, which may lead to increased local flooding; salt  water intrusion; increased incidence of large wildfires; increased  frequency and intensity of extreme high temperatures and sustained  increases in average temperatures; decreased permafrost; and increased  intensity\u2014including higher wind speeds and precipitation rates\u2014and  frequency of very intense hurricanes and typhoons. We reviewed EPA  documents (such as EPA\u2019s climate change adaptation implementation  plans) to identify potential climate change effects that may impact  nonfederal NPL sites and interviewed EPA officials.", "Through a review of federal agencies\u2019 documents and databases and  interviews with officials about their data and research on these effects, we  identified available national federal data sets on three current hazards:  flooding, storm surge, and wildfires\u2014which the NCA reports will be  exacerbated by climate change\u2014from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Forest Service. We also identified  data on sea level rise from NOAA.", "In this report, we refer to (1) flooding, (2) storm surge, (3) wildfires, and  (4) sea level rise as potential climate change effects. We used the most  recently available data for each of these climate change effects; these  data do not provide estimates of the projected changes in the future. To  the extent that data were available, we analyzed a range of these  potential climate change effects. For example, we used the maximum  extent of storm surge from Category 1 hurricanes as well as Category 4  or 5 hurricanes, the highest possible categories, as modeled by NOAA.  We focused on a range because, for three of the four effects, we had data  on current hazards, which may become more intense and frequent in the  future, according to the NCA. Additionally, the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980  (CERCLA) directs EPA to give preference to remedies that would result in  the permanent and significant decrease in toxicity, mobility, or volume of  the contamination. According to EPA officials, remedies at nonfederal  NPL sites may have to be operational indefinitely, during which time the  potential effects of climate change may become more extreme.", "The range of estimates we provide in our report is as follows:", "For flooding, we used data from FEMA\u2019s National Flood Hazard Layer  as of October 2018. FEMA identifies a variety of flood hazards, and  for reporting purposes, we grouped flood hazard zones into four  categories: (1) 1 percent or higher annual chance of flooding, (2) 0.2  percent or higher annual chance of flooding or other flood hazards,  (3) unknown flood hazards, and (4) minimal flood hazard.", "For storm surge, we used data from NOAA\u2019s model on Sea, Lake and  Overland Surges from Hurricanes as of November 2018 for Category  1 and Category 4 or 5 hurricanes.", "For wildfire, we used data from the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s 2018 wildfire  hazard potential map, which the U.S. Forest Service released in July  2018. We used areas with high or very high wildfire hazard potential in  our analysis. The U.S. Forest Service based the 2018 map on wildfire  likelihood and intensity data from 2016, spatial fuels and vegetation  data from 2012, and point locations of past fire occurrence from 1992  to 2013.", "For sea level rise, we used NOAA data, last updated in September  2018. We downloaded inundation data on 0, 1, 3, and 8 feet of sea  level rise and \u201cnot mapped\u201d areas.", "We obtained data from EPA\u2019s Superfund Enterprise Management System  on the location and other characteristics of active and deleted nonfederal  NPL sites. In our analysis, we used a 0.2-mile radius around the primary  geographic coordinate point of each nonfederal NPL site, which may not  accurately represent their actual areas because the sites vary in size and  shape. The EPA data we used in our analysis on the location of  nonfederal NPL sites are current as of March 2019. We also obtained  EPA data on contaminants and types of remedies that are current as of  fiscal year 2014 to determine the number of contaminants EPA has  identified in nonfederal NPL sites. We did not conduct further site-specific  analyses, such as those related to the extent of contamination and  location of remedies. We reviewed documents from the Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry on the health effects of hazardous  substances in nonfederal NPL sites and interviewed officials from that  agency.", "To analyze whether nonfederal NPL sites are located in areas that may  be impacted by flooding, we used ArcGIS mapping software to intersect  the area of a 0.2-mile radius around the primary coordinate of the sites  with the categories we defined from the National Flood Hazard Layer. If a  site overlapped with areas in more than one of the four reporting groups,  we categorized the site in the group representing the highest flood  hazard. For the purposes of our report, we considered the highest flood  hazard to be, in descending order, 1 percent or higher annual chance of  flooding, other flood hazards (including 0.2 percent or higher annual  chance of flooding), unknown flood hazard or no data, and minimal flood  hazard. To analyze whether nonfederal NPL sites are located in areas  that may be impacted by storm surge, wildfires, and sea level rise, we  used MapInfo mapping software to intersect the area of a 0.2-mile radius  around the primary coordinates of sites with each of these layers. Overlap  indicates that a site is potentially in an area that may be impacted.", "To assess the reliability of FEMA\u2019s National Flood Hazard Layer, we  reviewed FEMA\u2019s methodology, guidelines, and standards; interviewed  FEMA officials to assess the timeliness and accuracy of the data as well  as any limitations of the data; conducted data testing to check for missing  data and inconsistencies; and reviewed internal controls. We also  reviewed a prior GAO report on the methodology FEMA uses to map  flood hazards. To assess the reliability of NOAA\u2019s data on Sea, Lake and  Overland Surges from Hurricanes, we reviewed NOAA\u2019s methodology for  developing the model, interviewed NOAA officials to assess the  timeliness and accuracy of the data as well as any limitations of the data,  and reviewed internal controls. To assess the reliability of the U.S. Forest  Service\u2019s wildfire hazard potential data, we reviewed the agency\u2019s  documentation of the methodology, interviewed U.S. Forest Service  officials to assess the timeliness and accuracy of the data as well as any  limitations of the data, and reviewed internal controls. We also reviewed  our past reports that cited the 2014 versions of these data. To assess  the reliability of NOAA\u2019s data on sea level rise, we reviewed the  methodology NOAA used for developing the model, interviewed NOAA  officials to assess the timeliness and accuracy of the data as well as any  limitations of the data, and reviewed internal controls.", "To assess the reliability of EPA\u2019s data, we reviewed agency manuals and  data dictionaries to understand data elements, interviewed EPA officials  to assess the timeliness and accuracy of the data and related internal  controls, conducted data testing, discussed inaccuracies with EPA  officials; and obtained corrected data. For example, we compared the zip  code of each nonfederal NPL site to its coordinate to check the accuracy  of site locations. We shared potential errors with EPA officials, who  corrected the coordinates of six sites. As a result of the steps described  above, we found data from EPA, FEMA, NOAA, and the U.S. Forest  Service to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the extent to which EPA has managed risks to human  health and the environment from the potential impacts of climate change  effects on nonfederal NPL sites, we examined relevant provisions in  CERCLA, EPA\u2019s implementing regulations, and executive orders. We  also reviewed EPA documents, including climate change adaptation and  implementation plans; vulnerability studies; training materials; and site- specific documents, our prior work, and relevant documents from other  organizations, such as the National Research Council. We identified  these documents by conducting a search of (1) websites of relevant  agencies and organizations and (2) article databases. We also reviewed  documents provided to us by agency officials and stakeholders that we  identified as described below. We interviewed EPA officials at  headquarters and all regional offices to identify information on agency  actions for managing risks. In addition, to obtain their views of EPA\u2019s  actions, we interviewed former EPA officials, representatives of two  associations representing state officials (the Environmental Council of  States and the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste  Management Officials), a professor of environmental law, and a private  consultant who has worked on Superfund issues, which we identified in  the search described above and recommendations from other  interviewees. We generally contacted all stakeholders that we identified  who appeared to be currently working on issues related to Superfund and  climate change and who agreed to speak with us. We also interviewed  stakeholders at the three sites we selected as illustrative examples in  order to obtain their views of EPA\u2019s actions.", "We selected three nonfederal NPL sites as illustrative examples of how  EPA has managed risks to human health and the environment from  potential impacts of climate change effects and challenges EPA may face  in managing these risks. The three sites we selected are the (1) American  Cyanamid site in Bridgewater, New Jersey; (2) Iron Mountain Mine site  near Redding, California; and (3) San Jacinto River Waste Pits site in  Channelview, Texas. To select these sites, we initially identified 43 sites  based on information in EPA documents, news articles, and interviews  with EPA officials and other stakeholders as described above. We  selected relevant sites in three different EPA regions that illustrate a  variety of potential climate change effects and that had experienced an  extreme weather event in the past 10 years. To gather more in-depth  information about these sites, we reviewed EPA and other documents;  toured the sites; and interviewed EPA officials and relevant stakeholders  at these sites, including state and local officials, representatives of  potentially responsible parties, and community organizations. The results  from these illustrative examples are not generalizable to nonfederal NPL  sites that we did not select.", "We compared EPA\u2019s actions to manage risks to human health and the  environment from the potential impacts of climate change effects with  essential elements for managing risk as identified in our prior work on  enterprise risk management. These essential elements are as follows:  (1) align the risk management process with goals and objectives, (2)  identify risks, (3) assess risks, (4) respond to the risks, (5) monitor the  risks, and (6) communicate and report on the risks. We assessed  information on EPA\u2019s actions to determine the extent to which the  agency\u2019s actions aligned with these elements. In assessing EPA\u2019s actions  against these essential elements, we used \u201caligned,\u201d \u201cpartially aligned,\u201d or  \u201cnot aligned\u201d to reflect the extent to which EPA took actions aligned with  each essential element. If EPA provided evidence that it had taken major  actions in alignment with that essential element, we determined the  actions were aligned. If EPA provided evidence that it had taken some  actions in alignment with that essential element, we determined the  actions were partially aligned. If EPA took only a few or no actions in  alignment with that essential element, we determined the actions were  not aligned. Two GAO analysts independently reviewed the information  on EPA\u2019s actions and then reached consensus on the extent to which  EPA\u2019s actions were aligned with each element.", "To identify the challenges EPA faces in managing these risks, we  reviewed EPA documents; our prior work; and relevant documents from  other organizations, including the National Research Council, that we  obtained as described above. We interviewed EPA officials at  headquarters and all regional offices and stakeholders in order to obtain  their views on the challenges EPA faces. The views of stakeholders we  interviewed are illustrative and not generalizable to all stakeholders. We  reviewed the challenges that we identified in these documents and  interviews and grouped all the challenges into three categories for  reporting purposes: institutional, resource, and technical. Two GAO  analysts independently reviewed the information and then reached  consensus on the challenges and their grouping in the three categories.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to October 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
