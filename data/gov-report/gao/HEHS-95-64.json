In fiscal year 1994 lender commitments for subsidized Stafford loans, accounting for most FFELP loans, totaled about $14.8 billion. You asked us to study the availability of federally subsidized Stafford student loans for postsecondary education in light of recent legislated changes. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 authorized the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP) and brought changes to FFELP including decreases in the interest rates lenders may charge for Stafford loans and the rate at which lenders receive reimbursement if borrowers fail to repay the loans. These changes have raised concerns about whether lenders will continue to make these loans.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to determine (1) how guaranty agency and lender representatives, Department of Education officials, and others perceive the risk that eligible borrowers will have difficulty obtaining subsidized Stafford loans; (2) what arrangements guaranty agencies have in place or are adopting to provide loans to eligible borrowers that may have difficulty; and (3) what the Department is doing to ensure continued access to subsidized Stafford loans.", "To address these objectives, we sent a questionnaire to each guaranty agency inquiring about access to subsidized Stafford loans through fiscal year 1995 and their \u201clender-of-last-resort\u201d (LLR) programs and plans. Of the 45 guaranty agencies making new guarantees at that time, 43 responded to the survey. See the appendix for a copy of the questionnaire with summary results. We did not verify agencies\u2019 responses to the questionnaire.", "To supplement the questionnaire results, we reviewed guaranty agency LLR plans that had been approved by the Department. We discussed LLR programs, contingency plans, and agency monitoring efforts with officials from the Department; representatives at the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), a government-sponsored enterprise that purchases student loans from lenders; and with student loan interest groups including the Consumer Bankers Association, which provided us a written reply to questions based on responses from several of its members that lend to students."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FFELP is the largest source of federal financial assistance to students attending postsecondary institutions. In fiscal year 1994 students received about $23 billion in FFELP loan commitments, including about $14.8 billion in subsidized Stafford loans. The Department of Education pays interest to lenders on the behalf of subsidized Stafford loan borrowers while they are in school and during a subsequent 6-month grace period. This interest benefit is not available to borrowers for other FFELP loans. The private lenders that provide these loans may not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, religion, sex, marital status, age, or handicapped status but, according to a Department policy official, may deny loans to eligible borrowers who do not meet their lending standards. Lenders may, for example, deny loans to students attending proprietary (for profit, typically trade and vocational) institutions or schools with high loan default rates. They may also withdraw from the program.", "Guaranty agencies, designated state or private not-for-profit entities, help administer FFELP by, for example, reimbursing lenders if borrowers fail to repay their loans. If an eligible borrower experiences difficulty obtaining a subsidized Stafford loan, guaranty agencies are required to provide one. The agencies may do so either directly or through a lender authorized to make LLR loans. Guaranty agencies must provide subsidized Stafford LLR loans to eligible students that have been denied a loan by two or more participating lenders. This requirement does not apply to unsubsidized Stafford loans.", "Several major changes to the subsidized loan program may influence the availability of loans. The 1992 amendments, for example, reduced the interest revenue lenders can receive from subsidized loans, and the 1993 Student Loan Reform Act reduced the rate at which guaranty agencies generally reimburse lenders if borrowers fail to repay their loans. In addition, the 1993 act established FDSLP to provide loans to students from the Department of Education rather than from private lenders. This program is expected to provide at least 60 percent of federal student loans by the 1998-99 academic year. Such reductions in student loan revenue and competition from the direct student loan program could reduce the profitability of student loans and reduce lenders\u2019 willingness to offer new loans to students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings", "paragraphs": ["In response to our questionnaire and in discussions with us, participants in the subsidized Stafford loan program expressed differing views on the risk that eligible students could be denied loans through the end of fiscal year 1995. Most but not all guaranty agencies have arrangements in place to provide loans to students that have difficulty obtaining loans. The Department has several options for ensuring access if guaranty agencies are not able to do so without assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Perceived Risk of Loan Access Problems", "paragraphs": ["As some lenders become selective in making Stafford loans or stop participating in the program, many lenders and guaranty agencies expect some eligible subsidized Stafford loan borrowers to be denied loans by one or more lenders.", "We asked program participants to describe the risk that 5 percent or more of eligible borrowers will be refused a subsidized Stafford loan by one or more lenders through the end of fiscal year 1995. Department officials with whom we spoke foresaw little or no risk that lender refusals to make loans would be widespread. Sallie Mae officials also doubted that as many as 5 percent of eligible borrowers would be denied a loan. The President of the Consumer Bankers Association said that there is \u201csome\u201d risk that 5 percent or more would be denied a loan.", "The guaranty agencies that responded to our questionnaire had a wide range of views on this question. (See fig. 1.) Thirteen of these agencies rated the risk \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d or \u201cvery great,\u201d while 16 agencies said that there is \u201clittle or no risk.\u201d The remaining 13 agencies indicated \u201csome risk.\u201d One responded that it did not know.", "Some Risk (13) 10% Moderate Risk (4) 10% Great Risk (4)", "Very Great Risk (5)", "Concerns that some students will have difficulty obtaining access to loans evolve from lenders\u2019 deciding to leave the program or to become selective in making student loans. Additional departures of lenders from FFELP would represent a continuation of a trend begun in the mid-1980s. For example, during fiscal years 1984-1986, between 11,000 and 12,000 lenders participated in FFELP. The number of participating lenders has declined each year since, in part reflecting the general trend of mergers and consolidations in the financial community. By fiscal year 1993 the Department counted fewer than 7,500 active lenders. In response to our questionnaire, 28 agencies said that one or more of their lenders\u2014lenders whose loans they guarantee\u2014had indicated they plan to stop making subsidized Stafford loans sometime in the future. Six agencies said that this included one of their five largest loan volume lenders. Three of these agencies referred to the same lender.", "In addition to lenders that may stop making loans, concerns about loan access may arise if lenders choose to become more selective about making loans. Twenty agencies responded that one or more of their lenders planned to stop making loans to students attending institutions with student loan default rates that they\u2014the lenders\u2014consider too high. Most of these agencies said that 5 or fewer lenders would stop making loans, but one agency said that more than 200 lenders would stop."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guaranty Agency Arrangements for Providing LLR Loans", "paragraphs": ["Most guaranty agencies\u201440 of the 43 respondents\u2014had arrangements to provide LLR loans to eligible students. These arrangements included agreements with state secondary markets or other participating lenders to provide loans. Through September 30, 1993, the volume of loans provided through these arrangements had been small. More than half of the agencies said that they did not guarantee any LLR loans in fiscal years 1992 or 1993. The 16 agencies that provided data on LLR loans they made in fiscal year 1993 had an aggregate LLR loan volume of $32 million\u2014about 0.3 percent of the $12.5 billion of subsidized Stafford loans made in fiscal year 1993.", "Twenty-six of the responding guaranty agencies responded to our question concerning the estimated capacity of their LLR arrangements. Twenty-two agencies estimated that they could have provided about $1.8 billion in LLR loans in fiscal year 1994. This represents an amount that is more than 50 times the total LLR loan volume for fiscal year 1993, and about one-eighth of total subsidized Stafford loan volume in fiscal year 1994. Three agencies cited \u201cunlimited\u201d LLR capacity. The largest guaranty agency, United Student Aid Funds, Inc., said that it has no set maximum on its LLR capacity.", "Nearly all of the agencies indicated they had LLR arrangements, and two-thirds had plans that the Department had approved. Department officials said that six agencies had not submitted plans for approval. Plans from the remaining agencies were either pending approval, or the plans submitted had been denied approval and the agencies had not resubmitted their plans. (See table 1.)", "Thirty-one guaranty agencies responded that they had agreements with lenders to provide LLR loans, but only 20 agencies had such agreements in writing. All LLR agreements but one either allow lenders to withdraw from their LLR commitments at any time or do not specify withdrawal terms. Four agreements specified that the arrangements applied for a specific time period, ranging from 12 to 18 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department\u2019s Plans to Ensure Access to Loans", "paragraphs": ["Department officials told us they have several tools to help ensure that eligible borrowers have access to guaranteed student loans. They can assist guaranty agencies in recruiting lenders to provide LLR loans, direct Sallie Mae to make the loans, provide federal advances (interest-free loans) to guaranty agencies to enable them to make LLR loans, or make loans through the direct loan program.", "The Department is also developing a data reporting mechanism that, according to Department officials, will improve its monitoring of guaranty agencies\u2019 financial posture. It has proposed requiring each agency to submit annual 5-year financial projections.", "The Department recognizes that with the implementation of FDSLP, FFELP will require fewer guaranty agencies as the number of direct loans increases in relation to the number of guaranteed loans. Therefore, the Department is\u2014and plans to continue\u2014encouraging consolidation among guaranty agencies through mergers and takeovers in the belief that greater efficiency can be achieved through economies of scale. During the process of this consolidation, lenders could be left without guarantee services being available. In anticipation that such a condition may materialize, in 1994 the Department contracted with the private, nonprofit Transitional Guaranty Agency to provide loan guarantee functions, as the Department determines necessary.", "For those guaranty agencies having difficulty getting lenders to make student loans, particularly LLR loans, Department officials told us they can assist the agencies to recruit lenders or seek commitments from current LLR lenders to make more LLR loans. As of November 1, 1994, the Department had assisted one agency. According to Department and agency officials, it helped the California Student Aid Commission identify lenders to provide LLR loans to eligible borrowers at certain schools.", "The Department and Sallie Mae signed an agreement through which Sallie Mae could provide up to $200 million of LLR loans through fiscal year 1995. This amount can be increased by mutual written agreement between the Department and Sallie Mae. As of December 6, 1994, Sallie Mae made 149 unsubsidized Stafford LLR loans and 62 subsidized Stafford loans that were guaranteed by the Texas guaranty agency.", "Through the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the Department can make federal advances to guaranty agencies to provide loan capital needed to make LLR loans. The statute also provides authority for Sallie Mae to make advances to guaranty agencies to enable them to make LLR loans. In addition, with the implementation of FDSLP, the Department has the option of making direct loans to students if guaranteed loans are unavailable.", "Many uncertainties make predictions about the availability of loans in future years very difficult. For example, it is unclear whether guaranty agencies\u2019 LLR arrangements will ensure access because many agencies\u2019 LLR agreements allow lenders to withdraw at any time. It is also unclear to what extent postsecondary institutions will increase their participation in FDSLP. As institutions elect to participate in FDSLP, the demand for FFELP loans will decline, which may in turn encourage additional lenders to withdraw from the program or become more selective in making loans. On the other hand, the demand for LLR loans may decline if schools whose students are obtaining LLR loans switch to FDSLP. It is also uncertain how the actions of the 104th Congress, whose leadership has pledged to constrain federal spending, might affect federal student loan programs and the Department\u2019s ability to ensure access."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Generally FFELP administrators foresaw little or no risk of widespread loan access problems through fiscal year 1995, the period covered by our review. However, several respondents to our questionnaire foresaw more risk.

However, if such arrangements prove inadequate, the Department has several options to ensure students\u2019 access to subsidized loans, which have proved adequate in the few instances in which they were used.
