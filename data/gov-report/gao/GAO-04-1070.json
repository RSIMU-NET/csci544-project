In light of the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, we examined special allowance payments for 9.5% loans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Special allowance payments for 9.5% loans have risen dramatically in recent years, increasing from $209 million in FY 2001 to well over $600 million as of June 30, 2004. A primary reason for the increase is the sharp decline in the variable interest rates paid by borrowers relative to the minimum 9.5% lender yield. Another reason for the increase in special allowance payments is the rising dollar volume of 9.5% loans, which increased from about $11 to over $17 billion from FY 1995 to June 30, 2004. Given that current market interest rates are at or near historic lows, lenders have a financial incentive to maintain or increase their 9.5% loan volume and can do so in three ways. After paying costs, including payments to bond investors, associated with a pre 10/1/93 tax-exempt bond, lenders can use any remaining money to reinvest in more FFELP loans that, by law, are also guaranteed a minimum 9.5% yield. Lenders can issue a new bond, called a refunding bond, to repay an outstanding pre 10/1/93 tax-exempt bond that financed 9.5% loans. Consequently, the refunding bond finances the 9.5% loans and may have a later maturity date than the original bond, allowing lenders to maintain their 9.5% loan volume for a longer time. By issuing a taxable bond and using the funds obtained to purchase 9.5% loans financed by a pre-10/1/93 tax-exempt bond, lenders can significantly increase their loan volume. Lenders can use the proceeds from the sale of loans previously financed by the pre-10/1/93 tax-exempt bond to make or buy additional loans, which are also guaranteed a 9.5% yield. Under Education's regulations, loans previously financed by a pre 10/1/93 tax-exempt bond and subsequently financed by (i.e., transferred to) a taxable bond continue to be guaranteed a 9.5% yield. Some Members of Congress and the Administration have proposed making statutory changes with respect to 9.5% loans, which could save billions of dollars in future special allowance payments. An official representing a leading credit rating agency and some major lenders told us that making changes to the minimum 9.5% yield for loans made or purchased in the future should not affect lenders' ability to make required payments on outstanding tax-exempt bonds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), lenders\u2014 including banks, state agencies and other nonprofit and for-profit  organizations\u2014annually make, or originate, billions of dollars in loans to  help students and families finance postsecondary education costs. To  encourage lenders to make loans, the federal government guarantees  lenders repayment and a statutorily specified rate of return\u2014called lender  yield\u2014on the loans they hold. Lender yields as well as the interest rates  paid by borrowers are typically tied to, and vary with, money market  financial instruments, such as the 91-day Treasury bill. When the interest  rate paid by borrowers is less than the guaranteed lender yield, the  government pays lenders the difference\u2014a subsidy called special  allowance payments. In exercising its oversight of the FFELP, Congress  has periodically changed the formula for lender yields to better reflect  market interest rates, federal budget constraints, or the costs incurred by  lenders to finance loans. To finance loans, some lenders, specifically state  agencies and state-designated authorities, may issue tax-exempt bonds to  raise capital to make or purchase loans, thereby providing other lenders  with more funds to make more loans. Investors who buy these bonds  receive interest income that is exempt from federal taxation. Because  these investors do not pay taxes on their interest earnings, they are willing  to accept a lower pretax rate of return on their investment, which lowers  the financing costs for agencies and authorities issuing the bonds. As  student loan borrowers repay their loans, loan holders use the money to  repay, in turn, bond investors.", "Concerned that the lender yield for loans financed with tax-exempt bonds  did not adequately reflect the lower costs associated with tax-exempt  financing, Congress reduced the yield in passing the Education  Amendments of 1980. To do so, Congress reduced the special allowance  payments to be paid on loans financed with tax-exempt bonds to one-half  of that otherwise payable. At the same time, however, Congress  guaranteed that the lender yield for loans financed with tax-exempt bonds  would be no less than 9.5 percent. Several years later, in passing the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress eliminated the one- half special allowance payment and minimum 9.5 percent yield provision  for loans financed with tax-exempt bonds issued on or after October 1,  1993. In so doing, Congress provided that lenders would receive the same  yield on loans, regardless of whether tax-exempt bonds or other sources  of funds had been used to finance the loans. Due to these changes, loans  that are financed with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds issued prior to  October 1, 1993 are guaranteed a minimum 9.5 percent yield. (These loans  are hereafter called 9.5 percent loans).", "Believing that changes to the law should have resulted in a decline in  special allowance payments made for 9.5 percent loans since 1993, various  news media, policy makers, and others have recently raised questions  about the extent to which the government continues to make such  payments. In light of the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act of 1965, which authorizes the FFELP, you asked us to  examine special allowance payments for 9.5 percent loans. To conduct our  examination, we analyzed the Department of Education\u2019s (Education) data  on 9.5 percent loan volume and special allowance payments paid to  lenders from fiscal year 1986 through the third quarter of fiscal year   2004, the most current data available at the time of our review. On the  basis of our review of the documentation for these data and our  discussions with Education officials about the steps they take to ensure  the reliability and validity of these data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our examination. In addition, we  interviewed officials with Education; the Internal Revenue Service; a  major credit rating agency that examines and rates the quality of student  loan bonds, including those issued by several holders of 9.5 percent loans;  a leading bond counsel law firm that provides legal advice to lenders that  issue tax-exempt student loan bonds; and 12 lenders that reported holding  9.5 percent loans in fiscal year 2003. We gathered additional data on the  amount of 9.5 percent loans in taxable bonds from the top 10 holders of  9.5 percent loans in fiscal year 2003. These 10 lenders held 70 percent of  reported 9.5 percent loan volume in fiscal year 2003.", "On August 19, 2004, we briefed your staff on the results of our work. This  report summarizes the information we shared with your staff and  transmits the slides we used to brief your staff that day. In this report, we  are also making a recommendation to the Secretary of Education and  suggesting a matter for Congress\u2019s consideration. We conducted our work  between December 2003 and August 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Special Allowance Payments For 9.5 Percent Loans Have Increased More Than Threefold Since Fiscal Year 2001", "paragraphs": ["Special allowance payments for 9.5 percent loans have risen dramatically  in recent years, increasing from $209 million in fiscal year 2001, to   $556 million in fiscal year 2003 and reached about $634 million at the end  of the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. Two reasons account for this  increase: (1) a decline in the interest rate paid by borrowers and (2) a rise  in the dollar volume of 9.5 percent loans. In some cases, restrictions exist  on how the nonprofit, for-profit, and state agency lenders that hold 9.5  percent loans may use their earnings, including their special allowance  payments, from 9.5 percent loans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Decline in Interest Rate Paid by Borrowers Is Primary Reason for Increase in Special Allowance Payments", "paragraphs": ["The primary factor influencing the increase in special allowance payments  has been the sharp decline in interest rates paid by borrowers relative to  the minimum 9.5 percent government guaranteed yield for lenders. As  borrower rates have declined, the amount the government has been  required to pay to make good on its promise to lenders has increased. To  illustrate, in 2001, the borrower interest rate was 8.2 percent. Because this  borrower rate is tied to the 91-day Treasury-bill rate and the Treasury-bill  rate subsequently declined, the borrower interest rate on the same loan in  2003 was 5.4 percent. While the borrower rate declined, the yield for a  lender who used the proceeds, or funds obtained, of a pre-October 1, 1993,  tax-exempt bond to originate or purchase the loan remained at 9.5 percent.  Over this period, the difference, or spread, between the borrower rate and  the 9.5 percent lender yield increased from 1.3 percent to 4.1 percent. As a  result, the special allowance payment required to ensure a lender yield of  9.5 percent increased for each dollar of loan volume in this example."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing 9.5 Percent Loan Volume Is Another Reason for the Increase in Special Allowance Payments", "paragraphs": ["Another factor influencing the increase in special allowance payments has  been the rising dollar volume of 9.5 percent loans. Although the overall  volume of 9.5 percent loans has increased since fiscal year 1995, volume  among lenders has varied. Most lenders experienced a decrease in their   9.5 percent loan volume between fiscal years 1995 and 2003, but by the end  of the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, some of these lenders had sharply  increased their 9.5 percent loan volume. For example, one lenders\u2019   9.5 percent loan volume had decreased by 46 percent between fiscal years  1995 and 2003 but then increased by 136 percent between 2003 and the end  of the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, making its 9.5 percent loan volume  greater than it was in 1995.", "There are primarily three ways\u2014referred to as recycling, refunding, and  transferring\u2014that a lender can slow the decrease in, maintain, or increase  its 9.5 percent loan volume.", "First, after paying costs associated with a pre-October 1, 1993 tax- exempt bond (such as payments of interest and principal to bond  investors), lenders can reinvest, or recycle, any remaining money  earned from 9.5 percent loans to make or purchase additional loans  that, under the law, are also guaranteed a minimum 9.5 percent lender  yield.   Using this method, lenders are able to slow the decrease in,  maintain, or slightly increase their 9.5 percent loan volume.", "Second, lenders can issue a new bond, called a refunding bond, to  repay the principal, interest, and other costs of an outstanding pre- October 1, 1993 tax-exempt bond. Based on how the HEA has been  interpreted, 9.5 percent loans originally financed with a pre-October 1,  1993 tax-exempt bond, but subsequently financed by a refunding bond,  continue to carry the government guaranteed minimum yield for  lenders of 9.5 percent. Moreover, the refunding bond may have a later  maturity, or payoff, date than the original bond. Using this method,  lenders can maintain their 9.5 percent loan volume.", "Third, under Education regulations, a lender can significantly increase  its 9.5 percent loan volume by issuing a taxable bond and using the  proceeds to purchase 9.5 percent loans financed by a pre-October 1,  1993 tax-exempt bond. The lender then uses the cash available from the  pre-October 1, 1993 tax-exempt bond to make or buy additional loans,  which are guaranteed the minimum 9.5 percent yield. Under  regulations issued in 1992, the loans transferred to the taxable bond  continue to be guaranteed the minimum 9.5 percent lender yield, so  long as the original bond is not retired or defeased. (At the time the  regulation was promulgated, Education anticipated that interest rates  would rise, resulting in a higher lender yield for loans financed with  taxable bonds than for loans financed with tax-exempt bonds.  Education believed that if the 1992 regulation was not promulgated,  lenders would have had an incentive to transfer loans from tax-exempt  bonds to taxable bonds in order to obtain a higher yield, thus resulting  in higher special allowance payments for the government.) Among the  top 10 lenders holding 9.5 percent loans, more than half of the dollar  volume of their 9.5 percent loans had been transferred to taxable bonds  as of March 31, 2004. The extent to which lenders have transferred   9.5 percent loans to taxable bonds varies considerably. For example,  one lender had none of its 9.5 percent loans in a taxable bond, while  another held 90 percent of its 9.5 percent loans in a taxable bond as of  March 31, 2004. Some lenders interviewed have been transferring   9.5 percent loans for several years, while another lender just started to  transfer 9.5 percent loans in 2004. Additionally, some lenders have also  transferred 9.5 percent loans to tax-exempt bonds issued after October  1, 1993, thereby continuing the 9.5 percent minimum guaranteed yield.", "As a result of recycling, refunding, and transferring, the overall dollar  volume of 9.5 percent loans has increased from about $11 billion in fiscal  year 1995 to over $17 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year  2004. While the dollar volume of 9.5 percent loans presently accounts for  only about 8 percent of all outstanding FFELP loan volume, these loans  account for 78 percent of all special allowance payments made to FFELP  lenders thus far in fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earnings on Tax-Exempt Bonds that Finance 9.5 percent Loans May be Used for Borrower Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), earnings on loans financed by  tax-exempt bonds are limited.

Some lenders reported that they have  used, or plan to use, earnings in excess of IRC limits to provide interest  rate reductions or loan cancellation for borrowers. In contrast to tax- exempt bonds, earnings on taxable bonds are not limited.

The Administration and some members of Congress have,  in fact, already put forth proposals to make such changes. The  Administration has proposed limiting the extent to which lenders can  receive the substantially higher special allowance payments on 9.5 percent  loans in the future and estimates savings of $4.9 billion over fiscal years  2005 through 2014 by doing so. Proposed legislation introduced in the  108th Congress also seeks to revise the law pertaining to 9.5 percent loans  in order to reduce special allowance payments and change lender yields to  reflect current market interest rates.", "Changing current regulations that allow lenders to transfer 9.5 percent  loans to taxable bonds and retain the minimum 9.5 percent yield could  also significantly reduce potential special allowance payments in the  future. While Education officials told us that they had considered revising  the department\u2019s regulations, they believed that Congress could effect  such a change by law more quickly and easily. Education officials told us  that promulgating new FFELP regulations would likely be difficult and  time-consuming, in light of the HEA\u2019s requirement that the department  engage in negotiated rule making in promulgating FFELP regulations.  Negotiated rule making requires the department to convene a committee  that would include FFELP industry representatives, such as lenders, and  attempt to reach consensus among committee members on proposed  regulations. Given the interest of lenders who hold 9.5 percent loans,  reaching consensus on new regulations would likely prove to be very  difficult, according to Education officials. However, the inability to reach  consensus does not invalidate the negotiation of rules.  Moreover,  regulations are not subject to the negotiated rulemaking requirement if the  Secretary determines that applying this requirement would be  'impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'   Representatives from a major credit rating agency as well as some lenders  who hold 9.5 percent loans told us that eliminating the minimum   9.5 percent yield for loans made or purchased in the future should not  affect lenders\u2019 ability to meet their obligations under, and make required  payments on, their outstanding tax-exempt bonds, nor should it have long- term negative effects in the student loan bond market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Unlike other loans for which the lender yield varies with current market  interest rates, the lender yield for loans financed with pre-October 1, 1993  tax-exempt bonds are guaranteed a minimum yield of 9.5 percent. Given  that current market interest rates are at or near historic lows, lenders have  a significant financial incentive to slow the decrease in, maintain, or  increase the volume of loans that yield such a relatively high rate of return  unavailable on other FFELP loans. This incentive will remain even if  market interest rates gradually rise in the future. Ironically, moreover, an  Education regulation over 10 years old and originally intended to limit the  government\u2019s exposure to increased special allowance payments has today  presented lenders with an extraordinary opportunity to generate  additional loans that earn a 9.5 percent yield. As we have shown, lenders  are taking advantage of these opportunities. Industry experts acknowledge  that the government could take action to eliminate the 9.5 percent yield for  loans made or purchased in the future without compromising the ability of  lenders to meet their obligations with respect to their pre-October 1, 1993  tax-exempt bonds. Without government action, the taxpayers remained  exposed to additional special allowance payments that can easily and  rapidly escalate into the billions of dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of the rapid increase in special allowance payments for loans  guaranteed a minimum 9.5 percent yield and the continuing financial  incentive for lenders to originate or purchase additional loans that qualify  for a guaranteed yield of 9.5 percent, Congress should consider amending  the HEA to address the issues identified by this report, but particularly to  change the yield for loans made or purchased in the future with the  proceeds of pre-October 1, 1993 tax-exempt bonds, and any associated  refunding bonds, to more closely reflect these loans\u2019 financing costs and  current market interest rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given that lenders are increasing the volume of 9.5 percent loans based on  Education regulations that allow lenders to transfer 9.5 percent loans to  taxable bonds and tax-exempt bonds issued after October 1, 1993 while  retaining the special allowance payment provisions applicable to loans  financed with pre-October 1, 1993 tax-exempt bonds, and the resulting  increased costs for taxpayers, we recommend that the Secretary of  Education promulgate regulations to discontinue the payment of the  special allowance applicable to loans financed with pre-October 1, 1993  tax-exempt bonds that are subsequently transferred to taxable bonds or  tax-exempt bonds issued on or after October 1, 1993."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.  In commenting on our report, Education agreed that special allowance  payments for 9.5 percent loans should be scaled back considerably and  that, as noted in our report, such a proposal was included in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget. Education also stated that it had  considered changing its regulation or its interpretation of the regulation  last year, but believed at that time that the HEA would be reauthorized and  amended to address the issues discussed in our report before any  proposed regulation or regulatory interpretation it might undertake could  become effective. Education stated this was the case because of certain  requirements contained in the HEA and other laws, including a  requirement that it engage in negotiated rule making.", "Education also commented on the statutory exception to the general  requirement that it engage in negotiated rule making, which we highlighted  in our report. As mentioned in our report, the Secretary need not subject a  rule making to the negotiated rule making process if the Secretary  determines that the process would be \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or  contrary to the public interest.\u201d In its comments, Education stated that the  courts have construed this exception only to cover routine determinations  that are insignificant in nature and impact, inconsequential to industry and  to the public, or which raise issues of public safety. While we believe that  it is Education\u2019s responsibility to interpret the law as it relates to its own  programs, on the basis of our review of the case law, we disagree with  Education\u2019s characterization of the case law concerning the scope of the  exception in the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, it does not  fully address the courts\u2019 treatment of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d prong of the  three-pronged exception noted above.", "The federal courts have interpreted the three-pronged exception in many  cases involving a wide variety of factual situations. Education\u2019s  characterization of the case law describes the courts\u2019 discussion of the  first two prongs, \u201cimpracticable\u201d or \u201cunnecessary,\u201d but does not fully  address the potential applicability of the third prong, which, if met, would  independently justify use of the exception. In fact, in the case cited by  Education in its comments, Utility Solid Waste Activities Group v.  E.P.A., 236 F.3d 749 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the court briefly explains the \u201cpublic  interest exception\u201d by pointing to a situation where announcement of the  rule in advance would \u201cenable the sort of financial manipulation the rule  sought to prevent.\u201d  Id. at 755; see also, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the  Administrative Procedure Act, pp. 30-31.  Thus, it is clear that the  applicability of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d exception turns neither on the  insignificance of the rule nor on whether it raises issues of public safety.   See also Nader v. Sawhill, 514 F.2d 1064 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  Moreover, in  reviewing challenges to an agency\u2019s use of an exception, the Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia has stated that it will review the  \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including the complexity of the statute and  congressionally imposed time frames.  See Methodist Hosp. of  Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Petry v. Block, 737  F.2d 1193 (D.C. Cir. 1984).", "Determining whether the unique circumstances present here support the  agency\u2019s use of an exception is beyond the scope of our report and is a  matter, in the first instance, for Education.  Nevertheless, we continue to  believe that Education should consider all of its options in effecting the  desired policy change as we recommend in the report.  This could include,  for example, determining whether Education could use less formal  guidance, as it has in the past, to clarify or alter its position; whether a full  consideration of all the facts and circumstances as well as all the  applicable case law would support use of an exception to the negotiated  rule making requirement; whether an interim final rule could be issued to  take effect immediately; or whether negotiated rule making could be  accomplished on an expedited basis.  Given Education\u2019s position that it is  essentially unable to implement regulations until July 1, 2006, more than  21 months away, we think it is important that Education fully explore all  of its options, consistent with applicable law.
