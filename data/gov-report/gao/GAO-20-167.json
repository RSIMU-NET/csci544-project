PHMSA expected that all 25 eligible states would help inspect sites, but only 10 states agreed to partner with the agency. As a result, the agency's inspection workload increased by almost 60 percent from when it set its goal, according to PHMSA data. Because of the increase in its inspection workload over its preliminary estimate, PHMSA does not have assurance that it has enough resources to meet its inspection goal. Furthermore, PHMSA has not used a workforce analysis to inform its budget requests. PHMSA officials said that the agency does not expect to have enough data until 2022 or 2023 to further inform analysis of its workforce. By analyzing factors affecting states' willingness to partner with PHMSA and its workforce needs on an ongoing basis, the agency would have better assurance that it has the staff it needs to meet its inspection goal.", "Health effects have been reported related to chemicals that may be found in stored natural gas. Several federal agencies\u2014including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\u2014have documented potential health effects of chemicals that may be found in stored natural gas. In addition, some chemicals may be added to natural gas, such as sulfur odorants that give natural gas a distinct smell in case of leaks. The combination of such chemicals varies from one natural gas storage site to another, based on the attributes of that site such as its geologic type and the extent to which sulfur odorants are added to the natural gas before storage. Many of these chemicals have been linked to adverse health effects. However, research is limited on the health effects of exposure to stored natural gas in general and on the effects in particular from exposure to chemicals that may occur in natural gas storage leaks or be present at the storage sites.

As of July 2019, approximately 400 sites across the  country store natural gas in underground geological formations and use  wells at these sites to inject and withdraw natural gas, according to EIA.  These sites typically are near or have convenient pipeline access to major  metropolitan areas. This proximity helps to ensure that natural gas is  available for times of peak energy use\u2014such as in winter to heat  homes\u2014more quickly than would be possible if relying solely on pipelines  that transport natural gas from distant production fields. However, these  sites can pose risks.", "In 2015, a natural gas leak from a well at the Aliso Canyon site near  suburban Los Angeles, California\u2014the fourth-largest storage site in the  United States\u2014raised concerns about the safety of the underground wells  used at storage sites and about potential adverse health and  environmental effects from natural gas releases. The leak released about  5.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere, continued for  almost 4 months, and eventually led to the temporary relocation of about  8,000 families in the nearby Porter Ranch neighborhood. California  government officials identified two factors that contributed to the leak: (1)  the aging infrastructure of the well, which was drilled in 1953 as an oil  production well, and (2) the lack of redundant safety valves at the well.", "After this emergency, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and  Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016 was enacted. The act, among  other things, required the Secretary of Transportation to establish  minimum safety standards for all underground natural gas storage sites  by June 22, 2018. The Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Pipeline  and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible  for setting and enforcing these standards for underground natural gas  storage sites. In 2017, PHMSA established an oversight and enforcement  program for natural gas storage sites. PHMSA's mission is to protect  people and the environment by advancing the safe transport of natural  gas, among other types of energy, and hazardous materials that are  essential to our daily lives.", "In 2018, PHMSA collected data that showed approximately 10,000 of the  17,000 (about 59 percent) underground natural gas storage wells across  the country have design characteristics similar to the well at Aliso  Canyon.

However, we found that PHMSA had not yet followed  certain leading strategic planning practices for the program. For example,  PHMSA had not yet defined the level of performance to be achieved,  developed goals to address core program activities other than training, or  used baseline data to develop goals. We recommended that PHMSA (1)  define levels of performance and address all core program activities and  (2) use budget data to refine its performance goals for its gas storage  program. PHMSA officials concurred with these recommendations and  implemented the first recommendation.

We selected four of the five states with the largest amount of  working natural gas storage (Michigan, Texas, Louisiana, and California),  one state in which PHMSA was conducting an inspection (Iowa), and two  additional states that had considered partnering with PHMSA (Alaska and  Colorado). We visited sites representing each of the three types of  natural gas storage sites\u2014Moss Bluff in Texas (a salt cavern), Aliso  Canyon in California (a depleted oil and gas field), and Redfield in Iowa (a  depleted aquifer). We reviewed documentation from each site and  interviewed officials representing these sites\u2019 operators. We selected  these sites for specific reasons: Aliso Canyon because of the 2015 leak,  Redfield because it was scheduled to undergo an inspection by PHMSA  at the time of our visit, and Moss Bluff because it was readily accessible  from a major urban area (Houston, Texas). Our findings from the sites we  visited and officials we interviewed are not generalizable to sites and  officials we did not include in our review but provide illustrative examples  of such sites.

We visited the Redfield gas storage facility in Iowa during a  PHMSA storage safety inspection, and we met with officials from the Iowa  Department of Natural Resources to discuss natural gas storage safety.  We compared PHMSA efforts on its natural gas storage program\u2019s  workforce planning against our prior work on best practices in workforce  planning. We compared PHMSA\u2019s efforts on strategic planning against  leading strategic planning practices we identified in our prior work. For  example, we have previously reported that requirements of the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, as amended  (GPRA), such as performance goals, that apply at the departmental or  agency level can serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels,  such as component agencies, offices, programs, and projects within  federal agencies.", "To describe what is known about the potential health effects from  chemicals in stored natural gas, we used literature search results that  identified releases from 2000 through 2018 to determine whether there  were any studies that empirically linked the releases of natural gas in  storage sites with health effects; we did not find any such studies. As a  result, we reviewed chemicals known to be found in stored natural gas,  some at trace levels. As previously mentioned, we reviewed documents  from and met with officials from EPA, ATSDR, OSHA, and NIOSH. We  also identified chemicals that may be found in stored natural gas by  reviewing the Safety Data Sheets from 12 operators with the largest  storage capacity. In addition, we reviewed documentation from  California agencies on reported health symptoms and chemicals that  were tested for during the Aliso Canyon incident. We also reviewed  agency documents and spoke with agency officials about the natural gas  storage program.

Two  physical characteristics govern the suitability of each type of geologic  formation for storage, including: (1) its capacity to hold natural gas for  future use and (2) the rate at which natural gas can be withdrawn to meet  demand. As of July 2019, about 80 percent of the approximately 400  natural gas storage sites in the United States are depleted natural gas or  oil reservoirs because they are available in greater numbers than other  types of formations, according to EIA. Underground salt caverns and  depleted aquifers each account for about 10 percent of the sites.", "Natural gas storage sites are located in 31 states. California, Louisiana,  Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas together contain natural gas storage  sites that provide more than half of the natural gas storage capacity in the  United States.

According to  information from PHMSA, about 17,000 wells are used to inject and  withdraw gas at approximately 400 natural gas storage sites, ranging  from a few wells per site to more than a hundred wells at some larger  sites. Wells are constructed with multiple layers of steel pipe, called  casing, which are cemented in place. The layers of steel casing are  intended to isolate the internal portion of the well from the outlying  geological formations, which may include underground drinking water  supplies. As a well is drilled deeper, progressively narrower casing is  inserted further down the well and cemented in place. The wells at natural  gas storage sites can be constructed to prevent leaks by installing  multiple control points at each well, according to API. If a well is not  constructed with such multiple points of control, it could be subject to a  single point of failure, in which the failure of a single component, such as  a casing or a safety valve, can lead to a large release of natural gas\u2014a  factor that contributed to the Aliso Canyon incident, according to PHMSA  officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aliso Canyon Underground Storage Facility Leak", "paragraphs": ["From October 23, 2015, through February 11, 2016, the Aliso Canyon  Underground Storage Facility in Los Angeles County, California,  experienced a large and uncontrolled natural gas leak. The Aliso Canyon  natural gas storage site is a depleted oil field that was converted into a  natural gas storage reservoir in the 1970s and that is near the Porter  Ranch community, a residential community of about 30,000 people. It  provides natural gas to the Los Angeles region for residential heating and  cooling, commercial and industrial uses, and as fuel for electric power  plants. According to the Energy Information Administration, the Aliso  Canyon site has the fourth largest capacity among the approximately 400  underground natural gas storage sites in the United States. The leak  reportedly was caused by damage to a well casing approximately 500  feet underground. California state government officials identified the  damage as being caused by the aging infrastructure of that well, which  had been drilled in 1953, and a lack of redundant safety valves at the well  that prevented the leak from being stopped.", "Across a 4-month period, the site operator made multiple attempts to stop  the leak. About 8,000 families near the Aliso Canyon leak were  temporarily relocated in November 2015 due to ongoing odors and  symptoms including headaches or migraines; nausea, vomiting, stomach  aches, or diarrhea; nosebleeds; respiratory or breathing problems; chest  tightness, coughing, or palpitations; and light-headedness and dizziness.  Various agencies, including public health and regulatory agencies from  state and local governments such as the Los Angeles County Public  Health Department and California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health  Hazard Assessment, responded to the leak.", "Additionally, several studies about the leak have been conducted or are  planned. CCST, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization established in  response to a California state legislative resolution, published an  independent review of the viability of underground natural gas in  California, including an analysis of the health effects from stored natural  gas releases. An interagency task force established pursuant to federal  law, led by DOE and PHMSA, studied the Aliso Canyon incident and in  2016 provided a report to relevant congressional committees with  recommendations to enhance safety. According to the 2016 interagency  task force report, natural gas stored in geologic formations is under high  pressure, which can force the gas through underground fissures or  unplugged oil and gas wells and allow the gas to find its way to the  surface. Leaks can also occur if the wells lose integrity because of  cracking of the cement used to seal them, among other factors. Older  wells used for natural gas storage were often drilled for other reasons,  such as oil and gas production, and are more likely to have age-related  degradation. As part of its work, the interagency task force chartered a  Public Health and Environment Subgroup, led by EPA, to summarize the  actions taken by local, state, and federal agencies to monitor and mitigate  impacts to public health and the environment.

It  requires, among other things, that DOT establish minimum safety  standards for all natural gas storage sites. Within DOT, PHMSA's mission  is to protect people and the environment by advancing the safe  transportation of energy and other hazardous materials, and because  natural gas storage is a part of this mission, PHMSA is responsible for  natural gas storage safety. In response to the act\u2019s requirement, PHMSA  issued an interim final rule in December 2016 that took effect in January  2017. The rule included minimum safety standards based largely on  recommended practices from API and generally required compliance by  natural gas storage sites by January 2018. PHMSA provided for a public  comment period, and after reviewing the public comments received on  the interim final rule, PHMSA may modify aspects of the interim final rule  by issuing a final rule.

During the inspection, PHMSA's inspectors  also conducted a review of the storage site  operator's safety procedures, such as the  operator\u2019s schedule for inspecting its wells for  potential leaks or pressure changes, its  emergency contact protocols, and its  procedures for ensuring the integrity of wells.  As part of the review, PHMSA inspectors  reviewed the site operator\u2019s documentation to  evaluate the operator\u2019s efforts to implement  the agency\u2019s 2016 minimum safety standards  for natural gas storage sites.", "To meet its performance goal, PHMSA set targets for each of the 5 years  (see app. II for details about PHMSA's annual targets for this performance  goal). For example, PHMSA set a target that its inspectors and state  partners would inspect a total of 41 sites in 2018.

In  future years, according to PHMSA planning documents, PHMSA\u2019s annual  site inspection targets will almost double from 41 total site inspections in  2018 to 80 total site inspections in 2019.", "However, PHMSA's inspection workload for its natural gas storage  program has increased since November 2017, which may affect its ability  to meet its inspection performance goal. We reported in November 2017  that PHMSA had developed a preliminary estimate of the workforce it  would need to inspect half of the approximately 400 natural gas storage  sites. That estimate was based on the agency\u2019s experience from its  pipeline safety program. Specifically, in 2017, agency officials said that  they expected 25 state governments would partner with PHMSA to  inspect about 200 of the sites and that six agency employees would  inspect the remaining approximately 200 sites. Specifically, in 2017  PHMSA estimated the inspections would require about 203 work weeks  of inspectors\u2019 time. However, in October 2018, PHMSA officials told us  that their inspectors would need more time than previously estimated to  complete each natural gas storage site inspection, due to requirements  for operators in the 2016 minimum safety standards.", "Furthermore, in its 2017 estimate, PHMSA assumed that all 25 state  governments eligible to partner with PHMSA on inspections would agree  to do so. However, as of June 2019, only 10 of the 25 eligible states had  agreed to partner with PHMSA, according to agency officials. PHMSA  officials told us that more states may decide to participate in the future.  However, there are a variety of reasons why states may be reluctant to  partner with PHMSA. For example, officials from two states told us that  PHMSA had not offered enough funding to cover the cost of partnering  with the agency. Officials from two states told us that partnering with  PHMSA required some lead time to obtain funds through their states'  legislative processes for such inspections. In addition, PHMSA officials  told us that some states are waiting until the interim final rule is issued as  a final rule before determining whether to partner. As a result, according  to PHMSA data, unless additional states partner with the agency, PHMSA  will need to increase the number of sites it inspects from about 200 to 322  in order for the agency to meet its performance goal of inspecting all of  the approximately 400 sites by 2023. This would increase PHMSA\u2019s  inspection workload by about 60 percent, as shown in figure 2.", "Because of the increase in its inspection workload over its preliminary  estimate, PHMSA does not have assurance that it has enough resources  to meet its inspection goal. Specifically, PHMSA has requested and  received the same budget authority for its natural gas storage safety  activities\u2014$8 million\u2014for each fiscal year from 2017 through 2019. Of  the $8 million, PHMSA requested $2 million for federal employees to  inspect about 200 of about 400 natural gas storage sites. PHMSA  requested the remaining $6 million for grants to authorized states to  conduct inspections of the remaining sites. However, of the 25 states  PHMSA expected to request such authority, only 10 did so and are  partnering with PHMSA to conduct inspections, according to PHMSA  officials. This means that the number of sites that states could inspect is  about 90 rather than about 200, as PHMSA had initially estimated. In  comparison, PHMSA's workload for its natural gas storage inspection  program is more than three times higher than the workload for PHMSA\u2019s  pipeline inspection program.", "We also recommended in November 2017 that PHMSA use other data  and information about budgetary resources to inform and revise its  performance goals. PHMSA concurred with our recommendation.  However, officials told us that as of July 2019, the agency had not yet  fully addressed this recommendation to use workforce data to inform and  revise its goals. In December 2018, PHMSA issued a strategic workforce  plan that indicates it represents a thorough analysis of the agency\u2019s  current workforce composition as of 2018 and the collective viewpoints of  employees and senior leadership regarding the future. PHMSA stated in  this plan that workforce planning will allow the agency to respond to  emerging challenges and responsibilities and improve overall mission  effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, the plan states that PHMSA  leadership recognizes that while the agency has implemented some  foundational elements of workforce management and the overall  workforce is staffed with skilled professionals, the agency\u2019s workforce  planning has tended to be more reactive than proactive. The plan cites as  evidence underdeveloped succession plans, inconsistent hiring results,  increased turnover, and limited workforce analysis and forecasting. To  address these gaps, the plan identifies the following three high-level  strategies to supplement and expand agency capabilities: expand and enhance PHMSA\u2019s recruitment and hiring plans,  conduct operational workforce planning and workload analysis by  program office, and  implement succession planning and develop leadership and staff.", "PHMSA officials said that the agency has been assessing its workforce,  but they told us this assessment will not guide the agency\u2019s budget  requests for its natural gas storage program. PHMSA officials told us  they did not plan to change the workforce levels reflected in the agency\u2019s  budget requests until 2022 or 2023. This is because although PHMSA  has been collecting and assessing workforce data since March 2018, the  agency does not expect to have the workforce data it needs to further  inform workforce analysis until 2022 or 2023, according to PHMSA  officials. The officials indicated that the additional data they have begun  gathering may include variables such as the number of additional states  that may partner with PHMSA in the future; resources used, by region;  and the capacity of inspection teams of different sizes. In technical  comments PHMSA provided on a draft of this report, PHMSA officials  stated that the agency recently concluded a workforce assessment of its  pipeline inspection program\u2014including its natural gas storage program\u2014 covering the 5 years from 2020 through 2024. PHMSA\u2019s workforce  assessment indicated that the state of Texas is likely to partner with  PHMSA beginning in 2020, which would reduce the number of natural  gas storage sites PHMSA would need to inspect. Based on our  preliminary review of the information PHMSA officials provided, however,  PHMSA\u2019s assessment does not address the reasons its inspectors\u2019  workload increased by about 60 percent, such as the factors affecting  states\u2019 participation in inspections. Moreover, PHMSA officials did not  indicate whether PHMSA would use this workforce information to guide its  workforce planning or budget requests.", "We have reported that strategic workforce planning is an essential tool to  help agencies align their workforces with their current and emerging  missions and develop long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and  retaining staff. Furthermore, we have reported that existing strategic  workforce planning tools and models and our own work suggest that there  are certain principles that such a process should address. These  principles include developing strategies tailored to address gaps in  number, deployment, and alignment of human capital to enable and  sustain the contributions of all critical skills and competencies. We also  have reported that workforce planning should include (1) identification of  the knowledge, skills, and abilities and other characteristics (i.e.,  competencies) needed by the future workforce; the competencies of the  current workforce; and gaps between the two; (2) development of a  workforce action plan designed to address these gaps; and (3) monitoring  and evaluation of the workforce planning actions taken. Furthermore,  we have found in our prior work that completing and regularly updating  staffing models in a timely manner can help support agencies\u2019 activities  and decision-making. By analyzing the factors affecting states\u2019  participation in inspections and analyzing the agency\u2019s workforce needs  on an ongoing basis and using this information to guide its budget  requests, PHMSA would have more reasonable assurance that it has the  necessary staff to meet its inspection goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since 2017, PHMSA Has Established a Performance Goal, but the Goal Does Not Reflect the Agency\u2019s Contributions to Its Strategic Goal of Promoting Continuous Safety Performance", "paragraphs": ["PHMSA has established a strategic goal for its natural gas storage  program to promote continuous safety performance but as of April 2019  had not established performance goals that reflect the agency\u2019s  contributions to protecting human health and the environment.

As of November 2018, the database included  information on 510 chemicals. To conduct an assessment of a chemical,  the agency follows a multi-step process that includes identifying credible  health hazards associated with exposures to a chemical and  characterizing the quantitative relationship between chemical exposure  and each credible health hazard. The program derives toxicity values  through this quantitative relationship. EPA has completed assessments  on several chemicals that may be in stored natural gas, including  hydrogen sulfide, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene.

As a result, leaks such as the Aliso Canyon incident contribute to climate  change, according to EPA. For example, the Aliso Canyon leak resulted  in the single largest release of methane in U.S. history, with a release of  78,000 metric tons of methane in 2015 and an additional 22,000 metric  tons in the first 2 months of 2016.

However, PHMSA cannot collect  user fees from operators unless expenditure of the fees is provided in  advance in an appropriations act. Annually, prior to the start of the fiscal  year, PHMSA submits a budget request to Congress that identifies the  amount of budget authority it needs for the underground natural gas  storage program. The annual appropriations act then provides for  expenditure of a certain amount of fees and PHMSA is authorized to  collect that amount in fees. PHMSA then obligates the fees it receives  either (1) for federal activities, such as inspections by PHMSA  employees, or (2) for grants to state governments, which carry out  inspections at some natural gas storage sites.
