Service officials told GAO that they collect and use various types of information within the categories to assess specific activities. While both the categories established by DOD and the service-specific efforts provide useful context about the status of individual MWR activities, they do not replace the need for measurable goals that can be used to assess whether the programs are operating cost-effectively. The services are in the early stages of developing more specific performance measures, but it is too early to determine whether these efforts will result in measurable goals that can be used to assess cost-effectiveness.

While Army officials are learning how to evaluate programs  through this partnership with the Army Public Health Center, they said  that they have also learned that these endeavors are costly. Officials  said that a very modest program evaluation requires approximately  $300,000 to $500,000. Army officials also stated that program  evaluation requires support and participation by those organizations  and people that deliver the programs. Furthermore, according to Army  officials, resource reductions at the operational level (garrisons) are  increasingly restrictive, preventing them from collecting critical  information to support this multiphase effort.", "Navy. Navy officials said that they use the MWR Enterprise Modeling  System, which is based on performance measures that have been  developed and routinely reviewed and updated by headquarters,  regional, and installation program managers. The MWR Enterprise  Modeling System is used as the baseline for the annual MWR  performance data call that measures actual program performance  against performance standards. Navy officials said that the  performance measures provide the business strategy and guidance to  ensure efficient, effective and market-driven delivery of programs and  services.", "Marine Corps. Marine Corps officials said they collaborated with the  RAND Corporation to provide an analytically rigorous assessment  framework to evaluate program performance. The RAND Corporation  provided draft measures of performance. Marine Corps officials said  that the RAND Corporation also provided a user guide that outlines an  evaluation methodology and ensures consistent and standard  application. Marine Corps officials said that they are reviewing the  draft measures to determine appropriate data collection and have  drafted an implementation plan. Specifically, Marine Corps officials  said that they plan to brief Marine Corps installations in June 2018 on  the performance measures they plan to collect data from, which will  begin in fall 2018.", "Air Force. Air Force officials said that they are building off the work  that the RAND Corporation undertook for the Marine Corps and have  also started collaborating with the RAND Corporation. The objective of  the Air Force study is to develop an evidence-based evaluation  framework for MWR programs that identifies immediate and mid-term  outcomes that contribute to airman and family readiness and  resilience. Specifically, the goal is to provide the Air Force with logic  models and performance measures that are tied to each of the  programs and services in the MWR portfolio. Air Force officials said  they expect to finish this study by June 2018. However, the officials  noted that implementing the performance measures will be a  challenge since these types of MWR programs are difficult to measure  and hard to capture data for.", "While both the broad and specific measures established by DOD and the  services can provide useful context about the status of individual MWR  activities, they do not contain measurable goals that service officials could  use to compare program results with costs to determine whether an  individual activity is cost-effectively operating. Because the services\u2019  efforts to develop specific performance measures are in early stages of  development it is too early to determine whether these efforts will result in  measurable goals that can be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of  the MWR programs.", "DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation specifies that performance  measurement should include program accomplishments in terms of  outputs and how those outputs effectively meet intended agency mission  goals. Further, cost itself can be a performance metric, but should also be  combined with an effectiveness measure, such as the percentage of a  goal achieved at a level of expected performance, to ensure that the  resulting output is cost effective. Additionally, through our prior work on  performance measurement, we have reported that performance goals  and measures should align with an agency\u2019s goals and mission. However,  in reviewing DOD Instruction 1015.10, we found no mention of any goals,  mission, objectives, or purpose for the MWR programs. There is one  section entitled \u201cpolicy\u201d in the instruction that included items that resemble  goals. Specifically, the instruction stated that MWR programs:  1.  are an integral part of the military and benefits package;  2.  build healthy families and communities and provide consistently high- quality support services that are commonly furnished by other  employers or by state and local governments to their employees and  citizens;  3.  encourage positive individual values and aid in recruitment and  retention of personnel; and  4.  promote esprit de corps and provide for the physical, cultural, and  social needs; general well-being; quality of life; and hometown  community support of servicemembers and their families.", "USD(P&R) officials who have responsibility for developing MWR program  goals acknowledged that these policy items function as strategic goals  but were not clearly identified as such in the instruction and also  acknowledged that the instruction does not include measurable goals for  assessing cost-effectiveness. In addition, USD(P&R) officials said that  they are starting a review of DOD Instruction 1015.10 and did not know  yet whether they would make any changes to the goals or expand the  reporting requirement to include all 55 activities. Until DOD develops  performance measures that include measurable goals, DOD officials and  other decision makers, such as Members of Congress, may find it difficult  to determine whether the MWR programs and the activities that make up  the MWR programs are meeting servicemember needs in a cost-effective  manner."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s multibillion dollar MWR programs provide a wide range of benefits  for servicemembers and their families that ultimately help support military  missions and readiness, both in times of war and peace. DOD has  established funding targets for providing appropriated funding support for  Category A and B MWR programs. However, the funding targets have not  been comprehensively evaluated in the last 20 years to determine their  current relevance. Until DOD comprehensively evaluates the  appropriateness of current funding targets and documents any changes  made to the targets, DOD\u2019s funding targets may not reflect the current  operating environment, and may be posing an undue burden on the  servicemembers. DOD has also not developed performance measures  with measureable goals that would allow it to assess the cost- effectiveness of its MWR programs. Without performance measures that  include such measurable goals, it will be difficult for DOD and Congress  to determine whether the individual activities and overall MWR programs  are meeting desired outcomes in a cost-effective manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to DOD.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the USD(P&R),  in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments,  comprehensively evaluate the funding targets for Category A and B MWR  programs and document any changes made to the targets and the  methodology used.
