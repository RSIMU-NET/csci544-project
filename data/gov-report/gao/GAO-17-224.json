Of the additional authorized funding that the agency utilized, USAID obligated 75 percent in fiscal year 2014 and 96 percent in fiscal year 2015 for these modalities. In addition, to better meet beneficiaries' needs, USAID has increasingly used funds from accounts authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act, along with 202(e) funding, to implement and support projects\u2014costs that 202(e) funding has typically covered. Also, in some cases, USAID has used funds from those accounts along with 202(e) funding to provide cash transfers, food vouchers, or local or regional procurement in a single project.", "USAID and its partners have various controls for financial oversight of Title II funding used for implementation and support costs; however, GAO found certain deficiencies in USAID's oversight. USAID reviews partners' detailed planned budgets for these costs and high-level quarterly financial reports, according to USAID officials, but it generally has not conducted systematic, targeted financial reviews of partners' actual spending on these costs. While GAO found that partners' internal controls generally included policies and procedures to help ensure proper use of funds, GAO's limited, nongeneralizable financial transactions testing identified instances of misspending, such as charging a 202(e) cost to one project that should have been charged to another. Also, USAID has not obtained key monitoring data from partners related to these costs that could identify areas needing additional financial oversight. Moreover, USAID does not require partners to conduct comprehensive assessments of financial and fraud risks for cash transfers and food vouchers in development projects, although it requires risk assessments for emergency projects. GAO found that partners for selected development projects provided broad discussions of risk to USAID but did not provide comprehensive risk assessments. As a result, USAID is limited in its ability to ensure that partners are spending funds as planned."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to USAID\u2014for example, to conduct financial reviews, collect monitoring data, and assess risks.

Our  review of USAID funding data shows that USAID used Title II U.S. in-kind  food aid along with ESFP-funded cash transfers, food vouchers, or locally  or regionally procured food in some emergency food assistance projects.  For example, in fiscal year 2012, USAID obligated about $134 million in  EFSP funds to 10 emergency food assistance projects for which it also  obligated Title II funding for U.S. in-kind food aid. However, with its  expanded Title II authorities, USAID obligated a total of about $56 million  in 202(e) funding along with $140 million in EFSP funds to provide cash  transfers, food vouchers, or locally or regionally procured food in nine  WFP-implemented projects in fiscal years 2014 and 2015.

To monitor actual spending, USAID officials,  including agreement officers\u2019 representatives, told us that they rely  primarily on each partner\u2019s quarterly financial report, known as the  SF-425. Implementing partners are required to report high-level  expenditures for 202(e) and ITSH quarterly in the SF-425, according  to USAID officials. The officials noted that they follow up with a  partner if spending reported in the SF-425 is inconsistent with the  annual approved amount.", "Reviews of audit reports. According to USAID officials, USAID\u2019s  Office of Food for Peace generally reviews the results of partners\u2019  annual single audits as well as findings of the USAID Office of  Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) periodic audits. Single audits include an  organization-wide review of an entity\u2019s financial statements, a  schedule of the expenditure of federal awards, and review of related  internal controls. Single audit findings can be used by agencies to  identify areas warranting additional financial oversight. For example,  USAID officials informed us that the agency modified the terms of one  partner\u2019s letter of credit as a result of single audit findings, which  included material weaknesses. Specifically, USAID stipulated that  the partner must request payment for incurred expenses in lieu of  advance payments. According to USAID officials, the Office of Food  for Peace also reviews periodic audit reports completed by the OIG  that may address financial internal controls related to 202(e) and ITSH  spending.

However, we found that the partners reported  inconsistent data to USAID. For example, annual reports for the  selected project that included 202(e)-funded food vouchers provided  information on the frequency and number of months of food voucher  distributions, but quarterly reports for the project did not consistently  include this information.

For our other selected project that included cash  transfers, the most recent annual report provided only annual data on  the number of months that cash transfers were provided and the  actual number of cash transfer beneficiaries. In October 2016,  USAID updated reporting guidance, specifying requirements for Title II  development projects to provide annual data on cash transfers, food  vouchers, and local and regional procurement.

With the increased authority granted in the 2014  Farm Bill, USAID began allowing its partners to provide locally and  regionally procured food commodities through Title II projects, many of  which also provided U.S. in-kind food aid. For example, in fiscal years  2014 and 2015, one Title II development project and 22 Title II  emergency projects used Title II funding for local and regional  procurement as well as U.S. in-kind food aid. In the same years, 21 WFP  projects used Title II funding for U.S in-kind food aid as well as ESFP  funding for local and regional procurement (9 of the 21 received both Title  II and EFSP funding for local and regional procurement).

In  accordance with USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System (ADS), USAID  has designated WFP as a category 1 public international organization  (PIO) on the basis of its review of WFP and United Nations (UN)  documents and reports, including strategy, policy, and audit documents  related to WFP\u2019s internal controls procedures, financial resources and risk  management. USAID officials indicated that, in accordance with the  ADS, USAID may make awards to a category 1 PIO without conducting  pre-award audits or regularly reviewing audit and financial information. As  a result, USAID officials noted that the agency generally relies on WFP to  conduct financial oversight of implementation costs in Title II emergency  projects awarded to WFP.", "WFP\u2019s Office of Evaluation is responsible for evaluations to provide  information on the quality and effectiveness of WFP\u2019s policies, strategies,  operations, and efficiency of their implementation. WFP\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for providing assurance on  governance, policy, risk, resources, operations and accountability, and  internal controls, including through internal audit and investigation, to  ensure the effective and efficient use of the resources of WFP and the  safeguarding of its assets. WFP also has an external auditor that is  appointed by, and reports to, WFP\u2019s Executive Board and is responsible  for auditing WFP\u2019s accounts and for carrying out performance audits of  WFP\u2019s operations. According to the annual reports of WFP\u2019s OIG for  2014 and 2015, the oversight work of the OIG did not disclose any  significant weaknesses. Moreover, in 2015, WFP\u2019s Finance Committee  reported that the external auditor\u2019s review of WFP\u2019s financial statements  for 2014 revealed no material weaknesses or errors. We found that WFP  conducted 42 internal audits in 2014 and 2015 as well as several external  audits, with a range of findings and recommendations. For example,  audits identified instances in which a country office did not verify services  performed by third parties before paying for services and also identified  inconsistent or suboptimal rates of completion of risk assessments by  country offices, particularly for cash transfers and food vouchers. The  majority of internal audits reached satisfactory or partially satisfactory conclusions, and WFP generally reported implementing, or taking some  steps to implement, the audits\u2019 recommendations.", "We reviewed WFP\u2019s policies and procedures for financial internal controls  and found that they generally reflect Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) principles. We also  reviewed support documentation\u2014such as purchase orders, payment  requests, and reconciliation documents\u2014for one or two transactions  preselected by WFP involving 202(e) cash transfers, food vouchers, local  and regional procurement, or internal transportation, storage, and  handling (ITSH) funding for each of the three emergency projects we  reviewed. For example, in Zimbabwe, WFP officials walked us through  support documentation and discussed the approval process for a 202(e)  cash transfer transaction for our selected WFP project in Zimbabwe.  Support documentation included WFP\u2019s agreement with the mobile  service provider for the cash transfers to beneficiaries; the purchase  requisition (including a breakout of actual cash distributed to beneficiaries  and associated costs, such as fees paid to the mobile provider); the  purchase order; the distribution plan by district and month; distribution  lists (including names and account numbers for beneficiaries); and the  actual payment request and corporate payment report, as well as  reconciliation documentation. We determined that for the purposes of our  review, documentation that WFP provided for these preselected  transactions showed that expenses were accurate and allowable and had  adequate levels of review and approval.", "Further, in reviewing three WFP projects for our current report, we found  that WFP country offices had compiled required risk assessments and  mitigation plans relevant to the three projects. Specifically, the three WFP  country offices developed higher-level risk assessments that addressed  risks to strategic or operational objectives of WFP country operations,  such as risks related to political instability, poor road infrastructure, or  erratic weather. In addition, one of the country offices, in South Sudan,  also developed a more in-depth assessment that addressed 66  programmatic risks, including risks related to internal controls; financial  risks; and potential fraud, waste, or abuse. According to WFP, it requires  country offices to develop only the higher-level assessments, and country  offices may choose to also develop more in-depth assessments. In  addition, we reviewed WFP sectoral capacity assessments related to  cash transfers, food vouchers, and local and regional procurement for the  selected projects. These assessments evaluate the capacities and  associated risks of cooperating partners, financial institutions, and  markets as well as retailers for cash transfers, food vouchers, and local  and regional procurement. WFP noted that it consults with local  governments in developing these assessments. WFP also noted that it  uses the assessments to inform the choice of program delivery modality,  particularly examining logistics, financial, and information and  communications technology in determining the appropriateness and  feasibility of using cash transfers, food vouchers, and local and regional  procurement and mobile technology in its projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Val\u00e9rie L.
