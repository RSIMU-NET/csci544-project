Congressional interest was renewed in 1996 by the still unexplained crash of TWA Flight 800, which resulted in additional efforts by the federal government to increase aviation security. These efforts included the establishment of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security in August 1996. The Commission\u2019s report, issued in February 1997,  made a number of recommendations to improve aviation security. In addition, two laws were enacted\u2014the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 and the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 \u2014which, among other things, authorized and provided funding for the security recommendations contained in the Commission\u2019s report.", "The Reauthorization Act required the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to take specific actions to improve aviation security. Section 301 mandated that FAA conduct a study and report to the Congress by January 9, 1997, on whether and, if so, how to (1) transfer certain federally required security responsibilities of air carriers to either airports or the federal government or (2) provide for shared responsibilities between air carriers and airport operators or the federal government. The Congress required that the report identify potential sources of federal and nonfederal revenue that may be used to fund security activities and propose legislation, if necessary, for accomplishing the transfer of responsibilities. Section 302 of the act mandated that the FAA Administrator certify companies providing security screening at airports and improve the training and testing of security screeners through the development of performance standards. This report provides information on (1) the status of FAA\u2019s efforts to implement the requirements of section 301 of the act and (2) the status of FAA\u2019s efforts to implement section 302 and issues that could impede FAA\u2019s implementation of section 302."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FAA, the air carriers, and the airport operators share the responsibilities for aviation security. FAA is responsible for assessing threats, such as terrorism, to the aviation system and determining the procedures and equipment that will most effectively deter these threats. FAA\u2019s regulations prescribe the security responsibilities of air carriers and airport operators. The air carriers and airport operators are responsible for complying with the regulations and procedures. The air carriers are responsible for screening all passengers and baggage, hiring and training their employees or contracting for screening services, and procuring equipment to screen passengers and baggage. The screening of passengers and baggage is a critical element in FAA\u2019s strategy against terrorism. FAA\u2019s regulations provide basic standards for the screeners, equipment, and procedures to be used in screening operations. The airport operators are responsible for providing secure airport facilities and providing local law enforcement support relating to air carrier and airport security measures.", "The funding of the security operations is divided among FAA, the air carriers, and the airport operators. FAA is responsible for paying the salaries and costs associated with its oversight of air carrier and airport security programs, including security inspections of screening operations at airports, and for aviation security research and development activities. FAA\u2019s aviation security budget for fiscal year 1999 includes $100 million for purchasing and deploying advanced explosives detection equipment to selected airports, $52 million for research and development, and $123 million for operations. Air carriers are responsible for paying for the security personnel and checkpoint screeners, screening equipment, such as X-ray machines and metal detectors, and the operation and maintenance costs of that equipment. Airport operators are responsible for paying for law enforcement officers, access control systems, and perimeter fences and lighting. Currently, airport operators can fund certain security functions, such as perimeter fencing, with funds from FAA\u2019s Airport Improvement Program.", "Both the White House Commission and the Congress recognized the need to improve screeners\u2019 performance. The Commission\u2019s initial report in September 1996 made 20 specific recommendations for improving security, one of which was the development of uniform standards for the selection, training, certification, and recertification of screening companies and their employees. Following this report, the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act mandated that FAA (1) study and report on the current security responsibilities at airports and the potential sources of funding for these activities, (2) certify screening companies, and (3) improve the training and testing of security screeners through the development of performance standards for security-screening services. While FAA currently has training and testing requirements for screeners, it does not have a requirement that screening companies be certified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 301 Report Issued in January 1999", "paragraphs": ["FAA issued the report required under section 301 of the Reauthorization Act of 1996 on January 5, 1999, about 2 years after the date mandated in the act.

In a letter dated January 21, 1997, FAA informed the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that because the act directed FAA to consider the findings of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security and because of the time required to complete analytical work, FAA was unable to meet the January 9, 1997, deadline and expected to release its report in April 1997. The report was delivered to the Congress in January 1999.", "FAA officials said the report was delayed because of the complex issues involved and the need to consider the findings of numerous groups that have studied these issues. FAA\u2019s report is based, in part, on an 8-year-old internal FAA study that analyzed alternatives for shifting security responsibilities with respect to passengers, baggage, and cargo from the air carriers to airport operators. The study is appended to the report. FAA also reviewed other reports, including reports from the President\u2019s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, and Coopers & Lybrand.", "In addition, FAA conducted a literature search and reviewed testimony provided for the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security and various congressional hearings on aviation security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Consensus for Changing Security Responsibilities or Funding Sources", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s report considered the views of the various commissions and other parties that studied or commented on transferring air carriers\u2019 security responsibilities to the airport operators or to the federal government, or for sharing responsibilities among the air carriers, the airport operators, and the federal government. The report also considered the Commissions\u2019 and other parties\u2019 views on potential sources of funding for aviation security, such as the Airport Improvement Program, Passenger Facility Charges, and user fees. The report points out that the source of security funding has been a matter of continuing controversy over the last 30 years.", "FAA concluded that there appears to be a consensus in the civil aviation community to retain the current system of shared responsibilities for aviation security. Therefore, FAA would continue to be responsible for establishing and enforcing regulations, policies, and procedures and for identifying potential threats and appropriate countermeasures. Air carriers would bear the primary responsibility for applying screening and other security measures to passengers, baggage, and cargo. Airport operators would be responsible for maintaining a secure airport environment and for providing local law enforcement support.", "FAA also concluded that there is no apparent consensus for changing the overall system of funding for aviation security and that there is no definitive answer to the long-standing question of who should pay for aviation security. FAA therefore did not make any legislative proposals for transferring security responsibilities from air carriers or any recommendations for changing funding sources. FAA officials, however, stated that even though the report made no recommendations regarding funding sources for aviation security, this issue will continue to need discussion and study because of its high cost. FAA estimated in May 1997 that the total 10-year cost to the federal government, airport authorities, and the airlines for security programs at the nation\u2019s largest and busiest airports alone would be close to $3 billion. Thus, funding methods for aviation security improvements is an issue that the Congress and FAA will be faced with for a number of years.", "Officials of three principal aviation industry associations that we contacted\u2014Air Transport Association (ATA), Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) \u2014generally agreed with the current division of airport security responsibilities. These officials stated that the continuity of screening would be broken if the air carriers were not the ultimate responsible party. For example, under current procedures, if a passenger is identified as a potential threat at the airport check-in or ticket counter, the air carrier will label the passenger\u2019s bag appropriately and that air carrier will take additional security measures for examining the passenger\u2019s bag, such as sending the bag through explosives detection equipment. Under any scenario where the carrier is not responsible for all screening operations, the air carrier would have to transfer the information about the potential security threat to another entity, such as the airport operator, and then that entity would further scrutinize the passenger\u2019s bag. This would disrupt the continuity of the baggage-screening process and allow for a potential break in the chain of information.", "The associations expressed differing views with regard to funding aviation security. Two of the associations\u2014ACI-NA and AAAE\u2014believe that the federal government should provide the initial funding for any increase in the baseline security standards and then, through the use of increased Airport Improvement Program funding and an expanded local funding mechanism, namely the Passenger Facility Charge, the airport users would have a greater ability to raise funds for the increased security. However, the third association, ATA, does not support an increased Passenger Facility Charge for security improvements at airports. ATA believes that the funding for explosives-detection-screening equipment should be provided under direct federal appropriations and not from Airport Improvement Program funds and Passenger Facility Charges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lengthy Process Involved for Implementing the Section 302 Requirement for Certifying Screening Companies", "paragraphs": ["FAA is developing a regulation to comply with the mandated section 302 requirements to certify screening companies and improve the training and testing of security screeners.

One of the requirements for certification would compel screening companies and air carriers to comply with the performance standards that would be established by FAA and to implement FAA-approved training and testing programs for screeners. As the first step toward issuing a regulation, FAA, on March 11, 1997, issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting comments and suggestions on issues related to the certification of screening companies and the improvement of screening operations. FAA identified 10 issues of particular interest. They included the establishment, by regulation, of a uniform security-screening program for use by all air carriers and screening companies, methods for measuring screeners\u2019 performance, and a curriculum for training screeners. FAA also sought comments on the estimated costs of meeting any qualification or operational requirements that might be imposed. (See app. I for a list of all the issues on which FAA requested comments.)", "FAA recognizes that a critical step in the certification of screening companies is having a reliable and consistent way to measure their performance. By collectively analyzing and measuring screener\u2019s performance, FAA can hold screening companies accountable for safe, effective screening operations. FAA has focused its efforts on developing, field testing, and validating an automated screener testing-system called Threat Image Projection (TIP) which would provide the basis for establishing and monitoring performance standards for screening companies.", "TIP is an automated system that was developed to improve and maintain the effectiveness of image interpretation by screening personnel employed at screening locations in airports. When installed on existing X-ray machines at airport checkpoints, TIP tests screeners\u2019 detection capabilities by projecting threat images, including guns and explosives, into bags as they are being screened or projecting images of bags containing threat objects onto the X-ray screen as live baggage is being screened.Screeners are then responsible for positively identifying the threat image and calling for the bag to be searched. Once prompted, TIP indicates to the screener whether the threat is real and then records the screener\u2019s performance in a database that FAA can access to analyze performance trends. TIP exposes screeners to threat images on a routine basis to enable them to become more adept at recognizing threat objects.", "In order to adequately field test and validate the proposed automated screener-testing system\u2014TIP\u2014and to continue to collect and analyze data to develop performance standards for screeners, FAA withdrew the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on May 13, 1998, and changed the estimated issuance date of its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from March 1999 to the end of 1999. FAA expects to issue its final regulation within 1 year of the closing of the comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which would be by the end of 2000. In April 1998, we reported that FAA, at that time, planned to issue the final regulation in March 2000, which was about a year behind its previous estimated issuance date.", "In February 1999, FAA officials told us that during January 1999, they had analyzed the TIP data gathered to date and validated TIP as an effective and reliable means to measure screeners\u2019 performance. The completion of this effort, previously projected for September 1998, had been delayed several times. According to FAA, TIP\u2019s validation process had been slowed because of one manufacturer\u2019s slowness in bringing the equipment to an operating level. In addition, the validation of TIP had been further delayed by its software, which did not provide enough unique identification numbers for all screeners using TIP. FAA has since corrected that problem. During the next several months, FAA will continue to gather larger samples of TIP data that it can use to develop performance standards for screeners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry\u2019s Views on Section 302", "paragraphs": ["Our review of comments to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from air carriers, screening companies, airport operators, and associations representing segments of the aviation industry showed that most agreed that a national standard security-screener program for screening companies should be established. Many of the comments also stated that certification for individual screeners should also be required. Several commenters believed that certification would enhance screeners\u2019 performance and professionalism. For example, both AAAE and ACI-NA stated that FAA needs to develop a standard training curriculum to certify individual screeners. They stated that FAA-certified screeners would then be invested with a valuable and transferable skill and would be compensated accordingly. FAA, however, does not plan to require the certification of individual screeners because it does not have statutory authority to do so but, instead, will certify companies. In addition, officials from ATA, ACI-NA, and AAAE informed us that, in their opinion, all screening companies who wish to be certified to perform aviation security screening should be regulated by FAA, that FAA should develop a minimum national standard security-screening program, and that FAA should continue to perfect a consistent way to measure screening companies\u2019 performance. These actions are consistent with FAA\u2019s proposed approach for certifying screening companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues That Could Impede Issuance of Final Rule", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 allows FAA 16 months from the close of the comment period of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to publish the final regulation.

FAA believes that it is important to implement the final regulation at the earliest date possible to realize the performance improvements expected to be brought about by the proposed certification requirements, training requirements, and performance measurements and standards. However, several issues could impede FAA\u2019s efforts to complete this undertaking.", "In addition to the TIP validation and data-gathering efforts previously discussed, the human factors staff in FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Research is conducting a sophisticated and long-term evaluation using TIP to assess how such variables as screeners\u2019 experience, method of training, checkpoint operating environment, and shift lengths affect screeners\u2019 performance. TIP is still in the research and development stage; therefore, the Office of Aviation Research developed a test and evaluation plan for TIP. The effort is expected to be completed by mid-1999. This assessment could identify issues regarding screeners\u2019 performance that would have to be addressed and could potentially delay the issuance of the regulation. We have previously pointed out the importance of internal coordination between human factors research programs and all units within FAA in order to (1) understand the relationship between human performance capabilities and limitations and the means to measure them and (2) maximize the opportunity to leverage resources for research on human factors.", "In addition, FAA has identified other issues that must be addressed before the final regulation can be issued, including (1) ensuring that the costs of the rule will result in substantial screening improvements and (2) establishing a balance of responsibilities between carriers and screening companies that is clear and effective. FAA is preparing a cost and benefits analysis for inclusion in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on which interested parties will have the opportunity to comment. According to FAA, the costs for this regulation could be relatively high, and it is imperative that the regulation result in substantial measurable improvements to an individual screener\u2019s performance, to screening companies\u2019 operations, and in decreasing the aviation security system\u2019s vulnerabilities.", "The issue of balanced responsibility involves how much responsibility screening companies should assume and how air carriers should oversee the operations of screening companies.
