As a result, agencies' oversight of software license spending is limited or lacking, and they may miss out on savings. The potential savings could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, one major federal agency reported saving approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license agreements even though its oversight process was ad hoc.", "Given that agencies lack comprehensive software license inventories that are regularly tracked and maintained, GAO cannot accurately describe the most widely used software applications across the government, including the extent to which they were over and under purchased.

Licenses may be bought and are  normally required whenever externally acquired software is used, which  will typically be when the software is installed on a computer (or when  executed on a computer even if installed elsewhere such as on a server).  They may also be defined in enterprise terms, such as number of  workstations or employees, in which case a license is required for each  qualifying unit or individual regardless of actual usage.", "Many software products are commercial-off-the-shelf, meaning the  software is sold in substantial quantities in the commercial market place.

Also, according to USDA officials, for fiscal year 2014, the  agency reduced its Microsoft Desktop licensing by over 4,000 units for the  new contract renewal and 11,000 for Adobe Acrobat Standard software.  However, the remaining 21 agencies do not have information on over- or  under-purchasing for the most widely used applications. For example,  Commerce officials stated they are not aware of any over- or under- purchased software and attributed this to a decentralized approach to  managing licenses. In addition, USAID officials stated that reporting on  over- and under-purchased licenses is problematic because of the  manual efforts that are required to gather and compare data against  known purchases. GSA officials stated that GSA does not have this  information available; however, they indicated that GSA plans to form an  office tasked with this responsibility.", "Until agencies address the weaknesses identified in how they manage  their software licenses, including establishing a comprehensive inventory  that is regularly tracked and maintained, the most widely used  applications across the federal government cannot be accurately  determined. Additionally, because agencies were unable to identify the  extent to which these applications were over or under purchased, they  risk procuring software in a costly and ineffective manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government procures thousands of software licenses  agreements annually, and therefore effectively managing them is critical  to ensure that agencies maximize the value of these investments. OMB  has issued a policy associated with a broader IT management initiative  but does not have a directive that assists agencies in developing licensing  policies. This is especially important since the majority of agencies lack  comprehensive policies and have significant weaknesses in managing  their software licenses. While most agencies have established policies  that address leading practices for effectively managing software licenses,  they are not comprehensive. This has contributed to the majority of  agencies (1) not having a fully centralized approach for managing  licenses, (2) not fully establishing a comprehensive inventory for regularly  tracking and maintaining software licenses, (3) not regularly tracking and  maintaining an inventory using tools and metrics, or (4) not providing  sufficient training on software management. The result is an inability to  analyze software license data to more cost-effectively buy and maintain  software licenses, and ascertain the software applications most widely  used across the federal government. Consequently, while agencies were  able to identify millions in savings for software, there is the potential for  even greater savings and additional opportunities to reduce software  license spending and duplication than what agencies have reported. Until  OMB and the agencies focus on improving policies and processes, they  will not have the data to manage software licenses and will likely miss  opportunities to reduce costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of OMB issue a directive to the agencies  on developing comprehensive software licensing policies comprised of  the seven elements identified in this report.", "We are also making numerous recommendations to the 24 departments  and agencies in our review to improve their policies and practices for  managing software licenses. Appendix III contains these  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB and the 24 Chief Financial  Officers Act agencies in our review for comment and received responses  from all 25. OMB disagreed with our recommendation to issue a directive  and of the 24 agencies that we made specific recommendations to, 11  agreed, 5 partially agreed, 2 neither agreed nor disagreed, and 6 had no  comments. The agencies\u2019 comments and our responses are summarized  below.", "In written comments, OMB noted that there are several management  tools in place with respect to software license management, including  the three we identified in our report; however, the agency disagreed  with our statements that OMB and federal agencies need to improve  policies on managing software licenses, and that until agencies have  sufficient direction from OMB, opportunities to systematically identify  software license related cost savings across the federal government  will likely continue to be missed. In particular, OMB cited two  additional management initiatives that it asserted have significant  bearing in the area of software licensing that were not included in our  report. These two initiatives are known as \u201cMaximizing Use of  SmartBuy and Avoiding Duplication\u201d and \u201cCross Agency Priority Goal:  Cybersecurity.\u201d", "OMB stated that the SmartBuy initiative, along with the initiatives  detailed in our report, deliver a policy foundation that allows an  agency to leverage GSA and collaborate with agencies and monitor  performance. In addition, OMB stated that the Cybersecurity initiative  can be used to understand the risk and vulnerabilities of the software  an agency is using. The agency also noted that through the collective  OMB initiatives, agencies now have the tools to identify when there is  underutilization of software and are better able to recapture those  underutilized licenses and deploy them to people who need them.", "While we agree that OMB\u2019s initiatives collectively represent important  management tools for agencies, they are not enough to guide  agencies in developing comprehensive license management policies.  More specifically, the two initiatives along with the other three we  previously cited do not provide guidance to agencies on developing  software license management policies comprised of the seven  elements identified in our report. Our report shows that only 2 of the  24 major agencies have comprehensive policies in place; and only 2  have comprehensive license inventories. Until this gap in guidance is  addressed, agencies will likely continue to lack the visibility into what  needs to be managed, and be unable to take full advantage of OMB\u2019s  SmartBuy and other tools to drive license efficiency and utilization.  Therefore, we continue to believe that OMB should develop a  directive that guides the agencies to ensure that they have  appropriate policies. OMB\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XX.", "In e-mail comments, an official from Agriculture\u2019s Audit Liaison Group  stated that the department generally concurs with our findings and  recommendations and plans to move forward with our  recommendations.", "In written comments, Commerce stated the department concurred  with our findings as they apply to the status of software license  management within the department, but partially concurred with four  of our six recommendations. Specifically, the department plans to  develop an agency-wide comprehensive policy for the management of  software licenses, and ensure that software license management  training is provided to appropriate agency personnel. Since the  department did not provide any information on the reasons why it  partially concurred with the remaining recommendations, we are  maintaining our recommendations. Commerce\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix IV.", "In written comments, Defense concurred with two of the six  recommendations and partially concurred with the remaining ones.  Specifically, the department partially concurred with our  recommendations to develop a comprehensive policy; employ a  centralized license management approach; establish a  comprehensive license inventory; and regularly track and maintain the  inventory using automated tools and metrics.", "With regard to a need for a comprehensive policy and centralized  approach, the department stated that it concurs that a license  management policy is necessary to address the weaknesses we  identified; and that the majority of license spending and/or enterprise- wide licenses should be managed using an approach that is  coordinated and integrated with key personnel. However, Defense  stated it does not concur that a centralized management approach is  appropriate for the size and complexity of the department.", "We continue to believe our recommendations are valid because  consistent with leading practices, in order to take advantage of  economies of scale, a single entity should have access to department- wide software license data. Furthermore, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 requires the Defense CIO, in  consultation with Defense component CIOs, to issue a plan to conduct  a department-wide inventory of a subset of software licenses that will  maximize its return on investment; and to describe in the plan how the  department can achieve the greatest economies of scale and savings  in the procurement, use, and optimization of these licenses. In  addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014  further clarifies what the plan should entail. Adequately conducting an  inventory will necessitate that Defense centrally manage its software  license data. Having licensing management policy in place to address  the identified weaknesses, as well as employing a centralized  approach, would position the department to more effectively carry out  these mandated requirements, among other things.", "With regard to the need for a license inventory and tools to track the  inventory, Defense stated that it concurs that inventory data should be  collected for agency software licenses purchased and/or enterprise- wide licenses; and that effective license management requires regular  tracking and maintaining of inventory data using automated tools and  metrics. However, the department stated it does not concur that  maintaining an inventory comprising the majority of software  regardless of dollar value is required. Further, Defense stated it may  be resource exhaustive to incorporate automated tools to establish  inventories for the majority of licenses; and may not be practicable to  retroactively collect standard data about historical license transactions  due to the decentralized nature of purchasing and license  management today within the department.", "We agree that inventory data does not need to include all software  regardless of dollar value. As detailed in our report, leading practices  note a comprehensive inventory should represent the majority (80  percent) of the agency\u2019s software license spending and/or enterprise  licenses to allow the department visibility that reduces redundant  applications and identification of other cost saving opportunities.  Moreover, in response to the requirements in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Defense\u2019s own licensing  inventory plan is based on the software products with the highest  relative spend across the department to target the products that  present the greatest potential economies of scale and cost savings. In  other words, the department is already planning to take steps to  establish an inventory consistent with our recommendation.", "Regarding the use of automated tools to collect and maintain the  licensing inventory, we agree that the department should take the  most cost-effective and forward-looking approach. Accordingly, a  focus on implementing tools and metrics on current and future  software license purchases (rather than historical transactions) is  reasonable. Such an approach is consistent with our  recommendations; therefore, we are maintaining them. The  department\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix V.", "In written comments, Education concurred with our recommendations  and stated it plans to implement a revised software acquisition policy  in 2014, which will allow for better management, tracking, and  reporting of software licenses. The department\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix VI.", "In written comments, Energy neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendations, but stated that it has taken a number of steps to  aggregate licensing, and at this time has no plans to centralize  software licensing. In particular, the department stated it agrees that  there may be opportunities to aggregate licensing to achieve volume  discounts and integrate disparate but related data sources. Energy  further stated its IT Modernization Strategy, targeted for completion in  fiscal year 2016, seeks to reduce the number of procurement vehicles  and to leverage the department\u2019s collective buying power, among  other things. Energy also described activities under way that it  believes address our specific recommendations, as well as clarified  specific facts (on developing a comprehensive policy and having  visibility into 45 percent of the department\u2019s licenses), which we  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "While we agree that these activities are important steps, we continue  to believe that further work is needed to improve software license  management at the department. Because of Energy\u2019s decentralized  approach, it does not have visibility into the majority of the  department\u2019s software licenses. Additionally, while the department  stated analysis is done on agency-wide software usage and training is  managed on an office-by-office basis, Energy could not provide  evidence to substantiate these claims. Until the department takes a  more centralized approach, as well as addresses the other identified  weaknesses, such as regular analysis of licensing inventory data to  inform decisions and relevant management training, the department  will likely not be adequately positioned to take advantage of the  procurement vehicles and collective buying power currently being  planned as part of its modernization strategy.

The agency stated that to fully implement a centralized  software license management approach will require several phases,  working with NASA stakeholders to ensure both mission and  institutional software is integrated. In particular, NASA stated it would  be difficult to employ one centralized software license management  tool because, while it has a mechanism in place for a few of its large  enterprise license purchases, several of its large IT contracts have  purchasing of licenses embedded in the contract conditions.  Accordingly, the agency cannot easily obtain inventory data for  licenses not in its control (i.e., contractor-managed licenses).  Additionally, NASA noted that to fully establish and regularly track and  maintain a comprehensive inventory will require changes to some of  the large IT contracts at the agency to be able to automatically pull the  licensing information into a centralized system, with increased costs.", "While we agree that a phased approach to implementing a centralized  software license approach may be the most practicable, we are not  advocating the department collect information on licenses it does not  control.

In cases where the agency attested to its being  comprehensive, we asked agency officials how they ensure the data  within their inventories are comprehensive, reliable, valid, and accurate,  and requested supporting documentation, such as those related to  internal control processes. For those inventories that agencies reported  as not comprehensive, we determined additional data reliability steps  were not required because agencies have knowledge to determine  whether they do not have a comprehensive inventory and would not have  concerns with inventories being rated as not comprehensive if the rating  was based on their own assessment. We concluded that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes for the first two objectives.", "Finally, for our third objective, we collected and analyzed information on  the most widely used software applications, such as agencies\u2019 software  inventories and/or lists of applications according to volume and spending.
