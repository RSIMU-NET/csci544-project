However, it has not yet fully implemented measures to improve state accountability for these programs. Specifically, Labor reports that states will not be held accountable to the same standard for veterans' employment until 2007. States also report substantial progress implementing the law, but integrating veterans' staff with other one-stop staff remains challenging in some local areas. In addition, about one-third of the states did not establish incentive programs for their workforce personnel because state laws, policies, or agreements conflict with this JVA provision. Most state workforce administrators surveyed reported that the new legislation has improved both the quality of services to veterans and their employment outcomes. For example, they reported that services provided to disabled veterans have improved. They also credited the greater availability of case management and outreach to new employers for much of the improvement in employment outcomes under JVA. Aside from the law's influence, state administrators cited the willingness of employers to hire veterans and the strength of the local job market as significant factors affecting veterans' employment. About half of state directors of Veterans' Employment and Training reported their new monitoring role had strengthened local program accountability. However, just over a third reported that accountability had either lessened or not improved. Some partly attributed this to absence of local performance data and fewer annual visits to one-stop centers. GAO found, as well, that a lack of coordination among Labor's agencies responsible for certain JVA provisions has weakened accountability. Also, while Labor has developed a system to monitor program performance, it lacks a strategy for using the information it gathers to make improvements and to help states."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to present the findings of our recent report  on how the Department of Labor (Labor) and states have implemented  some key provisions of the Jobs for Veterans Act (JVA). Congress passed  JVA in 2002 not only to improve employment and training services for  unemployed veterans, but also to encourage employers to hire them. The  ability of veterans to quickly obtain quality service and employment has  always been important, but will become even more so as the number of  service members leaving active duty is likely to increase by 200,000 yearly,  according to Labor.", "The act introduced several reforms to two of Labor\u2019s primary veterans\u2019  employment assistance programs\u2014the Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach  Program (DVOP) and the Local Veterans\u2019 Employment Representative  (LVER) program\u2014administered by the Veterans\u2019 Employment and  Training Service (VETS). Under the act, DVOP staff are to focus on finding  and serving veterans who need services to become job ready, including  case management services for developing job skills. LVER staff are to  focus on developing relationships with employers to encourage them to  hire veterans. In addition, the act called for DVOP and LVER staff to be  integrated with other staff providing employment and training services  within the one-stop delivery system established in 1998 under the  Workforce Investment Act (WIA), and established an incentive program to  reward staff for outstanding service to veterans. To determine how well  these programs were working to assist veterans across states, the act also  required Labor to establish a performance accountability system as well as  a national minimum standard\u2014or threshold\u2014that states must meet for  veterans\u2019 employment.", "GAO previously testified on our preliminary observations on the status of  implementation of these key provisions of JVA. My testimony today will  present the findings of our completed work related to the JVA reforms of  the DVOP and LVER programs. Specifically, I will address (1) action taken  to improve performance and accountability since the enactment of JVA in  2002 and any associated challenges; (2) whether available data reflect that  such action has resulted in improved employment outcomes for veterans;  and (3) factors affecting program oversight and accountability.", "In summary, our work shows that Labor and most states took action to  implement JVA reforms for improving the DVOP and LVER programs  within the first two years of the new legislation. However, our work also  highlights several areas where Labor agencies should collaborate and take  additional action to enhance outcomes of these reforms, particularly in the  area of improving state oversight and accountability. To this end, our  December 2005 report recommended that Labor agencies work together to  provide states and local areas with strategies to address the long-standing  challenge they have faced in integrating veterans\u2019 staff into their service  delivery system. For those states with an incentive award system, the wide  variation in methodology for awarding incentives as well as the mixed  opinions on the program\u2019s success suggests that states could benefit from  Labor presentation of methodologies that it considers successful and we  recommended that Labor share these best practices. Finally, while states  have appreciated the flexibility JVA provides them in serving veterans,  such flexibility underscores the need for greater accountability to ensure  that programs are on the right track in serving clients. However,  accountability can be hindered and reforms implemented inconsistently  when local level information is not always available, different Labor  agencies do not coordinate their oversight efforts, and Labor does not use  monitoring results to improve program performance. We therefore  recommended that Labor strategically use monitoring results to target  guidance and technical assistance to states and local areas most in need of  improved performance. Labor generally agreed with our  recommendations.", "Our review was based on a survey of VETS directors as well as a survey of  state workforce administrators in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia. We also visited five states\u2014California, Florida, Louisiana, Ohio,  and Washington\u2014where we interviewed VETS and state workforce  officials, including local office managers and DVOP and LVER staff. In  addition, we visited the National Veterans\u2019 Training Institute in Denver,  Colorado, where we interviewed training officials and veterans\u2019 staff from  24 states who were attending training classes. Finally, we held discussions  with Labor agency officials and contacted various veterans\u2019 service  organizations and the National Association of State Workforce Agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["JVA amended Title 38 of the U.S. Code, the legislation that governs the  DVOP and LVER programs, and by doing so, introduced an array of  reforms to the way employment, training, and placement services are  provided to veterans under the DVOP and LVER programs. (See table 1.)  The act also required increased veterans\u2019 access to electronic services as  well as to different types of Labor employment and training programs by  requiring them to give veterans priority in receiving their services. In  addition, it required federal contractors to advertise job openings at the  appropriate employment service delivery system and report on their  veteran hiring practices.", "Within Labor, VETS has primary responsibility for helping the nation\u2019s  veterans find employment. Among the programs that VETS administers are  the DVOP and LVER programs, which were funded at about $162 million in  fiscal year 2005. VETS administers the agency\u2019s activities through  representatives in each of Labor\u2019s six regional offices and within each  state. The state directors are the link between VETS and each state\u2019s  employment service system that is overseen by the ETA.

Labor has also  established performance measures aligned with state workforce systems  under WIA as required by JVA. However, Labor reports that states will not  be held accountable to a common national standard for veterans\u2019  employment until 2007. (See table 2.) States also report good progress in  implementing provisions, but challenges remain in some local areas in  terms of integrating veterans\u2019 staff with other employment services staff in  local workforce centers.

VETS began issuing guidance to transition staff to  their new roles in 2002, and a training program soon followed in 2003.  Both Labor\u2019s formal written guidance and technical assistance was well- received, with almost three-quarters of the 50 state workforce officials  reporting on our survey that the quality was good or excellent in  facilitating implementation of new staff duties.", "VETS officials cited challenges, however, in meeting all training needs for  veterans\u2019 staff informing them of their new roles and responsibilities under  the act. While Labor\u2019s training institute continues to conduct and fund  training, it estimated that the current funding would cover training for only  about 16 percent of all veterans\u2019 staff each year, while annual staff  turnover was averaging about 18 percent. In terms of staff integration,  Labor officials said that integrating staff into the one-stop offices has been  a persistent challenge and the DVOP and LVER staff we interviewed cited  a wide variation of integration in local areas. Reasons these staff cited for  poor integration included a lack of support by the local office manager, the  lack of education and training for other one-stop staff members on serving  veterans, and only fair to poor quality of Labor\u2019s guidance and technical  assistance to states in how to integrate veterans\u2019 staff into the local one- stop offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentive Awards Program", "paragraphs": ["VETS issued guidance in time to establish an incentive program in the first  fiscal year after JVA, and 32 of the 50 state workforce administrators we  surveyed reported implementing the program.

California, for example, cited that state law prohibited monetary or other  gifts to employees for performing their duties. Idaho cited potential morale  problems among one-stop staff that have limited opportunities to serve  veterans. Four other states cited that the awards were incompatible with  the states\u2019 collective bargaining agreements. VETS officials said that some  states had been more successful than others in designing their awards  system and state opinions were mixed on the extent that the incentive  programs resulted in improved services. Administrators in 16 states with  award programs in place reported that their program had a positive effect  on improving or modernizing veterans\u2019 services.

VETS officials  told us they made additional modifications to the performance  accountability system when they adopted the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s new common performance measures in July 2005.

Overall, 33 of the 50 state workforce administrators reported that veterans\u2019  employment services have improved in their respective states since the  law\u2019s enactment. Among six different services we asked about,  administrators most often reported that DVOP staff were spending more  time on case management since JVA, although somewhat fewer states  reported that services to disabled veterans had similarly improved. (See  fig. 1.)", "Workforce administrators in 33 states also reported improvement in  veterans\u2019 employment results. These respondents attributed the  improvement both to the law\u2019s reforms and to other factors. The reform  cited most often as helping veterans obtain employment was the increased  availability of case management or other intensive services through the  DVOP program. Other than the reforms themselves, administrators said  veterans\u2019 employment was influenced by employer willingness or desire to  hire veterans and by the strength of the local job market. (See fig. 2.)", "In terms of barriers to employment, state administrators reported that  federal contractor failure to list job openings at the local one-stop centers  was a factor under most likely to delay or prevent some employment.  Other factors also presented obstacles to employment, the most frequent  one being a poor local job market.

While state VETS directors responding to our survey most often reported  that their monitoring role under JVA has had a positive effect on local  accountability, 19 directors reported their monitoring role either had no  effect or a negative effect. Our survey showed two main reasons for the  lack of a stronger effect.", "Lack of Local Level Data. In our survey, state VETS directors reported  that performance data from local offices are not available in many states,  limiting federal oversight and weakening local level accountability. State  VETS directors reported in our survey that among four different tools used  to monitor local office performance, the most beneficial were analysis and  use of data captured in states\u2019 performance reports, along with on-site  reviews of local offices. Under JVA, states took on greater responsibility  for assessing their own performance, and VETS modified its monitoring  practices in response by extending the time between site visits to local  offices from 1 year to 5 years. VETS directors in 21 states, however, noted  that data were not available to monitor performance of local offices, and  in these states, federal oversight may be limited to the on-site monitoring  visits by VETS directors required once every 5 years.", "Lack of Coordinated Oversight. While Labor agencies are jointly  responsible for monitoring employment and training services, little or no  effort has been made to coordinate oversight or use the monitoring results  to target assistance to states and localities that are most in need. For  example, while VETS is responsible for monitoring performance of the  DVOP and LVER programs, ETA oversees other workforce programs that  serve veterans as well as nonveterans, such as WIA and Wagner-Peyser  Employment Services. However, the two agencies do not generally  coordinate their monitoring activities or share the results. Only five state  VETS directors reported that they met with ETA officials to share  monitoring results and take joint action to address problems.", "Labor also lacks a strategy for using the monitoring information it gathers  to improve performance across states and local areas. While Labor has  authority under JVA to provide technical assistance to states that are  deficient in performance or need help, VETS has yet to begin addressing  the significant variation in performance levels among states, as reflected  by their widely divergent performance goals. For example, in program  years 2004 and 2005, states\u2019 negotiated goals for the rate at which veterans  entered employment ranged from 38 to 65 percent, while Labor\u2019s national  employment goal for veterans was 58 percent.
