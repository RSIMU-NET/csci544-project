While foodborne illnesses are often temporary maladies that may not require medical treatment, they can sometimes cause acute and chronic illnesses, such as kidney failure in infants and young children, stillbirths, and various types of arthritis. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service, in 1996, the estimated annual cost of medical treatments and productivity losses associated with these illnesses ranged from $6.5 billion to $37.1 billion. The actual number of foodborne illnesses, however, is unknown because many people who become ill do not seek treatment, and doctors may not associate the illnesses they do see with a food source or, if they do, report it to state or local health agencies.

For example, in 1995, one-third of all fresh fruits consumed in the United States were imported.", "Some imported foods pose a significant risk of foodborne illness. They can introduce pathogens previously uncommon in the United States, such as new strains of Salmonella and the Cyclospora parasite. Imported foods may also contain pathogens, such as hepatitis A, that cannot be easily detected until illness breaks out.

The import documents or electronic entry data identify the type of food product, the importer, foreign manufacturer, and country of origin. The bond, which covers potential duties, taxes, and penalties, may allow the importer to retain control of the shipment until FDA decides to inspect samples, test, or release it. If an importer fails to make an import shipment available for FDA\u2019s inspection, fails to recondition, or fails to destroy or re-export the shipment, as directed by FDA, Customs may collect penalties against all or part of the bond value.", "FDA relies on several sources of information to determine whether an imported food shipment will be inspected or tested or can be released into U.S. commerce. Among these sources are the following:", "FDA\u2019s annual work plan. The annual work plan establishes, among other activities, the number of inspections and tests that each FDA district office is to conduct, which are derived from guidance in specific food programs.For example, the work plan for fiscal year 1997 set inspection and testing activities for 10 imported food programs, such as imported low-acid/acidified canned foods and imported seafood, in four major project areas related to food safety\u2014Foodborne Biological Hazards; Pesticide and Chemical Contaminants; Molecular Biology and Natural Toxins; and Food and Color Additives.", "FDA\u2019s Import Alert Retrieval System database. This database contains a list of products that FDA automatically detains because the exporter or the specific food products have shown a history of violations in previous shipments. FDA will not approve the release into U.S. commerce of these automatically detained shipments until the importer shows that the product is not in violation, usually by providing the results of a private laboratory analysis. FDA disseminates information on automatic detentions to district offices through import alerts, which identify problem commodities and/or exporters, foreign firms, the country of origin, the reasons for detention, and the food safety risk.", "FDA\u2019s Low-Acid Canned Food database. This database contains information on foreign processors of low-acid and acidified canned foods registered with FDA. Foreign processors wishing to export these foods to the United States must submit descriptions of their canning processes to FDA before it will issue a registration number for the firm and permit the entry of the firm\u2019s shipments into U.S. commerce. The descriptions include the manufacturing methods used to prevent spoilage and contamination. FDA issues each foreign establishment a registration number to help track the firm\u2019s registration and processing records.", "To assist FDA in reviewing all shipments, Customs\u2019 computer system uses the information provided by the importer and FDA-developed screening rates to determine which shipments to automatically release into domestic commerce and which shipments to review further. FDA sets the screening rates using several sources of information, such as the annual work plan, compliance programs, type of product, and past violations of products or shippers. Most shipments that are believed to pose minimal safety risks, such as candy and dried pasta products, are frequently released automatically because they have low screening rates. FDA releases these shipments a few minutes after the importer enters the information. Other shipments, such as some seafood and low-acid canned foods, are less frequently or never released automatically, because they pose greater potential risks.", "Customs forwards information on products that are not automatically released to FDA for further review, through FDA\u2019s automated screening system, known as the Operational and Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS). This system was pilot-tested in 1992 and installed at all FDA\u2019s district offices by October 1997. (Before OASIS was developed, FDA manually tracked shipments through entry documents submitted by importers to Customs.) Along with the electronic information provided by the importer, FDA officials use the information in OASIS and other sources as needed\u2014such as the databases with information on products to be automatically detained and registration numbers for foreign firms\u2014to determine which samples of imported food shipments should be held for further action, such as inspection and/or laboratory testing, and which can be released without further review.

Inspections may occur at ports of entry and at warehouses or other business establishments. If FDA decides to test an imported food shipment, an FDA inspector collects a sample from the shipment and sends it to a FDA laboratory for analysis. (FDA maintains a record of all laboratory test results in its Laboratory Management System database.) For samples found to comply with U.S. standards, FDA notifies Customs and the importer that the shipment can be released. For samples found to violate these standards, FDA notifies Customs and the importer that the shipment has been refused entry into U.S. commerce.

Violations that generate more intensive inspections include food products that contain chemical residues or bone fragments, have misidentified products, or have microbial contamination.

Before it will allow a country to export meat and poultry to the United States, FSIS is required to determine that the exporting country has a food safety inspection system for these products that is equivalent to the U.S. system. By ensuring that countries exporting meat and poultry to the United States have adopted practices that protect their products from contamination, FSIS can devote its energies to verifying the efficacy of these exporting countries\u2019 systems and thereby use its inspection resources more efficiently. FDA does not have the authority to impose such a requirement on foreign countries for fish, fruits, vegetables, and the other foods for which it is responsible. Lacking the authority to ensure that exporting countries are adopting safe practices, FDA has to rely on labor-intensive inspections of imported products at the port of entry as its primary line of defense against the entry of unsafe foods. Because FDA is currently able to inspect less than 2 percent of the foods imported under its jurisdiction there is reason to question whether this approach adequately protects U.S. consumers.

Before a country can export meat and poultry to the United States, it must demonstrate that it has a food inspection system that is at least equivalent to the U.S. system. That is, the exporting country\u2019s inspection system must include, among other components, competent, qualified inspectors with the authority to enforce national food safety laws and regulations; administrative and technical support for these inspectors; and the implementation of inspection, sanitation, quality, microbiological, and residues standards equivalent to those applied to U.S. products.", "In implementing this requirement, FSIS requires exporting countries to apply for eligibility to export meat and poultry products to the United States, to supply health certificates attesting to the safety of the product with each exported item, and to submit exports for inspection at the U.S. border to verify the effectiveness of the foreign inspection system. FSIS staff visit foreign countries and firms annually to verify the effectiveness of their systems. In 1997, for example, FSIS staff visited 30 of the 37 eligible exporting countries to verify that the countries had changed their systems to include new safety procedures required for all domestic and foreign firms. These new procedures, called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), build science-based food safety controls into food production systems. Food firms incorporate controls into processing steps, maintain records of compliance with controls, and are subject to audits of their records to verify the program\u2019s effectiveness. As of January 1, 1998, FSIS had determined that 37 countries have food inspection systems equivalent to the United States\u2019 and are eligible to export meat and/or poultry products to this country. Products from countries not on the list of eligible countries are automatically refused entry.", "FDA does not have similar authority to accept only foods from countries with equivalent safety inspection systems. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, which covers most food items other than meat and poultry, requires imported products to comply with U.S. standards for purity, wholesomeness, safety, and hygiene. It does not, however, require the exporting countries to have inspection systems equivalent to the U.S. system. Accordingly, FDA must, with few exceptions, rely on inspections and tests of selected imported foods at the U.S. port of entry as the only defense against unsafe foods entering the United States. For a few products (infant formula and low-acid and acidified canned foods), FDA may request that foreign exporting firms grant FDA inspectors access to their plants, but these inspectors actually conduct few foreign plant inspections. In fiscal year 1996, FDA planned 90 such inspections but carried out only 9. FDA planned 37 such inspections in fiscal year 1997, carrying out 29.", "Although FDA cannot currently require countries to demonstrate that they have equivalent inspection systems before granting them authority to export to the United States, it can negotiate voluntary agreements with individual countries to establish equivalent inspection systems. For example, in 1997, FDA began an intensified effort to develop equivalency agreements, on a voluntary basis, with the major seafood exporting countries, in response to new regulations requiring all seafood producers selling to the U.S. market to use new HACCP procedures. However, FDA officials said the agency has not strongly pursued equivalency agreements on a broad scale because the effort would require considerable resources to review foreign countries\u2019 food safety systems. In addition, a single agreement with each country might not be adequate because many countries have multiple food safety programs for different food products or even for different stages of preparation for the same product for export. For example, one foreign agency may be responsible for the safety of fresh produce, while another agency may be responsible for processed produce. where equivalence has been determined to exist . . . the work of the foreign regulatory authority should serve to help ensure the safety of imports for U.S. consumers. Since the foreign inspection system will have been found to be equivalent to FDA\u2019s inspection system, FDA will be able to rely on the results for the foreign inspection system. . . . As equivalence is achieved, and agreements are reached recognizing the achievement of equivalence, trade is likely to flow more freely because of the reduced need by importing countries to engage in resource-intensive sampling and examination of products being offered for entry from countries with equivalent systems. For the United States, equivalency agreements will also mean that FDA will be able to target the limited resources it has for imports towards products from countries that have not been determined to be equivalent. Thus, FDA will be able to use its resources more efficiently and effectively.", "In October 1997, as part of the administration\u2019s food safety initiative, the President directed FDA to seek new authority to require equivalency in food safety systems. In response, FDA developed proposed legislation for new discretionary authority that would allow the agency to prohibit imports of some foods, unless the exporting country demonstrates that the food safety system and conditions in the exporting country achieve the same level of protection as food prepared and packed in the United States. Legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives in November 1997 and in the U.S. Senate in March 1998, and is under consideration.The legislation would allow FDA to determine that an imported food is adulterated, and thus cannot be imported, if the foreign system, conditions, or measures for preparing or packing the food product are not equivalent to the level of protection required for similar foods produced in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equivalency Authority Allows for More Effective Use of Resources to Ensure Safety of Imported Foods", "paragraphs": ["FSIS uses its equivalency authority to shift the primary responsibility for food safety to the exporting country. Rather than focusing on resource-intensive port-of-entry inspections, FSIS emphasizes reviews of exporting countries\u2019 compliance with U.S. requirements. In contrast, FDA relies on port-of-entry inspections to ensure that imported foods are safe. This approach does little to verify the safety of all imported foods because it does not account for the conditions under which the products were processed and packed. The efficacy of port-of-entry inspections therefore depends on inspecting an adequate sample of imports, an objective FDA has not been able to meet, particularly as import volumes have increased. In addition, inspections of imported foods may be insufficient to determine whether contamination has occurred.

It also deployed about 75 inspectors to (1) ensure that each imported shipment had a health certificate from the exporting country, (2) visually check every shipment for transportation damage and accurate shipping labels, and (3) conduct intensive inspections and tests on a sample of products as a way of verifying the performance of the exporting country\u2019s system. This approach allows FSIS to transfer the primary food safety responsibility to the exporting country. FSIS considers the eligible foreign country\u2019s inspection system\u2014not its own inspection at the port of entry\u2014to be the primary control for ensuring that imported meat and poultry products meet U.S. standards.

In addition, FDA\u2019s draft guidance on equivalency criteria states that, by itself, end-product inspection and testing at the port of entry cannot be relied upon to provide adequate protection because assurance that food will not present unacceptable risks requires effective processing controls that are periodically inspected and verified by a regulatory authority.", "Similarly, a 1991 report by the Advisory Committee on the Food and Drug Administration called point-of-entry inspections an anachronism. The process of inspecting a final product to determine if it conforms to standards and of rejecting those that do not has been \u201ctotally discredited,\u201d according to the committee, as a means of ensuring manufacturing quality or regulatory compliance for domestic products.", "Likewise, in 1994, we reported that reliance on end-product testing was an ineffective, resource-intensive, and statistically invalid approach to ensuring that imported foods are not contaminated with unsafe levels of chemicals. We recommended that the Congress change the federal government\u2019s role in ensuring food safety by moving away from end-product testing to an approach preventing contamination from occurring, such as the use of HACCP in production processes. In addition, we suggested the Congress consider requiring that all imported foods be produced under equivalent food safety systems. HACCP is now required for some products, such as seafood, and the Congress is considering legislation to provide FDA with equivalency authority.", "The capabilities of FDA\u2019s inspection approach to protect consumers from unsafe products has been further called into question by the agency\u2019s inability to keep pace with rising import levels. Between 1992 and 1997, the number of imported food entries more than doubled, from 1.1 million to 2.7 million. As workloads increased, resources devoted to inspecting imported foods declined by 22 percent, from 328 staff years for inspectors in 1992 to 257 staff years for inspectors in 1997; thus, the average number of annual food shipments each inspector was responsible for increased from about 3,350 to about 10,500. As a result of these and other factors, FDA\u2019s inspection coverage of imported food entries has fallen from an estimated 8 percent of food entries in fiscal year 1992 to 1.7 percent in fiscal year 1997. Of the 2.7 million total food entries in 1997, 56 percent were released after FDA\u2019s automated screening system reviewed the import information, 42.3 percent were released after an inspector reviewed electronic information or import documents, and the remaining 1.7 percent were held for inspection. Of the 1.7 percent held for inspection (46,295 entries), FDA conducted laboratory analyses on 16,048 entries, or 0.6 percent of the total number of food entries.

The number of import entries per FSIS inspector rose from about 1,236 in calendar year 1992 to about 1,645 in 1997. In addition to visually checking every shipment, FSIS performed more intensive inspections on about 20.2 percent of the 118,000 entries in 1997, somewhat less than its rate of 26.9 percent in 1992.

However, regional and district FDA officials told us that the numbers for inspections and tests contained in the work plan were not realistic because they did not take into account the time required to investigate emergencies and consumer complaints, which invariably occur. In 1997, for example, FDA spent 6,274 hours investigating the outbreaks associated with Guatemalan raspberries\u2014time not accounted for in the work plan.

FDA plans to integrate the laboratory database with OASIS in fiscal year 1998 to make better use of staff resources in targeting defective and dangerous products. Furthermore, FDA inspectors do not have ready access to some useful data in OASIS when deciding which products to inspect. For example, inspectors can obtain information on prior violations by foreign plants or countries, but the process for doing so can be cumbersome and time-consuming. To obtain these data, inspectors have to close their OASIS database and open another database. We observed two inspectors going through this process\u2014which took 3 to 10 minutes per shipment\u2014at a time when one of these inspectors had to process as many as 200 shipments per day.

FDA and Customs officials have also acknowledged that substitution is occurring at other ports, although neither we nor they know the full extent of its occurrence. Finally, Customs disagreed with our statement that violators are seldom punished effectively and the damages against violators do not represent an effective deterrent; Customs stated that the current damages assessed against violators are adequate in most cases. However, on the basis of our work extending back to 1992, we have found that liquidated damages do not appear to be an effective deterrent. In 1992, for example, we reported that the U.S. market value for selected products always exceeded the declared import value of the products we surveyed; thus, importers could and, in some cases, did profit from distributing refused products even after paying damages to Customs. The example we mention in this report, in which Customs assessed damages of $100 against an importer with a shipment having a declared value of $100,000, shows that the collected damages may be far less than the declared value of the shipment. We added information in the report to explain that, according to Customs officials in Washington, D.C., any decision to mitigate damages against importers for failure to redeliver shipments that were refused entry because of product purity or labeling problems requires agreement by both Customs and FDA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Outbreaks of Foodborne Illnesses Linked to Imported Foods, 1983-97", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has linked several significant foodborne outbreaks to imported foods (see table I.1).

For example, in the spring of 1996, multiple health departments reported cases of illness from Cyclospora, a pathogen that had not previously been proven to be transmitted by food. CDC and other public health officials were able to link illnesses from Cyclospora with raspberries from Guatemala; more than 1,000 people in various locations in the United States and Canada were affected. In 1997, additional illnesses from Cyclospora, also affecting more than 1,000 people, were also linked with raspberries from Guatemala.

While we agree with FDA that the compliance programs contain specific guidance on inspection requirements, we found that FDA inspectors rely on the numerical inspection targets set forth in the annual work plan for guidance. These targets are sometimes inconsistent with the directions for the compliance program. We agree that FDA needs flexibility to deal with emergencies as they arise, but we disagree that the current work plan \u201cclearly reflects priorities.\u201d The inconsistency we identified often leads inspectors to rely on subjective judgment, which may lead to inspectors\u2019 selecting shipments that do not pose the greater food safety risk to consumers. 2. We have not evaluated nor endorsed this legislation. Instead, this report addresses the need for FDA\u2019s equivalency authority. This authority would enable FDA to shift the primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of imported foods to the exporting country and to make more efficient and effective use of its limited resources. 3. We have modified the report to reflect FDA\u2019s comment that it does not have explicit authority to require importers to use certain laboratories nor to provide a list of accredited laboratories to importers. 4. Our recommendation was not intended to require the immediate implementation of equivalency requirements. Instead, we envision that such equivalency requirements would be phased in over time in a manner that would not unnecessarily disrupt trade. The mandatory authority to require equivalency would address weaknesses in FDA\u2019s approach to inspections at the port of entry, enable FDA to leverage its staff resources by sharing the responsibility for food safety with the exporting countries, and compel FDA to take an active approach in preventing food safety problems instead of requiring equivalency after problems are identified.

We modified the language in the report to clarify that the 50-percent substitution rate was attributed to Operation Bad Apple.
