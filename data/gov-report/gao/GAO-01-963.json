This is the first in a series of reports responding to your request. It focuses specifically on the District of Columbia school system\u2019s use of an areawide utility contract for gas and energy management services between the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Washington Gas Light Company (Washington Gas) to renovate the schools. We looked at whether the school system properly used and administered this contract."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In response to public concerns about safety and maintenance, the District of Columbia undertook a major effort to renovate and modernize its public schools in 1998.

The agreement was for engineering, procurement, and technical assistance to ensure that construction contracts were awarded and managed so that schools could open in the fall of that year. In the Fiscal Year 1999 District of Columbia Appropriations Act, Congress authorized the Corps of Engineers to provide the school system with engineering, construction, and related services.", "Until fiscal year 2001, the District of Columbia\u2019s Office of Contracting and Procurement was the central authority for procurements made by the various city agencies, including the school system.  In October 2000, the school system obtained its own procurement authority.  It assumed responsibility for about a third of the school renovation projects on the fiscal year 2001 capital projects list, while the Corps of Engineers was responsible for the remainder. To obtain renovation services for the repairs under its purview, the school system has almost exclusively used a GSA areawide public utility contract with Washington Gas for gas, gas transportation, and energy management services.", "GSA entered into the contract with Washington Gas, a regulated public utility, without competition because the company has an exclusive franchise by law to provide certain utility services in its service area. The \u201cenergy management\u201d services available from the contract could, if the contractor has these services on file with the Public Service Commission, include services intended to provide energy savings, efficiency improvements, energy audits, conservation measures such as lighting control and boiler control improvements, and water conservation device installation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Was Improperly Used and Precluded Competition", "paragraphs": ["The school system improperly used the gas utility contract as a vehicle for obtaining a broad range of facility improvements and maintenance work. In doing so, it precluded competition by awarding all of the work on a sole-source basis to Washington Gas as the prime contractor.  The types of services provided under the Washington Gas contract could have been performed by licensed plumbing, heating, electrical, or general contractor firms.", "The GSA contract with Washington Gas is limited to the provision of regulated gas utility and energy management services.  In contrast, our analysis of completed projects from August 2000 through March 2001 shows that the school system has paid Washington Gas $25 million for a range of projects, including painting, carpeting, and electrical work; boiler, air conditioning, heating, and structural repairs; bathroom, auditorium, and swimming pool renovations; and flag pole refurbishments. Figure 1 shows the major categories of  services.", "Based on our reading of the contract, the governing regulation, and discussions with GSA and the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, we do not believe these services were within the scope of the GSA contract because none of the work or services were regulated utility services or otherwise on file with the Public Service Commission. Appendix V contains details on our analysis.", "The school system first started using the GSA areawide contract with Washington Gas in the last months of calendar year 1997 to provide emergency boiler repairs and temporary boiler rentals. These services were outside the scope of utility services described in the contract. In 2000 and 2001, the range of services expanded to include many other types of projects ordered by the school system, all of which were also outside the contract\u2019s scope. Washington Gas marketed its project management services to the school system and performed these services without regard to the scope of its contract with GSA.", "The school system\u2019s chief contracting officer explained to us that the Washington Gas contract was used because it was an existing source of supply that could be quickly implemented to keep the schools open. In contrast, according to the contracting officer, the typical lengthy procurement process using solicited competitive bids would have prevented the timely acquisition of the needed work and services. The contracting officer considered the GSA contract to be available for use because the type of work was, in the contracting officer\u2019s view, energy- related.", "Other contracting options were available to the school system. For example, the school system could have used the Army Corps of Engineers to perform school renovations. The Corps carried out most of the renovation work for the school system from fiscal years 1999 through 2001.  Further, the Corps had alternative contract vehicles for which it had well-defined statements of work, independent cost estimates, and negotiated contractor fees. The then-Chief Facilities Officer informed us that he was reluctant to give additional work to the Corps, however, because he believed the Corps processes and procedures were too slow given the crisis atmosphere and pressure from the community to carry out renovations quickly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GSA Concerns With School System\u2019s Use of the Contract", "paragraphs": ["After we raised questions about the school system\u2019s use of the Washington Gas contract, the GSA contracting officer responsible for the contract sent a May 2001 letter to the school system\u2019s contracting officer stating that (1) the contract is not intended to provide general facility improvements and maintenance that are not energy-related and (2) continued use of the contract for services outside the scope and intent would jeopardize the school system\u2019s ability to continue using the contract. The GSA contracting officer was unaware of the scope of services for which the school system was contracting with Washington Gas because neither the school system nor Washington Gas had reported use of the contract to GSA as required.", "An Assistant General Counsel at the General Services Administration also told us that many of the construction services provided by Washington Gas to the school system clearly fell outside the scope of the areawide contract because these services dealt with general construction as opposed to gas, gas transportation, or energy management services. Further, the Counsel explained that energy management services must result in documented energy cost savings or a reduction in energy usage.", "To ensure that the contract is properly used in the future, the GSA contracting officer referred the school system\u2019s contracting officer to GSA guidance on areawide utility contracts.  However, we believe this guidance in insufficient and unclear. For example, the guidance could be interpreted as allowing the school system to order any service Washington Gas, or more precisely, its subsidiaries and subcontractors, might have to offer. It also lists many energy management projects that are not regulated utility services that could be provided under areawide contracts, such as window and air conditioning replacements.", "We are sending a separate letter to GSA detailing our concerns with its guidance and providing recommendations on improving oversight and guidance on areawide utility contracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sound Practices Not Followed in Using the Washington Gas Contract", "paragraphs": ["Our review also revealed serious breakdowns in internal controls and gross shortcomings in the way the work under the gas utility contract was ordered and handled.

The absence of effective controls and oversight has put the $32.9 million already spent on the renovation work\u2014as well as some $10.2 million in outstanding orders\u2014at considerable risk of improper billing, poor quality work, and high prices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Management and Oversight Practices Fundamental to Successful Contracting", "paragraphs": ["Establishing and following strong management and oversight practices is critical to successful contracting efforts.

For example, they should have effective plans for assuring the quality of the work performed by the contractor. When these controls are not in place, agencies assume undue risk and could end up paying more than they should.", "The District of Columbia has controls in place to ensure that it obtains fair and reasonable prices and to provide contract oversight. For example, District agencies are required to perform procurement planning and conduct market surveys to promote and provide for competition for supplies and services.  In addition, until fiscal year 2001, the District of Columbia\u2019s Office of Contracting and Procurement was required to review contracting actions (including the school system\u2019s) totaling $50,000 or more. Currently, the school system\u2019s Office of General Counsel is required to review contract actions of $25,000 or more. Among other things, these reviews require evidence that independent cost estimates have been performed, work has been competed or justified as a sole-source procurement, and a legal review has been performed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School System Did Not Adhere to Review and Oversight Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The school system did not adhere to a number of oversight requirements in carrying out the renovation work. Such requirements are in place to ensure that the District obtains the best price and service, contracts are legally sound, payments to contractors are justified, and work has adequately been competed. Specifically:   The school system did not obtain required reviews and approvals from the District of Columbia\u2019s Office of Contracting and Procurement. When the school system began using the Washington Gas contract, it had not yet been granted it own contracting authority. As such, it was required to submit actions totaling $50,000 or more to the Office of Contracting and Procurement up until October 2000. This review considered such things as the cost of the work, whether the contract was legally sound, whether the work was competed, and whether sole-source procurements were adequately justified. However, only 2 of 20 actions that were subject to this review\u2014representing $1.3 million of $14.9 million\u2014were submitted.", "The school system did not obtain required approvals from its General Counsel. When the school system obtained its contracting authority in October 2000, the school system\u2019s guidance required contract actions totaling $25,000 or more to be submitted to the General Counsel for review and approval. However, the contracting officer ignored this requirement and did not submit $28.2 million of orders that met this review threshold. General Counsel officials told us that they were unaware of the extent to which the school system was using the Washington Gas contract.", "The school system bypassed the City Council approval process. District of Columbia law requires City Council approval of any proposed District government contract (including orders under an existing contract) having a value of more than $1 million. The proposed contract is to be accompanied by a summary that includes a description of the selection process and a certification that the proposed contract is legally sufficient and has been reviewed by the District of Columbia Office of the Corporation Counsel. The school system bypassed this process by grouping about $43 million of renovation work into orders of $950,000 each\u2014just under the $1 million threshold. Sometimes, the school system issued as many as three such orders in a single day. Table 1 details the value and dates of the specific orders.", "Required approvals from the District of Columbia\u2019s Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority were not obtained. The authority, also known as the Control Board, was established in 1995 to repair the District\u2019s failing financial conditions and to improve the effectiveness of its various entities. The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving certain contracts awarded by the District.  One criterion triggering review by the Board is contracts awarded on a sole- source basis. Officials on the Board told us that they should have reviewed all of the orders placed under the Washington Gas contract because they consider the contract to be a sole source procurement.  They told us that they had reviewed only one of the orders, for emergency boiler repairs in 1997. After that time, the school system did not forward any subsequent orders under the contract to the Board for review.", "An additional oversight mechanism within the school system is the Office of Finance, which is concerned with the District\u2019s financial health and approves funding for contract orders as well as payments to contractors. The school system\u2019s Office of Finance questioned the use of the Washington Gas contract in July and August 2000 because of the large number of orders being made to Washington Gas. However, it approved orders after receiving assurances from the contracting officer that the orders were justified. We believe these assurances were insufficient because they did not show that the work was within the scope of the contract and they were not supported by justification for using a sole- source contract or pricing analyses. As figure 2 illustrates, the school system substantially increased the value of the orders once the Office of Finance continued approving orders based on the assurances of the contracting officer.", "By not following oversight requirements, the school system put the renovation work at considerable risk of improper billing and high prices. In fact, we found that the school system was overcharged by about $1.9 million because of duplicate billings and billings for work not completed. We found 11 cases where Washington Gas had billed the school system twice for the same work. These duplicate billings totaled $243,174. For example, Washington Gas billed the school system twice for $18,250 for painting performed by a subcontractor at M.M. Washington Senior High School and for $62,000 for lighting work at Aiton Elementary School. In other cases, Washington Gas billed the school system for the full cost of the work before subcontractors had completed the work.

For example, if carpeting was needed, a certain company usually received the work. Another company was usually called to do painting, a third for electrical repairs, and a fourth for general construction.

As such, they are required as part of the District\u2019s contract oversight requirements. Nevertheless, we found that independent cost estimates and pricing analyses were prepared for almost none of the orders under the Washington Gas contract. The school system relied on its facilities staff, not contracting officials, to conduct these reviews, but the staff did not do them.", "Additionally, the school system did not determine that Washington Gas\u2019 prices and fees for the renovation work were fair and reasonable, as required, or negotiate the fee charged by Washington Gas. The Washington Gas contract does not establish prices or fees for any of the work ordered by the school system.  Rather, prices were to be negotiated between the contractor and the school system.", "In 1999 and 2000, Washington Gas generally charged the school system a 20-percent fee on each project conducted under the contract. The fee included services such as project management, engineering design, inspection services, and administrative services, as well as overhead and profit. The fee was not negotiated. In fact, it applied to all renovations orders regardless of size or complexity of work and regardless of the extent of Washington Gas\u2019 role in individual projects.", "Washington Gas increased its fee at the beginning of fiscal year 2001 from 20 to 25 percent because the school system was requesting additional work and larger projects. This increase was also not negotiated, and the 25-percent fee was applied as a flat rate to all projects. The school system\u2019s contracting officer was unaware that the fee had been raised until we notified her. The then-Chief Facilities Officer raised concern about the fee with Washington Gas and requested that it be lowered. However, no action was taken.", "Lastly, for much of the boiler work, the school system paid a fee to a subsidiary of Washington Gas (American Combustion Industries, Inc.), in addition to the 25-percent fee charged by Washington Gas.  In some cases, as a result of this situation the school system paid fees of up to 50 percent\u2014with half going to Washington Gas and half to its subsidiary.", "Because the school system failed to use competitive procedures, neglected to prepare reliable cost estimates and pricing analyses, and failed to negotiate fees, it had no way of knowing whether prices were fair and reasonable. In fact, the school system has paid Washington Gas a total of $6 million in fees for very limited program management services.  For the most part, only 4 employees at Washington Gas worked on school renovation-related efforts. One employee served as a liaison with the school system; another prepared the listings of work to be completed and informed the subcontractor to begin work; a third inspected the work; and a fourth ensured that the subcontractors were paid.", "Further, on many projects, Washington Gas did not provide all of the services that, according to Washington Gas officials, formed the basis for its fee. For example, Washington Gas collected $74,448 in fees for a $297,795 parking lot and playground renovation project at Hendley Elementary School.  For its 25-percent fee, Washington Gas just prepared the listing of renovation work to be completed, told the subcontractor to begin work, inspected the work, and paid the subcontractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School System Did Not Adequately Administer the Contract", "paragraphs": ["Facilities staff took on duties normally belonging to the prime contractor and contracting officer without any authority to do so.  Specifically, school system facility staff who did not have contracting authority were intimately involved in selecting subcontractors, approving proposed prices, making changes to the work, assuring the quality of the work performed, and approving invoices for payment.  For example:   The prime contractor normally selects subcontractors, approves their prices, and defines their scopes of work. In this case, however, the school system facilities staff\u2014not Washington Gas, the prime contractor\u2014 solicited and approved subcontractor proposals. At times, these proposals were vague and broad in scope, making it difficult to determine how prices were established and approved. For example, one proposal, for drain cleaning at \u201cvarious D.C. public schools,\u201d offers to snake and clean various drains for a not-to-exceed price of $100,000. The schools were not listed, nor was the extent of the work detailed. A $25,421 proposal to install carpet in five rooms at Shaw Junior High School did not indicate the area of carpet; therefore, a realistic evaluation of the price could not be made.", "District contracting officers normally ensure that procurements of supplies, services, or construction conform to the quality and quantity requirements of the contract.   In this case, however, the facilities staff performed quality assurance without any official delegation of responsibility to do so.  Many times, the facilities official who had selected the subcontractor and approved the subcontractor\u2019s work and price also inspected the work and authorized payment. Furthermore, many inspections were not well-documented, and for some projects, facilities staff approved completed work by simply signing the subcontractor\u2019s invoices without indicating that the work had been inspected and deemed acceptable.", "Facilities staff directed Washington Gas to adjust contracted work for 276 projects, totaling $7.4 million, between August 2000 and March 2001. These projects comprised about 29 percent of the $25.4 million paid to Washington Gas during that time period. (See fig. 4). Nevertheless, the contracting officer did not officially modify contracted work, as required, to reflect these changes. In fact, the contracting officer, who was responsible for making contract modifications, was unaware of the changes.", "Contracting officials sometimes provide program staff with limited authority to perform such duties as monitoring technical performance and reporting any potential or actual problems to the contracting officer. In these cases, the contracting officer formally designates this authority, and in doing so, provides the program staff with detailed guidance on what these duties entail and do not entail. In particular, the guidance stresses that program staff are not empowered to authorize, agree to, or sign any modifications to the work.

Washington Gas\u2019 normal policy was to pay the subcontractors before billing the school system.", "To determine whether contracted work was adjusted, we compared the listing of projects compiled by Washington Gas under each order under the contract with the listing of projects accompanying Washington Gas\u2019 bill to the school system for each specific order.

We disagree with Washington Gas on each point, as discussed below. 1.  We disagree with Washington Gas on the issue of the scope of the areawide utility contract.  We stand by our position that none of the services provided by Washington Gas to the school system fell within the contract\u2019s scope.  These were not regulated services, but rather work that could have been performed by heating, plumbing, or general contractors.  We address this issue further in our response to GSA\u2019s comments (app. IV). 2.  Contrary to Washington Gas\u2019 response, our report does not state that the fee was excessive.  However, because the school system did not use competitive procedures, prepare cost estimates or pricing analyses, or negotiate the fee, it had no way of knowing whether Washington Gas\u2019 prices were fair and reasonable.  We rightly point out that Washington Gas charged the school system a flat fee for each project, despite the fact that the scope of work varied widely by project.", "Further, we are correct in stating that fees were not negotiated, that fees were charged by Washington Gas and its affiliate, and that there were overcharges (see comments 4, 8, and 9 below). 3.  We do not speculate that the Army Corps of Engineers would have provided better quality work at lower prices.  Rather, we point out that existing Army Corps contracting mechanisms provided an option to using the sole-source Washington Gas contract. 4.  The fees were not, in fact, negotiated. The school system inappropriately paid the fee without undergoing the normal negotiations with the contractor.  Merely accepting the fee is not equivalent to negotiating it. 5.  Washington Gas incorrectly states that its fees were fully disclosed as part of each proposal and invoice submitted to the school system.", "Washington Gas indicated on its proposals and invoices the base cost and, in a separate column, the final price, which incorporated Washington Gas\u2019 fee.  However, the fee itself did not appear explicitly on the documents.  The school system\u2019s contracting officer was unaware that the fee had increased to 25 percent. Only by calculating the difference between the base cost and the final price would one realize that the fee had increased.", "Further, the Control Board approved only one contract action, for emergency boiler work in 1997.  As we note in the report, the school system failed to submit all subsequent orders to the Control Board for review, contrary to the Board\u2019s requirements. Any implication that the Control Board was aware of\u2014or approved\u2014Washington Gas\u2019 fee for any other than the initial contract action is misleading. 6.  Our report outlines the elements included in Washington Gas\u2019 mark-up, based on documents provided by Washington Gas.  Further, we do not refer to the mark-up as a \u201cprofit,\u201d but rather as a \u201cfee.\u201d 7.  We recognize that the school system asked Washington Gas to provide a limited amount of services on certain projects.  However, we point out that Washington Gas charged a flat 25-percent fee\u2014and that the school system paid this fee\u2014for every project, even though the needs of each project varied widely. 8.  Contrary to Washington Gas\u2019 statement, our report does not contend that the company improperly marked up sales by its affiliate, American Combustion Industries, Inc. We correctly point out that both Washington Gas and its affiliate charged a fee to the school system and that, in addition to paying Washington Gas\u2019 25-percent fee, the school system paid an additional fee to American Combustion Industries, Inc. 9.  Washington Gas refers to \u201calleged\u201d overbillings. In fact, overbillings did occur and Washington Gas has explicitly acknowledged them.  After we identified $243,174 in duplicate billings from Washington Gas to the school system from August 2000 through March 2001, Washington Gas hired an independent audit firm to confirm our findings.  The firm discovered that Washington Gas had double-billed the school system in the amount of $482,915.  In an August 13, 2001, letter to the school system\u2019s superintendent, Washington Gas stated that it would credit the school system  for the duplicate billings.  Given this situation, we fail to understand how Washington Gas can imply that overcharges did not occur. 10. During our audit, we provided Washington Gas a list of  projects, totaling $1.7 million, where it appeared that Washington Gas had billed the school system before work had been completed.  As of the time of this report, the accounting firm hired by Washington Gas had not completed its review of these projects to determine whether these improper billings had occurred and, if so, the extent of the errors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the General Services Administration\u2019s letter dated September 19, 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We agree with GSA that areawide contracts may be appropriate vehicles for carrying out the federal energy management goals of the Energy Policy Act.  However, we continue to believe that any exception to the government\u2019s competitive contracting requirements for agency participation in utility incentive programs is limited to regulated services or to services for which the utility is the only available source. None of the arguments or information GSA has provided in its comments is inconsistent with our position or convinces us otherwise.", "As we will more fully discuss in our forthcoming letter to GSA, our view is further supported not only by the Energy Policy Act itself, but by the definition of \u201cutility\u201d in an Executive Order requiring agencies to reduce energy usage and cost through use of alternative financing and contracting mechanisms.  Indeed, the language \u201cgenerally available to customers\u201d that GSA refers to itself appears to indicate that the utility incentive programs in which federal agencies are authorized to participate are subject to applicable public utility regulatory authority.  Accordingly, we stand by our position that the government\u2019s competitive contracting requirements limit the use of GSA areawide contracts to utility services, including energy efficiency services, subject to public utility regulatory authority or for which the utility is the only available source. 2. GSA misconstrues our position.  The language to which GSA refers was not meant to signify that only the regulated utility could perform regulated services.  We are not aware of any prohibition on a utility company\u2019s subsidiaries or subcontractors performing such services if approved or authorized under regulatory authority.  Instead, our point was that, in the case of the school system, the subsidiaries and subcontractors were providing unregulated services not authorized under the areawide contract rather than services that could be authorized under the contract if subject to public utility regulatory authority.  Further, as we pointed out, Washington Gas was acting as a general contractor by performing a project management role over its unregulated subsidiaries and subcontractors, a role that was not authorized under the GSA contract. 3. GSA acknowledges that the areawide contract with Washington Gas is for regulated utility services, as we maintain.  Because of deregulation in the utility industry, GSA states that it is now reviewing its areawide contracts for possible modification in light of \u201ccurrent industry practice.\u201d", "We also recognize that deregulation may limit the services that may be ordered under an areawide contract because certain services may no longer be subject to regulation (but are available from more than one source in the marketplace).", "Since areawide contracts are entered into without competition due to the regulated nature of the utility industry, we reiterate our position that the contracts remain limited to regulated services or services for which the utility is the only available source.  As we have indicated, we believe the government\u2019s competitive procurement requirements are violated if an areawide contract is used for utility services, including energy efficiency services, that are not subject to public utility regulatory authority or for which the utility is not the only available source.  To the extent utility services are available from more than one source, the acquisition of such services should be through competitive procedures, as already required under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

We do not view the GSA contract as contemplating the type of boiler and HVAC repair and replacement, minor construction and building maintenance, and other work and services that could be provided competitively by many available sources. Indeed, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 41, which establishes procedures for federal agencies to acquire utility services, states that its provisions, including those related to GSA areawide utility contracts, do not apply to construction and maintenance of government- owned facilities.  To the extent that school system orders involved construction and maintenance, these orders are clearly contrary to the governing regulation.", "The GSA contract also requires than an \u201cEnergy Management Service\u201d provided by the contractor must be within the knowledge and/or supervision of the Public Service Commission having jurisdiction over the contractor\u2019s service area.

Based on our reading of the contract and our discussion with representatives of the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, we believe that any energy management services provided by Washington Gas to the school system under the GSA areawide contract would have to have been \u201cwithin the knowledge and/or supervision\u201d of the Public Service Commission.", "However, there is no indication that any of the work or specific services provided by Washington Gas to the school system were \u201cwithin the knowledge and/or supervision\u201d of the Public Service Commission, through a tariff filing or otherwise.  Rather, the only services relevant here that could have been construed as related to \u201cEnergy Management Services\u201d that the Public Service Commission had on file from Washington Gas were \u201cnon-residential full scale conservation programs\u201d that included a municipal boiler/furnace installation assistance program for space and water heating.  These programs were considered by the Commission to be a \u201cleast cost planning program,\u201d the costs of which were included in the rate base passed on to ratepayers.  Since these programs affected rates paid by Washington Gas customers, the programs were described in a tariff filed by Washington Gas with the Public Service Commission.  The Commission provided us a copy of the relevant portion of the tariff.", "Under the tariff, effective for service rendered after March 1994, the municipal boiler/furnace installation assistance program provided for cash incentives to the District Government for replacing boilers, furnaces, and hot water heaters with new gas-fired high efficiency equipment.  The tariff did not indicate that Washington Gas itself was to provide the equipment replacement but merely that upon verification of the installation of the equipment, Washington Gas was to provide a cash incentive to the District for each eligible replacement of equipment.  The tariff also authorized Washington Gas to conduct energy surveys of the buildings of customers participating in the programs at no cost to the customer.  Because these services were provided in a tariff effective when the GSA areawide contract with Washington Gas was executed in 1996, these limited services could be the only \u201dEnergy Management Services\u201d contemplated by the contract as being within the knowledge or supervision of the Public Service Commission.", "Beginning in 1999, even these limited \u201cEnergy Management Services\u201d were no longer authorized by the Public Service Commission in Washington Gas\u2019s capacity as a regulated public utility.  In an order dated December 21, 1998, the Commission approved the elimination of least-cost planning costs from the utility rate base, thus terminating filing requirements related to least-cost planning, including the municipal boiler/furnace installation assistance program.  The Commission does not have on file from Washington Gas any other energy management service programs applicable to the GSA contract.  Accordingly, since December 1998, there have been no authorized energy management services \u201cwithin the knowledge and/or supervision\u201d of the Public Service Commission that Washington Gas can provide under the GSA contract.

Based on the information provided to us, these orders were primarily for boiler (heating) repairs, temporary boiler rentals, new boilers, and chiller (air conditioning) repairs.  None of these goods and services are authorized under the GSA contract because none of Washington Gas\u2019s energy management services on file with the Public Service Commission included heating and air conditioning repair services, renting temporary boilers, and selling and installing new boilers.

Competition requirements are evaded if areawide contractors, which are awarded their contracts by virtue of their status as regulated utilities, are allowed to provide unregulated services to ordering agencies that are available from other sources using competitive procedures.
