To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS administrative and tax data. GAO identified California as a case study. GAO interviewed IRS and state officials and contacted revenue officials in the 50 states and the District of Columbia."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The California requirement that three types of businesses be in compliance with federal employment taxes to obtain a state business license shows promise as a valuable tool for improving federal tax compliance. According to data from IRS, of 7,194 businesses that applied for a California business license one or more times from calendar years 2006 through 2008 about 24 percent had to file employment tax returns or pay overdue taxes to come into compliance with federal employment taxes. California businesses filed 441 employment tax returns and IRS collected nearly $7.4 million in current dollars in employment taxes in calendar year 2006 and in 8 months of calendar year 2007. GAO estimated that IRS incurred about $331,348 to operate the data-sharing arrangement for this period. Using this cost estimate, the ROI for this arrangement is 22:1. IRS has not tracked the cost data needed to compare the ROI of the IRS-DLSE enforcement activity with other current enforcement activities. However, IRS's highest estimated ROI among five new direct revenue-producing enforcement initiatives proposed in its fiscal year 2009 budget was 11.4:1. Tax compliance among businesses after they applied for state business licenses showed continued improvement. GAO identified 2,017 businesses that applied for business licenses in calendar year 2006 only and found that 315 of these businesses had unpaid assessments as of September 18, 2006. By August 18, 2008, 165 of these businesses had resolved or lowered their unpaid assessment debt by $1,925,162. All but 1 of the 350 businesses that had unpaid assessments when they applied for business licenses in calendar year 2006 were small businesses. GAO's analysis, although showing a promising ROI, did not take into account certain factors, such as whether other tax collection activities were in process for the businesses that applied for licenses. Many opportunities exist to require federal tax compliance to qualify for state business licenses. GAO contacted revenue officials in every state and the District of Columbia to ask whether their states require tax compliance for business licenses. For the 48 respondents, 20 revenue officials said that their states require compliance with state taxes to obtain a state business license, and that these requirements exist for one or more industries. Twenty said that their states do not have such a requirement; 8 said that their states have no business license requirement at the state level. According to IRS, arrangements exist with 13 states that require compliance with one or more federal taxes to qualify for a state business license. Varying licensing requirements from state to state and lack of uniformity among states in categorizing a license as a \"business license\" make pinpointing the exact number of opportunities difficult. States that currently require compliance with state taxes for selected business license applicants may represent more of an immediate opportunity for establishing arrangements that require federal tax compliance to qualify for a state business license since they already see tax compliance as important for the businesses. Some challenges, such as a lack of current legal authority in some states to link businesses to tax compliance, would need to be addressed if requiring federal tax compliance for state business licenses is to be expanded."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Sharing data between federal and state agencies can be a cost-effective  way to improve tax compliance by uncovering information that helps  identify businesses and individuals that are noncompliant with their  taxes. According to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) studies, small  businesses with cash incomes contribute significantly to the 2001  estimated gross tax gap of $345 billion. IRS operates a wide variety of  data-sharing arrangements with state revenue and nonrevenue agencies  designed to improve tax compliance among individuals and businesses. In  one type of arrangement, IRS and state agencies share information about  businesses that apply for state business licenses.  Under this arrangement,  an individual applying for a business license from the state is required to  be in compliance with federal tax obligations, state tax obligations, or both  before the state issues a business license. Some state tax and IRS officials  believe this type of data sharing has the potential to benefit both IRS and  state governments since the businesses would need to initiate contact with  IRS or state revenue agencies to demonstrate compliance. If the  businesses cannot demonstrate compliance, they are then required to  come into compliance to qualify for a business license.", "The Department of the Treasury\u2019s 2006 Comprehensive Strategy for  Reducing the Tax Gap recognizes the potential benefits of increased  coordination with state governments to improve compliance and reduce  the tax gap. It envisions improved document-matching programs and  federal-state partnerships as a means to reduce the tax gap. In fact, we  found that federal and state partnerships that involve reciprocal  agreements covering collection of unpaid tax debts benefited both  governments, and the use of levies and offsets showed even greater  potential for collecting millions in unpaid debts. In fiscal year 2004, for  example, although most states submit only personal income tax debt and  not business income tax debt to the Financial Management Service (FMS)  for collection, FMS still collected over $217 million on behalf of various  states through offsets of federal income tax refunds to pay state income  tax debt. Conversely, IRS received over $77 million from states\u2019 levy of  state income tax refunds to pay delinquent federal taxes.", "You have raised questions about whether IRS is fully using data from state  and local governments to reduce the tax gap. Related to this interest, and  at your request, we issued a report in November 2008 on the State Reverse  File Match Initiative (SRFMI) pilot program, which matches federal and  state taxpayer data to identify noncompliant federal taxpayers. You also  requested that we assess a data-sharing arrangement between IRS and the  California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards  Enforcement (DLSE). Under this arrangement, applicants for California  business licenses in three industries\u2014farm labor contracting, garment  manufacturing, and car washing and polishing\u2014must be in compliance  with federal employment tax obligations to qualify. You asked us to  analyze (1) the extent to which requiring a demonstration of federal tax  compliance to qualify for a state business license has the potential to  improve federal tax compliance and (2) what opportunities exist for  increasing arrangements that require federal tax compliance to qualify for  state business licensing.", "To determine the extent to which requiring a demonstration of federal tax  compliance to qualify for a state business license has the potential to  improve federal tax compliance, we used the IRS and State of California  data-sharing arrangement as a case study. To determine the potential for  improving federal tax compliance, we estimated the return on investment  (ROI) for the IRS Ogden/California DLSE data-sharing arrangement by  determining the amount collected and estimating the cost of operating the  arrangement. To determine the amount collected, we used IRS Ogden  spreadsheets that record the number of federal tax returns filed by  business license applicants and the amount IRS collected from businesses  that IRS informed that they were not in compliance with federal  employment taxes covering calendar year 2006 and 8 months in calendar  year 2007. To determine the cost of operating this data-sharing  arrangement, we estimated the costs of collecting the amounts owed by  noncompliant businesses using actual cost categories provided by IRS  Ogden officials. We then compared the ROI ratio for this data-sharing  arrangement to IRS\u2019s estimates for five revenue-producing enforcement  initiatives in the IRS fiscal year 2009 budget submission. To determine  whether California businesses remained in compliance over time, we  matched data on California business applicants from an Access database  maintained by IRS Ogden with taxpayers in IRS\u2019s Unpaid Assessments  file. We used California business applicants for calendar year 2006 only  from the Access database and taxpayers in IRS\u2019s Unpaid Assessments file  as of the week of September 18, 2006, and the week of August 18, 2008. We  reviewed agency agreements and memoranda, regulations, and reports  covering the data-sharing arrangement and interviewed IRS and California  officials about the compliance value of the arrangement. The Access  database did not contain data prior to calendar year 2006 because IRS  Ogden purged these historical data. While data from previous years would  be useful for evaluating the data-sharing arrangement, we believe that the  Ogden records that were available to us were sufficiently reliable for  developing an understanding of the arrangement. We did not verify the  accuracy of the data IRS provided or its estimate of the revenue costs of  its five new activities, including the estimated ROI of these activities.", "To determine what opportunities exist for increasing data sharing that  requires federal business tax compliance to qualify for state business  licensing, we contacted state revenue officials in 50 states and the District  of Columbia via e-mail about the extent to which their states engage in  data-sharing arrangements that require applicants to be tax compliant to  qualify for business licenses, reviewed and identified IRS documentation  on data-sharing arrangements between IRS and state agencies that require  federal tax compliance to qualify for state business licensing, and  interviewed state revenue officials whose states engage in data-sharing  arrangements that require businesses to demonstrate federal tax  compliance to qualify for state business licenses.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 through June 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In a small portion of IRS\u2019s federal-state data-sharing  arrangements, states require federal tax compliance to qualify for a state  business license. In some instances, state licensing agencies require  compliance with both federal and state tax obligations, and requirements  can vary among states. These arrangements can vary by industry; by type  of taxes required for compliance, such as employment taxes or income  taxes; and even by the type of documentation required to prove  compliance. For example, in some states the businesses may self-certify  that they are in compliance with taxes, and in others businesses must  provide documentation from IRS or the state revenue agency that they are  in compliance with tax requirements.", "IRS and California\u2019s DLSE are engaged in an arrangement that requires  compliance with federal employment taxes to operate a business in any  one of three industries in California. An individual applying for a new  business license or a renewal of his/her business license to operate a farm  labor contracting, garment manufacturing, or car washing and polishing  business must first prove full compliance with federal employment taxes  by filing all required federal employment tax returns and resolving all  outstanding federal employment taxes through full payment or appeal.  Each business license applicant in the three industries requiring federal  tax compliance must submit a state business license application and a  signed IRS Form 8821, Tax Information Authorization, allowing IRS to  disclose the applicant\u2019s tax information to DLSE. IRS tax examiners in  Ogden, Utah, review the tax information in IRS\u2019s Integrated Data Retrieval  System (IDRS) to check the employment tax status of the applicant. If  the applicant is compliant, IRS provides DLSE and the applicant with a  statement that the applicant has met all filing and payment requirements.  If the applicant has an outstanding employment tax liability, has not filed a  federal employment tax return, or both, the tax examiner prompts the  system to generate a noncompliance letter, which is sent to the applicant.  Applicants with outstanding tax liability can pay the amounts due or  contact the IRS tax examiners for more information or to make  arrangements for payment. IRS officials told us that IRS Ogden does not  collect employment taxes from business applicants directly. Noncompliant  business applicants may pay federal employment taxes they owe at local  IRS offices or mail their payments to IRS. Ogden officials are notified by e- mail or phone when business applicants have paid the employment taxes  identified in the noncompliance letter. IRS informs DLSE that an applicant  has paid all employment taxes, is currently working with a revenue officer  to pay all balances due, or is otherwise compliant. After notification, DLSE  will issue the applicant\u2019s business license.", "DLSE officials told us that for purposes of business licensing, California  business applicants in the three industries have resolved their taxes if they  have (1) paid their tax liability, (2) entered into installment agreements, or  (3) completed offers in compromise with IRS. If an applicant\u2019s tax case is  in bankruptcy, California\u2019s DLSE makes the decision on whether to issue  the business license. If an applicant does not resolve his/her tax liability  within 90 days of applying, IRS staff in Ogden send the cases to the IRS  Agricultural Team in Fresno, where tax examiners open the case and do  investigative work on collecting the balance due. See figure 1 on how data  sharing between IRS and California operates.", "Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) prohibits the disclosure  of tax returns and return information by IRS employees; other federal  employees, state employees, or both; and certain others having access to  the information except in specifically enumerated circumstances. Data  sharing between IRS and California DLSE is authorized by a subsection of  I.R.C. \u00a7 6103. Specifically, section 6103(c) authorizes IRS to disclose the  return information of a taxpayer to any other person at the taxpayer\u2019s  request.

According to IRS officials, this type of data-sharing  arrangement has mutual benefits for IRS, by increasing filing and payment  compliance with federal employment taxes, and for states, by minimizing  concerns about the success of the business and its compliance with  unemployment requirements. IRS officials noted that growth in this data- sharing arrangement can generate many compliance benefits with a  relatively minimal resource allocation. According to a California DLSE  official, this data-sharing arrangement is beneficial because it helps to  ensure that businesses are competent and responsible and pay their taxes.", "The amount of revenue in federal employment taxes collected through this  data-sharing arrangement appears to outweigh the cost of operating the  data-sharing arrangement. Thousands of California businesses apply for a  business license each year in order to operate a business in the three  industries previously mentioned, and must provide documentation to  DLSE to show that they are in compliance with federal employment taxes.  Many of these businesses were not in compliance with employment taxes  during the time of our analysis and, therefore, had to file tax returns or pay  employment taxes to rectify their compliance status. According to the IRS  Ogden database on business applicants, 7,194 businesses applied for a  business license in the three industries one or more times from calendar  years 2006 through 2008 and requested that IRS provide California with  information on their compliance with federal employment taxes. About 24  percent of businesses (i.e., 1,726 of the 7,194 that applied) had to file  employment tax returns or pay or otherwise resolve overdue taxes to  come into compliance with federal employment taxes.", "IRS staff in Ogden use spreadsheets to track the number of federal tax  returns filed by noncompliant California business license applicants and  the amounts IRS collected from these businesses that are attributable to  the data-sharing arrangement. The spreadsheets show that businesses not  in compliance with federal employment taxes when they applied for  California business licenses filed hundreds of tax returns in calendar years  2006 and 2007 and IRS collected millions in federal employment taxes.  California businesses filed 441 employment tax returns to come into  compliance to qualify for California business licenses and IRS collected  nearly $7.4 million in employment taxes, according to IRS Ogden  spreadsheets. IRS Ogden officials told us that the nearly $7.4 million in  employment taxes collected represents the amount business applicants  paid after receiving noncompliance letters related to their DLSE business  license applications. Table 1 shows the number of tax returns filed and the  amount IRS collected from these applicants during calendar years 2006  and 2007.", "Even though IRS did not track all of the costs it incurred for operating the  data-sharing arrangement, IRS officials noted that the arrangement  resulted in high revenues relative to costs. In order to get some  perspective on how this data-sharing arrangement compares with other  IRS enforcement efforts, we developed an estimate of the costs of the  arrangement using cost categories provided and confirmed by IRS  officials. The cost categories we considered included personnel costs and  nonpersonnel costs, such as computers, telephones, and fax machines.", "We estimated that IRS incurred about $331,348 to operate the data-sharing  arrangement in calendar years 2006 and 2007. Our cost estimate included  personnel costs of about $202,125 in pay and about $61,042 in benefits for  one General Schedule (GS) 5 clerk and two GS 7 tax examiners. We also  included about $10,197 for three computers, $1,237 for one dedicated  printer, $313 for one fax machine with a dedicated line and two dedicated  phone lines with voice mail boxes, and approximately $56,435 for supplies,  facilities, utilities, and supervision. These costs may be somewhat  overstated because, for instance, we used approximate purchase costs for  equipment and did not spread those costs over the useful life of the  equipment or other uses of the equipment.", "Using our estimate, the ROI for this data-sharing arrangement is 22:1.

The  arrangement may help flag unpaid tax assessments when they are recent  and have a greater likelihood of collection. Our previous work found that  the age of the unpaid assessment is an indicator of the extent to which the  outstanding amounts owed are likely to be collected. This work showed  that the older an unpaid assessment the lower the probability it will be  paid. In another report, we found that the IRS records we examined  showed that 70 percent of all unpaid payroll taxes\u2014estimated at $58  billion as of September 30, 2007\u2014were owed by businesses with more  than a year (4 tax quarters) of unpaid federal payroll taxes. Over a quarter  of unpaid federal payroll taxes were owed by businesses that accumulated  tax debt for more than 3 years (12 tax quarters). One reason why older  debts may not be collected is that they lead to large and increasing  amounts of accrued interest and penalties. The requirement that annual  business license renewals depend on resolving unpaid employment tax  assessments may help businesses avoid the pyramiding of interest and  penalties.", "The ROI for these enforcement activities can vary depending on factors  such as the efficiency of operating the data-sharing arrangements and  whether the data-sharing arrangements experience higher collections in  the early years of operation. For example, an IRS official suggested that  there may be a way to more efficiently operate this type of data-sharing  arrangement and thereby obtain a higher ROI. Applying an automated  filter to isolate business applicants with no taxes due, IRS staff would only  need to manually review data on businesses with balances due or that  have not filed required returns, and fewer IRS staff may be needed to  operate the data-sharing arrangement. An IRS official in Ogden told us that  the taxes collected by the IRS Ogden/California DLSE data-sharing  arrangement about 10 years ago were substantially higher because there  was very little compliance when the data-sharing arrangement first started.  This official recalled that when the program was transferred to Ogden the  numbers of noncompliant applicants were at least three or four times  higher than they are now.

For example, it could evaluate whether  IRS had taken other enforcement actions against the California businesses  at the same time as they were applying for licenses. If IRS had sent  collection notices to the businesses or taken other enforcement action at  or close to the time the businesses went through the licensing reviews, the  resolution of their debts might be attributable to those enforcement  actions.

A more complete evaluation could take into  account the resolution of debts that may have been incurred before a  business applied for a license.

According to the Small Business Administration,  business licensing requirements vary from state to state. For example, a  state \u201cbusiness license\u201d is the main document required for tax purposes  and conducting other basic business functions. However, some states have  separate licensing requirements based on the product sold, such as  licenses to sell liquor, lottery tickets, gasoline, or firearms. Ultimately, it is  up to each state to determine what industries, occupations, and  professions must be licensed and the licensure requirements that  applicants must meet.", "Some states and some business types may represent more of an immediate  opportunity for establishing arrangements that require federal tax  compliance to qualify for state business licenses. States that currently  require compliance with state taxes for selected business license  applicants may be more amenable to requiring federal tax compliance than  states that do not even require state tax compliance since they already  recognize tax compliance as important for the businesses. For example,  North Carolina, Texas, and Missouri have a requirement for tax  compliance with state taxes for retail sales businesses. These states do not  require compliance with federal taxes. In addition, states that currently  require compliance with federal employment taxes may be amenable to  extending the requirement to include federal income taxes. For example,  California\u2019s DLSE requires applicants for the three industries requiring  licensing to be compliant with federal employment taxes only. California\u2019s  garment manufacturing, farm labor contracting, and car washing and  polishing license applicants have no requirement to be in compliance with  federal income taxes to qualify for business licenses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Increasing data sharing between IRS and state governments to help reduce  the tax gap can be beneficial to IRS when such data-sharing arrangements  demonstrate firm compliance value.

Our estimated ROI of the data-sharing arrangement between IRS Ogden  and California DLSE suggests that requiring tax compliance to qualify for  state business licenses can be a cost-effective way of collecting tax debt.  In fact, the data-sharing arrangement\u2019s estimated ROI is higher than the  estimated ROI for the new direct revenue\u2013producing tax enforcement  initiatives in IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget submission.

This report focuses on  data-sharing arrangements that require compliance with federal or state  tax obligations to qualify for state business licensing. We did not include  licensing requirements at the local level or licensing for professions or  occupations.", "To provide background on data-sharing arrangements that require  compliance with tax obligations to qualify for state business licensing, we  reviewed relevant Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and California  Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards  Enforcement (DLSE) documents and interviewed IRS and California  officials. We also reviewed laws and regulations related to taxpayer  disclosure.", "To determine the extent to which requiring a demonstration of federal tax  compliance to qualify for a state business license has the potential to  improve federal tax compliance, we used the IRS and State of California  data-sharing arrangement as a case study. To determine the potential for  improving federal tax compliance, we estimated the return on investment  (ROI) for the IRS Ogden/California DLSE data-sharing arrangement. To  determine the amount collected, we used IRS Ogden/California DLSE  spreadsheets that record the number of federal tax returns filed by  applicants for business licenses in the three industries and the amount IRS  collected from businesses that were notified by IRS that they were not in  compliance with federal employment taxes covering calendar year 2006  and 8 months in calendar year 2007. Spreadsheet data for calendar year  2007 excluded 4 months. Ogden misplaced data for July and August, and  data for November and December were not available when we obtained  the data in November 2007. We also reviewed agency agreements and  memoranda, regulations, and reports covering the data-sharing  arrangement between IRS and California DLSE and interviewed IRS and  California officials about the value of the data-sharing arrangement to IRS  and the state.", "To determine the cost of operating this data-sharing arrangement, we  estimated the costs of collecting the amounts owed by noncompliant  businesses using actual cost categories provided by IRS Ogden officials.  We used the guidance for preparing agency budgets in Executive Office of  the President, Office of Management and Budget, Circular A-11,  Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, and our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and  Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP (Washington, D.C.: March  2009). We estimated personnel costs using the Office of Personnel  Management Salary Table 2009-RUS, for the locality pay area \u201cof rest of  U.S.,\u201d effective January 2009, for General Schedule (GS) 5 and 7 personnel  at step 5. We used step 5 to capture the midpoint of the GS 5 and 7 grade  levels so as not to bias pay in the direction of a low or high estimate. We  estimated the cost of benefits for these employees using the Department  of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics 30.2 percent average compensation  cost for calendar year 2008. We estimated the cost of fax machines and  printers by averaging the costs for these items as shown on the Web sites  for federal government customers of two leading manufacturers of these  products. We shared our estimates with IRS officials to obtain  concurrence with our estimates of nonpersonnel costs. We did not analyze  the taxes IRS may collect or the costs it may incur after the noncompliant  cases leave Ogden. We then compared the ROI ratio for this data-sharing  arrangement to IRS\u2019s estimates for five revenue-producing enforcement  initiatives in the IRS fiscal year 2009 budget submission. The Ogden  Service Center sends information on the taxpayers that have unpaid  assessments 90 days after Ogden first receives their application materials  to the Fresno Service Center for collection.", "To determine whether California businesses remained in compliance over  time, we matched data on California business applicants from an Access  database maintained by IRS Ogden with taxpayers in IRS\u2019s Business  Master File Unpaid Assessments file. We selected the businesses that  according to the Access database, applied for California DLSE business  licenses in calendar year 2006 only\u2014that is, applied in calendar year 2006  and did not reapply in calendar year 2007 or in the 10 months in 2008 for  which we have IRS Ogden DLSE Access database data. The Access  database contained January 2006 through October 2007 data on business  license applicants in the three covered industries. For our analysis, we  matched records of the California businesses that we selected from the  Access database because they applied in calendar year 2006 only with  IRS\u2019s Unpaid Assessments file as of the weeks of September 18, 2006, and  August 18, 2008; identified the number of businesses with unpaid  assessments and the amounts of their tax debt as of the week of  September 18, 2006; and identified the applicants for business licenses in  2006 only that had resolved their unpaid assessments as of August 18,  2008, and the amounts of their tax debt they resolved. Our analysis  compares unpaid assessments at two points in time since the data file we  used did not allow us to track weekly changes in the businesses\u2019 unpaid  assessments. We could not follow the tax compliance of earlier applicants  into the present because IRS Ogden purged data from the Access database  for calendar years earlier than 2006. Unpaid assessments in this report  include the total tax assessment plus interest and penalties where these  exist.", "To determine what opportunities exist for increasing data sharing for  arrangements that require federal tax compliance to qualify for state  business licensing, we (1) analyzed and summarized which states and the  District of Columbia have data-sharing arrangements that require state tax  compliance to qualify for state business licensing, which states do not  have such arrangements, and which states do not require businesses to  obtain business licenses on the state level; (2) contacted revenue officials  in 50 states and the District of Columbia via e-mail with structured  questions about the extent to which their states engage in data-sharing  arrangements that require demonstration of tax compliance before  business licenses are granted; and (3) sent a follow-up e-mail to 21 state  revenue officials who confirmed that their states require applicants to be  compliant with state taxes to qualify for business licenses, by requesting  information on the amount of taxes collected, the costs associated with  operating the data-sharing arrangements, and benefits of these data- sharing relationships to the states. Three states did not respond to our  structured questions about the extent to which their states engage in data- sharing arrangements that require demonstration of tax compliance before  businesses qualify for business licenses. We also (1) summarized IRS  information on existing data-sharing arrangements between IRS and state  agencies that require compliance with federal taxes to qualify for state  business licensing, (2) interviewed IRS officials to determine which states  have state licensing requiring federal tax compliance, and (3) reviewed IRS  documentation on data-sharing arrangements between IRS and state  agencies that require businesses to demonstrate federal tax compliance to  qualify for state business licensing.", "Our review was subject to some limitations. We did not verify the accuracy  of the data IRS provided or its estimate of the revenues and costs of its  five new enforcement activities, including the estimated ROI of these  activities. IRS Ogden\u2019s Access database on California business applicants  did not contain data prior to calendar year 2006 because IRS Ogden  purged these historical data. While data from previous years would be  useful for evaluating the data-sharing arrangement, we believe that the  Ogden records that were available were sufficient to attain an  understanding of the potential value of this arrangement as a compliance  tool. The IRS Ogden spreadsheet used to track the number of federal tax  returns filed by noncompliant California business license applicants and  the amount IRS collected from these businesses attributable to the data- sharing arrangement did not contain data for the months of July, August,  November, and December 2007. We acknowledge that data for the entire  calendar year of 2007 would affect the number of tax returns filed and the  amount IRS collected from applicants during those months. Our estimate  of the cost of IRS and California\u2019s data-sharing arrangement may be  somewhat overstated because, for instance, we used approximate  purchase costs for equipment and did not spread those costs over the  useful life of the equipment or other uses of the equipment and used  calendar year 2009 costs. Additionally, our analysis did not address some  other potential factors that could reduce, or increase, the ROI we  calculated. We did not verify the responses from the states about tax  compliance to qualify for state business licenses. We recognize that the  state revenue officials may not be knowledgeable about all of their states\u2019  requirements for tax compliance to qualify for business licenses, but they  are a credible source of information about state tax compliance to qualify  for state business licenses.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 through June 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
