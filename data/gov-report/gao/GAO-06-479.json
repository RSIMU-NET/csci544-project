For example, State's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs provides support to posts in its region through staff based in Florida. State announced in October 2005 it would identify and remove additional functions that do not need to be performed at post and could instead be performed domestically or at regional centers overseas. State faces several challenges in trying to expand its use of remote support. For example, restrictions on what management functions non-American staff can perform might limit the extent to which services can be provided remotely. In addition, current funding arrangements for various regional bureaus and posts might limit opportunities for remote support to be offered from one region to another, while posts' reluctance to change is a further constraint. State is assessing whether certain regulations could be waived or changed and how institutional challenges might be overcome. There are several potential advantages to providing administrative support to posts from remote locations, and several concerns. For example, one U.S.-based officer provides financial management support to multiple overseas posts, eliminating the need for an American financial management officer at each post served, which, according to State, could result in cost savings. Officials at posts we visited reported they were generally satisfied with the level of support and customer service at a regional or domestic service center, though some noted concerns. However, at the time of our review, State had neither analyzed the potential cost savings associated with providing remote support nor systematically assessed the quality of support provided.

The White House, Congress,  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and GAO have emphasized  rightsizing as vital to ensuring that the overseas presence is at an optimal  and efficient level to carry out foreign policy objectives. GAO\u2019s rightsizing  framework, which has been adopted by OMB and State, consists of three  factors\u2014mission, security, and cost\u2014that should be weighed when making  rightsizing decisions. In addition, the President\u2019s Management Agenda  (PMA) has identified rightsizing as one of the administration\u2019s priorities.  One way to provide efficient administrative support to overseas posts is by  consolidating and centralizing service delivery within a geographic area  through regional service centers located overseas and within the United  States. Two objectives of regional service centers, which address the three  factors of the rightsizing framework, are to improve administrative support  to overseas posts (mission) and to reduce staffing overseas whenever  possible (cost and security).", "Within the State Department a number of bureaus and offices are  responsible for the administration and oversight of regional operations  overseas. The Under Secretary for Management is responsible for  implementing the PMA initiatives and, in particular, working with the White  House and OMB on the initiative focused on rightsizing the U.S.  government\u2019s overseas presence. The congressionally mandated Office of  Rightsizing leads State\u2019s efforts to develop mechanisms to better  coordinate, rationalize, and manage the deployment of U.S. government  personnel overseas. In addition, the Office of Global Support Services and  Innovation in the Bureau of Administration coordinates State\u2019s efforts to  improve the delivery of support services to all overseas posts.

At the post level, the management  section, which is normally headed by a management counselor or  management officer, is responsible for carrying out the administrative  functions at a post. The typical management section of an embassy consists  of several U.S. Foreign Service officers who are in charge of financial  management, human resources, information management, and general  services. They are assisted by locally employed staff who serve as voucher  examiners, cashiers, and financial and personnel assistants and specialists.  Smaller posts have not historically had full management sections with  trained, experienced U.S. citizen officers filling each of the management  positions, such as a financial management officer or human resources  officer.

The posts that receive remote support in these functions do  not have a full-time, American financial management officer or human  resources officer; rather, the U.S. post management officer at these  posts serves multiple roles and spends a certain percentage of his or  her time on various management activities, including the certification of  vouchers and some personnel functions, with assistance from locally  employed staff. However, the management officers might not be able to  provide enough personnel or financial support due to their lack of  experience or training in the function as well as time constraints,  according to officials at the posts we visited. To compensate for these  limitations, a regional human resources or financial management  officer, based in Fort Lauderdale, visits each post for which he or she is  responsible on an agreed schedule that is outlined in a memorandum of  agreement between the post and the Florida center. For example, during  a typical visit, a regional human resources officer ensures that the post  is in compliance with local labor laws and regulations, evaluates post  personnel operations and practices, addresses employee morale issues,  conducts salary and benefits surveys, provides guidance on post training  needs, and performs a host of other higher level human resources  duties, as necessary. A regional financial management officer\u2019s  responsibilities include reviewing post management practices to  prevent waste, fraud, and mismanagement; conducting spot reviews of  vouchers, purchase orders, and petty cash transactions; and providing  assistance in post budget and financial plans. The Florida center also  has one regional information management officer involved in a pilot  program to provide support to two posts that do not have a permanent  information management officers assigned, as well as three information  management specialists and two office management specialists that  provide additional support to posts throughout the region, when  necessary.", "The Regional Support Center in Frankfurt, Germany, provides  management assistance in financial management and human resources  to about 40 posts throughout Europe and Eurasia; however, it does this  on a more consultative, as-needed basis than the Florida center. The  Frankfurt center\u2019s focus is to promote self-reliance in the full range of  financial and personnel activities at European and Eurasian posts. It  provides management oversight to posts and assists staff in developing  various managerial skills through oversight visits and training. Many of  the posts the center serves do not have full-time human resources  officers or financial management officers, and a number of them are  staffed by junior or first-tour management officers who need occasional  assistance or training in core management functions.

For example,  because Embassy Phnom Penh does not have a resident human resources  officer, the management staff at Embassy Bangkok provides support by  reviewing human resources operations and providing ad hoc advisory  assistance at least twice per year. In Mexico, the Embassy in Mexico City  provides financial management support to about nine consulates  throughout the country that do not have resident financial management  officers. In addition, the Bureau of African Affairs employs staff in Paris to  provide financial support to posts in Africa. Some posts have a support  agreement that outlines how many visits will be made and what functions  will be carried out under such partnering arrangements.", "Officials from the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs in Washington  said that posts in Asia use partnering because geographic distances and  language and cultural differences between posts in some areas make it  difficult to devise a regional service center that, like those in Frankfurt and  Fort Lauderdale, meets all posts needs.

For  example, an official of the Bureau of African Affairs told us that many posts  in Africa lack the technological capabilities to be able to utilize remote  support, which requires more processes to be done electronically. He  cautioned that certain posts would need to obtain better bandwidth  connectivity to handle online financial management transactions. In  addition, officials from the bureau did not believe that the three African  posts identified as critical danger posts would meet the strategy\u2019s March  2006 timeline to receive nonlocation-specific services remotely.

In fact, according to the Foreign Affairs Handbook  (FAH), direct-hire, locally employed staff members who meet certain  professional qualification criteria and have proven records of integrity and  consistent superior performance may be designated to certify vouchers as  Alternate Certifying Officers. Several officials at the Florida center said  that allowing such staff to certify with oversight from a regional officer  could remove the need for American officers at some posts.

State is exploring this issue through a pilot program at  Embassy Brussels to implement contracting authority for locally engaged  staff. If successful and expanded, the program could free up American  officers for essential operational and management controls activities, or  potentially eliminate some American positions at posts, according to  officials in Washington.

Another  example is the Bureau of African Affairs\u2019 employment of staff in Paris to  provide financial support to posts in Africa. The bureau believes these  employees are ideally suited for this work because of their financial  management expertise, their French-speaking skills that are necessary to  serve many African posts, and their access to transportation links to Africa.  We asked if these staff could also serve some North African posts, which  are even closer geographically to Paris and where French is also widely  spoken.

Officials told us that eliminating the need for American officers overseas  could result in cost savings after factoring in offsetting costs, such as costs  for travel and technology enhancements, to accommodate the change. For  example, each overseas position costs approximately $400,000, according  to an average computed by State\u2019s Bureau of Resource Management for  fiscal year 2007. This amount includes salary, benefits, and support costs  plus a number of costs that apply only to officials overseas, such as housing  allowances; educational allowances for their children; and additional pay,  such as danger pay, depending on which region of the world the officer is  located. It also includes costs for providing a secure building for the  officers to work in overseas. By assigning regional officers in the United  States, State could avoid such costs, which do not apply to personnel  stationed domestically.

To avoid the additional costs associated with posting a financial  management officer in Nassau, officials from the Bureau of Western  Hemisphere Affairs said the bureau instead assigned a regional officer from  the Florida Regional Center to assist the Nassau post management officer  who handles a variety of financial management responsibilities, such as  certifying vouchers. The total cost for the Florida-based regional officer  would be his salary and benefits plus travel costs of about $60,000,  according to the center\u2019s officials, which includes travel to Nassau and  three other posts also served by that officer.", "In addition to cost efficiencies, officials said the Florida Regional Center\u2019s  model of support would enhance security, while the quality of support  would not suffer from the change.

One management officer said that the  regional managers were highly experienced and competent in their  functional areas, which led to a high level of quality support.", "Officials at the Florida Regional Center added that, in cases where a  regional center is located within the United States, civil servants or retired  employees could also be used as a cost-effective way of providing remote  support, when feasible. Another potential advantage of assigning civil  service or retired employees to provide remote support would be  continuity, as they would not be required to transfer every 2 to 3 years as  foreign service officers do."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Support from an Overseas Regional Center", "paragraphs": ["According to officials in Washington and overseas, potential advantages  also could arise from providing support remotely from a regional service  center overseas. For example, approximately 20 posts in Europe and  Eurasia have requests in their Mission Performance Plans for an  American financial management officer at post, according to the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Global Financial Services. To eventually avoid  assigning such new staff to posts overseas, State is piloting a project to  determine whether it can remotely certify vouchers in Frankfurt by using  scanned rather than original documents. Center officials said that there  would be a savings in cost and space and gains in security at those posts  where this concept of remote certification removes the need for an  American financial management officer position overseas. For example,  while some posts in Europe and Eurasia do not have facilities that meet  security standards, the Regional Support Center in Frankfurt is located in a  safe facility that meets security standards, including 100-foot setback  between office facilities and uncontrolled areas, and controlled access at  the perimeter of the compound. Also, officials said that posts could receive  highly skilled and experienced financial oversight from the center. Officials  acknowledged that it is costly to operate from the Frankfurt facility  because of local wage rates and the cost of living allowance for U.S. staff.  However, they believe that high operating costs would likely be outweighed  by a combination of factors, including the potential efficiencies achieved at  posts served by the regional facility and the eventual reduction in staff  needed at posts overseas due to the remote support offered from  Frankfurt. However, center officials said they had not performed cost  analyses to demonstrate if servicing posts from Frankfurt was cost  effective, and they agree that such analysis would be useful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Support Using Non- American Staff Rather than Americans", "paragraphs": ["State officials told us that using non-American staff to provide remote  support offers several advantages. For example, State uses these staff in  the Foreign Service National Executive Corps and Paris Rovers Programs.", "The Foreign Service National Executive Corps, one method of providing  remote support, is used by the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs  to leverage in-house resources to benefit smaller missions throughout  the world, according to officials at the Frankfurt center. Corps members  are locally employed staff, from a variety of posts throughout the  various regional bureaus, who are highly experienced in various  administrative functions and can assist, train, and mentor staff at posts  in areas such as facilities maintenance, financial management, general  services (such as procurement), human resources, and information  management. State officials told us that, by using the corps members to  provide remote support, State has avoided the assignment of additional  American officers overseas.", "The Paris Rovers Program, another means of providing remote support  by using non-American staff, is cost-efficient and effective, according to  officials from the Bureau of African Affairs. The program operates with  six locally employed staff\u2014five of whom are based in Paris\u2014serving as  financial management experts for about 44 posts in Africa, many of  which either have first-tour financial management officers or no full- time American financial management officers. The rovers are experts in  post budget needs and cashier problems and spend much of their time  providing on-the-job training to staff at posts, as well as occasionally  filling post staffing gaps. According to bureau officials, by educating  first-tour officers in the use and management of appropriated funds and  reviewing financial management reports, the Paris rovers provide  needed financial management internal control oversight, which likely  reduces financial losses to the bureau.", "In addition, bureau officials said they are committed to not sending an  American to post when there is no need to do so, due to the security risk  levels of many posts in Africa. Recently, several posts in Africa, including  Bangui in the Central African Republic, have requested American financial  management officers, according to an official from the Bureau for African  Affairs. To avoid hiring a financial management officer for Bangui, the  bureau added Embassy Bangui to the Paris Rovers Program.", "Although the bureau has not determined the full potential of the program,  its initial data demonstrate that the operation is cost-effective. According  to bureau officials, the total cost of the six employee rover program in 2005  was about $934,000, including employee salaries and travel costs. The  Bureau of African Affairs prepared an estimate, at our request, of what it  would cost to provide financial services without the Paris-based rover  operation. The bureau estimated that it would have to spend over one  million dollars to fund three additional U.S. officer positions and three part- time employees, slightly more than the cost of the Paris operation. Officials  agreed that a more detailed cost analysis could demonstrate if the program  is clearly cost-effective and therefore should be expanded to cover  additional posts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Addition to Advantages of Remote Support, Several Concerns Exist", "paragraphs": ["Despite overall satisfaction with regional support, management officers  and locally employed staff at the posts we visited mentioned a few issues of  concern relating to the quality of remote support, including timeliness and  the distribution of assistance. One management officer said that it once  took 4 weeks for his regional financial management officer to respond to  him on a certain issue, by which time the issue was no longer relevant.  Another management officer agreed that posts are subject to regional  officers\u2019 availability, and when an officer is not at a post, an issue may take  too long to resolve. Officials at regional centers told us that the quality of  partnering support was not as good as the service provided by a regional  center. One management officer told us that an officer with regional  responsibilities who is located at a post will likely prioritize the home post\u2019s  issues over the needs of other supported posts. In addition, State\u2019s recent  IG inspections found substandard regional support at smaller posts in  Africa where partnering is used, and often recommended updating the  memorandum of understanding to delineate regional support  expectations. However, at the time of our review, State did not have  performance data for remote support. An official from the Bureau of  European and Eurasian Affairs told us that, absent performance measures  and feedback tools to ensure costumer satisfaction, accountability, and  adequate internal controls, customer service could decrease when a  service provider is located outside of the post.", "In addition, an official from the Global Financial Services Center in  Charleston and other officials overseas reported concerns that fewer on- the-ground American management staff could increase internal control  vulnerabilities. For example, some officials believe that there needs to be  an American financial management officer at every overseas post to  prevent fraud, waste, and mismanagement of funds. According to GAO\u2019s  Internal Control Management Evaluation Tool, government agencies  should formulate an approach for risk management and decide upon the  internal control activities required to mitigate risks that could impede the  efficient and effective achievement of objectives. The approach should be  modified to fit the circumstances, conditions, and risks relevant to the  situation of each agency and should also consider the type of mission being  performed and the cost/benefit aspect of a particular control item. In this  example, State would weigh the potential internal control risks of allowing  non-American staff to certify vouchers and carry out other financial  management activities against the costs of having an American at every  post to carry out such functions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost Analyses and Performance Measures Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, State had not conducted analyses of the costs  associated with providing administrative support at posts versus providing  it remotely.

For example, the Deputy Director of the Florida Regional  Center told us that there had been no analysis on how much money has  been saved by serving posts from the Florida center rather than having  management officials at the posts, and he said that such a study would be  useful, not only for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, but also for  other regional bureaus when they consider using regional centers to  provide remote support.", "Cost analyses were not incorporated into State\u2019s 2006 operational plan for  rightsizing.

Such cost components would include the  various direct and other personnel and support costs associated with  providing support at a post. It would weigh these costs against costs  required to facilitate remote support, such as travel expenses; costs for  technology enhancements, such as improved bandwidth connectivity; costs  for new or expanded facilities and other related expenses to accommodate  increased staff at existing or new regional centers; costs for changes in  local staffing or staffing in the United States; and other costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures and Feedback Mechanisms Needed", "paragraphs": ["The concerns with remote support described earlier\u2014particularly relating  to quality of services\u2014underscore what officials indicated at both regional  centers and all four serviced posts that we visited, which is, that  performance measures and customer feedback processes would be useful  and beneficial in rating the current level of customer support and  oversight. Officials also said that performance measures and customer  feedback processes would be essential for making decisions about  expanding remote support. Officials from State\u2019s Office of Rightsizing said  that, before agreeing to any change, posts would first want proof that  remote support provides the same level of customer service as support  provided at posts. For example, the Executive Director of the Bureau of  Near Eastern Affairs said that the bureau would be willing to use remote  support from regional centers, such as the Regional Support Center in  Frankfurt, if the cost was reasonable and the quality and reliability of  service was demonstrated to be high. He said that, to convince decision- makers about the quality of remote support, all regional centers need to  have standards of performance with metrics and data to demonstrate that  offering services regionally or centrally, rather than at individual posts,  results in adequate service and internal controls. An official from the  Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs said one performance metric  could be the amount of time it takes for a voucher to be processed. One  post management officer suggested that a performance measure, such as a  required weekly telephone call to a serviced post by the regional officer,  would be another way support could potentially be improved from the  Florida center.", "State has recognized the need for performance measures and customer  feedback mechanisms in its operational plan, but has not yet developed  them. However, during our review, one regional bureau developed a  customer service survey. Six months after our visit in June 2005, the Florida  Regional Center sent customer satisfaction surveys to the posts it provides  with regional financial management and human resources support. The  survey asked management officers at posts to note the frequency and  duration of visits by a regional officer to a post, as well as the frequency of  communication between the officer and posts, and to rate the level of  guidance and supervision provided by the officer to the local staff.

For  example, management officers stationed in Asia and Africa said they lack  information on what types of support could be provided remotely and how  to access that support. Some officials indicated that it would be helpful for  them to know the full extent of remote support available, and whether it  results in cost efficiencies and effective service, in order to make an  informed decision about whether to utilize it.", "In addition, we found that regional centers were not always fully  communicating the types of services and support available to posts, either  within their region or across regional bureaus. The Executive Director of  the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs said he would consider using regional  support from Frankfurt if he knew the full range of services that were  offered there, the quality of customer service, and the potential costs of  services.

To assess regional support provided from  the United States to overseas posts, we met with senior management and  regional staff at the Florida Regional Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,  and the Global Financial Services Center in Charleston, South Carolina. We  also met with senior management, regional staff, and locally employed staff  at the overseas Regional Support Center in Frankfurt, Germany, to review  remote support provided from an overseas regional service center. We  focused our efforts on evaluating the various ways in which financial and  personnel support are provided by the various regional bureaus. We did not  perform an evaluative audit of the regional support provided by functional  bureaus, consular affairs, or the Model for Overseas Management initiative  because those operations either have been recently inspected by the Office  of the Inspector General or did not fit into the scope of our work.", "To assess some of the regulatory challenges that State faces in expanding  regional support, we reviewed foreign affairs regulations for carrying out  administrative functions overseas. This included a review of regulations on  what functions locally employed staff can carry out in the areas of  procurement and payments. We also reviewed the regulations pertaining to  the use of original documentation in processing payments and State\u2019s  proposal to waive that regulation.", "To identify the potential advantages of providing support remotely, we met  with ambassadors, deputy chiefs of mission, management officers, and  other U.S. embassy staff, including locally employed staff at various posts  that receive remote support from either the Florida Regional Center or the  Frankfurt Regional Support Center.

We chose Valetta, Malta, because it is a small post support by the  Frankfurt center, and it recently conducted a rightsizing review, which  addressed remote support issues. We chose Helsinki, Finland, because it  represents a medium-sized post supported by the Frankfurt center and  because it was originally the post chosen for the pilot project to certify  vouchers remotely, according to officials in the Bureau of European and  Eurasian Affairs. We also visited Mexico City to talk to embassy officials  about how the U.S. mission to Mexico has been rightsized and how the  embassy provides support to consulates throughout the country.
