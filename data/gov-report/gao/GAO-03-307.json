These challenges range from the fiscal imbalance in national pension systems caused by fewer workers having to provide benefits for greater numbers of retirees, to potential economic strains due to shortages of skilled workers. Part of the solution to these challenges could be greater older worker labor force participation. GAO identified three nations--Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom--that had displayed high levels of older worker labor force participation in the past and were now implementing policy reforms that continued to emphasize the importance of older workers. The experiences of these nations suggest that the nature of the reforms, the public availability and transparency of information on the reforms, and the strength of the national economy play key roles in extending older worker labor force participation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The retirement policy reforms in Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are expected to lead to higher labor force participation of older workers. Japan is facing the most severe aging trend of the nations GAO studied, as its median population age is projected to be 28 percent higher than the United States in the coming decades. In response, Japan has enacted substantial benefit cuts to its national pension system by raising the eligibility age and reducing benefit levels to maintain fund solvency. Due to these changes, some Japanese workers will have to work to later ages. Sweden undertook the most significant reform by changing the structure of its national pension system from a traditional pay-as-you-go defined benefit plan, like the U.S. Social Security program, to a system where participants' benefits are more in line with their contributions. These reforms are expected to extend workers' careers by rewarding longer labor force participation with higher benefits. The system also incorporates flexibility by automatically adjusting benefits to changes in the economy and life expectancy to preserve financial stability. The United Kingdom will phase-in an increase in the women's national pension eligibility age so that it will be equal to the higher male age of 65. It also revised its benefit formula to raise the annual incremental increase for those who defer drawing their pension benefits. These changes either reward continued employment or discourage earlier retirement, and thus may promote continued labor force participation. However, although incentives to work to later ages have been created through reforms to their national and employer provided pension systems, officials from each nation stressed that these policy changes must be accompanied by labor market reforms and economic growth to provide job opportunities to older workers if they are to be effective."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As is the case in developed nations around the world, the aging of the U.S.  population will pose challenges to our national economy and retirement  income programs.

Most of these organizations  believe that greater labor force participation by older workers can be part  of the solution to mitigate the adverse effects of aging populations.", "In light of the economic and labor force challenges posed by an aging  population, you asked us to draw upon the experience of other high- income industrialized nations in examining the following questions: (1)  How does the United States compare with other high-income nations with  regard to recent and projected trends in key demographic and labor force  characteristics? (2) How are recently enacted retirement policy reforms in  high-income nations expected to affect the labor force participation rate of  older workers? (3) What did these nations learn from enacting policies  that may increase the labor force participation of older workers?", "To answer these questions, we compiled and analyzed demographic and  labor force data from the OECD, the United Nations Population Division,  and the International Labour Organization (ILO), highlighting data from  the United States and seven other comparison OECD nations. In addition,  we consulted with individual experts in national pension policy and  conducted an extensive review of the international retirement literature.

Due to the aging of the baby  boom generation, older persons are becoming an increasingly significant  proportion of all persons and workers. In 2002, the U.S. Census Bureau  estimates that there were 61 million people over age 55 and their numbers  are projected to grow to 103 million in 2025. This growth will increase the  percentage of the population that is over 55 from 22 percent to 30 percent.", "This shift in population age will affect the composition of the labor force.  The number of older workers in the United States is projected to grow  substantially over the next two decades, and they will become an  increasingly significant proportion of all workers. In June of 2002, there  were 19.2 million workers over age 55 and their numbers are projected to  increase to 31.8 million by 2015. This growth is projected to increase the  percentage of the workforce that is over 55 from 14 percent in 2002 to  nearly 20 percent in 2015.", "The projected growth in the percentage of the labor force over 55 will  occur among both men and women. This would shift an earlier trend  among older men, whose labor force participation declined from the 1950s  until the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, labor force participation among  older men has been relatively constant at 67 percent for men age 55 to 64  and 17 percent for men age 65 and older. The Bureau of Labor Statistics  now projects these levels to rise to 69 percent and nearly 20 percent by  2015. The expected growth in labor force participation rates among older  women would continue the current long-term trends of increases in their  participation. For example, the percent of women age 55 to 64 in the labor  force has steadily increased since the mid-1980s, from 42 to 52 percent in  2000, while rates among women 65 and older have grown from 7 to 9  percent in 2000. BLS projects these numbers to increase to 61 percent and  10 percent by 2015.", "There are many factors that influence a person\u2019s decision to work at older  ages. One key factor is financial incentives created by the rules regarding  eligibility for benefits from the national pension system\u2014Social Security  in the United States. The decision to continue working is primarily related  to the trade-off between earnings and leisure time. The availability of  Social Security benefits allows workers to substitute non-labor income for  their earnings and to enjoy more leisure. Depending on the eligibility rules  and schedule of benefits, it can be more or less advantageous for workers  to retire at an earlier age rather than to continue employment. The  eligibility age for full Social Security benefits is currently 65 years and 8  months and rising, with reduced benefits available at age 62. If a person  elects to start receiving benefits at age 62, 63, or 64, the total lifetime  benefits they receive will be roughly equivalent. Even though delaying  receipt of benefits for 1 year is on average \u201cactuarially equivalent or  neutral,\u201d data from the mid-1990s show that most people (60 percent) elect  to start benefits at age 62. These benefits can be reduced if the beneficiary  has earnings above the income threshold when they are age 62-64. There  are no earnings limitations on Social Security benefits above age 65.", "Another important retirement incentive is eligibility for employer-provided  pension benefits. In the United States, about half of the labor force has  some type of employer-provided pension coverage. Employer-provided  pensions are customarily classified into two major categories: defined  benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined benefit plan promises a  retirement benefit amount that is usually expressed as an annual payment,  derived from a formula based on a worker\u2019s years of employment,  earnings, or both. In the United States, benefits in defined benefit plans  are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Under a  defined contribution plan, the retirement benefit is expressed as an  account balance for the individual employee. This balance results from  contributions that the employer, the worker, or both make, as well as from  subsequent investment returns on the assets in the account. Under a  defined contribution plan, retirement benefits are not guaranteed by the  PBGC, and employees bear the risks of investment.", "As different types of pension plans, defined benefit and defined  contribution plans provide workers with different incentives for either  retiring or continuing work. Defined benefit plans often provide incentives  for early retirement because they often do not increase retirement benefits  in-line with additional years of work with the firm after the early  retirement age. Under defined contribution plans, benefits can continue  to increase, consistent with continued contributions and positive rates of  return on assets. Since workers\u2019 accounts increase in size proportional to  the amounts that are contributed by them or by their employers, they do  not create incentives to retire based on the benefit formula. In the past, a  greater percentage of pension-plan participants were covered by defined  benefit plans. In 1998, according to the Employee Benefits Research  Institute, 20 percent of households had defined benefit coverage only; 57  percent had defined contribution coverage only; and 23 percent had both  types of coverage.", "Health status and occupation are other important factors that influence  the decision to work at older ages. As people age, they tend to encounter  more health problems that make it more difficult to continue working.  Thus, jobs that are physically demanding, usually found in the blue-collar  and service sectors of the economy, can be difficult for many people to  perform at older ages. Moreover, health status and occupation are often  interrelated since health can be affected by work environment. Blue-collar  and service workers, such as construction workers and janitors, often face  physically demanding work environments that may affect their health  status; these consequently lead to health impairments that affect their  ability to work to older ages. Although this group continues to face  problems, there is evidence that the health of older persons generally is  improving. This suggests that, compared with previous generations,  today\u2019s older age population has an increased capacity to work to older  ages.", "Although the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects  workers in the United States age 40 and older from employment  discrimination, labor force participation is not solely an older worker\u2019s  decision, as there must also be a demand for their labor. Employers\u2019  perceptions of older people may form barriers to older workers\u2019 retaining  their current jobs, finding new jobs if they are laid off, or re-entering the  labor force after retiring if their retirement income is inadequate. For  example, some employers believe that older workers have lower  productivity than younger workers, generate higher costs for employee  benefits such as health care and pensions, and represent higher costs for  recruitment and training since they have less potential time to recoup  these up front costs compared with a younger worker. Encountering these  obstacles could discourage older workers and influence their decision to  retire.", "The labor force decisions of older persons are also influenced by the  availability of alternative employment arrangements. In the United States,  there has been interest among older workers who wish to work longer in  seeking employment arrangements that result in \u201cphased retirement\u201d or  \u201cbridge employment.\u201d Phased retirement usually refers to staying with a  career job on a part-time or part-year schedule while phasing out  employment over a number of years to complete retirement. Bridge  employment usually refers to leaving a career job and moving to part-time  work with another firm in the same or different industry, prior to complete  retirement. In the United States, nearly half of all workers age 55 to 65  utilize a bridge job before completely retiring.", "Older Americans receive income through a variety of sources, with the  Social Security program constituting the largest share for most persons. In  2000, 90 percent of households with a person age 65 or older received  Social Security benefits. These benefits constitute more than 50 percent of  total income for 64 percent of these households. Social Security benefits,  on average, replace about 40 percent of a program-covered individual\u2019s  pre-retirement income, if benefits are taken at age 62. Other major  sources of income for older Americans are asset income (received by 59  percent of households), retirement benefits other than Social Security (41  percent), and earnings (22 percent).  Social Security represents 41 percent  of aggregate income, earnings represent 23 percent, retirement benefits  other than Social Security are 18 percent, and asset income is 17.5 percent.", "In the United States, the Disability Insurance (DI) program provides  compensation for the reduced earnings for individuals who have worked  long enough and recently enough to become insured and have lost their  ability to work because of a severe, long-term disability. DI provides  benefits to persons who are not able to perform substantial gainful activity  due to a physical or mental impairment. DI is not a major source of income  for a significant portion of older persons in the United States.

Reforms adjusting benefits in the national pension systems  of each of these nations provide incentives for older workers to extend  their working lives. National and employer-provided pension reforms that  introduce defined contribution features that do not link benefits to a  specific age are also expected to encourage greater labor force  participation of older workers. Other reforms that seek to limit the use of  disability benefits as a route to early retirement will also influence the  older worker labor force participation. Acknowledging that improving the  employment opportunities of older workers is an important consideration,  each of these nations is studying or has enacted reforms that address the  issues of older worker\u2019s employment more generally. Such reforms  include loosening or eliminating mandatory retirement age standards,  encouraging the elimination of age discrimination in employment,  improving older worker training, providing employment earnings  incentives, and exploring quality-of-work life issues such as the flexibility  of work arrangements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Benefit Adjustments to National Pension Systems May Increase Labor Force Participation of Older Workers", "paragraphs": ["Reforms in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Sweden that increase the age  at which workers are eligible for benefits or allow flexibility in when and  how pension benefits can be taken are some of the policy changes that  may encourage older workers to stay in the workforce. The United  Kingdom will phase in an increase in the age at which women become  eligible for national pension benefits, so that, beginning in 2020, men and  women will no longer be able to draw benefits before age 65. Japan has  also enacted reforms that will gradually increase the full eligibility age for  its earnings-based national pension system. In Japan, by 2025 for men and  2030 for women, the earliest age when this pension can be claimed will  have risen from 60 to 65. Rather than increasing the age for benefit  eligibility, pension reforms in Sweden allow older workers to take a full or  partial national pension (i.e., one-fourth, one-half, or three-fourths of a full  pension) at age 61 or later with no upper age limit and continue working.  This flexibility may make it easier to retire gradually with a mix of pension  benefits and earnings.", "Additional pension reforms that change benefit calculations so they  reward continued work or discourage early retirement may also promote  continued labor force participation by older workers. Sweden changed its  benefit calculation to reward those who work longer. Under the new  pension system in Sweden, pensions are based on lifetime earnings,  instead of the highest 15 out of 30 years of earnings as they were under the  old system. The United Kingdom adjusted its benefit calculation formula  to increase the reward for those who defer drawing benefits from the  national pension system. For example, by 2010, individuals who defer  drawing their pension benefits will receive benefits that are 10.4 percent,  rather than 7.5 percent, larger for each year deferred. In Japan, reforms  have changed how pensions are calculated, reducing the level of benefits  for future retirees through lower accrual rates. The expected effect of  these changes is a 20-percent reduction in lifetime benefits by   2020, thereby making early retirement less affordable.", "Finally, reforms in Sweden and the United Kingdom, in changing how  pension benefits are indexed, may discourage early retirement. The new  pension system in Sweden indexes pension benefits to life expectancy.  With increasing life expectancy, different generations of individuals with  similar work and earnings histories will have to work longer to maintain a  comparable  standard of living in retirement. This benefit adjustment  provides incentives for increased labor force participation by requiring  individuals to bear the cost of increased life expectancy, either through  additional work or lower benefits. The United Kingdom also revised the  index it used to adjust benefits in the portion of its pension that provides  flat-rate benefits. Prior to the reform, the United Kingdom adjusted  benefits using either the higher of increases in average prices or average  wages as an index. Now the United Kingdom uses only average price  increases. Since prices tend to increase more slowly than wages, this  reform has effectively reduced benefits relative to earnings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "To Increase Work Incentives for Older Workers, National and Employer-Provided Pension Reforms Moved Systems Towards Defined Contribution Features While Other Reforms Addressed Disability Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Each of the nations we studied implemented reforms that included defined  contribution features in their national and employer-provided pension  systems, although this shift was more pronounced in Sweden and the  United Kingdom than in Japan. Defined contribution pensions are more  retirement age neutral than traditional defined benefit pension plans. As  part of its recent national pension reform, Sweden instituted a pay-as-you- go pension system with defined contribution features, including among  other things a fixed contribution rate and notional individual accounts (the  \u201cnotional defined contribution pension\u201d). The new Swedish pension  system also includes a smaller, funded defined contribution plan with an  account for each individual worker (the premium pension).

Japan implemented legislation permitting  employer-provided and personal defined contribution pension plans in  2002.", "In Sweden and the United Kingdom, the inclusion of defined contribution  features in the national pension system has prompted complementary  changes among the employer-provided pensions. In Sweden, three of the  four major employer-provided pension plans converted from defined  benefit plans to pure defined contribution plans or plans with a mix of  both features following the national pension reform. In the United  Kingdom, many employers have closed their defined benefit plans to new  workers and replaced them with defined contribution plans. For Japan,  where defined contribution pensions were only recently introduced, there  is currently little data on the number of individual or employer-provided  plans being formed or on the degree to which employers are substituting  defined contribution plans for existing defined benefit plans.", "The inclusion of defined contribution features in national and employer- provided pension systems is expected to encourage greater labor force  participation of older workers. Because workers will have a greater  responsibility for ensuring retirement through contributions and the  returns they can earn on them, it will be in their best interest to make  contributions for as long as they can. In addition, because defined  contribution plans often have greater portability than defined benefit  plans, older workers may have greater ability to shift to jobs that suit their  leisure and health needs rather than retiring.", "Both Sweden and the United Kingdom, where disability insurance has  traditionally been an avenue to early withdrawal from the labor force,  have introduced reforms in recent years that will tighten eligibility of  disability benefits. In efforts to reduce the amount of early retirement  financed through disability pensions, throughout the last decade Sweden  has implemented successive reforms to tighten the eligibility requirements  for disability insurance. This has included eliminating the ability of older  workers to take a disability pension solely on the basis of long-term  unemployment or a combination of unemployment and medical reasons.  Medical reasons now provide the only valid criteria for granting a  disability pension in Sweden. As part of its efforts, the United Kingdom,  since the mid-1990s has tightened eligibility requirements, reduced paid  benefits, and provided more support for returning to the workforce after  an absence. For example, the government now reviews claims of  incapacity to work every 3 years compared to the previous policy of not  reviewing claims after the initial application, reduces or offsets disability  benefits if the recipient also receives an employer-provided pension over a  certain minimum level, provides services such as job search assistance to  the disabled as a way to enable their return to work, and will test a policy  allowing recipients to keep a portion of their wages if they return to  work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Market Policies May Reduce Barriers to Work at Older Ages", "paragraphs": ["Each nation we studied has enacted, or is considering, policies that  address barriers to older workers\u2019 continued employment such as  mandatory retirement and age discrimination.

Officials from all three nations noted that reforms  are most successful when they are comprehensive in scope. Both Sweden  and the United Kingdom, for example, in reforming their pension systems  also made changes to both their disability insurance programs and labor  market policies. Some officials also stressed that reforms should be  designed so that the intent of a particular reform is not thwarted by  countervailing policies in other areas. For example, Swedish pension  experts and other officials have acknowledged that the continued  presence of mandatory retirement ages in collective bargaining  agreements and labor regulations can work at cross-purposes with  features in the new national pension system that now relate benefit levels  to retiree life expectancy and that essentially have no upper retirement  age. They noted that to increase the effectiveness of the work incentives in  their national pension reforms, these impediments will have to be  resolved, as well as the need to establish complementary reform policies  that foster alternative work arrangements and quality of work-life issues  generally. Other nations also acknowledged the importance of  complementary reforms. Japan has supplemented its national pension  reforms with wage subsidies to encourage older employees to continue to  work. Japan and the U.K. also support their national pension reforms by  committing additional resources to organizations and services that provide  job search assistance to older workers.", "Officials in each nation that we studied emphasized that access to  information and public education about how the reforms will affect  retirement income would also be needed if the reforms were to have their  intended effect. There is concern in these nations that many workers are  currently unaware of the implications of the reforms. For example,  surveys conducted by the Swedish government and advocates for senior  citizens indicate that many individuals do not yet have a detailed  understanding of the new pension system. U.K. government officials  expressed concern that their citizens could have similar difficulties  understanding the implemented reforms. To help their citizens understand  that they may need to work longer or save more in order to ensure an  adequate retirement income, each of the nations we studied has taken  steps to educate workers. In Sweden, the government has launched  several large information campaigns since the new pension system\u2019s  implementation. In addition, participants receive annual statements of  their account balances in both the notional defined contribution (NDC)  and premium pensions. To help educate its workers, the U.K. government  has created a pension forecast tool that will present workers with  estimates of pension income from both government and nongovernment  sources. In Japan, because defined contribution pensions are very new  and offer both advantages and disadvantages to participants, employers  are required to provide information to employees about defined  contribution plan features and management.", "In addition to the importance of information and education, government  officials and pension experts agreed that a strong national economy is  necessary for the success of pension and labor market reforms that may  contribute to higher labor force participation by older workers. A strong  economy eases the implementation of pension reform by offering  increased employment opportunities for older workers. High  unemployment and low economic growth will limit older workers\u2019 ability  to remain employed, forcing them into complete retirement. Experts we  spoke with believe that the low growth of the Japanese economy during  the last decade has been a factor limiting the scope of pension and labor  market reform, for example, in the area of mandatory retirement ages.  Fiscal constraints also preclude more fundamental pension reform of  system financing and structure. In contrast, the currently strong U.K.  economy acts as an incentive for employers to retain their older workers  and there will likely be an increased need for older workers in the long  term, particularly as the workforce ages between now and 2020. The  current tight labor market also makes it easier for job search assistance  programs to find jobs for clients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In many nations, despite their numerous differences, increasing the labor  force participation of older workers is an element of the policies chosen to  reform national pension systems. Officials from each of the three nations  we studied emphasized this issue should be considered in their own  nation\u2019s reform efforts. Encouraging workers to stay in the labor force  longer can help alleviate the fiscal and budgetary stress induced by rising  national pension expenditures and can potentially enhance economic  growth. In those nations where national pension reform has included  benefit reductions, working longer can also enable older persons to avoid  serious reductions in their standard of living in retirement.", "An important result from the experience of other nations is that to  effectively foster greater labor force participation among older workers,  individual reform components should be comprehensive in design so that  employment incentives operate in a mutually reinforcing manner. Thus, in  the nations we studied, changes in the national pension system were often  matched by corresponding complementary initiatives affecting employer- provided pensions and the operation of the national labor market. Officials  from each of the three nations we studied also identified other critical  labor market policies that needed to be harmonized with these changes,  particularly in the area of employment age discrimination and regarding  mandatory retirement ages. Such comprehensive reforms can face  formidable challenges to their design and implementation. In Sweden, for  example, where prospects may be more favorable because the national  pension system accounts for a large proportion of retirement income,  comprehensive reform remains a work in progress with continuing  discussion and debate. Nevertheless, the returns from a comprehensive  approach could far outweigh the risks of failure.", "The reform policies chosen by other nations should be evaluated within  the context of their societies and institutions, however. For example,  benefit payments from the national pension system in Sweden currently  replaces a much larger percentage of pre-retirement income than in the  United States. Therefore, benefit reductions in these nations will have  significantly different effects on retirement income than similar actions  taken in the United States. In addition, reforms that more closely link  benefits to life expectancy, such as those implemented in Sweden could  have significantly different distributional effects in the United States. For  example, American subpopulations with lower average life expectancies,  such as African Americans, would be more adversely affected by this  policy change since they would collect benefits for shorter time periods  relative to other racial groups. African American men have shorter life  expectancies at birth and at age 65 compared to males of other ethnicities.", "Finally, the focus on extending the labor force participation of older  workers has also led to a reconsideration of the traditional definition of  retirement where a person is either considered working or retired, to one  that is more flexible or continuous in nature. The long-term trend of  improved health and age longevity of older persons throughout the high- income nations now permits a range of options beyond the traditional  career employment/out-of-the-workforce retirement tradeoff.  Acknowledging this development, experts and officials from the nations  we studied noted the importance of quality of work-life issues, including  the wider use and availability of part- time employment and other  alternative employment arrangements, and fostering \u201clifelong learning,\u201d as  other key components in a long-term strategy to extend the labor force  participation of older workers. In some ways, the United States has  already forged ahead in this area, through its prohibition of age  employment discrimination, broad elimination of mandatory retirement  ages, and through its public discussion of bridge employment, phased  retirement, and other alternative employment arrangements. However,  opportunities exist to do more. In recent work, we found that few U.S.  employers have focused on making such options available to their older  employees on any widespread basis, and numerous economic and  regulatory obstacles remain that can discourage the employment of older  workers. This led us to recommend to the Secretary of Labor that an  interagency task force be established to develop legislative and regulatory  proposals addressing the issues raised by the aging of the labor force. The  challenge of how to extend the work-lives of older employees, given the  new demographic realities of the 21st century, presents real opportunities,  not only to bolster economic growth but to help secure retirement income  adequacy for millions of working Americans and their families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of this report to the Secretary of Labor and  Commissioner of Social Security.
