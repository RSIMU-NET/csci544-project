ONDCP established seven Strategy goals related to reducing illicit drug use and its consequences by 2015. As of March 2013, GAO's analysis showed that of the five goals for which primary data on results are available, one shows progress and four show no progress. For example, no progress has been made on reducing drug use among 12- to 17-year-olds by 15 percent. This is primarily due to an increase in the rate of reported marijuana use, offset by decreases in the rates of reported use of other drugs. Nevertheless, ONDCP reported that 107 of the 112 action items in the Strategy are complete or on track. ONDCP officials stated that implementing these action items is necessary but may not be sufficient to achieve Strategy goals.", "ONDCP primarily intends to address the extent of progress in achieving Strategy goals through its new Performance Reporting System (PRS)--a monitoring mechanism intended to provide specific, routine information on progress toward Strategy goals and help identify factors for performance gaps and options for improvement. ONDCP officials stated that they plan to report on PRS results for the first time in 2013. They also said that they plan to assess the system's reliability and effectiveness. This could help increase accountability for improving results and identify ways to bridge the gap that currently exists between the lack of progress toward Strategy goals and the strong progress made on implementing Strategy actions.", "Drug abuse prevention and treatment programs are fragmented across 15 federal agencies and provide some overlapping services, which could increase the risk of duplication. Specifically, GAO identified overlap in 59 of the 76 programs included in its review. These programs could provide or fund one or more drug abuse prevention or treatment service that at least one other program could also provide or fund, either to similar population groups or to reach similar program goals. Such fragmentation and overlap may result in inefficient use of resources among programs providing similar services.", "GAO's prior work has found that inefficiencies created by fragmentation and overlap can be minimized through coordination. However, many prevention and treatment programs that GAO surveyed did not report coordination efforts, and ONDCP has not assessed the extent of overlap, duplication, and coordination. Agency officials who administer the 21 programs that GAO reviewed in detail-- programs for youth and offenders--reported making various efforts to coordinate program activities, but 29 of 76 (about 40 percent) surveyed programs reported no coordination with other federal agencies on drug abuse prevention or treatment activities. Moreover, ONDCP has not assessed all drug abuse prevention or treatment programs to identify the extent of overlap and potential duplication and any opportunities for coordination. Such an assessment would better position ONDCP to help ensure that agencies better leverage and more efficiently use limited resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that ONDCP assess the extent of overlap and the potential for duplication across federal programs engaged in drug abuse prevention and treatment activities and identify opportunities for increased coordination.

As a  result, we determined that the data used in our report were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We analyzed responses to identify potential  fragmentation, overlap, or duplication based on criteria established in our  previous work. To assess coordination efforts, we analyzed  questionnaire responses regarding agency efforts to coordinate drug  abuse prevention and treatment program activities.

For  example, SAMSHA officials told us that DOJ\u2019s and states\u2019 expansion of  funding for drug courts in the 1980s resulted in a strain on the number of  community substance abuse treatment services available to drug courts.  SAMHSA recognized the need for additional funding in this area and  began to fund the expansion and enhancement of substance abuse  treatment services specifically available to drug courts. In addition, having  multiple programs that can provide similar services to similar beneficiaries  can help to fill gaps in services for beneficiaries. However, this  fragmentation and overlap could also make it challenging to develop a  coordinated federal approach to providing drug abuse prevention and  treatment services because of the number of different federal agencies  involved, and could result in potential inefficiencies among programs  providing similar services. Specifically, our body of work on fragmentation  and overlap has found that agencies often can realize a range of benefits,  such as improved customer service and decreased administrative  burdens and cost savings from addressing issues related to  fragmentation and overlap, as we discuss below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Programs Reported That They Do Not Coordinate, and ONDCP Has Not Assessed the Extent of Overlap and Identified Coordination Opportunities to Help Improve Efficiencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coordination Efforts in Two Areas with Overlap Helped Minimize Risk of Duplication, but Not All Programs Reported Such Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials who administer programs in two areas that we reviewed  in more detail\u2014specifically, programs for youth and programs for  offenders\u2014reported making various efforts to coordinate overlapping  program activities or services, which can serve to minimize the risk of  duplication. However we found that not all programs surveyed reported  coordinating with other federal agencies on drug abuse prevention or  treatment activities in the year prior to our survey. For those areas that we  reviewed in more detail, we found the following:", "Prevention services for student and youth: While 6 programs that  provide services to youth are overlapping, the risk of potential  duplication among these programs may be low because of  interagency coordination efforts. Officials overseeing these  programs from Education, ONDCP, and SAMHSA reported that the  agencies coordinate to improve program efficiencies. For example,  using an interagency agreement, Education jointly administers the  Safe Schools/Healthy Students program with DOJ and HHS to  provide complementary educational, mental health, and law  enforcement services to help prevent youth violence and drug use.  Similarly, SAMHSA and ONDCP maintain an interagency agreement  to jointly administer the Drug Free Communities Support program.  Officials from SAMHSA said that the agreement defines the roles and  responsibilities of the two agencies, and establishes agreed-upon  standard operating procedures.", "In addition, officials from Education, ONDCP, and SAMHSA reported  that some programs and the services they can provide or fund are  distinct because they target specific subgroups among students and  youth, or they differ in scope. For example, the 21st Century  Community Learning Center program allows for additional uses of  funds that are not related to drug abuse prevention, like tutoring and  mentoring, and does not require that grantees include drug abuse  prevention as a program component. Officials from Education said  that this indicates a difference in scope from the Safe Schools/Healthy  Students program, which requires grantees to include drug abuse  prevention services as a main program component. These officials  also reported taking steps to identify opportunities for increasing  efficiencies. For example, in its fiscal year 2013 budget justification,  Education proposed consolidating several existing programs that seek  to help schools provide programs and activities including alcohol,  drug, and violence prevention. According to Education officials, the  consolidation would more effectively target resources and address the  needs of grantees.", "Prevention and treatment services for offenders: Officials from the  four agencies overseeing the programs that can provide or fund  treatment and prevention services to the offender population also said  that the agencies conduct coordination efforts to help ensure that  programs provide complementary services to this population, which  can minimize the risk for potential duplication. OJP and SAMHSA  officials reported that both agencies coordinate to ensure that these  programs provide funding for different program elements.  For  example, according to OJP and SAMHSA officials, SAMHSA funding  for drug courts is used for treatment services, while OJP funding for  drug courts is used for administrative or case management purposes.  While OJP is not restricted from funding the same treatment services  SAMHSA can fund, officials from both agencies said that they use  multiple coordination mechanisms to help minimize the risk of  potential duplication. For example, OJP and SAMHSA jointly  administer two drug court programs. For the agencies\u2019 other programs  serving offenders that are not jointly administered, SAMHSA officials  told us they share requests for grant applications and information on  potential awardees with OJP officials to ensure that grants are not  awarded to the same grantee for the same purpose. We also  previously reported that program overlap is minimal and the risk of  potential duplication is low among OJP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s offender  programs that assist former inmates or inmates preparing for release  from federal, state, and local correctional facilities.", "Additionally, officials from OJP and SAMHSA reported that their  programs specifically serve offenders in the state and local justice  systems, while the Bureau of Prisons and the Administrative Office of  the United States Court\u2019s programs specifically serve offenders who  are or were incarcerated in federal prisons, which results in these  programs having a low risk for duplication. In addition, these officials  reported that the two agencies regularly share information and  coordinate on prerelease planning for inmates in federal prisons and  on transitioning inmates from prison to court-ordered drug testing and  treatment after release, or vice versa.", "Coordination efforts among the programs included in the two areas we  reviewed in detail were consistent with practices that we have previously  reported federal agencies use to implement collaborative efforts. These  efforts could address crosscutting issues that may reduce potentially  duplicative, overlapping, or fragmented efforts. However, 29 of the 76  programs (about 40 percent) surveyed reported no coordination with  other federal agencies on drug abuse prevention or treatment activities.  As we have previously reported, because fragmentation across agencies  can create an environment in which programs are not delivered as  efficiently and effectively as possible, coordination across government is  essential.interagency coordination efforts among the programs that did not report   Therefore, there may be additional opportunities to implement  any of these efforts, to identify potential efficiencies that better leverage  available resources and minimize overlap and potential duplication.", "While ONDCP has identified activities related to the development and  implementation of the Strategy and Drug Control Budget that promote  coordination, it has not systematically assessed all drug abuse prevention  or treatment programs to examine the extent of overlap and potential for  duplication and identified opportunities for coordination among programs  to more efficiently use limited resources. According to ONDCP officials,  the office\u2019s current processes are sufficient to determine the extent of  overlap and potential for duplication. Specifically, officials from ONDCP  and other agencies with whom we spoke reported that they have made  efforts to promote coordination through the Strategy, which emphasizes  the importance of agencies collaborating on the Strategy\u2019s goals. In  addition, ONDCP officials stated that as part of the office\u2019s annual  process for developing the National Drug Control Budget submission,  they review prevention and treatment programs for which funding is  requested to verify that the programs serve unique needs and  populations. ONDCP officials stated that their familiarity with the  programs and information obtained from outreach at the programmatic  level and interagency meetings, among other things, help in this review.", "However, the purpose of the interagency meetings and other efforts to  facilitate coordination is to develop and implement the Strategy and not to  identify overlap or potential duplication. Furthermore, the purpose of the  budget process is to develop a consolidated funding request to implement  the Strategy and help ensure that the Strategy is adequately resourced  rather than to identify overlap or potential duplication across all programs.  Accordingly, ONDCP has not conducted a systematic assessment of all  federal drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, including those  not captured in the budget, and the services they are allowed to provide  to determine the extent to which they overlap and where opportunities  exist to pursue coordination strategies in order to more efficiently use  limited resources. Further, ONDCP officials stated that there is no  overlap among these programs, but our analysis of prevention and  treatment services identified overlap in 59 of them. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government highlights the importance of having  access to operational and other data to determine whether programs are  meeting goals for accountability and efficient use of resources.  Additionally, The Standard for Project Management states that to ensure  related projects are managed to achieve more benefits than could be  achieved with stand-alone efforts, management should coordinate  common activities or programs and the efficient use of resources across  activities.activities across organizations are to achieve desired benefits.", "This can include such efforts as mapping out how various  Further, our previous work on characteristics of effective national  strategies states that such strategies should include mechanisms for  coordinating agency implementation efforts, which could entail the  identification of specific processes for coordination. As discussed earlier, officials from 29 of the 76 programs (about 40 percent) surveyed  reported that they did not participate in any coordination efforts over the  past year. Additionally, there may be other opportunities for improved  efficiencies among agencies that have some coordination efforts in place.  For example, while SAMHSA and OJP officials have made efforts to  provide complementary drug court services, a SAMHSA official stated  that a drug court awardee using SAMHSA funds to provide treatment  services and OJP funds to administer the drug court still must meet  complex, separate reporting requirements to each agency for such things  as budget and performance management information. Our previous work  has shown that fragmented services with separate agency requirements  can be burdensome, difficult, and costly for service providers. ONDCP  is uniquely situated to conduct an assessment across the 76 programs  engaged in drug abuse prevention and treatment activities to identify the  extent of overlap and potential for duplication and prospective processes  for coordination. ONDCP could use the results of our analysis as a  starting point for conducting this assessment. Such actions would better  position ONDCP to help ensure that federal agencies undertaking similar  prevention and treatment efforts identify opportunities for increased  efficiencies, such as using coordination mechanisms to mitigate the risk  of duplication and reducing administrative burdens on grantees, and  better leverage available resources. These mechanisms could include, for  example, joint program administration established through interagency  agreements, sharing requests for grant applications, or joint performance  measurement reporting among programs serving the same grant or  cooperative agreement awardees."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies We Reviewed Have Completed Few Program Evaluations, with Three Looking at Program Effectiveness, but Have Taken Other Steps to Ensure Programs Are Effective", "paragraphs": ["While agencies in our review had completed few program evaluations  since 2007, in part because of funding constraints, more are under way or  planned.

The office also made the points, with  examples, that some overlapping programs (1) may not serve identical  populations and may target different specific subgroups of a large  population category, such as different types of youth age groups, and (2)  may provide distinct services. We acknowledged these factors in our  report, and maintain that this is why it is important to systematically  review the extent of overlap among prevention and treatment programs,  taking into account targeted subgroups and allowable services, to help  ensure that they efficiently use limited resources to deliver these  important services. ONDCP also reiterated, as we stated, that  overlapping programs may provide positive benefits, such as reinforcing  key prevention messages. Further, the office agreed that coordination  efforts among programs can help avoid duplication and maximize  program effectiveness.

As  the report states, marijuana accounts for almost 80 percent of drug use in  this age group, and the lack of progress on this goal is due primarily to an  increase in the rate of reported marijuana use, offset by decreases in the  rates of other drug use. We also state that misuse and abuse of  prescription drugs is the primary factor for one of the measures for the  goal to reduce drug-related morbidity by 15 percent, which also shows  lack of progress.

Specifically, we found that young people who had reported that they  engaged in delinquent activities, such as running away from home,  truancy, fighting, and theft, were more likely to have used marijuana;  however, we also noted that underlying factors may be associated with  both drug use and delinquent activities. More recently, in 2000, a meta- analysis of 101 longitudinal studies from around the world identified a  number of risk factors that predicted future marijuana use, including the  availability of illicit drugs and guns, family history of antisocial behavior,  positive attitudes toward substance use, low perceived risk of drug use,  and rebelliousness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Review of Studies on the Effect of Societal Factors on Youth Marijuana Use", "paragraphs": ["Other factors, including state laws and changing attitudes and social  norms regarding drugs, may also affect drug use.

For instance, a number of  states have passed varying degrees of laws related to the production,  possession, or use of marijuana for varying purposes. In addition,  separate from laws that may allow for the use of marijuana for certain  medical purposes, some states and local governments have taken  actions to reduce or eliminate certain criminal penalties for the  possession of small amounts of the drug. Finally, some speculate  whether media depictions of illicit drugs influence youth drug use. For  example, according to one study, frequent viewing of media messages  may increase the likelihood of the adoption of ideas or beliefs reflected in  the media portrayals, which may influence subsequent behaviors, such as  the use of illicit substances.", "Through searches of databases, Internet websites, and other sources  available as of June 2012, we identified 476 documents that addressed  possible factors relating to youth drug use, including the societal factors  described above, as well as others such as alcohol use and mental  illness.

We identified 10 studies that assessed the effect of medical  marijuana laws or decriminalization. We also identified 10 studies on  prodrug media that focused on U.S. youth; however, 4 of the latter 10  studies did not have a national or multiple state scope, and none of these  10 studies assessed the effect of media on youth marijuana use.  Specifically, 4 assessed the association between media and youth  marijuana use, and 6 provide descriptive statistics on, for example, the  prevalence of drugs and prodrug representations in various forms of  media. While these studies may not assess the effect of media on youth  marijuana use or include a national or a multiple state scope, we included  them because they provide useful context regarding the portrayal of drugs  in the media.

Three of the four studies found that exposure to various  forms of media (e.g., rap music, music, and media depicting the positive  aspects of marijuana use) were associated with higher rates of marijuana  or other drug use.

Further, ONDCP officials stated that  some studies incorrectly looked at the changes in marijuana use  before and after medical marijuana laws are passed instead of before  and after such laws are implemented. The officials noted that this is  an important distinction because the implementation of medical  marijuana laws after passage can be a lengthy process. ONDCP  officials also noted that the states that eventually passed medical  marijuana laws tended to have higher rates of youth marijuana use  before such laws were passed. However, some of the studies we  reviewed attempted to account for these issues in their study designs.  For example, one study used a model that controlled for unmeasured  state characteristics that do not change over time, such as differences  in social norms, and that might affect marijuana use and the likelihood  of a state passing a medical marijuana law.", "Self-reported data: As we have previously reported, research about  drug use among youth is limited, in part, because most studies rely on  self-reported data, and low estimates are likely because drug use is  illegal. For example, youth may be unlikely to report their drug use  in the survey for fear of negative repercussions, regardless of whether  the results of the survey are shared with law enforcement.

In total,  our initial search identified 91 potential programs that 16 federal agencies  administered.", "Next, we shared our preliminary list of programs with agency officials and  asked them to verify that the included programs met our criteria and if any  should be added or deleted. During initial meetings with agency officials,  we asked them to clarify program names, descriptions, and services  offered. We used the information obtained to make additional refinements  to the list of agencies and programs included in our review. For example,  some programs were removed from the list because they were no longer  in operation in fiscal year 2012 or were part of a larger program already  listed, and other programs were added. We also excluded one additional  agency from our review. Specifically, we excluded the Court Services and  Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia because its  programs are primarily for residents of the District of Columbia. Thus the  number of agencies in the scope of this study decreased from 16 to 15.  After completing these refinements our list identified a total of 95  programs.", "To obtain program-specific information, we sent a total of 95 web-based  questionnaires to the 15 agencies included in our review.questionnaires are described in detail below. We included several  screening questions in the questionnaire to further verify that programs  met our definition of a drug abuse prevention program, drug abuse  treatment program, or a program that includes these activities, and were  in operation in fiscal year 2012. Fourteen programs did not pass our  screening questions and therefore were excluded from our analysis. We  also removed 4 programs from our analysis after reviewing the responses  and determining that the program did not meet one or more of our criteria   These  for inclusion, and consolidated the responses of 1 program at the request  of agency officials. In total, 76 programs were included in our final  analysis of questionnaire responses.", "We developed a web-based questionnaire to collect detailed information  on federal drug abuse prevention and drug abuse treatment programs,  and programs that include these activities, for fiscal year 2011. The  questionnaire included questions on program objectives, target groups  served, services provided, and coordination activities with other federal  agencies. We also collected data on program obligations\u2014defined as  definite commitments that create a legal liability of the government for the  payment of goods and services ordered or received\u2014as available, for  fiscal year 2011. Specifically, we asked programs to provide the amount  of federal funds obligated specifically for their drug abuse prevention or  treatment activities, and the total amount of federal funds obligated for all  program activities in fiscal year 2011. In many cases, programs were not  able to provide data on funds obligated specifically for their drug abuse  prevention or treatment activities because agency officials told us that  they did not report budgetary data at this level, among other reasons.", "To minimize errors arising from differences in how questions may be  interpreted and to reduce variability in responses, we conducted pretests  with four agencies and 6 programs from July to August 2012. To ensure  that we obtained a variety of perspectives on our questionnaire, we  selected programs that differed in program scope, services provided, and  target groups served. We included budget staff as well as program  officials in the pretest to ensure budget-related terms in the survey were  understandable. An independent reviewer also reviewed a draft of the  questionnaire prior to its administration. After completing the pretests, we  administered the survey to 95 programs. We received completed surveys  for 95 programs, for a 100 percent response rate. telephone calls to officials and sent them follow-up e-mail messages, as  necessary, to clarify their responses or obtain additional information.", "We consolidated questionnaire responses for SAMHSA\u2019s Substance Abuse and Mental  Health block grant program at the request of agency officials. As a result, we ultimately  received responses for 94 unique programs.", "We used standard descriptive statistics to analyze responses to the  questionnaire. Because this was not a sample survey, there were no  sampling errors. To minimize other types of errors, commonly referred to  as nonsampling errors, and to enhance data quality, we employed survey  design practices in the development of the survey and in the collection,  processing, and analysis of the survey data. For instance, as previously  mentioned, we pretested the questionnaire with federal officials to  minimize errors arising from differences in how questions might be  interpreted and to reduce variability in responses. We further reviewed  the questionnaire to ensure the ordering of sections was appropriate and  that the questions within each section were clearly stated and easy to  comprehend. To reduce nonresponse, another source of nonsampling  error, we sent out e-mail reminder messages to encourage officials to  complete the questionnaire. In reviewing the questionnaire data, we  performed automated checks to identify inappropriate answers. We  further reviewed the data for missing or ambiguous responses and  followed up with agency officials when necessary to clarify their  responses. To assess the reliability of obligations data, we incorporated  questions about the reliability of the programs\u2019 data systems and if there  were any limitations to reporting the data. On the basis of our application  of recognized survey design practices and follow-up procedures, we  determined that the data were of sufficient quality for our purposes. All  data analysis programs were also independently verified by a data  analyst for accuracy.", "To determine the extent of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, we  compared data from the 76 drug abuse prevention and treatment  programs to review the types of services offered across the federal  government and used the following definitions from our prior work:", "Fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency (or more  than one organization within an agency) is involved in the same broad  area of national interest.", "Overlap occurs when fragmented agencies or programs have similar  goals, engage in similar activities or strategies to achieve them, or  target similar beneficiaries.", "Duplication occurs when two or more agencies or programs are  engaged in the same activities or provide the same services to the  same beneficiaries.", "To determine the extent of fragmentation, we used the questionnaire data  to identify the number of agencies that deliver similar types of drug abuse  prevention and treatment programs. To determine the potential for  overlap, we identified the number of programs with similar goals that  provided similar services to similar populations. We also conducted an in- depth analysis of two areas\u2014prevention services for students and youths  and treatment services for the offender populations\u2014to further assess the  potential for overlap among these programs. We selected these areas  because of the number of programs and extent of overlap in these areas.  For those areas in which we completed our in-depth review, we also  determined the potential for duplication by reviewing programmatic  information and holding meetings with program staff to determine whether  the programs were providing the same services to the same beneficiaries.", "To assess coordination efforts to reduce the potential for unnecessary  overlap or duplication, we analyzed questionnaire responses from the 76  programs regarding agency efforts to coordinate drug abuse prevention  and treatment program activities. We also analyzed the 2010 Strategy  and interviewed ONDCP and agency officials about actions taken to  coordinate activities.

For each  program evaluation, we reviewed its objectives, scope, and any  description of how its findings were used by the agency. Furthermore, we  interviewed agency officials about factors affecting the lack of program  evaluation. We also reviewed agency documents and interviewed agency  officials to identify whether the agencies took other steps to help ensure  that their programs are effective, such as requiring programs or their  grantees to use evidence-based interventions, and whether the agencies  prescribed specific evidence-based interventions that must be used in  their programs.
