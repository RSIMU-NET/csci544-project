This testimony is primarily based on these three reports and discusses prior GAO findings and SBA's progress on implementing GAO's recommendations on (1) the WOSB program, (2) the HUBZone program, and (3) SBA's procurement scorecard.", "To update the status of prior recommendations, GAO reviewed updates from SBA and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Administration (SBA) has not fully implemented GAO's prior recommendations to address oversight deficiencies in the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) programs and to improve evaluation of its procurement scorecard. GAO maintains that its recommendations should be addressed.", "Women-Owned Small Business Program. In its March 2019 report, GAO found that SBA had not addressed WOSB program oversight deficiencies identified in GAO's 2014 report (GAO-15-54). For example, GAO had found that SBA did not have procedures related to reviewing the performance of the four third-party certifers\u2014private entities approved by SBA to certify the eligibility of WOSB firms\u2014as well as information the certifiiers submitted to SBA. GAO recommended that SBA establish procedures to assess the performance of the certifiers and the information they submitted. While SBA conducted a compliance review of the certifiers in 2016, SBA said in June 2018 that it had no plans to conduct further compliance reviews until a final rule implementing a new certification process was completed. SBA officials said that they expected the rule to be implemented by June 2021. By waiting to improve its oversight of the WOSB program, SBA cannot provide reasonable assurance that certifiers are complying with program requirements and cannot improve its efforts to identify ineligible firms or potential fraud.", "HUBZone Program. In September 2018, GAO reported that it had reviewed case files for a nongeneralizable sample of 12 firms in Puerto Rico that received HUBZone certification between March 2017 and March 2018 and found that SBA did not consistently document or follow its policies and procedures for certification reviews. For example, SBA did not have complete documentation in nine of 12 cases and did not follow its policy to conduct three levels of review when determining whether to approve or deny a firm in four of 12 cases. As a result, SBA did not have reasonable assurance that firms meet HUBZone criteria. SBA said that it planned to implement GAO's recommendations that SBA (1) update internal policy manuals for certification and recertification and (2) conduct and document reviews of staff compliance with relevant procedures. However, as of May 2019, SBA had not provided documentation showing that it had completed these planned actions.", "Small Business Procurement Scorecard. For fiscal year 2017, SBA revised the methodology for its Small Business Procurement Scorecard, which assesses the efforts of federal agencies to support contracting with small businesses. For example, one revision reduced the share of the total scorecard grade devoted to prime contracting achievement (the dollar amount of contracts awarded directly to small businesses). GAO recommended in September 2018 that SBA design and implement a comprehensive evaluation to assess the scorecard revisions. Since that report was issued, SBA has proposed but not yet implemented a two-phase evaluation of the scorecard to include an evaluation of the scorecard's effect on federal agencies achieving small business contracting goals. SBA said that it expects to complete phase one by September 2019 and has not provided a time frame for phase two."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recent work on the Small  Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) contracting programs and SBA\u2019s  progress in implementing our recommendations.

I will discuss SBA\u2019s progress on implementing our prior  recommendations on (1) the WOSB program, (2) the HUBZone program  in Puerto Rico, and (3) SBA\u2019s procurement scorecard.", "To conduct the work on the WOSB program, we reviewed relevant laws,  regulations, and program documents; analyzed federal contracting data  from April 2011 through June 2018; and interviewed SBA officials,  officials from contracting agencies selected to obtain a range of  experience with the WOSB program, and three of the four private third- party certifiers. For our HUBZone report, we analyzed SBA documents  and reviewed files of a nongeneralizable sample of 12 firms located in  Puerto Rico that received certification between March 2017 and March  2018. We also interviewed SBA officials, representatives from HUBZone- certified firms in Puerto Rico, and local economic development agencies  in Puerto Rico. To conduct the work on SBA\u2019s procurement scorecard, we  analyzed SBA\u2019s prior and revised scorecard methodology and results and  interviewed officials from SBA, four other federal agencies selected based  on small business procurement volume and other attributes, and three  groups representing the interests of small businesses. To update the  status of recommendations from these reports, we reviewed updates from  SBA and interviewed officials. We conducted the work on which this  testimony is based in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. More details on our methodology can be found in the  three reports on which this testimony is based."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SBA Has Not Fully Addressed Deficiencies in Oversight and Implementation for the WOSB Program", "paragraphs": ["SBA has not fully addressed deficiencies we have previously identified for  the WOSB program, and these deficiencies are affected by SBA\u2019s  ongoing implementation of changes to the program authorized by the  National Defense Authorization Act of 2015 (2015 NDAA). As of early  June 2019, SBA had implemented one of the three changes to the  program authorized in the 2015 NDAA. Specifically, in September 2015  SBA published a final rule to implement sole-source authority (to award  contracts without competition), effective October 2015. The two other  changes\u2014authorizing SBA to implement its own certification process for  WOSBs and requiring SBA to eliminate the option for firms to self-certify  that they are eligible for the WOSB program\u2014had not been  implemented. On May 14, 2019, SBA published in the Federal Register a  proposed rule that eliminates the self-certification option and describes a  potential certification process to be administered by SBA. SBA officials  have stated that the agency will not eliminate self-certification until the  new certification process for the WOSB program is in place, which they  expect to implement by June 2021.", "In addition, SBA has not fully addressed WOSB program oversight  deficiencies described in our March 2019 report and first identified in our  2014 report. We reported that SBA did not have formal policies for  reviewing the performance of its four approved third-party certifiers  (private entities approved by SBA to certify the eligibility of WOSB firms),  including their compliance with their agreements with SBA. Further, we  found that SBA had not developed formal policies and procedures for,  among other things, reviewing the monthly reports that certifiers submit to  SBA. We recommended that the Administrator of SBA establish  comprehensive procedures to monitor and assess the performance of the  third-party certifiers in accordance with their agreements with SBA and  program regulations. While SBA has taken some steps to address our  recommendation, including conducting a compliance review of the  certifiers in 2016, SBA officials said in June 2018 that SBA had no plans  to conduct further compliance reviews until the final rule implementing the  new certification process was completed. By waiting to improve its  oversight of the WOSB program, SBA cannot provide reasonable  assurance that certifiers are complying with program requirements and  cannot improve its efforts to identify ineligible firms or potential fraud. In  addition, the implementation of sole-source authority in light of these  continued oversight deficiencies can increase program risk.  Consequently, we maintain that our recommendation should be  addressed.", "SBA also has not fully addressed deficiencies related to eligibility  examinations that we described in our March 2019 report and first  identified in our October 2014 report. We found that SBA lacked  formalized guidance for its eligibility examination processes and that the  examinations identified high rates of potentially ineligible businesses. As  a result, we recommended that SBA enhance its examination of  businesses that register for the WOSB program to ensure that only  eligible businesses obtain WOSB set-asides. Specifically, we suggested  that SBA should take actions such as (1) completing the development of  procedures to conduct annual eligibility examinations and implementing  such procedures; (2) analyzing examination results and individual  businesses found to be ineligible to better understand the cause of the  high rate of ineligibility in annual reviews and determine what actions are  needed to address the causes, and (3) implementing ongoing reviews of  a sample of all businesses that have represented their eligibility to  participate in the program.", "SBA has taken some steps to implement our recommendation, such as  including written policies and procedures for WOSB program eligibility  examinations in a standard operating procedure and a Desk Guide.  However, SBA does not collect reliable information on the results of its  annual eligibility examinations. In addition, SBA continues to have no  mechanism to look across examinations for common eligibility issues to  inform the WOSB program. As we noted in 2014, by not analyzing  examination results broadly, the agency is missing opportunities to obtain  meaningful insights into the program, such as the reasons many  businesses are deemed ineligible.", "Further, SBA still conducts eligibility examinations only of firms that have  already received a WOSB award. Restricting the samples in this way  limits SBA\u2019s ability to better understand the eligibility of businesses before  they apply for and are awarded contracts, as well as its ability to detect  and prevent potential fraud.", "We recognize that SBA has made some effort to address our  recommendation by documenting procedures for conducting annual  eligibility examinations of WOSB firms. However, without maintaining  reliable information on the results of eligibility examinations, developing  procedures for analyzing results, and expanding the sample of  businesses to be examined to include those that did not receive  contracts, SBA limits the value of its eligibility examinations and its ability  to reduce ineligibility among businesses registered to participate in the  WOSB program. Leading fraud risk management practices state that  federal program managers should design control activities that focus on  fraud prevention over detection and response, to the extent possible.  The deficiencies in SBA\u2019s oversight of the WOSB program limit SBA\u2019s  ability to identify potential fraud risks and develop any additional control  activities needed to address these risks. As a result, the program may  continue to be exposed to the risk of ineligible businesses receiving set- aside contracts. In addition, in light of these continued deficiencies, the  implementation of sole-source authority without addressing the other  changes made by the 2015 NDAA could increase program risk. For these  reasons, we maintain that our previous recommendation that SBA  enhance its WOSB eligibility examination procedures should be  addressed.", "In addition, similar to previous findings from SBA\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, our March 2019 report found that about 3.5 percent of contracts  using a WOSB set-aside were awarded for ineligible goods or services  from April 2011 through June 2018. At that time, SBA was not reviewing  contracting data that could identify this problem and inform SBA which  agencies making awards may need targeted outreach or training. As a  result, we found that SBA could not provide reasonable assurance that  WOSB program requirements were being met and that the program was  meeting its goals. We recommended that SBA develop a process for  periodically reviewing the extent to which WOSB program set-asides are  awarded for ineligible goods or services and use the results to address  identified issues, such as through targeted outreach or training to  agencies making awards under the ineligible codes. In early May 2019,  SBA said that it had initiated such efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Not Yet Implemented Recommendations to Improve the HUBZone Certification Process", "paragraphs": ["In September 2018, we found that although SBA had adopted criteria and  guidance for a risk-based approach to certifying and recertifying firms for  the HUBZone program in March 2017, the extent to which it conducted a  risk assessment to inform its approach was unclear. In 2015, we found  that SBA lacked key controls for its recertification process and  recommended that SBA assess the process. In 2009, SBA increased  documentation requirements for certification but not recertification (which  determines continued program eligibility every 3 years). In March 2017,  SBA changed its recertification criteria and guidance to require firms with  $1 million or more in HUBZone contract awards to provide documentation  to support continuing eligibility. During our work for the September 2018  report, SBA officials stated they had completed a risk assessment of the  HUBZone recertification process, but did not provide us with  documentation on when they performed the risk assessment, which risks  were identified and considered, or what analysis established the $1  million threshold. As of May 2019, SBA had not provided documentation  showing that it had performed the risk assessment, but we maintain that  an assessment of the recertification process would help inform a risk- based approach to reviewing and verifying information from firms that  appear to pose the most risk to the program. In addition, SBA had not  provided documentation showing that a technology-based solution  designed to address some of the ongoing challenges with the  recertification process had been implemented. SBA officials had  previously estimated this solution would be available first in spring 2017  and then by the end of calendar year 2017.", "We also found in our September 2018 report that, based on our review of  case files for a nongeneralizable sample of 12 firms in Puerto Rico that  received HUBZone certification between March 2017 and March 2018,  SBA did not consistently document or follow its policies and procedures  for certification reviews:", "SBA did not have complete documentation in nine of 12 cases.

SBA (1) reduced the share of the total scorecard grade devoted to prime  contracting achievement, which is the dollar amount of contracts awarded  directly to small businesses, and (2) added an element calculating  changes in the number of small businesses receiving prime contracts.  SBA made two additional revisions\u2014with input from other agencies\u2019  representatives\u2014to increase the share of subcontracting achievement  results and the share of the peer review of required activities designed to  facilitate small business procurement. In July 2018, officials said they had  begun developing a plan to evaluate the effects of the revised scorecard  methodology but did not provide a draft plan.
