Although the Navy to date has  not updated these life-cycle cost estimates to reflect changes in the  program, the Navy adjusted the estimates for inflation to fiscal year 2014  dollars. Using these data, we calculated an annual per ship life-cycle cost  estimate for the combined LCS seaframes and mission modules to  account for differences in the number of ships and mission modules and  their respective expected service lives. We also obtained life-cycle cost  data in fiscal year 2014 dollars from the Navy for five surface ships, patrol  coastal ships, mine countermeasures ships, frigates, destroyers, and  cruisers, and used these data to calculate an annual per ship life-cycle  cost estimate for each of these five surface ships.

The mission modules, when combined with the  mission-module crew and an aviation detachment\u2014consisting of an MH- 60 helicopter and its flight and support crew, as well as vertical takeoff  unmanned aerial vehicles\u2014make up a mission package. The LCS is  designed to embark with only one mission package at a time.", "The Navy envisioned the LCS as a ship that could operate with a much  smaller crew size than other surface combatants, with preventative  maintenance duties performed primarily by contractors. This concept  would in turn lead to lower operations and support costs, which  traditionally account for about 70 percent of the total cost over a ship\u2019s  lifetime. The Navy planned the LCS to have a core crew of 40 sailors and  mission-module crews of 15 to 20 sailors\u2014far fewer than the crew of  approximately 170 sailors for a frigate and approximately 250 sailors for a  destroyer. To meet its operational, maintenance, support, and  administrative needs with these reduced manning levels, the Navy is  developing a new maintenance and support concept. Unlike other ships,  the LCS would have no onboard administrative personnel and a limited  ability to conduct maintenance at sea; instead, it would rely heavily on  shore-based support, including flyaway maintenance teams made up of  contractors flown in to conduct scheduled maintenance. The Navy also  opted to use a rotational crewing concept, whereby three crews rotate  between two ships, one of which is forward deployed. The Navy has used  a different form of rotational crewing on ballistic missile submarines for  years but has not used it widely on surface combatants.", "As of July 2014, the Navy has accepted delivery of four LCS seaframes\u2014 two of each variant\u2014and has already contracted for 20 more seaframes  (10 of each variant).

Moreover, because the Navy has  acknowledged it has made several programmatic changes to LCS  concepts that will increase the overall costs to operate and sustain the  ship class, it is likely that the per ship, per year life-cycle costs for the  program will be higher than this current estimate.", "We analyzed the Navy\u2019s life-cycle cost estimates for LCS seaframes  (2011) and mission modules (2013), which the Navy adjusted for inflation  to fiscal year 2014 dollars, and used updated Navy life-cycle cost  estimates provided in April 2014 by Naval Sea Systems Command for  patrol coastal ships, mine countermeasures ships, frigates, destroyers,  and cruisers. These ships were selected for comparison because they have been in the surface fleet for decades and historical cost data are  readily available, and they all conduct at least one mission that the LCS is  also expected to perform. We calculated the life-cycle costs on a per ship  annualized basis to account for differences in the number of ships and  expected service life of each class. As shown in figure 5, we found that  per ship life-cycle costs per year for the LCS program are nearing or may  exceed those for other surface ships, including guided-missile frigates  and multimission destroyers.", "We are providing a descriptive comparison of annual life-cycle costs per  ship using available data and are not assessing the relative benefits and  capabilities of these various ship classes. Navy officials point out that the  below estimates may not include the full costs of developing,  modernizing, and sustaining software and combat systems installed on  the surface ships we use for comparative purposes (e.g., Aegis ballistic  missile defense system used on cruisers and destroyers). Additionally,  officials stated that the acquisition costs presented are not to be  interpreted as replacement costs since a replacement value for the  specific ship would have to take into account changes in productivity,  design specifications, and legislative and contracting environments.  Despite the inherent difficulties associated with comparing the life-cycle  costs of various surface ships with differing capabilities and mission sets,  and at different points in their respective service lives, we believe this  analysis is useful because it provides a framework for comparing the life- cycle cost estimates of various surface ships on a per ship, per year  basis, thereby accounting for variations in expected service life and the  number of ships. For an overview of the surface ships used in figure 5,  including their missions and crew sizes, see appendix IV. We used the  Navy\u2019s expected ship service lives of record, although the Navy has made  decisions to retire vessels before they\u2019ve reached their expected service  lives in some instances and has extended the service lives of other  vessels, such as destroyers. For LCS seaframes, the Navy used a 25- year expected service life to calculate life-cycle costs, which is an  average of the 20-year service-life threshold and 30-year service-life  objective outlined in key performance parameters.", "Although the LCS has been identified by the Navy as a low-cost  alternative to other surface ship classes, the available data indicate that  the costs of the LCS may exceed or closely align with the costs of other  multimission surface ships with larger crews. Without comprehensive life- cycle cost estimates, the Navy may be hindered in its ability to evaluate  the merits of investing in LCS ships compared with other alternatives,  conduct long-term budgetary planning, or determine the level of  resources required to implement the program in accordance with the LCS  concept of operations.", "In 2013, we recommended that the Navy collect actual operational data  on the Independence variant and update operations and support cost  estimates for both variants prior to contracting for additional LCS ships in  2016. Our work shows that the Navy still lacks operational data and that  life-cycle cost estimates are still not comprehensive. We continue to  believe that the Navy should have greater clarity on the performance of its  operational concepts and greater confidence in its cost estimates before it  enters into contracts for additional LCS ships."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Defense  (DOD) noted it is concerned with the conclusions drawn from the analysis  of life-cycle cost data across ship classes.

DOD also provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate.", "In its comments, DOD noted differences in the scope of cost data across  the ship classes and differences in life-cycle phases among the ship  classes included in our life-cycle cost analysis. For example, DOD  commented that there are gaps in the Navy\u2019s record keeping for  operations and support costs, so that some potential costs may not be  captured in the estimates the Navy provided us, such as system  modernization, software maintenance, and program startup, which could  understate the costs of the other surface ships. However, these data are  the most comprehensive operations and support cost data that the Navy  could provide us.

To  do this, we reviewed cost estimates in the current LCS Seaframe  Program Life Cycle Cost Estimate (2011) and the LCS Mission Module  Program Life Cycle Cost Estimate (2013), both prepared by the cost- estimating division of the Naval Sea Systems Command, and determined  that these are the latest estimates available from the Navy.

Using these data, we  calculated an annual per ship life-cycle cost estimate for the combined  LCS seaframes and mission modules to account for differences in the  number of ships and mission modules and their respective expected  service lives. We also obtained life-cycle cost data in fiscal year 2014  dollars from the Navy for five surface ships (patrol coastal ships, mine  countermeasures ships, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers) and used  these data to calculate an annual per-ship life-cycle cost estimate for  each of these five surface ships so as to account for differences in the  number of ships and their expected service lives.

The minimal crew size drives many of the  other LCS concepts, since LCS sailors are expected to spend most of  their time operating the ship rather than performing training, maintenance,  or administrative functions. The last revision of the LCS wholeness  concept of operations, approved in January 2013, called for a core crew  size of 40 and mission-module crews of 15 to 19 sailors. The maximum  number of core crew members allowed by LCS key performance  parameters is 50.beyond 50, the ships would require significant design changes. A number  of internal Navy reports issued in 2012 raised concerns about the  adequacy of a 40-member core crew size, with crew fatigue and overwork   To add berthing spaces for additional crew members  as potential negative effects of this manning concept. In response to  these concerns, the Navy added 10 sailors to the USS Freedom core  crew deploying to Singapore as part of a pilot program. Navy leadership  determined early in the deployment that these additional crew members  were helpful in performing maintenance and watch-standing duties, and  decided to permanently increase LCS core crews to 50 sailors.

Specifically, the Center for Naval Analyses found that Freedom crews  averaged about 6 hours of sleep per day compared to the Navy standard  of 8 hours; some key departments, such as engineering and operations,  averaged even fewer. While Navy officials told us that sailors do not  realistically expect 8 hours of sleep while they are under way and may  choose to have more down time rather than sleep, the LCS must adhere  to Navy manpower standards, including those for crewmember fatigue  levels and workload hours found in Navy standard workweeks. These  standards are set to minimize potential adverse effects on morale,  retention, and safety. Crew members told us that their sleep hours  decreased significantly during major equipment casualties, particularly  those affecting the ship\u2019s diesel generators and other engineering  systems. Navy officials said that follow-on ships have been outfitted with  different systems that are supposed to be more reliable than those on  Freedom, which should decrease the amount of corrective maintenance  required, and thereby decrease crew fatigue on future deployments.  However, as previously discussed, these systems have not been fully  tested or operated on the LCS, and their reliability has yet to be proven by  actual experience.", "Additionally, we found that core crews depended heavily on sailors from  the surface warfare mission-module crew to perform watch standing,  training drills, and engineering maintenance over the course of the  deployment. This is a departure from what was envisioned in the concept  of operations, and creates a situation that may not be sustainable under a  different pace of operations or with a different mission module deployed.  Officers and enlisted sailors from both core and mission-module crews  told us that mission-module sailors were heavily leveraged to help  complete core crew functions and that the crews were fully integrated.  The crews added that the surface warfare mission module is uniquely  qualified to help with core crew functions, since these sailors\u2019 billet  structure\u2014their mix of skills and expertise\u2014completely aligns with that of  the core crew. For example, there are engineers in the surface-warfare  mission-module crew to operate and maintain the motors on the module\u2019s  rigid-hull inflatable boats. Since these boats are not part of the  antisubmarine warfare mission modules, there are no engineers in those  crews. Sailors from the core crews\u2019 engineering department told us they  depended on the qualified mission-module engineers to assist them and  were at a loss as to how the engineering department would function  effectively if deployed with the other mission modules. Figure 6 shows the  extent of overlap between the core crew billets and the three mission- module crew billets.", "Core crews also relied heavily on support from the maintenance  contractors embarked during the course of the deployment. Program  officials and crew members cited these contractors\u2019 expertise with  engineering systems and said they were of great assistance, essentially  becoming additional highly experienced engineers always on watch in the  engineering space. Engineering department crew members told us that  the ship would not have gotten under way if not for these contractors.  Program officials do not yet know whether contractors will always be  embarked during future LCS deployments, but they said that the Navy  utilizes contractors on other surface combatants when they are deployed  and underway.

The 10 sailors added  to the crew as part of the \u201cplus-up\u201d pilot program were identified in the  months leading up to the March 2013 deployment date and did not  undergo LCS-specific training or complete their qualifications prior to  deploying. Some of these 10 additional crew members were junior sailors  and told us they had limited sailing experience but were ultimately able to  earn their qualifications over the course of the deployment. More- experienced core crew members who completed LCS training were in  part responsible for instructing and training these additional 10 sailors, a  collateral duty not accounted for within the standard LCS workday or  envisioned in the LCS concept of operations. The Navy is in the process  of reviewing and defining training needed for the 10 additional sailors, but  since the training pipeline for LCS service can take about 2 years to  complete, the Navy risks repeating this situation on upcoming  deployments.", "While the Navy is reviewing training for the late-addition ensigns and the  10 \u201cplus-up\u201d sailors, it considers the training process to have been  validated by the Freedom deployment, since no major training omissions  or deficiencies were identified. However, we found that in addition to the  10 \u201cplus-up\u201d sailors not receiving all training prior to deployment, sailors  from the original 40-person crews were training over the course of the  deployment as well. The Center for Naval Analyses found that more than  half of the qualification and instructed training that occurred during the  deployment was for the original core crews, not the crew plus-ups. The  Center for Naval Analyses added that sailors will train no matter what\u2014at  times out of necessity but also to maintain proficiency and in support of  career development and well-being\u2014and that time must be made  available for training during deployments. The Center for Naval Analyses  calculated the average amount of training conducted by all crew members  over the course of the deployment to be about an hour a day. However,  this hour is unaccounted for in the Navy\u2019s expected LCS workday and  detracts from the time a sailor could otherwise be resting or performing  other collateral duties. The most common reasons for performing training,  drills, and underway instruction while deployed were to cover training that  was not provided prior to the deployment or to maintain proficiency. LCS  program officials explained that much of this training was planned to be  conducted during the deployment, and that underway training will likely  continue until the new curriculum is fully implemented over the next  several years. However, requiring LCS sailors to train while deployed was  not envisioned in the LCS wholeness concept of operations, and it can  exacerbate crew fatigue levels and negatively affect performance, morale,  retention, safety, and the operational readiness of the ship.", "In addition to sailors not being fully trained prior to deployment, we heard  concerns about the quality of the training the sailors received. The Navy  is aware of this and is investing heavily in virtual reality\u2013based training  simulations and a curriculum to prepare sailors for LCS service as  envisioned in the concept of operations. Specifically, the Navy has  budgeted for construction of another LCS training facility in Mayport,  Florida, and awarded several contracts valued up to $300 million to  develop training simulations. While the final LCS training infrastructure is  being developed, the program is training sailors through a combination of  classroom instruction, vendor training (whereby contractors or original- equipment manufacturers train sailors on how to operate certain  equipment), shore-based trainers, and very limited on-hull \u201cschool ship  periods\u201d to complete the qualification and certification process. Enlisted  sailors from both core crews across ship departments expressed general  dissatisfaction with the LCS training they received prior to the  deployment. Some cited the obsolescence of vendor training and the  limited utility of the 3-week LCS Academy in preparing them to serve on  the LCS, and others stated that insufficient training left them ill-prepared  to deal with contingencies on the deployment. Freedom officers said that  it will take time for training to adapt to the needs of LCS sailors, but that it  would make sense to cut the training that is not proving useful to LCS  sailors in the short term until a more-tailored curriculum is developed.  Navy training officials told us that they are aware of some of the quality  issues with the current training and are attempting to make reasonable  improvements that are cost-effective, but they pointed out that this interim  training will be phased out over the next several years. While the program  seeks to have useful and applicable training available for sailors  progressing through the training pipeline now, the officials added that it  would not be prudent to make major investments to overhaul temporary  training.", "Navy officials told us that they are in the process of reviewing a revised  LCS training plan that should be released in 2014. The training plan will  lay out the schedule and process for replacing current training with the  new simulations being developed. While this plan was not released early  enough for inclusion in our review, earlier versions of LCS training plans  did not include measures of effectiveness or training effectiveness- evaluation plans. In light of crew feedback on the inadequacy of current  training, and unless the Navy acts on this feedback and builds  effectiveness measures into its new training plan, it risks making  significant investments to develop training that will not meet LCS sailors\u2019  training needs. Additionally, the Navy risks deploying LCS crews that are  not properly qualified and certified, which in turn could negatively affect  the crews\u2019 ability to operate and maintain the ship and perform warfighting  duties as expected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintenance Risks and Navy Actions to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Because of the relatively small size of LCS crews, the maintenance  concept calls for contractors to perform most preventative maintenance  during regularly scheduled in-port periods. During the Singapore  deployment, USS Freedom executed this concept, returning to port every  25 days to undergo a 5-day preventative maintenance availability and  every 120 days for a more-intensive 2-week intermediate maintenance  availability. Flyaway maintenance teams of about 30 contractors were  flown to Singapore for the 5-day maintenance periods, and about 60-70  contractors for the 2-week periods. Because of the regular returns to  Singapore for maintenance availabilities, the USS Freedom had a  somewhat limited range in theater, and Navy officials noted that this rigid  maintenance periodicity limited operational flexibility. Navy officials  explained that this was a deliberate decision and that future deployments  will have a longer, more-flexible interval for scheduling in-port  maintenance. During the maintenance availabilities, there were some  maintenance checks that could not be completed because the needed  parts, tools, or equipment were not prepositioned by the contractor in  time. The Navy attributes some of these issues to changing the  maintenance schedule without enough lead time for the contractor to  adequately respond. The Navy notes that contractor execution rates  improved over the course of the deployment, and the Navy has  established an improved maintenance scheduling process that should  help prevent this problem on future deployments.", "Although contractors reportedly improved their positioning of materiel in  time for the scheduled maintenance periods, Navy officials and Freedom  crews said that lack of continuity in contractor personnel is an issue. They  said that it is not unusual to see different contractors sent every month to  perform scheduled maintenance. This presents a problem, since there is  a learning curve associated with new maintainers coming onboard to  execute their assigned maintenance checks. Freedom sailors told us that  the burden of teaching new contractors how to complete their checks  often falls on them, as does the task of repairing any equipment broken in  the course of an inexperienced or unqualified contractor trying to maintain  it. While Navy officials said that quality-assurance provisions will be  included in the maintenance contracts expected to be awarded later in  2014, officials acknowledged that these provisions may not address this  problem.", "Although contractors perform much of the preventative maintenance on  LCS, the crews are still responsible for performing limited checks  between scheduled maintenance periods. Sailors are largely responsible  for performing more-frequent daily or weekly maintenance checks, and  contractors for those that are required monthly or quarterly. During the  deployment, the Center for Naval Analyses reported that Freedom sailors  performed both scheduled and corrective maintenance actions each day  (see fig. 7).", "However, crew members told us that unexpected levels of maintenance  activities impacted crew fatigue levels. Navy officials stated this  maintenance effort reflects the materiel reliability issues that they say  have been remedied for follow-on LCS ships. Yet crew members told us  of several instances where some of their preventative maintenance  responsibilities would be better suited to contractors and other examples  of how some routine maintenance activities could be shifted from  contractors to crew. For example, members of the combat systems  department crew reported that approximately 90 percent of combat  systems spaces are sensitive and therefore require the presence of LCS  crew members in the workspace while contractors complete maintenance  on department systems. Crew members must essentially \u201cshadow\u201d  contractors as they perform such basic tasks as changing batteries and  cleaning filters. Each maintenance activity has a tag that specifies the  amount of time it should take to perform the check, and crew members  voiced frustration over having to watch contractors take the full amount of  time to perform the check even if they could have performed it in a  fraction of the time specified on the tag.", "A major action item in the LCS Plan of Action and Milestones calls for  developing an integrated and coordinated plan for the planning,  executing, tracking, reporting, and quality assurance of planned  maintenance between the ship\u2019s force, shore sailors, the LCS Squadron,  and contractors on both variants. However, this broad action item, as well  as another action item calling for the continuous review of maintenance  requirements, extends out to December 2015 for completion. Program  officials said that the current process for refining maintenance  requirements\u2014where changes in the frequency or responsibility for  maintenance actions is reviewed and approved by the Navy\u2019s in-service  engineering agents or through maintenance effectiveness reviews\u2014is  adequate, but added that the program is still working to develop a tool  that would allow better management and coordination of maintenance  activities. For example, greater visibility into the full scope of planned  maintenance work performed by both crew and contractor personnel  would allow program managers greater foresight into how and when  certain parts should be repaired or replaced.", "The Navy is implementing a pilot condition-based maintenance program,  whereby sensors installed on ship systems collect usage and reliability  data, with the intention of conducting maintenance based on the condition  of the equipment rather than according to a predetermined schedule. As  more data are collected on equipment failure rates by condition-based  maintenance sensors and as knowledge of LCS systems grows, the Navy  intends for some maintenance requirements to be eventually phased out  without increasing the risk of failure or sacrificing reliability. For example,  there are a number of shut-off valves on the Freedom variant with a  scheduled maintenance requirement to check them every month. These  could be continuously monitored by sensors rather than being checked by  a contractor or crew member on a monthly basis. The LCS program office  has plans to expand the condition-based maintenance program on other  LCS ships; for example, USS Fort Worth is being fitted with additional  sensors in preparation for its late 2014 deployment.", "The maintenance concept for LCS may be changed in the future. The  LCS program office requested that a business-case analysis be  conducted to develop a sustainment strategy that will provide the most  cost-effective solution for providing LCS maintenance outside the  continental United States. The analysis, completed in April 2013,  compared five alternatives to the current contractor-based maintenance  approach and recommended shifting responsibility from contractors to  shore-based Navy personnel to achieve cost savings and other  improvements. The Navy is exploring options to enact this  recommendation under different scenarios and plans to do so as more  LCSs are deployed to more forward operating stations. For example, the  Navy plans to use reservists to conduct some LCS maintenance in lieu of  contractors and intends to shift more maintenance responsibility to shore- based Navy personnel. However, program officials said that they may be  somewhat limited in carrying out the recommendation by statutory  maintenance requirements that govern how maintenance is performed  abroad for ships, such as the LCS, that are homeported in the United   The Navy is planning to award 5-year maintenance contracts  States.later this year, and officials said there will be enough flexibility built into  the contracts to allow experimentation with different maintenance  alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Logistics Risks and Navy Actions to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Shore-based support networks perform LCS logistics functions such as  administrative tasks, emergent repairs, and management of ship support  needs.

For example, the ship\u2019s crew did not follow  established distance support processes to address emergent  maintenance needs, resulting in significant opportunity costs and  duplication of effort. The LCS Squadron is revising its written instructions  to resolve this issue for future deployments. However, some of the  reporting duties that were supposed to be performed by shore support  teams under original distance support concepts\u2014such as reporting of  equipment casualties\u2014have now become crew responsibilities. Officials  said the time difference between San Diego and Singapore was creating  a lag in reporting and response times and cited this as a reason for  shifting some reporting duties back to the crew. As mentioned earlier,  adding additional responsibilities to an LCS sailor\u2019s already-full workday  may exacerbate crew fatigue and may require reallocation of workloads  or other revisions to the LCS concept of operations.", "We found several additional limitations of the LCS support infrastructure  over the course of the deployment. For example, the Navy noted that  existing Internet resources ashore were insufficient for managing  maintenance, and the Navy continues to explore options with the host  nation for improving connectivity. Another issue still being resolved is  finding adequate providers for facilities maintenance and ship cleaning,  as the services contracted for Freedom\u2019s deployment were not up to  sailors\u2019 expectations. The Navy would also prefer to have LCS hulls  cleaned while deployed and is in the process of determining a cost- effective way to execute this task in compliance with statutory  maintenance requirements. Finally, USS Freedom required nearly three  times as many underway refuelings as were scheduled. Navy  logisticians in Singapore scheduled seven at-sea refuelings for the  deployment but 18 were eventually required. LCS program officials say  that this was a scheduling error rather than an indication of higher-than- expected fuel burn rates. As the Navy gains more operational experience  in an overseas environment, it expects to learn additional lessons about  more-accurately scheduling LCS refuelings.", "Additionally, Navy officials acknowledged that the logistics footprint  needed to support four LCSs in Singapore by 2017 must be defined and  expanded over the next several years. The Navy is in the process of  determining the final logistics requirements to support additional ships at  Singapore and other forward operating stations; these efforts are  scheduled to be completed by April 2014. Currently, there is only a  temporary tension-fabric structure in Singapore to house spare parts,  tools, and working space for maintenance contractors, but this temporary  structure does not have adequate space to house support elements for  four LCS of both variants, according to Navy officials. Permanent support  facilities have not been built in Singapore or other potential forward  operating stations, and the lack of operational data on the Independence  variant limits the Navy\u2019s ability to accurately plan for logistics support  when both variants deploy. Without a clear understanding of the logistics  needs of both variants, the Navy risks being underprepared to support  both while forward deployed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Overview of Navy Surface Ships Used in Life-Cycle Cost Comparison", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Suzanne Wren, Assistant  Director; Steven Banovac; Kristine Hassinger; Joanne Landesman; Carol  Petersen; Michael Silver; Amie Steele; Sabrina Streagle; Grant Sutton;  and Chris Watson made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Navy Shipbuilding: Significant Investments in the Littoral Combat Ship  Continue Amid Substantial Unknowns about Capabilities, Use, and Cost.
