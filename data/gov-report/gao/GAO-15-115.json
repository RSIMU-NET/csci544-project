In fiscal year 2013, DOD reported spending more than $170  billion on contract services, constituting more than half of the  department\u2019s total acquisition spending. Like the rest of the federal  government, DOD is operating in a constrained budget environment and  is facing difficult decisions about how to allocate its resources, including  the appropriate balance between civilian and contractor staff to meet  mission requirements. Our prior work has shown that there are benefits  to using contractors to perform services for the government.

The goal was to ensure DOD achieved expected savings from  planned reductions to its workforce and help maintain the appropriate  balance between the civilian and contractor workforce. Among other  things, the Act set limits on DOD\u2019s total obligations for contract services  and required the Secretary of Defense to issue guidance to the military  departments and defense agencies to reduce funding for contracts for the  performance of functions that are closely associated with inherently  governmental. The Act further required that the Secretary issue guidance  to the military departments and defense agencies to reduce funding for  staff augmentation contracts, which it defined, in relevant part, as  contracts for personnel who are subject to the direction of a government  official other than the contracting officer for the contract.", "You asked us to review DOD\u2019s implementation of the section 808  provisions in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The House Armed Services  Committee Report accompanying a bill for the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015  also mandated that GAO review DOD\u2019s implementation of the section  808, as amended.

Specifically, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s section 808 guidance to identify steps taken by DOD to implement  the statutory requirements. Further, we analyzed DOD Comptroller  budget and obligation data for all DOD components\u2014military  departments and defense agencies\u2014for fiscal years 2010, 2012, and  2013 to assess DOD\u2019s methodology for determining the annual spending  limit and the extent to which DOD and individual components adhered to  this mandated limit. We compared these obligation data to services  obligations reported in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation and found that they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To identify data available to establish a baseline for mandated  funding reductions in closely associated with inherently governmental  functions we reviewed DOD guidance, which identified fiscal year 2011  inventory of contracted services data as the basis to measure reductions  in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. We reviewed prior GAO reports on DOD\u2019s  annual inventory of contracted services and analyzed available data from  29 components for fiscal year 2011. To identify the steps taken by each  component to reduce funding of closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, we analyzed available data from 32 components  for fiscal year 2012. To determine the extent to which the military  departments and selected defense agencies achieved mandated  reductions in staff augmentation funding, we reviewed DOD\u2019s section 808  guidance and available data. In addition, for all objectives, we also  discussed implementation efforts with officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics;  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness (Personnel and Readiness); the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller); and the departments of the Army, Navy, and Air  Force.

For  example, in August 2010, the Secretary of Defense directed DOD to  undertake department-wide efficiency initiatives to reduce duplication,  overhead, and excess across the department. Among other things, the  efficiency initiatives specified that DOD should freeze (or cap) the civilian  workforce at the fiscal year 2010 levels for fiscal years 2011 through  2013.", "In 2012 the Senate Committee on Armed Services cited the need to  maintain the appropriate balance between the civilian and contract  workforce and to achieve the expected savings from reductions in both  workforces, and Congress enacted provisions to limit DOD\u2019s service  contracts. Section 808 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 limited DOD\u2019s  total obligations for contract services in 2012 and 2013 to the amount  requested for these services in the fiscal year 2010 President\u2019s Budget  Request. The limit does not apply to contract services for military  construction, research and development, and services funded for  overseas contingency operations. Additionally, it provides for two  adjustments to the spending limit above fiscal year 2010 budgeted levels.  DOD may adjust contract services spending above 2010 levels to account  for (1) funding increases associated with contract services that were  transferred from overseas contingency operations to the base budget and  (2) the cost of additional civilian personnel positions over fiscal year 2010  levels. As shown in table 1, DOD identified an aggregate spending limit of  $56.47 billion for fiscal year 2012 and $57.46 billion for fiscal year 2013.", "The spending limit identified in the Act applied to the entire department;  therefore, components could exceed their individual targets but DOD  would still be in compliance with the law if total spending for contract  services across the entire department was less than the aggregate  spending limit.

In fiscal year 2002, Congress enacted  section 2330a of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which required the Secretary  of Defense to establish a data collection system to provide management  information on each purchase of services by a military department or  defense agency. In 2008, Congress amended section 2330a of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to require the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual  inventory of contracted services performed for or on behalf of DOD during  the preceding fiscal year. This annual inventory submission includes,  among other things, the number of contractor full time equivalents and the  associated direct labor cost for these positions. Following the  submission of the inventory, the secretaries of the military departments  and heads of the defense agencies are to complete a review of the  contracts identified in the inventory to ensure, among other things, that  the activities do not include inherently governmental functions\u2014which are  those that require discretion in applying government authority\u2014such as  the determination of budget policy. The review should also ensure that to  the maximum extent practicable, the activities do not include any closely  associated with inherently governmental functions, which are those that  may be at risk of becoming inherently governmental due to the manner in  which the contractor performs the work, among other things. Upon  completion of this review, the secretaries of the military departments and  heads of the defense agencies submit a certification letter to the Office of  Personnel and Readiness that outlines the results and any corrective  actions to be taken to ensure that contractors are not performing  inherently governmental functions and to monitor the use of contractors  for closely associated with inherently governmental functions.", "Section 808 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 further reinforced these  requirements by instructing DOD to issue guidance requiring the  components to reduce funding by 10 percent for fiscal years 2012 and  2013 for contracts identified with personnel performing closely associated  with inherently governmental functions. Section 808 also instructed DOD  to establish guidance to conduct a reduction of funding by 10 percent for  fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for contracts identified with personnel  performing on staff augmentation contracts, which it identifies, in relevant  part, as contracts for personnel who are subject to the direction of a  government official other than the contracting officer for the contract.  Unlike the aggregate spending limit, the statutory requirement for  guidance on reductions in funding for closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and staff augmentation are directed to each  component; therefore, the reductions are expected to take place at each  component, rather than an aggregate reduction across the department.  The section 808 requirement to reduce funding for closely associated with  inherently governmental functions and staff augmentation expired in  September 2013; however, Congress modified the requirements in  section 802 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014, extending the time period  for DOD to implement the full 20 percent reduction for both the closely  associated with inherently governmental and staff augmentation functions  through fiscal year 2014.

However, military department budget officials said that they spent more  on contract services in the last quarter of the fiscal year than budgeted  due to additional funding for contract services made available through  reprogramming, which allows for the shifting of funds for contract services  requirements that were not planned for the when the appropriation was  made.", "As shown in figure 3, the military departments have historically increased  contract services obligations during the last quarter of the fiscal year.

Throughout the year, Air Force Financial  Management officials monitored monthly spending reports and  communicated with commands to ensure that they adhered to their  targets and made adjustments to the allocation of funds among  commands when necessary. Additionally, these officials planned for  potential reprogramming and reviewed reprogramming actions to ensure  that they would not result in the Air Force exceeding its spending target,  as it did in fiscal year 2012. Similarly, DTRA spent less than its target in  fiscal year 2013, which DTRA Comptroller officials attributed to allocating  contract services spending targets among its organizations based on  annual budget estimates for contract services and monitoring periodic  reports on the execution of spending against these targets. Further,  DTRA Comptroller officials stated that they prioritize mission  requirements to ensure that the highest priority missions receive contract  services funds, while lower priority mission needs may not receive such  funds.", "The Army Budget Office also provided spending targets to each  command in fiscal year 2013; however, it did not solicit input from the  commands on their spending plans to inform these targets. An Army  manpower official said commands have generated contract services  spending estimates through the Army\u2019s inventory of contracted services  that could have been used by the budget office to inform contract services  targets. Further, without incorporating such information from the  commands, the Army Budget Office did not prioritize requirements to  assist commands\u2019 planning efforts to meet their spending targets. For  example, one Army command that we spoke with said it was difficult to  meet the spending target without additional guidance to prioritize the  types of services that should be reduced or eliminated to meet the target.  Instead, these targets were based on each command\u2019s contract services  spending in fiscal year 2012. In addition, according to an Army budget  official, the Army Budget Office does not typically communicate with  commands during the year to monitor spending, which limited the Army\u2019s  ability to ensure adherence to the spending target.

In fiscal year 2012, the  Army reported $4.5 billion in obligations associated with closely  associated with inherently governmental functions, showing a reduction of  nearly 50 percent when compared to the obligations reported in 2011.  However, Army manpower officials were not able to identify how these  reductions were achieved, but explained that their 2012 review  certification letter did not include complete input from all commands. For  example, the command that accounted for the largest reduction in these  functions from 2011 to 2012 attributed it to the transfer of responsibility for  these functions to another command.

For example, DOD\u2019s  guidance for the fiscal year 2011 inventory review instructed components  to review at least 50 percent of the contract actions reported in the  inventory to identify these functions, while guidance for fiscal year 2012  called for a review of 80 percent of contract functions. Further, officials  from the components reported various interpretations of the 80 percent  review guidance. For example, the Army and DLA reported reviewing 80  percent of the contract dollar amounts identified in their inventory, while  DTRA reported reviewing 80 percent of the contract awards or  modifications. In addition, the fiscal year 2013 guidance does not specify  the percent of contract actions or percent of total dollar amounts that  should be reviewed for 2013 and as a result continues to limit comparison  of data collected across fiscal years. In November 2014, we  recommended that DOD update its annual inventory review guidance to  clarify this review requirement and DOD agreed to update its guidance for  future years.", "The Office of Readiness and Force Management issued additional  guidance in May 2014 requiring components to identify the steps taken to  implement funding reductions in closely associated with inherently  governmental functions in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. If components did  not achieve the full 20 percent reduction for fiscal years 2012 and 2013,  they were also instructed to identify any additional carryover reductions to  be taken in fiscal year 2014 to achieve the full 20 percent reduction, as  required by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014. However, these carryover  reduction amounts will not be identified until fiscal year 2015, after the  statutory requirement to implement these additional reductions in 2014  has expired. In addition, it is unclear what data will be reported to  demonstrate compliance with section 808 given the lack of data from  2011 to establish a baseline for reductions and the differing selection  methodology used each year to identify these functions. We will assess  the data reported in the fiscal year 2013 inventory review certification  letters when they become available and report on results in fiscal year  2015.", "Given the lack of comparable inventory data, officials at some DOD  components that we spoke with identified other data sources to measure  these reductions during the fiscal year 2013 inventory review. For  example, DTRA officials relied on actual expenditures reported for  advisory and assistance services\u2014a subset of contract services recorded  in the department\u2019s financial system\u2014to show reductions in obligations  for closely associated with inherently governmental functions. According  to these officials, they relied on the advisory and assistance services  category due to the similarities between closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and the types of services captured by the  category, such as analyses or evaluations that support budget and  acquisition decisions. Further, advisory and assistance services have  been recorded in the annual budget since 1994, allowing DTRA officials  to budget a reduction and track spending in the category. Personnel and  Readiness officials agreed that the advisory and assistance budget  category provides an alternative to measure reductions, but noted that  these data have their own limitations. For example, we found in 2008 that  the identification of advisory and assistance services is subjective and  agencies experienced challenges linking obligations reported for these  categories to specific contracts to provide oversight. Based on the  challenges presented by the currently available data sources, the  Personnel and Readiness officials said that DOD does not currently have  the tools in place to measure funding reductions for specific contract  functions. Nevertheless, data collected through other available sources  may help DOD corroborate data obtained from prior inventory reviews  and assist in validating whether funding reductions for closely associated  with inherently governmental functions have been achieved for fiscal  years 2012 and 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which DOD Has Implemented Staff Augmentation Reductions Is Not Yet Known", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not yet determined if funding reductions in staff augmentation\u2014 contractors under the direction of a government official other than a  contracting officer\u2014were implemented due to insufficient guidance and  management attention. Section 808 instructs DOD to issue guidance to  the components to implement a 10 percent reduction in funding for staff  augmentation contracts and to identify responsible management officials  to ensure that reductions are achieved. DOD\u2019s section 808 guidance,  issued in June 2012, instructs each component to identify responsible  management officials to ensure that section 808 requirements, including  staff augmentation reductions, are met, but officials from only one of the  five components that we spoke with were able to clearly identify an official  responsible for implementing staff augmentation funding reductions. The  June 2012 guidance also identifies a number of officials, including  Comptroller and Personnel and Readiness officials, as points of contact  for questions on the implementation of the guidance. However, in  speaking with these officials, none considered themselves responsible for  oversight to ensure implementation of reductions in staff augmentation. In  the absence of this oversight, officials at some components stated that  they had not measured reductions in staff augmentation funding because  they had not been directed on how to report the results.", "DOD\u2019s section 808 guidance also lacked clarity in how reductions in staff  augmentation funding should be implemented and measured. The  guidance notes that these funding reductions were factored into budget  requests for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, but does not specify the  amounts of these budgeted reductions or the data source that should be  used to determine if the reduction was achieved. In response to section  802 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014 that requires DOD to implement  reductions in 2014 if they were not achieved in 2012 and 2013, DOD  issued supplemental guidance in May 2014 instructing components to  report on actions taken to implement staff augmentation reductions in  their fiscal year 2013 inventory review certification letters. However, this  guidance did not provide any direction to the components on how to apply  the statutes definition of staff augmentation or the data that should be  used to measure compliance with the requirement. As a result,  components that we spoke with provided varying interpretations of how to  report on the staff augmentation requirement and were still determining  how to report on these reductions in their 2013 inventory review  certification letters. For example,", "Army manpower officials planned to use a combination of inherently  governmental and authorized and unauthorized personal services  contractor data reported through the inventory review process.", "DTRA interpreted the definition of staff augmentation contained in the  law as synonymous with closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and measured the reduction using the  advisory and assistance services category tracked through the  department\u2019s financial system.", "DLA officials planned to identify staff augmentation funding using  select product service codes for professional, administrative, and  management support services from the Federal Procurement Data  System-Next Generation. However, they noted that it would be  challenging to manually verify if all contracts identified were in fact for  staff augmentation services.", "The results of the 2013 inventory review will not be reported until fiscal  year 2015, after the statutory requirement to implement reductions has  expired. As a result, if DOD components identify any additional reductions  needed to comply with section 808 they will have to be implemented  outside of the timeframes specified in section 808. In addition, as shown  above, the methods used to measure reductions will likely vary among  the components.

By inconsistently excluding categories of services and overestimating the  allowable spending, DOD did not accurately measure compliance with  contract services spending limits. Implementation of improved fiscal  controls by the Air Force helped DOD to better manage contract services  spending in fiscal year 2013, but wider use of effective fiscal controls by  all defense components could help DOD realize intended efficiencies and  effective management of contract services spending. The significant  discrepancies among the military departments\u2019 adherence to the contract  services spending targets signal that more could be done to ensure that  the department has the information necessary to budget and manage  contract services spending. Moreover, in the absence of the data  necessary to reliably measure reductions in funding associated with  closely associated with inherently governmental functions and staff  augmentation contracts, DOD is not a position to know whether required  reductions have been achieved.
