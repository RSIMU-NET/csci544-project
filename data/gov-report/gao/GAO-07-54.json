Over this period, drug companies spent less each year on DTC advertising ($4.2 billion in 2005) than on promotion to physicians ($7.2 billion in 2005) or research and development ($31.4 billion in 2005). Studies GAO reviewed suggest that DTC advertising has contributed to increases in drug spending and utilization, for example, by prompting consumers to request the advertised drugs from their physicians, who are generally responsive to these requests. Evidence suggests that the effect of DTC advertising on consumers can be both positive, such as encouraging them to talk to their doctors, and negative, such as increased use of advertised drugs when alternatives may be more appropriate. FDA reviews a small portion of the DTC materials it receives. To identify materials that have the greatest potential to impact public health, FDA has informal criteria to prioritize materials for review. However, FDA has not documented these criteria, does not apply them systematically to all of the materials it receives, and does not track information on its reviews. As a result, the agency cannot ensure that it is identifying or reviewing those materials that it would consider to be the highest priority. FDA has taken longer to draft and review regulatory letters and the agency has issued fewer letters per year since 2002, when legal review of all draft regulatory letters was first required. From 2002 through 2005, from the time FDA began drafting a regulatory letter for a violative DTC material, it took the agency an average of 4 months to issue a regulatory letter, compared with an average of 2 weeks from 1997 through 2001. FDA has issued about half as many regulatory letters per year since the 2002 policy change. The effectiveness of FDA's regulatory letters at halting the dissemination of violative DTC materials has been limited. The 19 regulatory letters FDA issued in 2004 and 2005 were issued an average of 8 months after the materials were first disseminated. By the time FDA issued these letters, companies had already discontinued use of more than half of the violative materials. When the cited materials were still being disseminated, drug companies complied with FDA's requests to remove the materials, and identified and removed other materials with similar claims. FDA's issuance of regulatory letters did not always prevent drug companies from later disseminating similar violative materials for the same drugs. These issues are not new. In 2002, GAO reported that, by delaying the issuance of regulatory letters, the 2002 policy change had adversely affected FDA's ability to enforce compliance. At that time, GAO recommended, and FDA agreed, that letters be issued more quickly. GAO continues to believe this is necessary in order to limit consumers' exposure to false or misleading advertising."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Spending on prescription drugs, which accounted for about 11 percent of  total health care spending in 2004, has increased more rapidly since 1997  than any other component of health care spending in the United States.  One factor, among many, that has been cited as contributing to this trend  is the advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers. Direct-to- consumer (DTC) advertising includes a range of media, such as television,  radio, magazines, newspapers, and the Internet. The pharmaceutical  industry spent more than $4.2 billion in 2005 to advertise prescription  drugs to consumers. Supporters of DTC advertising maintain that it  educates consumers, helps to get patients into needed treatment, and  saves money by reducing spending on other medical care. Critics contend  that it can be misleading, encourages inappropriate increases in  prescription drug use, and creates unnecessary costs for the U.S. health  care system.", "The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) regulates the promotion and advertising of  prescription drugs, including DTC materials and materials directed to  medical professionals, to ensure that they are not false or misleading and  otherwise comply with applicable laws and regulations. This oversight  function is carried out by the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and  Communications (DDMAC) within FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and  Research. FDA regulations require that drug companies submit final  advertising materials to FDA at the time they are first disseminated to the  public. In addition, drug companies sometimes voluntarily submit draft  versions of DTC advertising materials to FDA prior to their release in  order to obtain advisory comments from the agency.", "If FDA identifies a violation in a disseminated DTC advertisement, such as  a false or misleading safety or effectiveness claim, the agency may issue a  regulatory letter. In these letters, FDA asks drug companies to take  specific actions such as stopping the dissemination of the advertisement  and, if FDA finds the violation to be particularly serious, running another  advertisement to correct misleading impressions left by the violative  advertisement. Regulatory letters for these violative advertisements are  drafted by DDMAC. Since January 31, 2002, at the direction of HHS, all  draft FDA regulatory letters, including the letters drafted by DDMAC, are  reviewed and approved by FDA\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC) before  they are issued in order to ensure the letters\u2019 \u201clegal sufficiency and  consistency with agency policy.\u201d In October 2002, we reported that the  2002 policy change had adversely affected FDA\u2019s ability to enforce  compliance with its regulations by delaying the issuance of regulatory  letters and potentially allowing misleading advertisements to continue to  be disseminated. As we noted in that report, issuing regulatory letters  quickly after violative materials are disseminated is a key component of  FDA\u2019s oversight of DTC advertising because any inaccurate impressions of  a drug that are caused by a misleading advertisement are minimized if the  advertisement is quickly removed. We recommended that FDA take action  to reduce the amount of time for internal review of draft regulatory letters  citing violative DTC materials. In its response to our recommendation,  FDA wrote that it had established a goal of issuing regulatory letters  \u201cwithin 15 working days of review at OCC.\u201d", "As a result of the increased spending on prescription drugs and concerns  about the effect of DTC advertising, you asked us to examine trends in  DTC advertising and FDA\u2019s regulation and oversight of this advertising. In  this report, we discuss (1) trends in pharmaceutical industry spending on  DTC advertising, as compared to promotion to medical professionals, and  research and development; (2) what is known about the relationship  between DTC advertising and prescription drug spending and utilization  patterns; (3) the DTC advertising materials FDA reviews; (4) the number  of FDA regulatory letters that cited DTC advertising materials and FDA\u2019s  process for issuing those letters; and (5) the effectiveness of FDA\u2019s  regulatory letters at limiting the dissemination of false or misleading DTC  advertising.", "To examine trends in pharmaceutical industry spending on DTC  advertising, promotion to medical professionals, and research and  development of new drugs, we reviewed publicly reported data. For  overall drug company spending from 1997 through 2005 on DTC  advertising and promotion to medical professionals, we obtained data  from IMS Health Inc. For 2005, we reviewed detailed data from Neilsen  Monitor-Plus on DTC advertising by prescription drug. Some types of  promotional spending on DTC advertising and promotion to medical  professionals\u2014such as spending on professional meetings and spending  on promotion to nurse practitioners\u2014are not captured in the data we  examined. In addition, we obtained data from the Pharmaceutical  Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)\u2014which represents U.S.  pharmaceutical research and biotechnology companies\u2014on drug  company spending for the research and development of new drugs from  1997 through 2005. Based on our review of related documentation and our  discussions with the data providers, we determined that the data we  present were sufficiently reliable for our use. To examine the relationship  between DTC advertising and prescription drug spending and utilization,  we reviewed 64 peer-reviewed journal articles, dissertations, and industry  articles published from 1982 through 2006. To examine the DTC  advertising materials that FDA reviews, we obtained data from FDA on the  number and type of advertising materials that it received and reviewed  from 1997 through 2005. Based on interviews with FDA officials and  reviewers and our review of related documentation, we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To  examine the number of FDA regulatory letters that cite violative DTC  advertising materials and FDA\u2019s process for issuing those letters, we  reviewed all regulatory letters issued by FDA from 1997 through 2005  citing prescription drug promotion. We identified 135 regulatory letters  issued during this period that cited one or more violative DTC advertising  materials. We also reviewed FDA documentation on the length of the  agency\u2019s process for issuing the 135 regulatory letters. Because FDA does  not track when the agency identifies a violation, we used the date on  which reviewers first began drafting a regulatory letter as the earliest date  in this process. To examine the effectiveness of the regulatory letters FDA  issued from 2004 through 2005 that cite violative DTC advertising  materials, we obtained additional details about the timeliness of the letters  and drug companies\u2019 compliance with any corrective action requested by  FDA. We reviewed the content of the regulatory letters FDA issued from  1997 through 2005 to identify the violations cited; we did not evaluate the  appropriateness of cited violations or evaluate the legal sufficiency of  these letters. We also did not examine the effectiveness of FDA\u2019s review of  draft materials at preventing potentially violative materials from being  disseminated. Finally, our examination included only DDMAC\u2019s oversight  of prescription drug promotion and advertising; we did not examine  oversight by other parts of FDA of promotion for other types of medical  products. (For additional information on our methodology, see app. I.) We  conducted our work from January 2006 through November 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The practice of advertising prescription drugs to consumers has been  controversial. The United States is one of only two nations that allow DTC  advertising (the other is New Zealand). In the United States, there have  been concerns about the impact of DTC advertising on prescription drug  spending and about potential safety issues, particularly with regard to the  advertising of new drugs. These concerns have led to calls to restrict DTC  advertising. For example, the Institute of Medicine recently recommended  that DTC advertising be restricted during the first two years a new drug is  marketed because some of the health risks of new drugs are not fully  understood.", "FDA regulates the content of all prescription drug advertising, whether  directed to consumers or medical professionals. Advertising that is  targeted to consumers includes both DTC and \u201cconsumer-directed\u201d  materials. DTC advertising includes, for example, broadcast  advertisements (such as those on television and radio), print  advertisements (such as those in magazines and newspapers), and Internet  advertisements (such as consumer advertising on drug companies\u2019 Web  sites). In contrast, consumer-directed advertisements are designed to be  given by medical professionals to consumers and include, for example,  patient brochures provided in doctors\u2019 offices.", "FDA requires that drug companies submit all final prescription drug  advertising materials to the agency when they are first disseminated to the  public. Drug companies are generally not required to submit advertising  materials to FDA before they are disseminated. However, drug  companies sometimes voluntarily submit draft DTC advertising materials  to FDA in order to obtain advisory comments from the agency.", "Advertising materials must contain a \u201ctrue statement\u201d of information  including a brief summary of side effects, contraindications, and the  effectiveness of the drug. To meet this requirement, advertising materials  must not be false or misleading, must present a fair balance of the risks  and benefits of the drug, and must present any facts that are material to  the use of the drug or claims made in the advertising. With the exception  of broadcast advertisements, materials must present all of the risks  described in the drug\u2019s approved labeling. Broadcast materials may  present only the major side effects and contraindications, provided the  materials make \u201cadequate provision\u201d to give consumers access to the  information in the drug\u2019s approved or permitted package labeling.", "Within FDA, DDMAC is responsible for implementing the laws and  regulations that apply to prescription drug advertising. The division, which  had 41 staff as of July 2006, is responsible for the oversight of both  advertising directed to consumers and advertising directed to medical  professionals. In March 2002, DDMAC created a DTC Review Group,  which is responsible for oversight of advertising materials that are  directed to consumers. Four Professional Review groups are responsible  for oversight of promotional materials targeted to medical professionals.  The DTC Review Group was allocated a group leader, four reviewers, and  two social scientists when it was created. This group\u2019s responsibilities  include reviewing final DTC materials and reviewing and providing  advisory comments on draft DTC materials. The group also monitors  television, magazines, and consumer advertising on drug companies\u2019 Web  sites to identify advertising materials that were not submitted to FDA at  the time they were first disseminated and reviews advertising materials  cited in complaints submitted by competitors, consumers, and others. The  two social scientists support reviewers in both the DTC and professional  groups in their assessment of the content of advertising materials and  conduct research related to DTC advertising, such as surveys of consumer  and physician attitudes toward DTC advertising.", "Once submitted to FDA, final and draft DTC advertising materials are  distributed to a reviewer in the DTC Review Group. For final materials, if  the reviewer identifies a concern, the agency determines whether it  represents a violation and merits a regulatory letter. For draft materials  submitted by drug companies, FDA may provide the drug company with  advisory comments to consider before the materials are disseminated to  consumers if, for example, the reviewers identify claims in materials that  could violate applicable laws and regulations.", "If FDA identifies violations in disseminated DTC materials, the agency can  issue two types of regulatory letters\u2014either a \u201cwarning letter\u201d or an  \u201cuntitled letter.\u201d Warning letters are typically issued for violations that may  lead FDA to pursue enforcement action if not corrected; untitled letters  are issued for violations that do not meet this threshold. FDA generally  posts issued letters on its Web site within several days of issuance. Both  types of letters\u2014which ranged from 2 to 9 pages, from 1997 through  2005\u2014cite the type of violation identified in the company\u2019s advertising  material, request that the company submit a written response to FDA  within 14 days, and request that the company take specific actions.  Untitled letters request that companies stop disseminating the cited  advertising materials and other advertising materials with the same or  similar claims. In addition, warning letters further request that the  company issue advertising materials to correct the misleading impressions  left by the violative advertising materials. While FDA does not have  explicit authority to require companies to act upon these letters, if the  companies continue to violate applicable laws or regulations, the agency  has other administrative and judicial enforcement avenues that could  encourage compliance or result in the product being taken off the market.  For example, FDA, through the Department of Justice, may seek  additional remedies in the courts resulting in the seizure of drugs deemed  to be misbranded because their advertising is false or misleading.", "As reviewers from the DTC Review Group draft the regulatory letters, they  sometimes obtain consultations from other FDA experts. For example,  they may consult with the social scientists in the DTC Review Group about  how consumers might interpret the violative materials, with the regulatory  counsel in DDMAC about regulatory issues, or with a medical officer in  FDA\u2019s Office of New Drugs who has knowledge of a drug\u2019s clinical testing  and approval history. The reviewers may also consult with reviewers in  DDMAC\u2019s Professional Review groups.", "The draft regulatory letters are subsequently reviewed by officials in  DDMAC, FDA\u2019s Office of Medical Policy (which oversees DDMAC), and  OCC. In January 2002, at the direction of the Deputy Secretary of HHS,  FDA implemented a policy change requiring OCC to review and approve  all regulatory letters prior to their issuance, including letters drafted by the  DTC Review Group, to ensure \u201clegal sufficiency and consistency with  agency policy.\u201d In its written comments on a draft of our 2002 report,  FDA stated that, prior to the policy change, there had been complaints that  FDA would not follow up on many of its regulatory letters, and that the  goal of the policy change was to promote voluntary compliance by  ensuring that drug companies who receive a regulatory letter understand  that the letter has undergone legal review and the agency is prepared to go  to court if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Company Spending on DTC Advertising Has Increased More Rapidly Than Spending on Promotion to Physicians or Research and Development", "paragraphs": ["The amount that drug companies spend on DTC advertising increased  twice as fast as spending on promotion to physicians or on research and  development. IMS Health estimated that, from 1997 through 2005,  spending on DTC advertising in the United States increased from   $1.1 billion to $4.2 billion\u2014an average annual increase of almost   20 percent. In contrast, over the same time period, IMS Health estimated  that spending on drug promotion to physicians increased by 9 percent  annually. Further, PhRMA reported that spending on the research and  development of new drugs increased by about 9 percent annually during  the same period. While spending on DTC advertising has grown rapidly,  companies continue to spend more on promotion to physicians and on  research and development. In addition, IMS Health reports that the retail  value of the free drug samples that companies provide to medical professionals to distribute to their patients has increased by about   15 percent annually. (See table 1.)", "Some types of promotional spending are not captured in the data we  report. For example, figures for spending on DTC advertising do not  include spending to develop and maintain drug companies\u2019 Web sites or  spending on sponsorship of sporting events. In addition, some spending on  promotion to medical professionals is not captured. For example, the data  do not include drug company spending on meetings and events, or  spending on promotion that targets medical professionals other than  physicians, such as nurse practitioners and physicians assistants.", "Drug companies concentrate their spending on DTC advertising in specific  forms of media and on relatively few drugs. Television and magazine  advertising represented about 94 percent of all spending on DTC  advertising in 2005. DTC advertising also tends to be concentrated on  relatively few brand name prescription drugs\u2014in 2005, the top 20 DTC  advertised drugs accounted for more than 50 percent of all spending on  DTC advertising. Many of the drugs most heavily advertised to consumers  in 2005 were for the treatment of chronic conditions, such as high  cholesterol, asthma, and allergies. Several of the drugs that have high  levels of DTC advertising are also often promoted to physicians, and the  drug companies often provide physicians with free samples of these drugs  to be given to consumers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Suggests DTC Advertising Increases Drug Spending and Utilization", "paragraphs": ["Studies we reviewed suggest that DTC advertising increases prescription  drug spending and utilization. It increases utilization by prompting some  consumers to request the drugs from their physicians and for some  physicians to prescribe the requested drugs. Evidence about increased  utilization prompted by DTC advertising suggests it can have both positive  and negative effects on consumers.", "Studies we reviewed suggest that DTC advertising can increase drug  spending for both the advertised drug and for other drugs that are used to  treat the same condition. Studies have found that, for many drugs, DTC  advertising increases sales of the drug itself, though the amount varies  substantially. Across the studies we examined, estimates for certain drugs  range from little change in sales to an increase of more than $6 for every  $1 spent to advertise the specific drug. For example, one study of 64 drugs  found a median increase in sales of $2.20 for every $1 spent on DTC  advertising. The impact of DTC advertising on the sales of an individual  drug depends on many factors. For example, one study found that, for the  63 drugs with the largest revenues in 2000, DTC advertising for newer  drugs\u2014launched in 1998 or 1999\u2014increased sales more than DTC  advertising for drugs launched from 1994 through 1997. Further, research  suggests that the sales of a specific drug may be affected by DTC  advertising for other drugs that treat the same condition. For example, one  study found that every $1,000 spent on advertising for allergy drugs was  associated with 24 new prescriptions for one specific allergy drug.", "The studies we reviewed also suggest that DTC advertising increases  prescribing by prompting some consumers to request the drugs from their  physicians, and that physicians are generally responsive to the patient  requests. Across the consumer and physician surveys that we reviewed,  about 90 percent of consumers report having seen a DTC advertisement.  Studies have found that about 30 percent (ranging from 18 to 44 percent)  of consumers who have seen DTC advertising reported discussing with  their physician either the condition seen in an advertisement or an  advertised drug. Of consumers who reported discussing an advertised  condition or drug, about one quarter (ranging from 7 to 35 percent)  reported requesting a prescription for the advertised drug. Surveys have  found that of consumers who requested a drug they saw advertised,  generally more than half (ranging from 21 to 84 percent) reported  receiving a prescription for the requested drug. The surveys we reviewed  found that between 2 and 7 percent of consumers who see a DTC  advertisement requested and ultimately received a prescription for the  advertised drug. Studies suggest that physicians are generally responsive  to consumers\u2019 requests, and that decisions to prescribe a drug are  influenced by a variety of factors in addition to a patient\u2019s medical  condition. For example, studies have found that advertising in medical  journals and visits from drug sales representatives may influence  physician prescribing to a greater degree than DTC advertising.", "Studies about DTC advertising and the increased utilization of prescription  drugs it can prompt suggest that its effect on consumers can be both  positive and negative. Some research suggests that DTC advertising can  have benefits for consumers, such as encouraging them to talk to their  doctors about previously undiagnosed conditions. For example, one study  found that DTC advertising is associated with the diagnosis and treatment  of high cholesterol with prescription drugs. Similarly, another study  found that DTC advertising for antidepressant drugs was associated with  an increase in the number of people diagnosed with depression and who  initiated drug therapy, as well as with a small increase in patients who  received the appropriate duration of therapy. In contrast, other research  suggests that DTC advertising can have negative effects, such as  encouraging increases in prescriptions for advertised drugs when  alternatives may be more appropriate. For example, one study found that  consumers who requested a pain medication as a result of DTC advertising  were more likely to get the requested drug than a drug more appropriate  for those consumers. Another study, using actors posing as patients,  found that 55 percent of those who presented with symptoms of  adjustment disorder and requested a specific antidepressant received an  antidepressant, even though treatment with drugs may not have been  appropriate given their symptoms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Reviews a Small Portion of DTC Materials and Cannot Ensure It Is Reviewing the Highest-Priority Materials", "paragraphs": ["FDA reviews a small portion of the increasingly large number of DTC  materials it receives.

However, OCC officials told us that the  review of DDMAC\u2019s draft regulatory letters is a small portion of their total  responsibilities and must be balanced with other requests, such as the  examination of legal issues surrounding the approval of a new drug.

However, the goal OCC established is not directly relevant to  the total amount of time it takes FDA to issue the regulatory letter once it  has been formally submitted to OCC because DDMAC must make changes  to the letters to respond to OCC\u2019s comments and OCC may review letters  more than once. For regulatory letters issued from 2004 through 2005 that  cited violative DTC materials, we found that, once DDMAC had formally  submitted a draft letter to OCC, it took an average of about 3 months for  the letter to receive final OCC concurrence and be issued.

Because FDA reviews a small portion of the final and draft  DTC materials that it receives, it is important that the agency have a  process to identify and review the materials that are the highest priority.  However, FDA lacks documented criteria for identifying and prioritizing  DTC materials for review, a process to ensure that criteria are applied  systematically to all materials received, and a system for tracking whether  materials have been reviewed.

First, HHS disagreed with our  recommendations that it systematically prioritize and track the DTC  advertising materials it reviews. HHS stated that DDMAC now reviews all  of some types of high priority DTC materials, especially final and draft  broadcast advertisements. HHS also commented that, although DDMAC  has not documented its selection criteria, those criteria are systematically  applied by its reviewers to determine workload priorities. HHS also noted  that reviewing each DTC material received according to selection criteria  and tracking the reviews that DDMAC conducts would require DDMAC\u2019s  staff to be vastly increased.", "We recognize that, with current staffing, DDMAC\u2019s DTC Review Group  cannot review in detail the more than 10,000 DTC materials that are  submitted to the agency each year and that DDMAC now focuses its  review efforts specifically on broadcast materials and draft materials.  However, it is because DDMAC\u2019s reviewers are only able to review  selected materials that we believe it is important for FDA to develop a  more complete and systematic process for screening the materials the  agency receives. To do so, the informal criteria that reviewers now  consider when prioritizing reviews should be formalized to help ensure  consistent application. Contrary to HHS\u2019s comments, we do not agree that  systematically applying these criteria would require that every DTC  material be reviewed in detail. Instead, FDA should apply the criteria as a  screening mechanism to all materials it receives. Furthermore, FDA  already has most of the information that would be necessary to establish a  system to screen submitted materials against these criteria. For instance,  when drug companies submit DTC materials to FDA, the agency records  information about the drug being advertised and the type of material  submitted. Additionally, for most of the priority criteria described in our  report, FDA already has information\u2014such as whether the drug has been  the subject of a previous regulatory letter or a recent label change\u2014 needed to determine how the criteria would apply to materials used to  promote a given drug.", "Second, HHS also expressed concern that our draft report criticized the  agency for the length of time it takes to issue regulatory letters and  declines in the number of letters issued since the policy change requiring  review by OCC, without adequately addressing the underlying purpose of  that review. HHS commented that its policy change has led to more  defensible regulatory letters and better compliance after issuance. We  agree with HHS that it is important to ensure that FDA\u2019s regulatory letters  are legally supportable, and, as HHS noted, we did not examine the effect  of the policy change on the legal sufficiency of the letters in this report.  However, we also believe that it is important for letters to be issued in a  timely manner if they are to have an impact on halting the dissemination of  the violative materials that the letters cite. In 2002, HHS agreed with the  recommendation of our earlier report that DTC regulatory letters be issued  more quickly. Nonetheless, as we noted in the draft of this report, we  found that violative advertisements had often been disseminated for  several months before letters were issued in 2004 and 2005. More than half  of the violative DTC materials cited in the 2004 and 2005 letters were no  longer being disseminated by the time the letter was issued.

These records also contained information about key meetings that  occurred, internal consultations requested by FDA\u2019s Division of Drug  Marketing, Advertising, and Communications (DDMAC), and the  comments obtained during the drafting and review of each regulatory  letter.
