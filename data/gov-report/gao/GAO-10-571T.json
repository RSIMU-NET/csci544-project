To address these allegations, the Director of CRD commissioned an external review of civil rights operations. In February 2009, the review made 53 recommendations to improve the civil rights operations. CRD developed action plans to address these recommendations. As requested, GAO reviewed (1) how Coast Guard's action plans align with EEOC's elements of a model equal employment opportunity program (2) how Coast Guard developed and reviewed its action plans, and (3) the extent to which Coast Guard's action plans align with generally accepted project management practices. To conduct this work GAO reviewed documentation from CRD, EEOC, internal control standards, and literature on project management. We also interviewed CRD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) six equal employment opportunity program model elements, CRD's action plans focus mainly on the first--agency leadership. Of the 29 action plans developed and implemented by CRD to address the 53 recommendations in the recent external review, almost half center on the leadership element. For example, one action plan involved scheduling training for headquarters and field staff. CRD took several steps to develop and review action plans to address recommendations from the external review, such as developing a functional review team, assigning project officers, meeting with the Commandant and agency leadership, and consulting the agency financial officer. However, CRD did not consistently document key decisions related to the development and review of the action plans as recommended in federal internal control standards. As a result, CRD lacks transparency and accountability to stakeholders. Lack of documentation also impedes the ability to track progress, make mid-course corrections, and illustrate to stakeholders that it is effectively solving these issues. According to CRD officials, their priority was to complete the action plans in a timely manner rather than ensure that development and review processes were documented. GAO reviewed four of CRD's action plans in relation to generally accepted project management practices to determine the extent to which recommended practices were followed. The recommended practices are: (1) identifying measurable performance goals, (2) defining specific tasks, (3)identifying the person(s) accountable, (4) identifying interim milestones and checkpoints, (5) identifying the needed resources, (6)consulting stakeholders, and (7) defining how to evaluate success. The selected action plans showed some elements of the project management practices, such as identifying accountable individuals, but fell short in relation to other elements. Specifically, performance goals were identified in the form of a product, such as development of a manual, rather than in relation to a desired outcome, such as demonstrating an increase in the number of staff who know how to properly safeguard personal information. All four action plans we reviewed lacked plans for evaluating their success. CDR officials stated that they were more focused on completing the plans rather than evaluating them, but early evaluation can identify and guide mid-course corrections to ensure positive change."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the approach the Civil Rights  Directorate (CRD) of the U.S. Coast Guard has taken to improve the  operations of its civil rights program. According to CRD, their mission is to  foster and maintain a model workplace which supports mission execution.  To accomplish this mission, CRD manages the Coast Guard Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) program for civilian employees and the  Equal Opportunity (EO) program for its military members. In advancement  of these programs, CRD provides services such as an intake, mediation,  and review process for military and civilian complaints for all Coast Guard  personnel.", "Under a prior Director, two separate external reviews of the civil rights  operations made recommendations for improvement related to the CRD\u2019s  organizational structure, complaint processes, and program effectiveness.  More recently, allegations of management weaknesses, unsecured  personal information, and employee dissatisfaction have been made  against CRD. The current CRD Director commissioned a third external  review and evaluation in September 2008 to improve the operations of the  civil rights program. In February 2009, Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH)  completed this review and made 53 recommendations, which were similar  to those of the previous reports. The Director of CRD subsequently  developed action plans to address these recommendations.", "As requested, my testimony today will describe (1) how Coast Guard\u2019s  action plans align with the elements of a model equal employment  opportunity program, (2) how Coast Guard developed and reviewed its  action plans, and (3) the extent to which Coast Guard\u2019s action plans align  with generally accepted project management practices.", "To address all of the objectives, we reviewed the 2009 BAH report and  recommendations and selected CRD action plans and supporting  documentation to address the recommendations. In addition, to identify  how Coast Guard\u2019s action plans focus on the elements of a model EEO  program, we reviewed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s  (EEOC) Management Directive-715 (MD-715), which established the  elements. In the absence of an EO framework of model elements, and  given that CRD stated they apply the EEO model elements to all Coast  Guard personnel, including military, we have used the EEO model  elements framework to organize the actions plans.", "To describe how the Coast Guard developed and established a project  management process for its action plans, we obtained documentation from  CRD officials on their organizational structure and review processes and  interviewed CRD officials to supplement the documentation. To determine  the extent to which Coast Guard\u2019s action plans are aligned with generally  accepted project management practices, we reviewed prior GAO reports  and the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, and  also conducted an external literature review to identify elements of  successful project planning and implementation. Subsequently, we  identified and adapted seven practices that are associated with generally  accepted project management practices. We analyzed the extent to which  selected action plans contained seven practices associated with generally  accepted project management practices. We also reviewed our prior work  on the Coast Guard\u2019s modernization program for context regarding the  Civil Rights Directorate\u2019s restructuring action plan. We conducted semi- structured interviews with Coast Guard officials responsible for the  design, implementation, and approval of action plans to address the  recommendations.", "As part of our assessment, we selected and reviewed four action plans that  are related to key issues identified in the external review. For example, the  first three action plans relate to improving the consistency of EO/EEO  service delivery throughout Coast Guard\u2014a major issue identified in the  third party review. The selected plans encompass actions on 13 of the 53  recommendations and address major concerns with CRD\u2019s operations. We  selected the following action plans:    Completing a New Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Handbook;    Restructuring Civil Rights Operations;    Revising the EO Manual; and    Training to Address Office Climate.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2009 through April  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "In brief, nearly half of the action plans align with strengthening the  demonstrated commitment from leadership. Leadership commitment is an  essential element of a model EEO program. While action plans and  leadership commitment are critical, only effective implementation of  solutions will resolve the CRD\u2019s long-standing issues. According to CRD  officials, their priority was to address the recommendations and complete  the planning and implementation of action plans in a timely manner.  Although CRD established a planning and process management control  group and focused on implementing and completing the action plans  quickly, in many cases the CRD action plans lack documentation  important to internal controls, and these plans could be improved by  defining measurable outcome goals and plans for evaluation of action plan  results. Without internal controls, such as timely and reliable  documentation, CRD weakens transparency to stakeholders and loses a  historical record of its implementation approach. Based on our review of  the selected action plans, we recommend that, going forward, CRD:   (1) ensure internal controls are in place to maintain the documentation  necessary to facilitate oversight and course corrections as plans are  designed and implemented, (2) establish measurable performance goals  for the action plans to support the management decision as to the  completion status of the action plans, and (3) define an evaluation plan for  each action plan to assess the degree to which the plan yielded the  intended outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is one of the five armed forces of the United States and  the only military organization within the Department of Homeland  Security.

Under the EEO program, CRD is  responsible for ensuring Coast Guard compliance with the federal statutes  prohibiting employment discrimination as well as EEOC\u2019s regulations and  directives, including MD-715, which explains the basic elements necessary  to create and maintain a model EEO program. Under the EO program,  while military members are not covered by the antidiscrimination statutes  and EEOC regulations and directives, Coast Guard policy provides that  military equal opportunity policies are generally based upon principles set  forth in civilian EEO policy, including affording military members with  discrimination complaint procedures that mirror the EEO process to the  extent possible.", "CRD is led by a Director who reports to the Commandant of the Coast  Guard and is responsible for all EEO/EO activities within the Coast Guard.

EEOC instructions state that an agency should  review its EEO and personnel programs, policies, and performance  standards against six elements to identify where their EEO program can  become more effective. The six essential elements EEOC describes for a  model EEO program are:    Demonstrated commitment from agency leadership,   Integration of EEO into the agency\u2019s strategic mission,    Management and program accountability,    Proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination,    Efficiency, and    Responsiveness and legal compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Leadership Is the Primary EEOC Model Program Element Addressed by Coast Guard Action Plans", "paragraphs": ["Over one-third of the 2009 recommendations dealt with agency leadership  issues, as did the recommendations of the prior reviews.

According to EEOC, the leadership element of  a model program includes allocating sufficient resources to the EEO  program, such as personnel with training and experience, staff with  relevant knowledge and skills, adequate data collection and analysis  systems, and training programs for all employees. Issuing an effective EEO  program policy statement and ensuring that all employees are informed of  EEO programs are also part of the demonstrated commitment element.

CRD officials stated that they organized with a sense of  urgency to address the recommendations and complete their planning and  implementation of action plans. The key players in the planning and  implementation of action plans were:    Functional Review Team: According to CRD staff, a team of senior CRD  staff, called the \u201cTiger Team,\u201d was created to serve as the functional  review team. This team aimed to effectively and efficiently address the  recommendations with limited resources. Members of the Tiger Team  included the Director of CRD, the executive assistant, the Chief of the  Office of Policy and Planning, and Chief of the Office of Civil Rights  Operations. The Tiger Team guided the development of the action plans  and also reviewed and approved the implementation of the action plans.  The Tiger Team formulated strategies to implement action plans, assigned  project officers, set deadlines for project officers to complete action plans,  and reviewed documentation submitted by project officers to support their  position that an action plan was complete.", "Project Officers: Project officers, appointed by the Tiger Team, were  responsible for providing weekly updates to the Tiger Team and for  overseeing the execution of the action plans. CRD told us that the project  officers were chosen based on their job responsibilities and knowledge of  the subject matter. The project officers reported to the Tiger Team  through an appointed lead project officer.", "Commandant: CRD staff told us that the Director and executive assistant  met regularly with the Commandant to provide updates and receive  feedback on the action plans. According to CRD staff, during these  meetings the Commandant provided guidance on the action plans and  helped formulate the decision on time frames to complete the action plans.", "Agency Leadership: Coast Guard leadership, including the Commandant,  was involved mainly with the action plan to restructure civil rights  operations.

For example, the Director and executive assistant met  with Planning, Resources, and Procurement Directorate staff to review all  the action plans for financial implications and to receive status updates  from CRD on the execution of the action plans. The Planning, Resources,  and Procurement Directorate staff advised the Commandant on the budget  implications of the proposed action plans and recommended budget- related decisions. Although the Chief Financial Officer did not have  approval responsibilities, he received periodic status updates from CRD  on the execution of the action plans.

This action plan was intended to  centralize the management of the EEO/EO services. Formerly, the civil  rights service providers who receive EEO/EO complaints were  geographically dispersed and reported to their command leader within the  geography in which they were located. In the centralized structure, full- time civil rights service providers report to three civil rights regional  managers, each responsible for a multistate region.

All the selected action  plans describe an output goal, such as revising the EO manual or attending  training, but do not identify measurable objectives or identify the intended  results of completing the action plans. In order to fully meet the criteria,  CRD needed to define an outcome goal for each of the selected action  plans that had measurable objectives against which actual achievements  can be compared. For example, conducting training to address office  climate is an output goal, but also establishing an outcome goal, such as  improving the results of CRD\u2019s organizational assessment survey\u2014a  measure of personnel attitudes across Coast Guard\u2014would more fully  measure the success of the action plan in achieving its intent.", "Defined Specific Tasks to Complete the Action Plan.

All four selected action plans fully implemented the project planning  practice of identifying a person or persons accountable for completing the  action plan. CRD designated a project officer, or person accountable for  the completion of the action plan, at the beginning of the action plan  implementation process. Each project officer was responsible for updating  the lead project officer on the week\u2019s progress, as part of the process CRD  had established.", "Identified Interim Milestones and Checkpoints to Gauge the  Completion of the Action Plan. The contract to revise the EO manual  was the only action plan that fully implemented checkpoints and  milestones to gauge the completion of the manual. The remaining three  action plans, creating the PII handbook, restructuring civil rights  operations, and training to address office climate, used their weekly status  reporting system to judge process. Establishing milestones for the action  plans before or during the planning process would have allowed CRD not  only to judge weekly progress, but also to benchmark where weekly  progress stood against where they intended. Further, CRD did not keep a  record of the weekly status reports or checkpoints; instead, they replaced  the prior week\u2019s status with the newest status, thus reducing their ability  to track the action plans\u2019 long-term progress.", "Identified the Needed Resources to Complete the Action Plan.

Training to address  office climate partially implemented this practice. CRD provided  documentation of the financial cost of training; however, the  documentation did not discuss any other training resources, such as staff  time and equipment or training materials. The other two selected action  plans, restructuring civil rights operations and revising the EO manual,  fully implemented the practice of identifying all of the needed resources to  complete action plans.
