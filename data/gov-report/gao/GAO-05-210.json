Experts recommend certain services and supplies for managing diabetes. Because these can be costly, concerns exist about whether individuals with diabetes have access to and receive what they need. Little is known, however, about health plan coverage of diabetes services and supplies. GAO reviewed the extent to which (1) states require insurance policies to cover diabetes services and supplies, (2) health coverage not subject to state requirements includes diabetes services and supplies, and (3) individuals with diabetes ages 18 and older receive services and supplies. GAO analyzed all 50 states' and the District of Columbia's laws and regulations pertaining to diabetes coverage. GAO also obtained from selected health plans providing coverage not subject to state requirements--13 large-employer plans and 3 plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)--information on coverage of 10 services and nine supplies identified as important for individuals with diabetes. In addition, GAO obtained national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on individuals' receipt of diabetes services and supplies. GAO received technical comments from CDC and incorporated them in the report as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, 47 states, including the District of Columbia, had laws or regulations related to coverage of diabetes services or supplies, although specific requirements varied by state. Services for which states most often required coverage were diabetes education (45 states) and medical nutrition therapy (27 states). All 47 required coverage of diabetes supplies, although some states were more specific than others about which supplies must be covered. Health plans GAO contacted that provide coverage not subject to state insurance requirements--those offered by 13 large Fortune 500 companies and the 3 largest health plans in FEHBP--covered most of the services and supplies recommended for individuals with diabetes, generally without limits on the coverage. Each plan covered at least 7 of 10 diabetes services, such as an annual blood glucose test, cholesterol and blood pressure monitoring, and influenza vaccinations, as well as at least five of nine diabetes supplies, such as insulin and insulin-administering supplies. According to a 2003 CDC nationwide survey, the majority of individuals with diabetes reported receiving at least one diabetes service within the past 12 months. Significantly fewer individuals, however, reported receiving five services that individuals with diabetes are recommended to receive at least once a year. For example, an estimated 88 percent reported receiving a test for blood glucose, whereas an estimated 33 percent had received the five recommended services: blood glucose and cholesterol tests, eye and foot exams, and an influenza vaccination. Receipt of diabetes services and supplies varied by service, state, and whether an individual had health coverage. For example, 71 percent of individuals with diabetes who had health coverage at the time of the survey received eye exams, compared with 46 percent of individuals with diabetes who lacked coverage."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Diabetes afflicts an estimated 18 million Americans, and the number of  newly diagnosed cases has been rising, according to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diabetes is characterized by a  high level of blood glucose, which damages nerve endings and blood  vessels; this damage in turn leads to serious health complications such as  blindness, heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, and poor circulation in  the extremities potentially resulting in foot or leg amputations.  Complications like these can be delayed or prevented with proper care,  provided that such care is accessible and used. Specifically, federal health  agencies and national organizations recommend that individuals with  diabetes receive certain services to manage their disease\u2014including  periodic tests for blood glucose, eye and foot exams, medical nutrition  therapy, and diabetes education\u2014along with other services, such as  cholesterol tests, smoking cessation services, and influenza  immunizations, which help reduce the risk of complications. Supplies that  many individuals with diabetes use to track and control their blood  glucose levels include blood glucose monitors; test strips; insulin; and, to  administer insulin, insulin pumps or disposable needles and syringes.", "Because diabetes services and supplies can be costly, you and others have  raised concerns about whether individuals with diabetes have access to  and receive all the services and supplies they need. Certain national  organizations concerned with diabetes patient care have advocated state  laws mandating that health insurance cover certain services and supplies  benefiting these individuals. Although states generally do not regulate  employment-based benefit plans, such as health plans provided by  employers, they do regulate insurance; consequently, health coverage  employers provide through the purchase of insurance is generally subject  to state insurance regulation. Although the exact number is unknown,  many individuals with diabetes have health coverage not subject to state  insurance regulation because their employers self-fund their health plans;  that is, the employers pay the cost of health benefits directly, instead of  purchasing insurance. In addition, the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP)\u2014through which the federal Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) contracts with private health insurance carriers to  offer health coverage to federal employees, retirees, and their  dependents\u2014is not subject to state insurance requirements.", "In this context, we examined the following three questions:  1.  To what extent do state laws or regulations require health insurance  policies to cover diabetes services and supplies?  2.  To what extent does health coverage not subject to state insurance  requirements\u2014specifically, coverage provided by the largest health  plans participating in FEHBP and the largest private self-funded health  plans\u2014include diabetes services and supplies?  3.  To what extent do individuals with diabetes, including those with  health coverage and those without, receive diabetes services and  supplies?", "To answer these questions, we obtained information from federal health  agencies and national organizations concerned with diabetes patient care,  and we identified 10 services and nine supplies that individuals with  diabetes may need. To examine the extent to which states require health  insurance policies to cover diabetes services and supplies, we reviewed  state laws and regulations related to diabetes coverage. To assess the  extent to which health coverage not subject to state requirements\u2014such  as coverage provided by the largest plans participating in FEHBP and by  selected large employers\u2019 self-funded plans\u2014includes diabetes services  and supplies, we contacted the three largest national plans participating in  FEHBP\u2014Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Mail Handlers, and Government  Employees Hospital Association, Inc.\u2014as well as a random sample of 15  of the largest 50 Fortune 500 companies regarding their plans\u2019 coverage of  diabetes services and supplies in 2004. We received responses from all  three FEHBP plans, which covered approximately 5.3 million people in  2003, and from 13 of 15 of the employers we contacted, which together  employed about 2.4 million people in 2003. To collect information on the  extent to which individuals with diabetes with and without health  coverage receive diabetes services and supplies, we analyzed data  provided by CDC from an annual national survey of individuals ages 18  and older known as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS). This survey, conducted by the states, consists of self-reported  data gathered from telephone interviews. We used data collected during  2003, the most recent year available. We also obtained data from another  CDC survey known as the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey (NHANES). Unlike BRFSS, this survey combines an in-home  interview with a physical examination to assess the health of a nationally  representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population,  including a representative sample of individuals with diabetes. We used  data collected by this survey from 1999 through 2002 for individuals ages  18 and older. To assess data reliability, we reviewed CDC documentation  of its data collection and discussed the data and their appropriate use with  CDC officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes.", "We conducted our work according to generally accepted government  auditing standards from July 2004 through January 2005. Additional details  about our scope and methodology appear in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Diabetes, a chronic disease, was the sixth leading cause of death in the  United States in 2000, contributing to the loss of more than 200,000 lives,  according to CDC. Type 1 diabetes, in which the body fails to produce  insulin, is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes,  in which the body fails to use insulin properly, is associated with aging, a  family history of diabetes, physical inactivity, and obesity and accounts for  90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. Although type 2 diabetes occurs  most often among adults, it is increasingly being diagnosed in children and  adolescents. One study found that, on average in 2002, individuals with  diabetes incurred about $13,243 in health care expenditures, compared  with about $2,560 in expenditures for individuals without diabetes. These  estimates include costs attributed to complications of diabetes, such as  cardiovascular disease, neurological symptoms, and kidney disease.", "Federal health agencies and national organizations concerned with  diabetes patient care have identified a number of services and supplies  that individuals with diabetes often need to help manage their disease.  Table 1 lists services considered important for diabetes patient care by the  American Association of Diabetes Educators; the American Dietetic  Association; and the National Diabetes Quality Improvement Alliance  (Alliance), a consortium of 13 private-sector organizations and  government agencies, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA),  CDC, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.", "In addition to such services, according to federal agencies and  organizations concerned with diabetes patient care, individuals with  diabetes often need certain supplies to manage their disease. Needed  supplies may include blood glucose monitors, glucose control solutions  (used to check the accuracy of testing equipment and test strips), test  strips, lancets and lancet devices (used to prick the skin for a blood  sample to self-test blood glucose levels), insulin (when necessary), insulin  pumps (to administer insulin), disposable needles and syringes (also to  administer insulin), alcohol swabs, and therapeutic shoes (for individuals  with severe diabetic foot disease).", "Health coverage may be provided through the purchase of insurance  policies that are subject to state laws and regulations or through means  other than insurance. Health coverage provided through the purchase of  insurance in a given state, whether purchased by individuals or by  employers, is subject to insurance requirements in that state, including  requirements to cover specified illnesses, services, or supplies. For  example, states often require coverage of cancer-screening services such  as mammography or tests for colorectal cancer. These state requirements  are in addition to coverage requirements established by federal law. In  2001, two-thirds of Americans younger than 65 (the age at which people  generally become eligible for Medicare), received health coverage  through their own employer or that of a family member. Large private  employers often self-fund their health plans, and coverage provided by  these plans is not subject to state insurance regulation, although it is  generally subject to federal requirements. Health coverage provided by  the federal government is also not subject to state insurance regulation.  For FEHBP, OPM is responsible for contracting with private health  insurance carriers to offer health benefit plans to federal employees. By  federal law, the terms of any FEHBP contract negotiated by OPM that  relate to coverage or benefits preempt any inconsistent state or local law  or regulation. OPM routinely preempts state requirements to ensure a  consistent set of benefits among nationwide FEHBP plans, according to an  OPM official."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States Require Insurance Policies to Cover Diabetes Services and Supplies, Although Specific Requirements Vary", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, 47 states had laws or regulations related to coverage of diabetes  services or supplies, although specific requirements varied by state (see  fig. 1 and app. II). Forty-five states required insurance policies to cover  specific services or supplies for diabetes. Two more states, Mississippi  and Missouri, required \u201cmandated offerings\u201d; that is, these states required  insurance policies to provide coverage for diabetes at the option of  purchasers. Some states\u2019 requirements applied only in narrow  circumstances. For example, Arizona and Wisconsin required coverage of  diabetes supplies only when a health insurance policy covered the  treatment of diabetes. The services most frequently specified in state  requirements were diabetes education and medical nutrition therapy: 45  states required that insurance policies cover diabetes education, and 27  states required coverage of medical nutrition therapy. State requirements  may have focused more often on these two services in part because  national organizations concerned with diabetes patient care\u2014including  ADA, the American Dietetic Association, and the American Association of  Diabetes Educators\u2014have supported \u201cmodel\u201d legislation centered on  these two services. According to ADA and the American Dietetic  Association, the organizations focused on these two services in particular  because others, such as eye and foot exams, were thought to be covered  by most policies as general medical services. The model legislation also  includes coverage of \u201cdiabetes equipment and supplies,\u201d and 47 states  required such coverage. Twenty-eight states identified which supplies  must be covered, although their specific requirements varied.", "Some states had specific requirements regarding the coverage of certain  services, such as diabetes education. Forty-two states specified at least  some criteria for the training or education that health care professionals  must have to provide diabetes education. These criteria varied widely from  state to state. To provide diabetes education in Louisiana, for example,  health professionals must have demonstrated expertise in diabetes and  must have completed an educational program in compliance with the  National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education established  by ADA. In contrast, several states required educators to be licensed  professionals with expertise in diabetes but did not define the term  expertise. Eight states referred to ADA\u2019s national standards in setting their  requirements for diabetes education programs. Some of these states  required programs to be consistent with these standards, while others  mentioned them as an example of acceptable standards.", "Among the 47 states whose laws or regulations required coverage of  diabetes supplies, specific coverage requirements varied. For example, 19  states did not specify which supplies must be covered; instead, these  states typically required coverage of all medically necessary equipment  and supplies prescribed by a physician. The remaining 28 states specified  covered supplies, either in laws or regulations, but the number of supplies  varied among the states. For example, Michigan had requirements related  to insulin, blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets, lancet devices,  syringes, and insulin pumps. In contrast, Mississippi required coverage of  equipment and supplies, including supplies used in connection with blood  glucose monitoring and insulin administration, but did not specify which  supplies. Some states that listed covered supplies also prescribed  procedures for adding new supplies to the list. For example, in New  Jersey, the Commissioner for Insurance, in consultation with the  Commissioner of Health, may update the list of supplies.", "While nearly all states have required some coverage of diabetes services or  supplies in the insurance policies they regulate, some states have  authorized a class of health insurance policies that are not bound by many  of the state coverage requirements, which may include those for coverage  of diabetes services and supplies. Known as \u201cflexible health benefit\u201d or  \u201climited-benefit\u201d policies, and typically marketed to small employers or  individuals, such policies may, through lower premiums, reduce the cost  of coverage. At least two states, Louisiana and Arkansas, have authorized  limited-benefit policies that are not bound by requirements related to  diabetes services and supplies. Louisiana has authorized such policies for  individuals not otherwise able to obtain health coverage and for small  employers (3\u201335 employees), and Arkansas has authorized them for all  groups, regardless of size.
