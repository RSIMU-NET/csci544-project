The U.S. Coast Guard--a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)--is the lead federal agency for maritime security, including the security of offshore energy infrastructure. The Coast Guard oversees two main types of offshore energy infrastructure--facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and deepwater ports. GAO was asked to examine (1) Coast Guard actions to ensure the security of OCS facilities and what additional actions, if any, are needed; (2) Coast Guard actions to ensure the security of deepwater ports and what additional actions, if any, are needed; and (3) what limitations in oversight authority, if any, the Coast Guard faces in ensuring the security of offshore energy infrastructure. GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents, such as inspection records, and relevant laws and regulations and interviewed Coast Guard inspectors and officials, including those at Coast Guard headquarters and the two Coast Guard districts that oversee all OCS facilities and deepwater ports that are subject to security requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has taken actions to address the security of OCS facilities (that is, facilities regulated for security pursuant to 33 C.F.R. part 106), but could improve its process for managing security inspections. For example, the Coast Guard developed a security plan for the Gulf of Mexico, in which all 57 OCS facilities are located, and it reviews security plans developed by the owners and operators of OCS facilities. It has also issued guidance, which states that Coast Guard personnel should conduct security inspections of OCS facilities annually, but has conducted about one-third of these inspections from 2008 through 2010. Further, the Coast Guard does not have procedures in place to ensure that its field units conduct these inspections. Consequently, the Coast Guard may not be meeting one of its stated goals of reducing the risk and mitigating the potential results of an act that could threaten the security of personnel, the OCS facility, the environment, and the public. The Coast Guard also faces challenges in summarizing inspection results. Specifically, its database for storing inspection data has limitations that make it difficult to determine if security inspections were conducted. For example, there is no data field to identify OCS facilities, which makes it difficult to readily analyze whether required inspections were conducted. By addressing some of these challenges, Coast Guard managers could more easily use the data as a management tool to inform decision making. The Coast Guard has also taken actions to ensure the security of the four deepwater ports, but opportunities exist for improvement. The Coast Guard's actions to ensure the security of deepwater ports are similar to actions it has taken to ensure the security of OCS facilities. For example, Coast Guard security plans address security at deepwater ports, and the Coast Guard also reviews security plans developed by the owners and operators of the deepwater ports. However, Coast Guard guidance for deepwater ports does not call for annual security inspections, and it has conducted only one security inspection at a deepwater port from 2008 through 2010. Coast Guard officials said that the Coast Guard plans to begin annual security inspections of deepwater ports in recognition of the risk of a transportation security incident. However, limitations in the Coast Guard's inspection database and lack of guidance available to database users may complicate the Coast Guard's management and oversight of inspections at deepwater ports. For example, the data field for deepwater ports has been incorrectly applied to other types of infrastructure and some deepwater ports are recorded under multiple names. Unless the Coast Guard addresses these database limitations and issues updated guidance to database users, it will be difficult for the Coast Guard to verify that the deepwater ports are complying with applicable maritime security requirements. The Coast Guard has limited authority regarding the security of mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) registered to foreign countries, such as the Deepwater Horizon. The Coast Guard is taking action, though, to gain a fuller understanding of the security risks associated with MODUs by conducting a study to help determine whether additional actions could better ensure the security of offshore energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, including MODUs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Coast Guard develop policies or guidance to ensure that (1) annual security inspections are conducted at OCS facilities and (2) information entered into its database for both OCS facilities and deepwater ports is more useful for management. DHS and the Coast Guard concurred with these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon in April 2010 resulted in 11  deaths, serious injuries, and the largest oil spill in the history of the United  States. The spill resulted in widespread and substantial environmental  consequences and had an adverse impact on workers and businesses,  with an estimated cost to compensate for these damages totaling billions  of dollars. While the explosion was not the result of a breakdown in  security procedures or a terrorist attack, other countries have experienced  attacks by terrorists or other criminals on offshore energy infrastructure\u2014 facilities that produce, transport, or receive oil and natural gas. For  example, attacks on oil facilities in the Niger River Delta in Africa have  occurred in the last several years. Further, in 2004, a terrorist attack on  an offshore oil terminal in Iraq using speedboats packed with explosives  killed two U.S. Navy sailors and a U.S. Coast Guardsman. Domestically,  offshore energy infrastructure may be an attractive target to terrorists  given the importance of oil and natural gas to the nation\u2019s economy and  security. In May 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  issued a press statement that intelligence information showed that  throughout 2010 there was continuing interest by members of al Qaeda in  targeting oil tankers and commercial oil infrastructure at sea. In addition,  congressional interest in potential attacks on offshore energy  infrastructure has increased because of the economic and environmental  damages that resulted from the Deepwater Horizon incident.", "The U.S. Coast Guard\u2014a component of DHS\u2014is the lead federal agency  responsible for maritime security, including the security of offshore energy  infrastructure. In this role, the Coast Guard seeks to mitigate many kinds  of security challenges in the maritime environment. Doing so is a key part  of its overall security mission and a starting point for identifying security  gaps and taking actions to address them. Offshore energy infrastructure  presents security challenges because some of this infrastructure is  located many miles from shore.", "The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002\u2014enacted in  the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001\u2014 underscored the importance of deterring, preventing, or disrupting a  terrorist attack on key infrastructure in and around the nation\u2019s ports and  waterways. In accordance with MTSA, and its implementing regulations,  the Coast Guard undertakes efforts to ensure maritime security by,  among other things, reviewing and approving security plans produced by  owners and operators of regulated vessels and facilities. The Security  and Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 subsequently  amended provisions of MTSA to, among other things and subject to the  availability of appropriations, require verification of the effectiveness of  facility security plans at least twice a year.", "There are two main types of offshore energy infrastructure that the Coast  Guard oversees for security. The first type of offshore energy  infrastructure includes facilities that operate on the outer continental shelf  (OCS) and are generally described as facilities temporarily or  permanently attached to the subsoil or seabed of the OCS that engage in  exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or mineral  resources. There are about 3,900 such facilities, and if a facility of this  type meets or exceeds any one of three thresholds for production or  personnel\u2014(1) producing greater than 100,000 barrels of oil a day,   (2) producing more than 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, or  (3) hosting more than 150 persons for 12 hours or more in each 24-hour  period continuously for 30 days or more\u2014it is subject to security  requirements in accordance with 33 C.F.R. part 106. In this report, we  discuss the 57 facilities regulated for security in accordance with part 106  because they met or exceeded these criteria at some point from 2008  through 2010. We refer to these facilities as \u201cOCS facilities.\u201d The second  type of offshore energy infrastructure is called a deepwater port.  Deepwater ports fall under a different set of regulations than OCS  facilities. Deepwater ports are fixed or floating manmade structures used  or intended for use as a port or terminal for the transportation, storage, or  handling of oil or natural gas to any state and include the transportation of  oil or natural gas from the United States\u2019s OCS. There are currently four  licensed deepwater ports\u2014two in the Gulf of Mexico and two in  Massachusetts Bay. Unlike OCS facilities, which are involved in the  production of oil or natural gas, deepwater ports enable tankers to offload  oil or liquefied natural gas for transport to land by underwater pipelines.", "In partnership with the Coast Guard, owners and operators of offshore  energy infrastructure also play a key role in securing OCS facilities and  deepwater ports. For example, working in conjunction with appropriate  Coast Guard personnel, owners and operators are responsible for  assessing risks and implementing security measures at their facilities.  They may assess risks by identifying the vulnerabilities of their facilities to  possible attack scenarios and, in so doing they identify ways to mitigate  vulnerabilities in and around their facilities. Owners and operators also  have security officers that are responsible for carrying out appropriate  security measures.", "Given the role that the Coast Guard plays in ensuring the security of OCS  facilities and deepwater ports, we were asked to address the following  three questions:  \uf0b7  What has the Coast Guard done to ensure the security of OCS  facilities, and what additional actions, if any, are needed?  \uf0b7  What has the Coast Guard done to ensure the security of deepwater  ports, and what additional actions, if any, are needed?  \uf0b7  What limitations in oversight authority, if any, does the Coast Guard  face in ensuring the security of offshore energy infrastructure?", "This report supplements our August 2011 testimony that focused on  Coast Guard risk assessments of OCS facilities and deepwater ports. In  this report, we focus on Coast Guard security inspections of OCS facilities  and deepwater ports.", "To address all three objectives in this report, we interviewed officials in  Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C., and district offices in  New Orleans, Louisiana, and Boston, Massachusetts, about offshore  energy infrastructure security because officials in these offices are  responsible for ensuring the security of OCS facilities or deepwater  ports. In addition, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and Coast  Guard guidelines for ensuring the security of OCS facilities and  deepwater ports. We also reviewed our previous work on Coast Guard  efforts to assess security plans and to conduct security inspections of  shoreside maritime facilities.", "To address the first question, we visited the Coast Guard\u2019s field unit in  Morgan City, Louisiana, because Coast Guard officials at this location are  responsible for inspecting the most OCS facilities of any unit in the Coast  Guard. We also interviewed Coast Guard marine inspectors by telephone  at Coast Guard field units located in Mobile, Alabama; Morgan City,  Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; Galveston,  Texas; and Port Arthur, Texas. We selected these offices because they  constitute all Coast Guard offices responsible for conducting security  inspections of OCS facilities. We also visited an OCS facility in the Gulf of  Mexico to observe security measures that had been implemented and to  interview the facility security officer. We visited this facility because the  local Coast Guard marine inspectors and the facility\u2019s security officer  were able to accommodate our visit without interrupting operations. We  also interviewed representatives from two companies that together  operate 18 OCS facilities that are subject to annual security inspections.  We selected these two companies because they own and operate the  most OCS facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. We cannot generalize the  results of our visit and interviews with these representatives to all owners  and operators of OCS facilities; however, the information we obtained  provided further insights into the Coast Guard\u2019s and owners\u2019 and  operators\u2019 efforts to ensure the security of offshore energy infrastructure.", "In addition, we interviewed relevant officials and analyzed information and  data on the National Level Exercise (NLE) 2009\u2014an exercise that tested,  among other things, the Coast Guard\u2019s capabilities for preventing a  hypothetical terrorist attack on offshore energy facilities in the Gulf of  Mexico. Regarding NLE 2009, we also reviewed data on \u201caction items\u201d  resulting from the exercise to determine whether corrective actions had  been implemented. We assessed the reliability of these data by  interviewing Coast Guard officials who use the data and by reviewing  relevant documentation, such as the after action report produced by the  Coast Guard. We concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of assessing action items that have not been resolved. For those  action items from NLE 2009 that had not been addressed, we followed up  with Coast Guard and DHS officials responsible for tracking such action  items to verify the status of the action items.", "To further address the first question, we analyzed inspection data and  reports for OCS facilities from 2008 through 2010 from the Coast Guard\u2019s  Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database\u2014 the database that the Coast Guard uses to, among other things, record its  inspection results. We also analyzed security inspection data for 2011  (through June 24, 2011), but did not report on these data because most  of the annual security inspections of OCS facilities are typically not  conducted until the fall. We assessed the reliability of these data by  interviewing Coast Guard officials who use the data and by reviewing  relevant documentation. As discussed later in this report, we identified  some problems with the data and worked with Coast Guard officials to  address these problems. Appendix I has a more detailed discussion on  our scope and methodology in analyzing the MISLE database. Based on  the steps we took to assess data reliability, we found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of determining the extent to which the  Coast Guard conducted security inspections of OCS facilities. We also  interviewed officials from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of  Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), formerly the Bureau of  Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), to  determine what role, if any, BSEE plays in ensuring the security of OCS  facilities. We also reviewed our Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government and compared the standards for control activities  with the Coast Guard\u2019s policies and procedures for conducting security  inspections of OCS facilities and for recording inspection results in  MISLE.", "To address the second question, we reviewed Coast Guard documents  on the security of deepwater ports and interviewed owners and operators  of deepwater ports to discuss their role in the security of their facilities.  We also visited a deepwater port in the Gulf of Mexico called the  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) to observe security measures that  had been implemented and to interview the facility security officer. We  visited the LOOP because it is the only operational deepwater port in the  Gulf of Mexico. While we cannot generalize our findings from this visit to  all deepwater ports, the information we obtained provided us with  valuable insights about the role of facility security officers and Coast  Guard efforts to ensure the security of such facilities. We also interviewed  Coast Guard officials responsible for inspecting deepwater ports in  Morgan City, Louisiana, and Boston, Massachusetts. We selected these  locations because these are the only Coast Guard units in which there  are federally regulated deepwater ports. We analyzed inspection data  from 2008 through 2010 for deepwater ports from the Coast Guard\u2019s  MISLE database. We assessed the reliability of these data by  interviewing Coast Guard officials who use the data and by reviewing  relevant documentation to ensure its integrity. As discussed later in this  report, we identified some problems with the data and worked with Coast  Guard officials to address these problems. On the basis of the steps we  took to assess data reliability, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of determining the extent to which the Coast Guard  conducted security inspections of deepwater ports. We also reviewed  Coast Guard policies and procedures for ensuring the security of  deepwater ports. Further, we reviewed the Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government and compared the standards for control  activities with the Coast Guard\u2019s policies and procedures for recording  inspection results in MISLE.", "To address the third question, we reviewed relevant international  requirements, such as the International Maritime Organization\u2019s  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code and U.S.  regulations for ensuring the security of OCS facilities, which may include  mobile offshore drilling units (MODU). We also reviewed reports on the  Deepwater Horizon incident, including the Coast Guard\u2019s report from  the joint investigation it conducted with BSEE\u2019s predecessor, BOEMRE,  and a report from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon  Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. We also discussed international  agreements and U.S. regulations that apply to OCS facilities and MODUs  with Coast Guard officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 through October  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

OCS facilities  play a significant and growing role in domestic production. For example,  oil production from offshore sources helped offset declines in land-based  production in recent decades. The OCS is in an area of federal  jurisdiction that contains an estimated 85 billion barrels of oil, more than  all onshore resources and those in shallower state waters combined (see  fig. 1 for a photograph of an OCS facility in the Gulf of Mexico). In  addition, the LOOP is responsible for transporting to shore about 10  percent of imported oil to the United States.", "Offshore production of oil and natural gas is critical in supporting  businesses, the military, and individuals who rely on a steady supply of  these resources. In addition, the leasing of offshore lands and the  collection of royalties on the production of oil and natural gas results in  billions of dollars in revenue for the federal government.", "Because of their importance to the economy and national security, OCS  facilities and deepwater ports are possible targets for al Qaeda and other  groups with malevolent intent. For example, in May 2011, DHS issued a  press statement that intelligence information showed that throughout  2010 there was continuing interest by members of al Qaeda in targeting  oil tankers and commercial oil infrastructure at sea. In addition, other  countries have experienced attacks by terrorists or criminals. For  example, in 2006, Nigerian militants attacked energy facilities and  abducted foreign oil workers in the oil-rich Niger delta. These attacks  have continued in recent years and, in August 2011, the United Nations  Security Council expressed concern about the attacks. Potential attack  methods identified by the Coast Guard or owners and operators of  offshore energy infrastructure include (1) crashing an aircraft into a  facility; (2) using a submarine vessel, diver, or other means of attacking a  facility underwater; (3) ramming a facility with a vessel; and (4) sabotage  by an employee.", "OCS facilities and deepwater ports may be at risk for an attack because  they are located in open waters and generally are many miles away from  Coast Guard assets and personnel. For example, owners and operators  of OCS facilities expressed concern about recreational and fishing boats  and divers operating near or attempting to attach themselves to an OCS  facility. Another risk is that many OCS facilities do not have personnel on- board the facility who can detect or report unauthorized incursions.  According to Coast Guard officials, OCS facilities and deepwater ports  are generally not considered to be high-risk targets. Rather, Coast Guard  officials also noted that OCS facilities and deepwater ports are lower risk  targets because of their remote location because an attack on them  would not likely result in a significant disruption of maritime commerce.  However, if an incident occurs, it would be difficult for the Coast Guard to  respond quickly because deepwater ports and OCS facilities are  generally isolated and located many miles from the closest Coast Guard  unit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of OCS Facilities and Deepwater Ports Vary", "paragraphs": ["Of the roughly 3,900 offshore facilities on the OCS, from January 1, 2008,  through December 31, 2010, there were 57 facilities which, at some point  during that period of time, met the production or personnel thresholds  subjecting them to security requirements. OCS facilities generally consist  of two different types of facilities: (1) fixed OCS facilities and (2) floating  OCS facilities. For example, 41 of the OCS facilities are fixed OCS  facilities that are permanently fixed to the sea floor. Of those, 34 are  primarily involved in the transportation of large volumes of oil or natural  gas and are called \u201ctransmission platforms.\u201d These facilities, unlike  facilities that produce oil and natural gas, may not be staffed, but instead  may have automated operations or could be operated remotely from  shore. The remaining 16 facilities are floating OCS facilities, which are  buoyant facilities that are securely moored to the seabed. An example  of such a facility is a floating offshore installation, which is a floating  structure that is moored to the seafloor in a semipermanent manner, to be  kept at that location for the primary purpose of producing oil and natural  gas from wells drilled into the sea floor.", "Further, we determined there were four deepwater ports in operation  during the time period covered by our review. Deepwater ports can be  one of two types: (1) oil deepwater ports and (2) liquefied natural gas  (LNG) deepwater ports. The LOOP is an oil deepwater port that has two  above the water fixed platforms in addition to buoys that float on the  surface, while the remaining three deepwater ports involve an underwater  buoy system that tankers use to offload LNG and have no above the  water infrastructure. When LNG tankers are not using these ports, the  ports are not visible above the water. Figure 2 shows these facilities by  type, number of each type from 2008 through 2010, and the applicable  security regulation.", "All OCS facilities, as defined in this report, are located in the Gulf of  Mexico. Among the four deepwater ports, the LOOP and one LNG  deepwater port are located in the Gulf of Mexico and the other two LNG  ports are located offshore in Massachusetts Bay near Boston. During the  course of our review, the operator of the LNG deepwater port in the Gulf  of Mexico notified the Coast Guard that it intended to decommission the  facility.

For example, staff at Coast Guard headquarters  oversee and develop policies and procedures for field staff to follow when  conducting security inspections of offshore energy infrastructure and to  assist affected owners and operators so that they can comply with  maritime security regulations. Such policies and procedures offer  guidance for (1) reviewing security plans produced by owners and  operators of OCS facilities and (2) ensuring the security of OCS facilities.  Among other things, Coast Guard marine inspectors in field units are to  conduct security inspections of OCS facilities and deepwater ports by  taking helicopter rides to facilities that can range up to 200 miles offshore.  Once arriving, inspectors are to conduct on-site interviews with facility  security officers and observe operations to verify whether required  security measures are in place. As of August 2011, the Coast Guard had  about 12 active marine inspectors who were qualified to conduct security  inspections of OCS facilities. These inspectors work out of six field units  near the Gulf of Mexico. After conducting security inspections of OCS  facilities and deepwater ports, and in accordance with the guidance,  inspectors are to record the results of these inspections in the MISLE  database. Coast Guard marine inspectors are to record information such  as any deficiencies that were identified and enforcement actions that  were used to ensure compliance by the owners and operators. In addition  to recording the results of offshore security inspections in MISLE, Coast  Guard staff are to record other actions that are not related to offshore  inspections, such as the results of search and rescue missions.", "Owners and operators of OCS facilities and deepwater ports have a  shared responsibility with the Coast Guard to ensure the security of their  offshore facilities and ports. For example, owners and operators of OCS  facilities must carry out measures intended to improve the security in and  around their facilities. These measures include designating a company  security officer and a facility security officer for each OCS facility the  company operates. Company and facility security officers have  responsibilities that include reporting security incidents to the National  Response Center, submitting facility security plans to the Coast Guard  for approval, and ensuring their facilities comply with the security plans.  Among other things, each facility security plan must address any  vulnerabilities identified through a facility security assessment. Although  not subject to the same security requirements as OCS facilities, owners  and operators of deepwater ports must develop security plans  comparable to those required for OCS facilities and that address, among  other things, risk identification and procedures for detecting and deterring  terrorist or subversive activity."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Could Further Ensure the Security of OCS Facilities by Improving Its Process for Managing Security Inspections", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Actions to Ensure Security", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has taken actions to ensure the security of OCS  facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, within which all OCS facilities are presently  located. For example, within a greater maritime security preparedness  program, it established an Area Maritime Security Committee for the Gulf  of Mexico in 2004. An Area Maritime Security Committee is responsible  for, among other things, identifying critical infrastructure and operations,  identifying risks, and providing advice to the Coast Guard for developing  the Area Maritime Security Plan. The Gulf of Mexico Area Maritime  Security Committee covers a broad area that crosses jurisdictional  boundaries of multiple Coast Guard field units. Among other things, the  Gulf of Mexico committee has representatives from stakeholders, such as  federal law enforcement, state emergency responders, and owners and  operators of OCS facilities. The committee has taken actions to enhance  information sharing among stakeholders by holding annual meetings and  offering training to OCS facility security officers on the command structure  for responding to a transportation security incident. One of the functions  of the committee is to contribute to the development of an Area Maritime  Security Plan, which is discussed in more detail below.", "The Coast Guard, in consultation with the Gulf of Mexico Area Maritime  Security Committee and reliance on information in OCS facility security  plans, has also developed an Area Maritime Security Plan specific to the  offshore environment in the Gulf of Mexico. One of the primary  objectives of the plan is to provide a framework for communication and  coordination among stakeholders and law enforcement officials and to  identify and reduce vulnerabilities to security threats in and near the  marine transportation system in the Gulf of Mexico. For example, the plan  specifies security measures to be taken at OCS facilities under certain  security conditions. Furthermore, the plan discusses the broader security  environment, including security measures at facilities and vessels that are  not currently regulated with respect to security under part 106, which  includes fixed transmission platforms or MODUs that do not exceed the  production or personnel thresholds in part 106, and provides that the  Coast Guard may consider requiring additional security measures for  such facilities.", "Additionally, the Coast Guard has conducted exercises and has taken  corrective action, as appropriate, to strengthen its ability to prevent a  terrorist attack on OCS facilities. In particular, in July 2009, the Coast  Guard participated in a National Level Exercise (NLE)\u2014a major exercise  that involved multiple agencies, including DHS; the Department of  Justice; the White House; and other federal, state, and local  stakeholders\u2014that tested the effectiveness of federal agencies in  preventing a hypothetical attack on the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure,  including OCS facilities. According to officials in the Coast Guard\u2019s  Exercise Policy and Budget Division, the Coast Guard\u2019s role in this  exercise was its most extensive involvement in an NLE to that date. As a  result of the exercise, to address the lessons learned from the exercise,  the Coast Guard developed 99 remedial action items that were assigned  to Coast Guard units. According to Coast Guard data, 88 of these 99  action items have been resolved. For example, two field units that  oversee the Gulf of Mexico clarified procedures for notifying relevant  stakeholders of changes in risk levels. Additionally, the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence has established a working group to  examine the issue of information sharing with the private sector with the  aim of finding a balance between sharing and securing sensitive  information.

For more information about the status of action items from NLE  2009, see appendix II.", "All OCS facilities that meet the production and personnel thresholds to be  regulated for security are required to operate in accordance with facility  security plans that the Coast Guard has approved. Coast Guard officials  have reviewed and approved security plans produced by owners and  operators of all OCS facilities. A Coast Guard port security specialist uses  a detailed checklist to review the facility security plans to ensure that the  plans satisfactorily address regulatory requirements. For example, in  reviewing a facility security plan, the port security specialist ensures that  the plan includes provisions to provide security training to OCS facility  personnel, including full-time and part-time contractors and temporary  and permanent employees. Upon approval, a facility security plan  remains valid for 5 years. Facility owners and operators must submit  updated security plans to the Coast Guard at least every 5 years for  approval, and regulations also require owners and operators to review  their plans annually and submit any amendments to the Coast Guard for  approval.

For  example, the Coast Guard conducted about one-third of annual  inspections of OCS facilities from 2008 through 2010 (see table 1). In  2008 the Coast Guard inspected 7 of 56 OCS facilities, which was   13 percent of the annual inspections. More recently, in 2010, the Coast  Guard inspected 23 of 51 OCS facilities (45 percent) that the Coast  Guard should have inspected.", "Our analysis of Coast Guard inspections data shows that the Coast  Guard generally inspected a greater percentage of floating OCS facilities  than fixed OCS facilities (see table 2). For example, from 2008 through  2010, the Coast Guard conducted annual security inspections of 54  percent of floating OCS facilities, compared to 24 percent of fixed OCS  facilities. During our interviews with Coast Guard marine inspectors and  their supervisors, we learned that some field units did not know that they  were responsible for conducting security inspections of fixed OCS  facilities, approximately one-third of which are not staffed because  operations are automated. For example, marine inspectors in the Coast  Guard field unit that oversees more than half of the OCS facilities stated  that they had only recently learned that they were responsible for  conducting security inspections of fixed OCS facilities. These marine  inspectors stated that they thought that security inspections of the fixed  OCS facilities within their area of responsibility were carried out by  another field unit and that they had only been conducting annual security  inspections of the floating OCS facilities. Further, other Coast Guard  officials stated that it is easier to arrange for security inspections of  floating OCS facilities because marine inspectors visit those facilities  more frequently for other types of inspections, such as hull or safety  inspections, whereas for fixed OCS facilities, the Coast Guard conducts  an initial safety inspection when they are first installed and then are only  required to visit the fixed OCS facilities once a year for annual security  inspections.", "The Coast Guard does not have procedures in place to help ensure that  its field units conduct security inspections of OCS facilities annually in  accordance with its guidance. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that internal controls should include control  activities, such as policies, procedures, and mechanisms that help ensure  management directives are carried out. However, the Coast Guard does  not have such control activities in place. For example, the Coast Guard\u2019s  OCS facility guidance does not describe specific procedures for the way  in which Coast Guard staff should track whether annual security  inspections have been conducted. Further, Coast Guard district officials  and most local field unit supervisors and marine inspectors we spoke with  do not maintain any kind of tool, such as a spreadsheet or calendar, to  remind them when annual security inspections of OCS facilities are due.  Coast Guard officials from five of the six Coast Guard field units that  conduct annual security inspections of OCS facilities told us that they do  not maintain a spreadsheet or other management tool to track whether  annual security inspections had been conducted. For example, at three of  these locations, Coast Guard officials told us they rely on owners and  operators to inform them when inspections were due rather than tracking  themselves when annual inspections were due. As a result of the lack of  procedures or control activities to manage the offshore security inspection  program, the Coast Guard is not positioned to ensure OCS facility  compliance with established maritime security requirements for most of  the OCS facilities. Without conducting annual inspections of OCS  facilities, the Coast Guard may not be meeting one of its stated goals of  reducing the risk and mitigating the potential results of an act that could  threaten the security of personnel, the OCS facility, the environment, and  the public.", "During the course of our review, Coast Guard officials stated that they are  planning to update the OCS facility guidance, policies, and procedures\u2014 which have not been updated since 2003\u2014for implementing security  requirements for OCS facilities. In September 2011, in response to our  findings, Coast Guard officials indicated that they may issue a separate  policy letter to Coast Guard marine inspectors to address these  weaknesses, but they noted that they were still considering how to best  address the problem to achieve a higher level of compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Documentation and Database Limitations", "paragraphs": ["In addition to challenges in the Coast Guard\u2019s inspection efforts,  inconsistent documentation of security inspections as well as limitations in  the MISLE database\u2014the database in which security inspection results  are recorded\u2014hinder the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to manage the offshore  security inspection program or analyze inspection data needed for making  management decisions about OCS facilities. During the course of our  review, we found inconsistencies in how security inspection data were  recorded in MISLE. For example, in most cases, marine inspectors select  the \u201cMTSA-related\u201d inspection type to designate that an annual security  inspection of an OCS facility was completed in accordance with 33 C.F.R.  part 106. However, among the 50 security inspections of OCS facilities  that were conducted from 2008 through 2010, marine inspectors did not  select this inspection type for 5 records. Instead, the inspectors selected  another inspection type (such as a safety inspection) and indicated in the  narrative section that a security inspection was conducted. Without  reviewing the narrative of each inspection report, Coast Guard  management may not be able to determine if security inspections of OCS  facilities were conducted. In July 2011, and in response in part to our  review, the Coast Guard issued new MISLE guidance on documenting  the annual security inspections of OCS facilities in MISLE and distributed  this guidance to all of the relevant field units. Specifically, the guidance  provides step by step instructions for entering information on annual  security inspections into MISLE for both fixed and floating OCS facilities.  If effectively implemented, this guidance should help to ensure that all  future security inspections of OCS facilities are recorded consistently,  which would enhance program management and oversight of these  facilities.", "In addition to the inconsistencies with how inspections are recorded in  MISLE, we also identified limitations with the MISLE database in the  following three areas:  \uf0b7  No OCS facility data field: There is no data field in the MISLE  database to identify a facility as an OCS facility, which makes it  difficult to readily analyze and summarize information on this type of  facility. Coast Guard officials recognize that not having an OCS  facility data field makes it difficult to readily summarize information  and they created an alternative method using standardized language  in another data field. However, this alternative method only applies  to the fixed OCS facilities and there is no alternative method to  identify floating OCS facilities in MISLE. Officials noted that it would  be useful if there were a data field for both fixed and floating OCS  facilities because this would allow the Coast Guard field units to  generate a report each year that would help local officials see when  security inspections are due for the OCS facilities within their area of  responsibility.  \uf0b7  Multiple entries for facilities: In the MISLE data we reviewed and  analyzed, we found that 14 of the 57 OCS facilities were listed  multiple times under slightly different facility names and, as such, had  multiple entries in the database. According to Coast Guard officials,  because of the MISLE database\u2019s limited search functions, staff  wishing to enter the results of an inspection or other activity might not  be able to find the OCS facility in MISLE because the information they  entered was not an exact match to how the facility was recorded in  MISLE. Consequently, the staff may assume that the facility is not in  MISLE and create a new entry to record their results. For example,  Coast Guard staff might not be able to find the \u201cGreen Canyon 55\u201d  facility in MISLE because the facility name was entered into MISLE  initially as \u201cGC 55.\u201d As a result, data records in MISLE are listed under  several names and identification numbers, which make it difficult to  determine how many security inspections have been conducted of an  OCS facility. Coast Guard marine inspectors stated this issue can  make it difficult to (1) locate previous inspection records, which the  marine inspectors review prior to conducting an inspection and   (2) compile a history of a facility\u2019s inspections.  \uf0b7  OCS facilities may be considered either \u201cfacilities\u201d or \u201cvessels\u201d  in MISLE: Infrastructure in the MISLE database is classified as either  a \u201cfacility\u201d or a \u201cvessel,\u201d and information on these two types cannot be  gathered simultaneously. While the fixed OCS facilities are  considered \u201cfacilities\u201d in the MISLE database, the floating OCS  facilities are considered \u201cvessels.\u201d This distinction exacerbates the  potential for creating multiple entries in MISLE for the same OCS  facility. For example, 13 of the 57 OCS facilities were listed in the  MISLE database as both a \u201cfacility\u201d and a \u201cvessel\u201d under different  names and identification numbers. Further, officials at one location  reported that they entered security inspection reports for the facilities  within their area of responsibility into MISLE twice\u2014once as a vessel  and once as a facility. As a result, data analysts cannot gather  information on both fixed and floating OCS facilities at the same time  without first searching for and eliminating duplicate entries, which  complicates data analyses.", "The Coast Guard could benefit from enhancing and facilitating the use of  performance information to make improved management decisions.  One way to enhance the use of performance information is to improve the  usefulness of such information to better meet management\u2019s decision- making needs. We reported previously that to be useful, performance  information must meet users\u2019 needs for completeness, accuracy,  consistency, timeliness, validity, and ease of use. However, due to the  MISLE database limitations noted above, it is difficult for Coast Guard  managers to determine if annual security inspections have been  conducted. Coast Guard officials indicated that they are taking action to  address not having an OCS data field and that they plan to create such a  data field for both fixed and floating OCS facilities when they release an  updated version of MISLE in early 2013. However, while the Coast Guard  is in the process of updating MISLE, it remains unclear whether problems  with (1) multiple facility names and (2) considering OCS facilities both  vessels and facilities will be addressed in the updated MISLE version.  Further, the new MISLE guidance on documenting security inspections  for OCS facilities in MISLE that was issued in July 2011 does not  describe policies or procedures that would address the MISLE database  limitations described above. Addressing such problems, either in the  updated version of MISLE or through updated guidance that addresses  these problems, could enhance the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to summarize  data on OCS facilities and make informed decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions Are Needed to Further Ensure the Security of Deepwater Ports", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Actions to Ensure Security", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has taken actions to ensure the security of deepwater  ports that are similar to actions it has taken to ensure the security of OCS  facilities.

Further, the Coast Guard has conducted some  exercises that address the security of the LOOP, which was an attack  target in a 2008 exercise as well as in NLE 2009. The Coast Guard has  also reviewed and approved deepwater port operations manuals for the  three deepwater ports that, among other things, must include deepwater  port security plans that are comparable to the security plans required for  OCS facilities pursuant to 33 C.F.R. part 106. In addition, the Coast  Guard has taken additional actions to ensure the security of deepwater  ports. For example, the Coast Guard has established security zones  around the two LNG deepwater ports in Massachusetts Bay. In the  context of a deepwater port, a security zone is a designated area for such  time as deemed necessary to safeguard the port from destruction, loss, or  injury from sabotage or other subversive acts. In particular, the  establishment of a security zone prohibits a person or vessel from  entering the designated area without permission and authorizes the Coast  Guard to take appropriate enforcement actions against such unauthorized  persons or vessels. Additionally, the Coast Guard has access to live  video feeds from the two LNG deepwater ports in Massachusetts Bay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Could Improve the Security of Deepwater Ports by Conducting Security Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has conducted only one security inspection of a  deepwater port from 2008 through 2010. Following the LOOP\u2019s 2010  annual self-inspection\u2014an inspection conducted by owners and  operators that generally assesses maintenance and repair issues\u2014Coast  Guard marine inspectors conducted a security inspection at the LOOP in  November 2010 and found deficiencies. Specifically, Coast Guard  marine inspectors determined that the facility security officer was not  familiar with the facility security plan. Based on MISLE inspection records,  this was the only security inspection conducted for a deepwater port from  2008 through 2010. However, according to Coast Guard officials, Coast  Guard marine inspectors have observed security measures at the  deepwater ports as part of their responsibilities for overseeing the vessels  that connect to these ports. For example, as part of a vessel examination,  the Coast Guard might observe whether physical security measures at  the deepwater port prevent unauthorized access to the port and the  vessel. Additionally, Coast Guard officers can ask questions of the  vessel crew about security practices to ensure that the vessel is  complying with either U.S. or international security requirements, as  applicable.", "Because deepwater ports are subject to different regulations than OCS  facilities, the Coast Guard has different sets of policies and procedures  for these two types of facilities. Unlike its requirement for OCS facilities,  the Coast Guard\u2019s deepwater port guidance does not call for annual  security inspections. According to Coast Guard officials, deepwater  ports were specifically excluded from the regulatory definition of OCS  facilities because of the different statutory and regulatory regimes  governing these two types of offshore energy infrastructure and because  the security risk factors at deepwater ports may be different from those at  OCS facilities. For example, deepwater ports are not connected, directly  or via a pipeline network, to the source of oil or natural gas production.  Therefore, the oil or natural gas that could be released as a result of an  attack on a deepwater port would be limited to the volume contained in  the tankers that connect to the deepwater port rather than the generally  larger volumes contained in source wells that are connected to OCS  facilities. As a result, according to Coast Guard officials, an attack on a  deepwater port could have lesser consequences compared to an attack  on an OCS facility that is directly connected to an oil or natural gas  source.", "While current Coast Guard deepwater port guidance does not require  annual security inspections of deepwater ports, the Coast Guard is  mandated by statute to verify the effectiveness of facility security plans for  those facilities that could be involved in a transportation security  incident. While deepwater port operators are required to develop  security plans as part of their operations manuals, which are to be  approved by the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard acknowledges that  its mandate to verify the effectiveness of security plans applies to  deepwater ports where an incident may meet the definition of a  transportation security incident, the Coast Guard has not implemented  procedures for conducting inspections to verify the effectiveness of the  deepwater port security plans on annual basis. Officials at Coast Guard  headquarters, however, recognize that an incident at the LOOP or either  of the two LNG deepwater ports in Massachusetts Bay could be  considered a transportation security incident.", "We discussed the statutory requirement to assess the effectiveness of  facility security plans and the general lack of security inspections at  deepwater ports with Coast Guard officials who generally agreed with our  observations. Based on this discussion, Coast Guard officials stated that  by the end of 2011 they plan to (1) update applicable Coast Guard  guidance to require annual security inspections of deepwater ports and  (2) add new procedures for conducting such security inspections. In  addition to this Coast Guard headquarters initiative, the Coast Guard field  unit in Boston is planning to develop and implement a local security  inspection program for the two LNG deepwater ports in Massachusetts  Bay, and the Coast Guard field unit in Morgan City, Louisiana, plans to  perform annual site safety and security inspections at the LOOP.", "As the Coast Guard moves forward with updating its deepwater port  guidance, one challenge it faces is the inherent differences between the  LOOP and the two LNG deepwater ports. These differences may  necessitate approaching security inspections of these facilities in different  ways. For example, the LOOP and the two LNG deepwater ports in  Massachusetts Bay differ in terms of their potential consequences,  economic importance, and physical structure.  \uf0b7  Potential consequences of an incident may be greater for the  LOOP than for the LNG deepwater ports: While the Coast Guard  views the LOOP and the LNG deepwater ports as having the potential  for a transportation security incident, an incident at the LOOP could  have greater consequences than an incident at the LNG ports. In  particular, an oil spill resulting from an attack on the LOOP could have  greater environmental consequences than the release of LNG from an  attack on one of the LNG deepwater ports because oil does not  dissipate as quickly as LNG does, and it must be removed from the  water. Additionally, there can be personnel stationed at the LOOP\u2019s  offshore location; therefore, potential death and injury consequences  could also be a consideration for the LOOP. In contrast, no staff are  stationed at the LNG deepwater ports, except when a tanker is  attached to the buoy and offloading LNG. Therefore, if an incident  were to occur at an LNG deepwater port, such as an explosion, the  potential for deaths or injuries could be limited to the crew aboard the  LNG tanker.  \uf0b7  The LOOP has greater importance to the economy than the LNG  deepwater ports: The LOOP is the only crude oil port in the United  States that can receive oil transfers from the largest crude oil tankers.  Additionally, about half of the oil consumed in the United States is  imported and the LOOP accounts for approximately 10 percent of  U.S. crude oil imports. In contrast, most of the natural gas consumed  in the United States is produced domestically, and the two LNG  deepwater ports import a relatively low volume of LNG compared to  onshore LNG port facilities. As a result, an attack on the LOOP could  have greater economic impact than an attack on the LNG deepwater  ports.  \uf0b7  Due to the structural nature of the ports, security inspections of  the LOOP may be more feasible than security inspections of the  LNG deepwater ports: In addition to the buoys that connect to oil  tankers, the LOOP has a fixed platform structure above the water  surface, similar to some of the OCS facilities, and the Coast Guard  plans to conduct on-site inspections of the LOOP. In contrast, the  structural nature of the two LNG deepwater ports may make these  ports difficult to inspect. Specifically, the LNG deepwater ports are  submerged buoy systems, meaning that buoys are submerged  whenever they are not connected to an LNG tanker, and these buoys  are connected by pipeline to shoreside facilities. As a result, when an  LNG tanker is not connected to the port\u2019s buoy, there is no visible  infrastructure above the water to inspect. Coast Guard officials in the  Boston field unit, which oversees these deepwater ports, said that  they could conduct an onshore security inspection that could include a  review of the deepwater port security plan with the facility security  officer to discuss how security measures are being implemented.", "The differences between the LOOP and the two LNG deepwater ports  described above could play a role in how the Coast Guard decides to  conduct security inspections of these deepwater ports. For example, on- site inspections of the LOOP could be warranted because of its  importance and the fact that a major part of the facility is above the water,  while inspections of LNG deepwater ports could potentially be done, at  least in part, at those ports\u2019 onshore facilities since these ports do not  have infrastructure above the water, except when a tanker is offloading.  As the Coast Guard updates its guidance for deepwater ports, the factors  described above could be considered in determining how to carry out  future security inspections of these deepwater ports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Database and Guidance Limitations Could Hinder Inspections", "paragraphs": ["When the Coast Guard begins annual security inspections of deepwater  ports, limitations in the MISLE database may complicate Coast Guard  management and oversight of such facilities. Similar to the problems we  found with MISLE regarding OCS facilities, we also noted the following  weaknesses in MISLE specific to deepwater ports:  \uf0b7  Deepwater port data field incorrectly used for other types of  infrastructure: The MISLE database contains a data field for  deepwater ports; however, this term is not defined in MISLE guidance  and has been incorrectly applied to facilities that do not meet the  definition of a deepwater port in applicable federal regulations.  According to Coast Guard officials, staff sometimes select the  deepwater port data field for shoreside ports that have deep drafts,  which allow large ships to enter these ports. For example, the MISLE  deepwater port data we reviewed identified 80 facilities as deepwater  ports rather than just the 3 currently active and 1 soon to be  decommissioned deepwater ports that meet the definition established  by applicable federal regulations. Further, Coast Guard MISLE  guidance does not define a deepwater port nor does it make  reference to the applicable federal regulations or definitions. As a  result, it is difficult to identify deepwater ports in MISLE for the  purpose of summarizing data that may inform management decisions.  \uf0b7  Multiple entries for deepwater ports: We also found that some of  the deepwater ports in MISLE were listed multiple times under slightly  different names. For example, the LOOP appeared in MISLE under  four different names. This situation may have occurred in part  because the Coast Guard\u2019s MISLE guidance does not provide naming  conventions for how deepwater ports are to be entered into MISLE.  The existence of multiple names for the same deepwater port and the  limited search function of MISLE make it difficult for Coast Guard  marine inspectors and managers to locate previous inspection  records.", "Similar to what we found with MISLE regarding OCS facilities, limitations  in the MISLE database, as well as no guidance on recording inspection  results into MISLE, make it difficult for the Coast Guard to analyze  security inspection results and other information on deepwater ports. As  previously discussed, performance information must meet users\u2019 needs  for completeness, accuracy, and consistency if it is to be useful.  According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, controls such as policies, procedures, and mechanisms  help ensure management directives are carried out. One way to enforce  management directives involves policies and procedures that ensure  accurate and timely recording of transactions and events, such as  security inspections. However, the Coast Guard\u2019s MISLE guidance does  not describe procedures related to information on deepwater ports and it  is difficult to use the information currently in the database as a  management tool. Correcting MISLE limitations and developing guidance  related to deepwater ports, including information on how deepwater ports  are named in MISLE and how the results of security inspections are to be  entered into MISLE, would allow the Coast Guard to better manage  security inspections and verify that the deepwater ports are complying  with applicable maritime security requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Has Limited Authority over the Security of MODUs Registered to Foreign Countries", "paragraphs": ["While the Deepwater Horizon incident was not the result of a breakdown  in security procedures or the result of a terrorist attack, the loss of the  Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill have raised concerns about  U.S. oversight over MODUs that are registered to foreign countries. In  this regard, various circumstances govern the extent to which the Coast  Guard oversees the security of MODUs. In general, MODUs operating on  the OCS implement security measures consistent with applicable security  requirements\u2014specifically, they implement requirements in accordance  with U.S. security regulations and the International Maritime  Organization\u2019s ISPS Code. Depending on the particular characteristics  and operations of the MODU\u2014for example, its method of propulsion or its  personnel levels\u2014it may be subject to Coast Guard security regulations  governing vessels (33 C.F.R. part 104) or OCS facilities (33 C.F.R. part  106). MODUs will fall under applicable Coast Guard regulations if (1) they  are self-propelled\u2014that is, they are capable of relocating themselves, as  opposed to other types that require another vessel to tow them\u2014in which  case they are subject to the ISPS Code and 33 C.F.R. part 104, or   (2) they meet production or personnel levels specified in 33 C.F.R. part  106. In the case of self-propelled, foreign-flagged MODUs, the Coast  Guard will assess compliance with part 104 by reviewing a MODU\u2019s  International Ship Security Certificate, which certifies compliance with the  ISPS Code; in all other cases where MODUs are subject to Coast Guard  security requirements, the Coast Guard assesses compliance with part  104 or part 106 through annual security inspections. Figure 3 illustrates  the types of MODUs, the applicable security requirements, and the  means by which the Coast Guard assesses compliance.  \uf0b7  Self-propelled MODUs: Among other things, the ISPS Code  establishes an international framework, involving cooperation between  contracting governments, government agencies, local administrations,  and the shipping and port industries to detect and assess security  threats and take preventive measures against security incidents  affecting ships or port facilities in international trade, and to ensure  confidence that adequate and proportionate maritime security  measures are in place. MODUs that are self-propelled are considered  vessels and are subject to the ISPS Code. In general, the country to  which a vessel is registered (the flag state) enforces its own as well as  applicable international requirements. Coast Guard regulations  governing vessel security (33 C.F.R. part 104) are consistent with the  requirements of the ISPS code. For example, a MODU may be  registered to a foreign flag state, such as the Marshall Islands or  Panama, and if self-propelled, the Coast Guard is able to ensure  compliance with applicable U.S. security requirements by ensuring the  MODU possesses a current International Ship Security Certificate  issued by the flag state. Whereas the Coast Guard may physically  inspect a U.S.-flagged MODU to ensure compliance with applicable  security requirements, the Coast Guard\u2019s oversight of foreign-flagged  MODUs is more limited. For example, Coast Guard inspectors may  board a self-propelled, foreign-flagged MODU to verify the issuance of  an International Ship Security Certificate, observe security measures,  and ask security related questions of personnel; however, absent  consent from the flag state, the inspectors generally do not have  authority to review the MODU\u2019s vessel security plan.  \uf0b7  MODUs that are not self-propelled: In contrast, MODUs that are not  self-propelled\u2014those that require another vessel to move them from  one location to another\u2014are not subject to the ISPS Code, and  countries in whose jurisdiction drilling occurs may individually  determine how they choose to regulate such MODUs. In U.S. federal  waters, both U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged MODUs that are not  self-propelled may be subject to the security requirements of 33  C.F.R. part 106, which govern OCS facilities, if they meet the  applicable production or personnel thresholds. While some non-self- propelled MODUs could meet the personnel thresholds that would  make them subject to part 106, most such MODUs do not meet the  applicable production or personnel thresholds. Since 2008, security  regulations for OCS facilities have applied to one foreign-flagged  MODU and no U.S.-flagged MODUs. Because most MODUs are not  regulated for security under part 106, the owners and operators are  not required to provide security plans to the Coast Guard and the  Coast Guard does not conduct security inspections.", "The Coast Guard may not be fully aware of the security measures  implemented by self-propelled, foreign-flagged MODUs because of its  limited oversight of such MODUs. The Coast Guard and BOEMRE  conducted a joint investigation into the Deepwater Horizon incident, and  the Coast Guard\u2019s report from the investigation emphasized the need to  strengthen the system of Coast Guard oversight of foreign-flagged  MODUs. The Coast Guard\u2019s report from the joint investigation stated that  the Coast Guard\u2019s regulatory scheme for overseeing the safety of foreign- flagged MODUs is insufficient because it defers heavily to the flag state to  ensure safety. The report noted that deferring to a flag state could work if  the flag state conducts inspections comparable to those conducted by the  Coast Guard on U.S.-flagged MODUs; however, the report found  deficiencies in the way that the flag state for the Deepwater Horizon  exercised its oversight responsibilities. The investigation also found that  Coast Guard examinations of foreign-flagged vessels, which include  foreign-flagged, self-propelled MODUs, are less stringent than for U.S.- flagged vessels, and the report stated that had the Deepwater Horizon  been a U.S.-flagged MODU, the Coast Guard likely would have become  aware of some of the deficiencies onboard. The joint investigation team  recommended, among other things, that the Commandant of the Coast  Guard develop more comprehensive inspection standards for foreign- flagged MODUs operating on the OCS. The Commandant concurred with  this recommendation and has chartered an Outer Continental Shelf  Activities Matrix Team, which has been tasked with providing  recommendations on the establishment and implementation of an  enhanced oversight regime for foreign-flagged MODUs on the U.S. OCS.  While the investigation focused on issues that were not related to  security, such as safety, these findings may have implications for security  oversight because the Coast Guard also relies on the flag state to carry  out responsibilities for assessing compliance with security requirements.", "Further, in its report to the President, the National Commission on the BP  Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling reported that the risks  involved with deepwater drilling are not yet completely addressed by  reviews on where it is safe to drill, what could go wrong, or how to  respond if something does go awry. While the report did not address the  federal role in ensuring the security of offshore energy infrastructure, it did  address risk management and challenges in responding to the  consequences of an incident on a MODU operating in deepwater. In  particular, the report noted that when a failure happens at such depths,  regaining control is a formidable challenge. This potential for adverse  consequences could be of greater concern as drilling technologies  advance and more drilling occurs in deeper waters. For example, drilling  in deeper water means that the Coast Guard or other response resources  are generally going to be further away from the drilling sites. Figure 4  depicts the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon explosion, which  demonstrates the possible consequences of a successful terrorist attack  or other security incident on offshore energy infrastructure.", "According to Coast Guard officials, it is likely that MODUs operating in  deepwater would be subject to security requirements because the  industry is increasingly using dynamically positioned MODUs that are  able to maintain position without being anchored to the seabed, and as  such MODUs are self-propelled, they would be subject to the ISPS Code  and 33 C.F.R. part 104. Additionally, the Coast Guard is aware of  potential risks regarding MODUs and is conducting a study designed to  help determine whether additional actions could better ensure the security  of offshore energy infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, including MODUs.  This study is expected to be completed in the fall of 2011. Gaining a fuller  understanding of the security risks associated with MODUs could better  inform Coast Guard decisions and potentially improve the security of  these facilities. Further, the Coast Guard has implemented a new risk- based oversight policy for MODUs, including foreign-flagged MODUs, to  address safety and environmental protection issues. This policy includes  a targeting matrix to assist inspectors in determining whether a foreign- flagged MODU may require increased oversight, based on inspection  history or other related factors, through more frequent examinations by  the Coast Guard. Additionally, the policy calls on Coast Guard field units  to conduct random, unannounced examinations of a portion of all MODUs  in their areas of responsibility. Although this policy does not directly  address security, increased oversight resulting from this new policy could  help mitigate some of the ways in which a MODU might be at risk of a  terrorist attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The threat of terrorism and the significant damages resulting from the  Deepwater Horizon incident point to the importance of the Coast Guard  having robust policies and procedures in place to better ensure the  security of OCS facilities and deepwater ports.

Because it is not complying with its established maritime  security requirements, the Coast Guard may not be adequately meeting  one of its stated goals of reducing the security risk and mitigating the  potential results of an act that could threaten the security of personnel,  the OCS facility, the environment, and the public. We also found  limitations in the MISLE database which make it difficult for Coast Guard  managers to determine if security inspections were conducted when  reviewing the data, and current guidance does not describe policies and  procedures that would fully address these limitations. By addressing  some of these inconsistencies and other limitations, Coast Guard  managers could more easily summarize data, identify issues related to  OCS facilities, and use the data as a management tool to inform decision  making.", "Finally, we also found weaknesses in the MISLE database related to  deepwater ports, such as not defining a deepwater port in MISLE  guidance and the use of multiple names for such ports in the MISLE  database.

These actions should improve the Coast Guard\u2019s  ability to ensure that such inspections are consistently conducted on an  annual basis, thereby addressing the intent of our recommendation.", "The Coast Guard also concurred with our second recommendation to  make improvements to the MISLE database or MISLE guidance to better  ensure that all OCS facilities are accurately and consistently identified  and that the results of security inspections are consistently recorded to  allow for better data analyses and management of the security  inspections process. Specifically, the Coast Guard stated that it  developed guidance in 2011 to improve MISLE database quality.  However, as we discuss in this report, the MISLE guidance issued in July  2011 does not describe policies or procedures that would address the  MISLE database limitations we identified. In particular, we noted that  within MISLE (1) there is no data field to identify OCS facilities, (2) there  are multiple entries for some facilities, and (3) OCS facilities may be  considered either \u201cfacilities\u201d or \u201cvessels.\u201d While the update to the MISLE  database mentioned in relation to our first recommendation should  address the need to identify OCS facilities in MISLE, the Coast Guard  would need to issue additional guidance or further update MISLE to  resolve the other two database limitations to fully address the intent of our  recommendation.", "Finally, the Coast Guard concurred with our third recommendation to  ensure that information on deepwater ports in MISLE can be used as a  management tool for decision making. The Coast Guard stated that it  plans to modify MISLE to include facilities, such as deepwater ports, that  do not fall under maritime security regulations in parts 101 to 106 of Title  33, Code of Federal Regulations, which implement provisions of MTSA.  However, according to the Coast Guard, this modification will take a few  years to complete. If, in addition to the MISLE modification, the Coast  Guard issues accompanying guidance for how information on deepwater  ports and their security inspections are to be entered into MISLE, these  actions should, collectively, address the intent of our recommendation.", "We are distributing this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the  Commandant of the Coast Guard, and other relevant DHS officials.

We used this database to address the  objectives on what the Coast Guard has done to ensure the security of  Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities and deepwater ports, and what  additional actions, if any, are needed.", "To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard conducted security  inspections of OCS facilities, we analyzed security inspection data for  OCS facilities recorded in the MISLE database for calendar years 2008  through 2010. We requested and obtained all MISLE inspection records  for this time period for inspections conducted by the six field units  responsible for conducting security inspections on all of the OCS facilities:  Mobile, Alabama; Morgan City, Louisiana; New Orleans, Louisiana;  Corpus Christi, Texas; Galveston, Texas; and Port Arthur, Texas. The  MISLE data were provided in two spreadsheets: (1) a facility inspections  spreadsheet that included fixed OCS facilities, among others and   (2) a vessel inspections spreadsheet that included floating OCS facilities,  among others. To assess the reliability of the MISLE data, we   (1) performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness;  (2) reviewed related documentation, such as MISLE user guides and data  dictionaries; and (3) held meetings and exchanged correspondence with  Coast Guard information systems officials and marine inspectors at the  field units to discuss data entry, analysis procedures, and results. We  analyzed the spreadsheets separately and, after taking the steps  described below, manually merged them to summarize the results. We  also obtained security inspection data for 2011 (through June 24, 2011),  but did not report on this information because most annual security  inspections of OCS facilities are typically not conducted until the fall.", "Because MISLE does not have a data field for OCS facilities, we obtained  a separate list from the Coast Guard that identified the 57 OCS facilities  that had been regulated for security under 33 C.F.R. part 106 at any point  from 2008 through 2010. We planned to use information contained in the  list, including facility names, identification numbers, and the dates on  which facilities were deregulated (that is, no longer subject to 33 C.F.R  part 106), to identify OCS facilities in the MISLE database. Prior to linking  the Coast Guard list of OCS facilities to the MISLE data, we assessed the  reliability of this list by interviewing Coast Guard officials responsible for  maintaining the list, as well as marine inspectors at the field units who are  to who conduct security inspections of the OCS facilities. In addition, to  assess the completeness of the Coast Guard list, we used MISLE data to  look for indicators that additional facilities were regulated for security  under 33 C.F.R. part 106 but were not included on the Coast Guard list.  The indicators in the MISLE data that we considered included, for  example, references made in the free-form, narrative portions of the  MISLE data to \u201c33 C.F.R. part 106\u201d and \u201cOCS\u201d because these terms  would likely be used to describe an OCS facility. When we found  discrepancies, we brought these to the Coast Guard\u2019s attention and  worked with officials to correct them. After conducting these steps, we  determined that the list was reliable for the purpose of identifying facilities  that were regulated for security under 33 C.F.R. part 106 at some point  from 2008 through 2010, which we refer to as OCS facilities, and that  there were 57 such facilities during that time period.", "During our interviews with Coast Guard officials and marine inspectors,  we learned that the same OCS facility could be entered into MISLE  multiple times under slightly different facility names and that there may be  annual security inspection records for OCS facilities recorded under  different facility names than those included in the Coast Guard list of OCS  facilities. Failure to identify these facilities as the same facilities in the  Coast Guard list could result in a possible undercount of annual security  inspections at the 57 OCS facilities. To address this issue, we conducted  searches for facilities in the MISLE database with matching, partially  matching, or similar names and locations based on the Coast Guard list  of 57 facilities to flag possible matches for OCS facilities in MISLE.  Through these efforts, we identified alternative facility names for 14 of the  OCS facilities on the Coast Guard list. For our analysis of the inspection  records of the 57 OCS facilities, we combined the inspection records of  the facilities identified in MISLE using the facility names provided by the  Coast Guard with those of the 14 additional facility names we  subsequently identified.", "We also used the Coast Guard list of OCS facilities to determine the  years for which the facilities were subject to the 33 C.F.R. part 106  requirements. According to the Coast Guard, an OCS facility that meets  applicable production or personnel thresholds becomes regulated for  security once its facility security plan is approved. A facility stays on the  regulated list until the Coast Guard receives documentation from the  facility that it no longer meets the thresholds to be regulated for security.  In particular, once a facility has been below the production thresholds for  1 year or below the personnel thresholds for 30 days, the facility can  inform the Coast Guard and provide supporting documentation. Upon  reviewing this documentation, the Coast Guard may determine that the  facility is no longer subject to the 33 C.F.R. part 106 requirements and it  becomes \u201cderegulated.\u201d For our analysis, based on the date of  deregulation included in the Coast Guard list of OCS facilities, we only  considered a facility to be subject to 33 C.F.R. part 106 for a particular  year if it was regulated during the entire calendar year. For example, if a  facility had its facility security plan approved prior to January 2008 and it  was deregulated in October 2010, we considered that facility to be subject  to security regulations in 2008 and 2009 only. We determined that there  were 57 different facilities subject to 33 C.F.R. part 106 at some point  from 2008 through 2010. In 2008, there were 56 OCS facilities. In 2009, 1  OCS facility became operational and 4 facilities were deregulated, for a  total of 53 OCS facilities. In 2010, 2 facilities were deregulated for a total  of 51 OCS facilities.", "For our analysis of the MISLE inspection records of the 57 OCS facilities,  we worked with Coast Guard officials to determine how marine inspectors  documented annual security inspections of OCS facilities in MISLE  because there was no guidance on documenting such inspections. This  approach included identifying inspections in which marine inspectors  selected a \u201cMTSA-related\u201d inspection type to designate that an annual  security inspection was completed in accordance with 33 C.F.R. part 106,  and we identified 52 security inspections from 2008 through 2010 in  accordance with this approach. Further, at the advice of Coast Guard  officials, we also searched the free-form, narrative portions of the MISLE  data for indicators that a security inspection had been conducted. We  used search terms such as \u201cMTSA\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d in these searches and  found 6 additional security inspections, for a total of 58 inspections. Prior  to conducting our analysis of the data, we looked for duplicative security  inspection records and errors and we removed 8 of these records, for a  total of 50 annual security inspections. Specifically, 5 inspection records  were removed because the same security inspection had been recorded  twice in the MISLE database, including 1 of the 6 records that had be  identified by reviewing the narrative. Of those 5 inspection records (1) 3  records had two inspections recorded on the same date under the same  facility name and (2) 2 records had two inspections recorded on the same  date under two different facility names for the same OCS facility. Further,  3 additional inspection records were removed because, based on the  date of deregulation, the security inspection took place during a year that  we determined the facility was not subject to regulation for security under  33 C.F.R. part 106. Therefore, out of the 50 annual security inspections  we analyzed, 45 were identified in accordance with the Coast Guard\u2019s  suggested approach and 5 were identified solely through reviewing the  inspection narratives.", "We also analyzed MISLE data to determine the extent to which the Coast  Guard had conducted security inspections of deepwater ports for  calendar years 2008 through 2010. We requested and obtained all MISLE  inspection records for 2008 through 2010 for deepwater ports as well as a  MISLE-generated list of all facilities that were designated as deepwater  ports in the database. To assess the reliability of the deepwater port data,  we took similar steps with the data as those described above for OCS  facilities. For example, we conducted searches in the MISLE database to  identify deepwater ports with matching, partially matching, or similar  names based on the names and locations of the deepwater ports. We  also searched the narrative portions of the deepwater port inspection data  for indicators that a security inspection had been conducted. Through  these efforts, we identified one security inspection of a deepwater port  from 2008 through 2010.", "After conducting the above steps, we determined that the MISLE data  were sufficiently reliable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard  conducted security inspections at OCS facilities and deepwater ports from  2008 through 2010. Our report discusses MISLE data problems in more  detail, along with the steps the Coast Guard is taking to address some of  the issues, and additional steps we believe are still needed.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2010 through October  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

According to those data, 88 of the 111 action  items have been resolved and 23 are unresolved. For example, according  to the data, the Coast Guard and DHS have not yet established a process  for engaging the private sector to address the observation from the  exercise that information sharing with private sector stakeholders  occurred at multiple levels without clear synchronization.
