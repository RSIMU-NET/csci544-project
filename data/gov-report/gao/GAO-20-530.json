Most of these institutional investors noted that they seek additional ESG disclosures to address gaps and inconsistencies in companies' disclosures that limit their usefulness.", "GAO's review of annual reports, 10-K filings, proxy statements, and voluntary sustainability reports for 32 companies identified disclosures across many ESG topics but also found examples of limitations noted by investors. Twenty-three of 32 companies disclosed on more than half of the 33 topics GAO reviewed, with board accountability and workforce diversity among the most reported topics and human rights the least. Disclosure on an ESG topic may depend on its relevance to a company's business.

SEC considers information to be material if there is a  substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it  important in making an investment decision in the context of the total mix  of available information. Public companies disclose information on an  ongoing basis through annual 10-K filings, quarterly 10-Q filings, and  definitive proxy statements, among other disclosure requirements.  Regulation S-K contains SEC integrated disclosure requirements for 10-K  filings and other periodic reports filed with SEC. Staff in Corporation  Finance are to selectively review 10-K filings for compliance with  requirements outlined in Regulation S-K and other applicable accounting  standards and form requirements. While federal securities laws generally  do not specifically address the disclosure of ESG information, Regulation  S-K\u2019s disclosure requirements for nonfinancial information apply to  material ESG topics.

For example, in 2010, SEC issued the Commission Guidance  Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change, which described how  existing disclosure requirements could apply to climate change-related  information and how companies may consider climate disclosures in  required filings. In 2018, SEC also issued the Commission Statement  and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures, outlining  how existing reporting requirements could apply to cybersecurity-related  risks and incidents.

Representatives at the other two pension funds said that they  generally do not consider ESG information relevant to assessing  companies\u2019 financial performance. While investors with whom we spoke  primarily used ESG information to assess companies\u2019 long-term value,  other investors also use ESG information to promote social goals. A 2018  US SIF survey found that private asset managers and other investors,  representing over $3.1 trillion (of the $46.6 trillion in total U.S. assets  under professional management), said they consider ESG issues as part  of their mission or in order to produce benefits for society.", "Institutional investors we interviewed identified various ways they use  ESG disclosures to inform their investment decisions and manage risks  related to their investments.", "Protecting long-term investments by monitoring companies\u2019  management of ESG risks. Some investors with whom we spoke  noted that they primarily make long-term investments in passively  managed funds, which may prevent them from making investment  decisions based on ESG information. However, 10 of 14 investors  said that their focus on long-term factors that drive value leads them  to monitor or influence companies\u2019 management of ESG issues to  protect their investments. Investors generally said they use ESG  disclosures to determine which ESG issues companies monitor and to  assess how companies manage these risks. Nearly all investors said  ESG issues can be important to a company\u2019s operations and  performance over time. For example, seven of 14 investors said they  used ESG disclosures to identify companies that were less  transparent than their peers or appeared to be outliers in their  industries, such as having less board diversity than their peers.  Investors then engaged with these companies to discuss their risk- management strategies, encourage disclosure on ESG issues, or  provide information about what kind of disclosure they would find  useful.", "Informing shareholder votes. Most investors with whom we spoke  said they use ESG information to inform their votes as shareholders at  annual shareholder meetings, either through a proxy advisory firm or  independently. Specifically, nine of 14 investors said that ESG  information informs how they vote on directors\u2019 nominations to the  board and other proposals at public companies\u2019 annual meetings. For  example, representatives from two large public pension funds said  they withhold votes for directors if they determine that a company\u2019s  board had not effectively disclosed issues, such as climate risk or  executive performance metrics.", "Creating ESG funds or portfolios. Five of 14 investors we  interviewed said they created ESG-focused investment funds or  portfolios with goals such as promoting social responsibility and  environmental sustainability. In creating these funds and portfolios,  investors generally review companies\u2019 ESG disclosures to determine  which companies to include or exclude from these funds or portfolios.  For example, two private asset managers said they created ESG  funds or portfolios to attract investors focused on social goals, such as  faith-based investors, while representatives from one pension fund  said they had worked with an asset manager to create a low- emissions index intended to support the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals.", "Divesting. Some investors we interviewed said they typically would  not divest based on a company\u2019s ESG disclosures, and three said that  ESG information could lead them to divest. A mid-size asset manager  noted that the firm works with companies to improve their disclosures  rather than divest. Conversely, representatives from one mid-size  pension fund said they found that buying or selling shares is a more  efficient method for changing corporate behavior than the lengthier  strategy of engaging companies in dialogue. Additionally, a large  asset manager said that its portfolio managers sell shares if a  company\u2019s ESG performance or response to engagement is poor.", "Although some studies report that the quantity and quality of ESG  disclosures generally improved in the last few years, 11 of 14 investors  with whom we spoke said they seek additional ESG disclosures from  companies to address gaps and inconsistencies, among other issues.  Investors described challenges with understanding and interpreting both  quantitative and narrative disclosures.", "Quantitative disclosures. Investors cited examples of  inconsistencies in companies\u2019 quantitative disclosures that limit  comparability, including comparability among companies that disclose  on the same ESG topics. Specifically, investors described challenges  such as the variety of different metrics that companies used to report  on the same topics, unclear calculations, or changing methods for  calculating a metric. For example, five of 14 investors said that  companies\u2019 disclosures on environmental or social issues use a  variety of metrics to describe the same topic. A few studies have  reported that the lack of consistent and comparable metric standards  have hindered companies\u2019 ability to effectively report on ESG topics,  because they are unsure what information investors want. In  addition, some investors said that companies may change which  metrics they use to disclose on an ESG topic from one year to the  next, making disclosures hard to compare within the same company  over time.", "Narrative disclosures. Most investors noted gaps in narrative  disclosures that limited their ability to understand companies\u2019  strategies for considering ESG risks and opportunities. For example,  some investors noted that some narrative disclosures contained  generic language, were not specific to how the company addressed  ESG issues, or were not focused on material information. For  example, two private asset managers said that companies may  provide boilerplate narratives or insufficient context for their  quantitative disclosures, and representatives from one pension fund  said that the fund would like additional disclosures on cybersecurity  but has found that most disclosures on this topic are generic and not  very helpful.", "Additionally, most institutional investors said that there is fragmentation in  the format or location of companies\u2019 ESG disclosures, which can make  this information hard to compile and review. However, these investors  generally said that it is more important for companies to focus on  providing disclosures than on how or where the disclosures are  presented. These investors said that they are able to purchase access to  compiled data from third-party data providers to use in their analysis of  companies\u2019 ESG disclosures.", "Regarding how investors seek ESG disclosures, nearly all institutional  investors with whom we spoke said they engage with companies to  request additional ESG disclosures through meetings, telephone calls, or  letters. Some investors said that companies\u2019 responsiveness, which can  include producing ESG presentations for investors and discussing ESG  information on earnings calls, varied by size because larger companies  have more resources to respond to investor engagement. Engagement  also can be complicated by conflicting investor demands, as well as the  proliferation of standards and surveys. According to representatives from  an industry group that we interviewed, the large number of demands for  specific ESG information from investors and third parties can pose a  challenge to companies as they prioritize how to respond.

For the ESG-related proposals in our  sample, on average about 28 percent of shareholders voted in favor of  these proposals and no proposals received more than 50 percent of the  vote. As shown in table 3, the companies in our sample received a total  of six proposals requesting additional ESG disclosures on a variety of  social and governance topics. Most of these proposals were submitted to  large companies. Investors that submitted proposals included one public  pension fund, one labor organization, three socially focused asset  managers, and one higher education endowment.", "All of the private asset management firms and representatives from three  of seven pension funds we interviewed said they do not use shareholder  proposals as a means to influence companies\u2019 ESG disclosures. One of  these pension funds said they have found filing shareholder proposals  unnecessary after engaging in dialogue with companies. However,  representatives from four of seven pension funds said they have filed  shareholder proposals to seek additional ESG disclosures. Two large  pension funds said they have found filing shareholder proposals an  important engagement method for getting companies\u2019 attention on ESG  issues, while the other two funds noted that it was rare for them to file a  proposal.", "Similarly, studies and reports we reviewed indicated that shareholder  proposals are concentrated among a relatively small number of  shareholders and that the number of proposals has been declining in the  last 5 years. For example, a law firm\u2019s analysis of shareholder proposals  filed with companies listed on the S&P 1500 in 2019 reported that 10  investors submitted over half of all proposals. This report also found that  faith-based investors and socially focused asset managers, who seek to  advance social causes in their investments, submitted the majority of  environmental and social proposals in both 2018 and 2019. In addition,  this analysis showed that the total number of shareholder proposals,  including withdrawn proposals, submitted annually declined each year  from 2015 to 2019. As the total number of proposals has declined,  shareholder proposals related to environmental and social issues  constituted over 45 percent of proposals each year from 2015 to 2019.

As part of the engagement process, companies  generally said they reach out to investors, representatives of communities  they operate in, and other interested stakeholders to solicit their opinions  about which ESG factors are important to them. Some companies  described their ESG stakeholder engagement process as part of their  broader company-wide outreach efforts, while others told us they hired  outside firms to conduct this engagement on their behalf.", "In addition to stakeholder outreach, most companies (11 of 18) told us  they perform assessments to determine which ESG topics to include in  their regulatory filings or other reports. As part of these assessments,  companies review a wide array of potential risks and identify the ones that  would have the most impact on their business. In addition to  requirements, outreach and assessments, most companies (nine of 18)  told us they review ESG disclosure frameworks, such as GRI and SASB,  to inform their consideration of which ESG factors to disclose.", "Similar to deciding which ESG topics to disclose, most companies (10 of  18) told us they also rely on legal and regulatory requirements when  determining where to disclose ESG information.

In addition, some companies  (six of 18) told us that they view their voluntary sustainability report as  complementary to their regulatory filings. Specifically, four companies  said they view their sustainability reports as a place to publish relevant  ESG information that may not necessarily be material under the SEC  definition and is therefore not included in regulatory filings. Lastly, some  companies also told us that their voluntary sustainability reports provide  an opportunity to disclose information that is of interest to ESG-focused  investors or non-investor stakeholders.

Of our selected  companies, 25 published voluntary sustainability reports and 21 published  annual reports separate from their 10-Ks.

In contrast, we identified the  fewest companies disclosing on human rights and occupational health  and safety factors.", "With regard to the 33 more-specific ESG topic disclosures we examined,  23 of 32 companies disclosed on more than half of them. The topics  companies disclosed most frequently were related to governance of the  board of directors and addressing data security risks. Conversely, based  on disclosures we identified, we found that companies less frequently  reported information on topics related to the number of self-identified  human rights violations and the number of data security incidents. In  addition, we found that companies most frequently disclosed information  on narrative topics and less frequently disclosed information on  quantitative topics. There are several reasons why a company may not  have disclosed information on a specific ESG topic, including that the  topic is not relevant to its business operations or material.", "Figure 3 compares the amount of disclosure on the 33 ESG topics within  and across the selected industries. We identified the most disclosure on  the group of topics related to board accountability, climate change, and  workforce diversity and the least amount on topics related to human  rights. SEC requires companies to report certain governance information  in their proxy statements in advance of shareholder meetings where  shareholders elect members of the company\u2019s board of directors, which  may help explain why board accountability topics are the most reported  across industries in our sample. Additionally, differences in disclosure can  result, in part, from the relevance of an ESG topic to a particular industry.", "For example, more companies in the airline and oil and gas industries  disclosed information on climate change, while more companies in the  internet media and banking industries disclosed information on data  security. We identified disclosures on fewer topics by companies in the  internet media industry than the other industries we assessed. None of  the four internet media companies in our sample issued a stand-alone  sustainability report. As discussed below, most companies tended to  include more extensive ESG disclosures in their sustainability reports  than in their regulatory filings.", "Figure 4 illustrates how the amount of disclosures on the 33 ESG topics  compared across the four types of documents we reviewed. We found  that companies generally reported information on a wider variety of ESG  topics in their voluntary sustainability reports. Specifically, with the  exception of a few topics, when companies disclosed information on an  ESG topic, they most frequently did so in their sustainability reports.  Certain ESG topics were reported more frequently in regulatory filings.  For example, nearly all selected companies reported ESG information  related to their board of directors in their proxy statements. Additionally,  we found that companies disclosed on risks related to climate change,  data security, hiring employees, and resource management in their 10- Ks, which includes a risk factors section where companies are required to  discuss the most significant factors that make investment in the company  speculative or risky.", "As discussed earlier, some investors with whom we spoke said they seek  additional narrative disclosures from companies whose disclosures  contained generic language or did not provide specific details about how  the company manages ESG-related risks or opportunities. Among the 33  ESG topics we reviewed, 16 were topics for which companies reported a  narrative rather than quantitative disclosure. We categorized these  narrative disclosures as either generic or company-specific (see fig. 5 for  examples). We defined company-specific disclosures as those that  discussed specific ways that ESG-related risks and opportunities could  affect the company\u2019s operations or specific steps the company takes to  manage or respond to the ESG-related risks or opportunities. We defined  disclosures that did not include such specific details as generic  disclosures. As a result, such generic disclosures can be considered  applicable to the reporting company as well as to many of its peers.  According to two reports, companies may choose not to disclose more  detailed information for a particular ESG topic for several reasons,  including concerns that such disclosures would put the company at a  competitive disadvantage or expose it to legal liability.", "For 11 of the 16 narrative topics, among companies for which we  identified disclosures on these topics, at least 75 percent disclosed  company-specific information (see fig. 6).

In contrast, for other narrative topics, such as addressing data security  risks and describing climate-related risks and opportunities, we identified  company-specific information for less than two-thirds of disclosing  companies. In addition, for one narrative topic, describing obstacles that  might limit the company\u2019s ability to hire the talent it needs, less than one- third of disclosing companies reported company-specific information. We  also found that disclosures we identified in companies\u2019 10-K filings were  less likely to be company-specific than those in the other three types of  documents we reviewed.", "Though most of the narrative ESG disclosures we reviewed contained  company-specific details, these disclosures varied in the amount of detail  they provided about how a company manages ESG-related risks and  opportunities (see fig. 7). In particular, some companies\u2019 disclosures  included details about specific steps the company was taking to manage  an ESG-related risk or opportunity and details about the results of such  efforts, while others did not.

For example, in workforce diversity disclosures, some companies  reported their employee demographics using broad groupings, such as  \u201cminority\u201d or \u201cethnically diverse,\u201d while others reported by specific racial or  ethnic groups. Similarly, some companies defined greenhouse gas  emissions differently. Most companies combined carbon dioxide and  other greenhouse gases when reporting emission data, but a few  reported carbon dioxide emissions alone.", "We also identified instances of companies using different calculation  methods or units of measure when reporting information related to climate  change and resource management. For example, companies used  different base years when calculating their reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions, limiting their comparability. Some companies reported  reductions year-over-year, while many reported reductions over multiple  years with no consistency within or across industries. For example, airline  companies we reviewed reported emission reductions with base years  ranging from 1990 to 2017.

We reviewed companies\u2019 2018  10-Ks, 2019 definitive proxy statements (which typically covered the same reporting period as the 2018 10-K), and 2018 annual reports (when different from the 10-K). We also reviewed companies\u2019 most recent sustainability reports available on their websites, accessed from July through December 2019. We defined a sustainability report as a voluntary, stand-alone document that provided information on sustainability and other issues related to environmental, social, and governance factors. Companies can use other means to report ESG information, such as their websites or issue-specific company reports. We did not include single-issue documents or information included on  websites that was not also part of the sustainability report. There are  several reasons why a company may not disclose information on a  specific ESG topic; for example, the topic may not be relevant to its  business operations or the company may not consider it to have a  significant enough impact on its financial performance to warrant  disclosure.", "To identify relevant disclosures, we searched each document for a list of  keywords related to each of the eight ESG factors to help identify  passages likely to contain ESG disclosures on the 33 specific ESG topics.  We selected these keywords by reviewing the 33 topics we selected and  identifying unique terms associated with them. We categorized each  narrative disclosure as being generic or company-specific. We  categorized a narrative disclosure as company-specific if it included  details about how ESG-related risks and opportunities affect the  company\u2019s specific operations or how the company manages these risks  or opportunities. Otherwise, we characterized the narrative disclosure as  generic. Generic narrative disclosures are disclosures that could apply to  the reporting company as well as to many of its peers. We considered  each disclosure as a whole and, if it provided some company-specific  information, we categorized the disclosure as company-specific.", "In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives  of 18 of the 32 selected companies to obtain their perspectives on how  they determine what ESG information to disclose, where to disclose it,  and the benefits and challenges of ESG reporting. We requested  interviews with all 32 of the selected companies, but eight companies  declined and six companies did not respond to our request. For those that  did not respond, we made at least three requests by email. We  interviewed at least one company from each of the selected industries.  Furthermore, through the semi-structured interviews with investors  described above, we obtained investors\u2019 perspectives on characteristics  of ESG disclosures that may limit their usefulness to investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Staff Efforts Related to the Disclosure of Material ESG Factors", "paragraphs": ["To understand SEC\u2019s current regulatory framework for overseeing public  companies\u2019 disclosures, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations, such  as Regulation S-K and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. To review  SEC\u2019s efforts related to ESG disclosures, we reviewed relevant SEC  policies and procedures, such as internal guidance and SEC\u2019s interpretive  releases to public companies on climate change and cybersecurity  disclosures. We also reviewed SEC\u2019s 2012 and 2014 reports on climate  change disclosures to the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations.  We reviewed additional internal SEC assessments on selected ESG- related topics to obtain information on steps taken by SEC to review ESG  disclosures. To obtain information on how staff conduct reviews of annual  10-K filings and ESG information, we interviewed SEC officials from the Division of Corporation Finance and a nongeneralizable sample of 15 review staff from the same division (six attorneys, six accountants, and three office chiefs).

For  example, we reviewed letters submitted by various groups to SEC in  response to its 2016 request for public comment on possible changes to  regulation S-K, as well as press releases by large asset management  firms. We conducted searches of government and academic literature for  research on ESG disclosures from the previous 5 years. We searched the  internet and various databases, such as ProQuest Newsstand  Professional and Scopus. Using broad search terms, we identified articles  related to our research objectives that provided useful context and  discussion topics for interviews with market observers, investors, and  companies. We also identified relevant reports and studies through  investor and market observer interviews, by reviewing sources cited in  documents we obtained, and through internet searches.", "In addition, we reviewed reports and studies on international ESG  disclosure requirements to identify and obtain information about relevant  policy approaches implemented in other countries. We interviewed  government officials in the United Kingdom and Japan and stock  exchange and industry association representatives from South Africa to  obtain their perspectives on the quality of ESG disclosures in their  countries and the advantages and disadvantages of their current ESG  disclosure laws and policies. We selected these countries for interviews  because each had implemented one or more of the ESG policies that had  been discussed as potential policy proposals by investors and market  observers in the United States. Finally, we interviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of 13 market observers selected to represent a  range of stakeholders, including ESG standard-setting organizations,  academics, and representatives of industry and investor groups, to obtain  their perspectives on issues and policy options related to ESG  disclosures.
