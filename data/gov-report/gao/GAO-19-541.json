DOT must determine that an applicant's project meets statutory requirements in order for the project to be eligible for an INFRA award. DOT initially found that 97 applications had insufficient information for an eligibility determination. DOT followed up with 42 of the 97 applicants to request additional information. DOT did not sufficiently document why it followed up with certain applicants over others. If DOT does not clearly communicate and document its process regarding applicant follow-up, the process lacks transparency and the assurance of fairness.", "Evaluating applications. In addition to the statutory requirements, DOT established merit criteria (e.g., economic vitality) to evaluate projects against, and stated that competitive projects would substantively address all of the criteria. DOT teams scored the projects on how well they addressed each criterion. However, DOT forwarded the information on all 165 projects that were found to be statutorily eligible to the Secretary for potential award, regardless of how well they scored on the merit criteria. In the end, DOT awarded some projects that did not address all of the criteria. Several applicants told GAO they were uncertain how DOT determines which projects should receive awards. In addition, DOT's documentation does not provide insight into why projects were selected for awards, an issue GAO has previously noted and recommended DOT address.", "The above limitations reflect long-standing issues GAO has identified in DOT's discretionary grant programs. Specifically, since 2011, GAO has recommended actions to increase consistency and transparency. In some cases, DOT implemented the recommendations for one program, but GAO later found similar problems in other programs. After finding repeated issues, GAO recommended in 2016 that DOT develop a department-wide directive that would, among other things, require that key decisions be documented. DOT agreed with the recommendation. In a March 2019 memo, DOT directed offices to implement GAO's recommendation by June 2019. However, it is unclear how this action will improve transparency and consistency because, among other things, DOT did not communicate how offices should sufficiently document decisions to ensure that the rationale for decisions is clear. The next reauthorization of surface transportation programs provides Congress the opportunity to build requirements for greater consistency and transparency into DOT's grant programs. This is particularly important as DOT has two additional rounds of INFRA funding to award under the FAST Act, and the President's Budget proposal proposed providing an additional $1 billion to INFRA. Absent effective action by DOT going forward, the recurring and long-standing issues GAO has identified could continue to affect DOT's competitive discretionary grant programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that DOT should communicate and document the rationale for asking specific applicants for more information and provide information to applicants on how, if at all, DOT uses merit criteria scores to advance projects through its evaluation and selection process.

In December 2015, the Fixing America\u2019s  Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) established a nationally significant  freight and highway project program and authorized the appropriation of  $4.5 billion to the Department of Transportation (DOT) to award in  discretionary grants for such projects for fiscal years 2016 through 2020.  In 2016, DOT issued the first round of grants providing approximately  $759 million to 18 projects under this new program, called the Fostering  Advancement in Shipping and Transportation for the Long-term  Achievement of National Efficiencies (FASTLANE) program. We reviewed  DOT\u2019s processes used to evaluate and award FASTLANE grants and  found issues related to consistency and transparency.

We asked these staff how  they conducted reviews and documented their decisions. For the  technical review staff, we selected a sample of staff from six of the seven  teams that reviewed projects against criteria. We selected technical  review staff from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal  Railroad Administration (FRA), and United States Maritime Administration  (MARAD) to ensure diversity with respect to area of expertise and modal  administration.

Generally, federal agencies review  grant applications against published selection criteria and statutory and  regulatory requirements before selecting projects to receive awards.

In prior  work, we have recommended that a merit-based competitive approach\u2014 like INFRA\u2014be used to direct a portion of federal funds to transportation  projects of national and regional significance.

For  example, for one large project, a technical reviewer noted, \u201c\u2026 we  conclude that the benefits of this project are reasonably likely to  exceed its costs, though the case is very marginal and highly  uncertain, as even a small change in some of the key assumptions  and parameters could result in a negative finding.\u201d Uncertainty  regarding projects\u2019 benefit-cost ratios is particularly important as DOT  used these scores to assess whether large projects met the FAST Act  requirement to be cost-effective. While comments from technical  reviewers were not included in the spreadsheets provided to the  Secretary, an official stated that the Senior Review Team reviewed  each project in-depth with the Secretary, and other DOT officials  noted that the spreadsheet provided to the Secretary included the  uncertainty ratings for each project.", "Low scores on multiple criteria, or did not address all criteria.", "Two awarded small projects had a benefit-cost ratio of less than one,  and one of those projects did not address the innovation criteria at  all. Three of the 26 awarded projects (11.5 percent) did not address  the innovation criteria at all.", "In addition, several of the selected applicants and consultants we  interviewed expressed confusion regarding how DOT reviewed the  applications and moved them forward within DOT. Some of the applicants  and consultants thought that DOT used the project scores to determine  which projects should move forward to the Secretary (similarly to previous  rounds of other DOT grant programs in which projects were sorted into  categories such as \u201chighly recommended,\u201d \u201crecommended,\u201d and \u201cnot  recommended\u201d). One applicant noted that it is important to know how  many projects make it to the Secretary in order to understand the extent  to which decisions are based on technical scores versus other  considerations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Documentation of Rationale for Award Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s guidance states that grant recipients should be selected based on  technical merit and those projects most likely to achieve the intended  purpose. In addition, we have identified recommended practices for  awarding discretionary grants, one of which includes documenting the  rationale for award decisions. Documenting the rationale for award  decisions becomes even more important in light of DOT\u2019s decision to  provide every eligible INFRA application to the Secretary, rather than  providing the Secretary a list of the projects \u201cmost likely to achieve the  intended purpose.\u201d However, DOT\u2019s documentation on the final selection  of projects states the anticipated benefits of the projects but does not  indicate why these projects, according to DOT\u2019s guidance, \u201cbest address  program requirements and, therefore, are most worthy of funding.\u201d In our  review of the FASTLANE process, we also noted that due to limited  documentation, we could not determine how DOT selected which projects  should receive awards. We recommended that DOT require program  teams to document their decision-making rationale throughout all levels of  review in the application selection process. DOT agreed with this  recommendation; however, it has not yet been implemented. Therefore, it  remains unclear whether DOT is awarding discretionary grants on the  basis of merit principles or other considerations.

In some cases, DOT  implemented our recommendations for one program, but we  subsequently found similar or recurring problems in other DOT programs.", "In 2011, we reviewed DOT\u2019s Transportation Investment Generating  Economic Recovery (TIGER) program and FRA\u2019s High Speed Intercity  Passenger Rail program\u2014two discretionary grant programs funded  through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. For  both programs, we found, among other things, limitations in the agencies\u2019  documentation of the rationale for award decisions. With respect to  TIGER, we noted that a lack of documentation could subject DOT to  criticism that projects were selected for reasons other than merit.  However, we also noted that documenting key decisions could help build  confidence in DOT\u2019s ability to administer competitive discretionary grant  programs. We recommended that DOT and FRA improve their  documentation of key decisions for both programs. DOT implemented  these recommendations by updating its TIGER and FRA guidance to  require additional documentation.", "Despite the steps DOT took to address our prior recommendations, in  2014, we found continued issues in the TIGER program and made more  targeted recommendations. Specifically, we found that DOT did not  document key decisions to, among other things, (1) advance projects with  lower technical ratings instead of more highly rated projects, and (2)  change the technical ratings of lower-rated projects that had been  selected for an award. We recommended that the Secretary of  Transportation establish additional accountability measures for  management of the TIGER program, to include using a decision  memorandum or similar mechanism to document a clear rationale for  decisions to:  change the technical evaluation rating of an application, not advance applications rated as highly recommended, and advance for senior review applications other than those rated as  highly recommended.", "Subsequently, DOT revised its guidance for the TIGER program to  prohibit changes to the technical ratings, require that all highly rated  projects be advanced, define the conditions through which lower rated  projects may be advanced, and require that all such decisions be fully  documented. DOT did not require that these decisions be documented  through a decision memorandum or similar mechanism, as we had  recommended. However, taken together, we determined DOT\u2019s actions  were sufficient to address our recommendation for the TIGER program.", "In December 2016, we found similar problems during our review of the  Hurricane Sandy transit-resilience grant program administered by the  Federal Transit Administration (FTA). For example, we found that FTA  did not document rationales for changes to project ratings nor did it  document how it addressed high-level project concerns raised by  reviewers in their evaluation comments. In addition, we found that DOT  lacked clear department-wide requirements for what should be  documented when evaluating and selecting discretionary grant awards.  We noted that internal control standards state that all transactions and  significant events need to be clearly documented, and that a  recommended practice for evaluating and selecting discretionary grant  awards is documenting the rationale for awards decisions, including  reasons individual projects were selected or not selected. We also found  that FTA did not develop an evaluation plan prior to calling for  applications, despite the fact that this was a requirement in DOT\u2019s  Financial Assistance Guidance Manual and that recommended practices  for administering discretionary grant programs note the importance of  having an evaluation plan that describes a method for overseeing the  technical review panels to ensure a consistent review. Finally, we found  that FTA did not assess projects against the policy priorities it outlined in  its notice of funding availability, despite an OMB directive to provide  sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision  about whether to submit a proposal.", "At this time, we noted a pattern of problems occurring across DOT and its  modal administrations\u2019 discretionary grant programs and determined that  a department-wide action was needed to address these issues.  Specifically, we recommended that the Secretary issue a department- wide directive that should include requirements to: develop a plan for evaluating project proposals in advance of issuing  a notice of funding availability that defines the stages of the process,  including how the process will be overseen to ensure a consistent  review of applications; document key decisions, including the reason for any rating changes  and the officials responsible for those changes, and how high-level  concerns raised during the process were addressed; and align stated program purpose and policy priorities with the evaluation  and selection process.", "DOT concurred with our 2016 recommendation to develop a department- wide directive and initially stated that it would address it by updating its  Financial Assistance Guidance Manual by September 2018 (DOT  recently extended this to December 2019). In response, we noted that in  order to address our recommendation, DOT needed to issue a directive  that incorporates all of the elements identified in our recommendation. In  addition, it remains unclear whether updating the manual would have the  same effect as issuing the department-wide directive that we  recommended. Specifically, we have found that DOT has not always  followed its own guidance despite clear language that certain actions are  required. For example, in our 2017 review of the FASTLANE program, we  noted that the Financial Assistance Guidance Manual required finalization  of the evaluation plan prior to soliciting applications for grants, but this  guidance was not followed. Since 2017, we have sent letters to the Secretary of Transportation noting that this is a high-priority  recommendation that warrants her attention.", "In March 2019, DOT issued a one-page memo to all offices and  departments that administer discretionary grants. This memo directed the  offices to update their policies and procedures to implement our 2016  recommendation and to send the updated policies to DOT\u2019s Office of the  Senior Procurement Executive by June 30, 2019. DOT officials told us  that DOT believes this action has addressed the recommendation. Due to  a number of issues, however, it is unclear how this action will address our  recommendation to create clear department-wide requirements aimed at  improving transparency and consistency. Specifically, we found that the  memo was essentially limited to a repetition of our recommendation. That  is, DOT did not take steps to ensure that the various affected offices  consistently interpret and implement the recommendation. For example,  DOT did not define key terms such as \u201chigh level concerns,\u201d or \u201ckey  decisions.\u201d In addition, DOT did not communicate to offices how they  should sufficiently document their decisions to ensure that the rationale  for those decisions\u2014including the reasons individual projects were  selected or not selected\u2014is clear. DOT officials told us they wanted to  provide the affected offices flexibility to implement the recommendation  and would assess the need for additional guidance based on the  completion of the Financial Assistance Guidance Manual. However, the  lack of information regarding how offices should implement the memo  raises significant questions about whether various offices will interpret  and implement the recommendations differently, and enhances the risk  that DOT will continue to lack a department-wide approach to ensure that  discretionary grant programs are consistently and transparently  administered.", "As DOT continues to try to address these long-standing issues with its  discretionary grant programs, Congress has an opportunity through  reauthorization legislation, scheduled for 2020, to build requirements for  enhanced consistency and transparency into these programs. This is  particularly important as DOT has two additional rounds of INFRA funding  to award under the FAST Act, and the President\u2019s Budget proposal  proposed providing an additional $1 billion to INFRA. Moreover, the FAST  Act also authorized over a dozen discretionary transportation grant  programs, and Congress may consider additional programs during the  reauthorization of DOT\u2019s surface transportation programs. Through  legislation, Congress could craft requirements around the administration  of DOT\u2019s discretionary grants to improve the processes for awarding  grants.

In addition, without  documentation outlining why DOT decided to request additional  information from certain applicants over others, the process lacks  transparency.", "Since the FAST Act was enacted in 2015, we have been unable to  determine the basis for the resulting awards of about $2.3 billion through  the FASTLANE and INFRA program. This lack of clarity is significant and  is the product of long-standing issues that we have identified with DOT\u2019s  discretionary grant programs since 2011. We have previously noted that  competitive discretionary grant programs have promise in better targeting  federal transportation spending to areas of national and regional  significance; however, this promise cannot be fulfilled if DOT\u2019s process  and rationale for making awards remains unclear. In 2019, DOT issued a  department-wide memo aimed at addressing our 2016 recommendation,  but it is unclear how DOT\u2019s approach will improve consistency and  transparency in its management of grant programs.
