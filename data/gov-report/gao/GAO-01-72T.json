NPR stated that the level of service a customer receives should not vary significantly across an organization. NPR also found that model customer service organizations in the private sector generally follow three consistent approaches or best practices for telephone communications. First, they set challenging goals for meeting callers\u2019 needs for timely and accurate information. Second, they collect credible performance data to measure progress in attaining those goals.

Some mail requires a response\u2014 for example, congressional inquiries on behalf of constituents. However, district office officials said they believed that most of the mail does not require a response. For example, medical reports are used to assist claims examiners in adjudicating cases but do not usually require a response. Although OWCP did not know what proportion of its mail requires a response, district office officials\u2019 estimates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent.", "The telephone calls and written correspondence are handled primarily by 12 OWCP district offices nationwide, which had a total of about 900 employees as of December 1, 1999.

That goal could be met by OWCP\u2019s calling the people within 3 days, giving them the status of their claims, and saying that the answer to their questions would follow at a later time. However, OWCP\u2019s Acting Director noted that this is the only response possible for many calls when OWCP lacks information, such as doctors\u2019 reports, needed to resolve the caller inquiry. OWCP also had a separate goal established in fiscal year 1999 to return 95 percent of calls related to medical authorizations within 3 days. whose employees\u2019 only responsibility is answering telephone calls. He explained that because district offices have many other responsibilities in addition to answering calls, some district offices prefer to direct most calls to voice mail and respond at a later time.  Several district directors told us that, if there were such a goal, assigning additional employees to answer calls would take time away from their adjudication of claims.", "The scope of NPR\u2019s study did not include identifying what goals the private sector has for responding to written inquiries, as it did for telephone communications.  Thus, we could not compare the goals that OWCP has established for the timeliness of written communications with an NPR suggested standard.", "Nevertheless, for nonpriority mail requiring a response, OWCP had a goal of responding to 85 percent within 30 days. OWCP also had goals for responding to priority mail from Congress: 90 percent within 14 days and 98 percent within 30 days. These goals do not compare favorably to VBA\u2019s goal of responding to all written benefit inquiries within 10 workdays and Ohio\u2019s BWC\u2019s goal of responding to written requests the same day, or within 24 hours of the request\u2019s being referred to another section of the Bureau.", "OWCP also did not have a national goal for responding to requests for medical authorizations in the mail, through e-mail, or by fax. Nonetheless, the five district offices we visited gave written medical authorization requests received by mail the same priority that OWCP gave congressional correspondence. Several of these five offices have also established their own goals for medical authorizations received by e-mail or fax. For example, the Dallas district office encourages claimants to use e-mail for medical authorizations. Dallas had a goal of responding to 90 percent of e- mails within 24 hours.

It could do this by either creating a record of all such calls or of a statistically valid sample. While all calls may not require a response, district office officials have stated that most callers have inquiries that require a response. The national office suggested--but did not require--that district employees use a standardized computer program (CA- 110) to make a recording of all calls requiring a response, as well as of those in which the content is relevant to adjudicating decisions.  OWCP did not require the use of this program for all calls because some district office employees have complained about taking time away from their other tasks to record the information, such as the date and nature of the call.", "We found that all 12 district offices used the CA-110 system to some extent. However, two of the five offices we visited\u2014Dallas and Seattle-- told us that they entered only about 15 percent or fewer of all calls requiring a response and did not enter calls in the systematic manner that would be necessary to yield valid results. The other three offices\u2014 Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.--estimated that they entered about 75, 75, and 95 percent of the calls requiring a response, respectively. However, our analysis of the number of calls received and the number of calls recorded in the CA-110 system suggests that these estimates are high.For example, San Francisco estimated that it entered 75 percent, but for a 3-month period in fiscal year 2000, San Francisco received 76,238 calls and entered 14,502, or 19 percent, in the CA-110 system. sampling plan approved by OWCP headquarters when recording information. However, the OWCP Acting Director said that each of these four offices had developed a modified version of the sampling plan and that their plans--while approved by OWCP--were probably not statistically valid. We reviewed the national office\u2019s sampling plan for the data to be entered into these systems and also believe that this plan would not yield statistically valid results even if implemented as designed.", "The telephone response rates developed using the CA-110 and other systems indicated that the district offices were generally meeting their timeliness goals.

The results of these samples were to be reported to the national office on a quarterly basis. Four of the five district offices we visited each had a different approach for sampling such correspondence, and each stated that its approach was not scientifically developed or developed in a manner that would produce valid results if projected to the universe of all responses. For example, the Dallas district office required each claims examiner to provide his or her supervisor four pieces of written correspondence requiring a response per month to determine whether the response was provided within 30 days. We are concerned about the validity of this approach because, among other things, the potential exists for the claims examiner to give the supervisor only those letters to which the response was timely.", "The Seattle district office required claims examiners to log in all general correspondence received every Wednesday that required a response. Supervisors were to review the claimants\u2019 files for these letters after 30 days to determine whether a response had been sent within the 30-day goal. days.

OWCP did not have goals\u2014 nor did it have related measures\u2014for three basic areas of telephone communications: the percentage of callers able to access the telephone system, the percentage of callers who can reach a customer service representative and their time waiting on line, and the percentage of callers\u2019 inquiries that are resolved during the first call.", "Officials from SSA and VBA told us that setting goals for those areas (e.g., telephone access) for their agencies and measuring the results has proven useful in identifying areas where customer satisfaction levels needed improving. For example, data from SSA\u2019s customer satisfaction surveys in 1993 showed that access was the single biggest factor affecting customer satisfaction. According to an SSA official, SSA began collecting access data and found that callers attempting to reach SSA at the busiest times were getting busy signals 50 percent of the time. SSA established a telephone access goal and continued to collect access data, explore new technologies, and acquire additional telephone capacity. By 1996, SSA said, it was able to set and achieve a goal of 95 percent of the callers reaching the system within 5 minutes, and customer satisfaction scores improved accordingly.", "My point in using this example is that without goals or measures in these three basic high priority areas, OWCP was not in a position to know what levels of customer service it was providing and where and how telephone services needed to be improved.", "For the goals that OWCP did establish, we found that it often did not collect credible performance data from surveys of (1) injured workers, (2) medical providers, or (3) employees that was sufficiently reliable or done in a timely manner to measure progress or to set goals for improving customer service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OWCP Did Little to Gauge Customer Satisfaction Levels", "paragraphs": ["NPR found that model telephone service organizations in the private sector survey (1) their customers frequently to determine how satisfied they are with the services provided and (2) their employees who are answering the phones for job satisfaction levels and ideas to improve their services.

Since 1996, OWCP has hired a contractor to conduct customer satisfaction surveys about once each year to determine claimants\u2019 perceptions of several aspects of the FECA program, including overall service, the timeliness of responses to telephone inquiries, and the timeliness, thoroughness, and accuracy of written responses to claimants\u2019 inquiries.The claimants are selected on a random sample basis.

For example, the Seattle district office, in May 2000, initiated a program to begin calling a sample of all telephone callers within the same week they called. The district director said that the office asked the callers whether the response was appropriate and if the caller was satisfied with the representative\u2019s response. OWCP national office officials said that these efforts did not ensure that consistent questions were used or that a random sample of all district office customers was surveyed.", "OWCP also has not surveyed its own employees regarding customer service or employee satisfaction within the last 5 years. According to NPR, employee satisfaction is measured as routinely as customer satisfaction in model customer service organizations. NPR cited as benefits of such employee surveys: obtaining information on how to improve the work processes that lead to improved customer service, as well as identifying employee morale issues that could lead to customer service problems. In addition, Executive Order 12862 directed agencies to survey front-line employees on barriers to, and ideas for, matching the best in business.

We generated listings for our callers which provided the dates, times, and phone numbers to be called, and when applicable, the claim information to be accessed. OWCP provided information about the breakdown of IVR call types for four of the twelve OWCP district offices (Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Seattle) during a 2-month period.  We used this information to build a nongeneralizable profile of the distribution of IVR calls across the following six types of claim information for each district office (number of calls per district office in parentheses): claimant calling about a bill payment ( 47), medical provider calling about a bill payment  (8), medical provider calling about a periodic roll payment  (24), claimant calling about a compensation check  (10), claimant calling about physical therapy authorization  (2), and medical provider calling about physical therapy authorization  (9).", "For the IVR calls, we were provided with identifiers, such as claim numbers and employer identification numbers, that enabled us to enter the IVR and identify specific transactions on each office\u2019s automated database. We worked with OWCP to identify a time period of earlier transactions from the national database that would still exist in each district office\u2019s IVR system during our test period in June and July 2000.  OWCP sampled records from their national database for this time period until they obtained the required number of records of each type, for each district office. OWCP\u2019s selection of IVR cases did not strictly constitute a random sample of cases for each office from the specified time period, since the cases were selected in case number order, which generally reflected a chronological order, until the required number of cases was obtained. However, since we had no reason to believe that time ordering of the cases was associated with whether a district office\u2019s IVR data would match the information in the national database, we accepted OWCP\u2019s selections for use in our test.", "All of our test calls attempted to reach an OWCP representative, either directly or after accessing the IVR system.  We therefore randomly scheduled all our test calls only during the hours that each office told us that a \u201clive\u201d representative should be available to respond to customer inquiries.  Saturdays, Sundays, and Tuesday, July 4, 2000, were excluded from our test days.", "For district offices that had the same telephone number for the automated voice response system and for a representative, we called that number 200 times and attempted to reach a representative immediately upon accessing the system on 100 of those calls and attempted to access claim information on the automated system and then access a representative on the other 100 calls. For offices that had separate numbers for the automated voice response system and the representative, we called each number 100 times. As before, upon completion of the automated voice response system, we attempted to reach a representative. All representatives contacted were informed that they had participated in a GAO telephone survey. When attempting to access an OWCP office\u2019s telephone system, we let the telephone ring 15 times (over 1 minute) before making the determination that the telephone system did not answer.  And, in waiting for a representative to answer the line, we waited at least 5 minutes after making the selection to speak to a representative before determining that the call was not answered. We used the 5 minute time period because we wanted to be more conservative than VBA\u2019s goal of a caller\u2019s accessing a representative within 3 minutes and NPR\u2019s guidance and Ohio\u2019s BWC\u2019s goal of 30 seconds. For each call, we recorded how successful the district office was in providing services an injured worker or medical provider might desire. The information recorded included busy signals, no answer after 1 minute, whether we reached an office representative, whether we reached the automated voice response system, and whether consistent information was provided about the claimant by that system, such as the amount of a medical payment or the status of medical authorization for physical therapy. We conducted this telephone survey over a 6-week period in June and July 2000, and attempted the calls throughout the business hours listed for each district office.", "If the test calls we made were considered random samples of customers\u2019 telephone experiences during the test period, the following statements could be made about the precision of the estimates:", "Estimates of the proportion of calls in each district in which customers were unable to access the telephone systems, and the proportion of calls in each district in which customers were unable to reach an employee within five minutes, have sampling errors of no more than 10 percentage points.", "Estimates of the proportion of IVR calls with consistent data (among IVR calls for which transactions could be tested) have sampling errors of no more than 10 percentage points unless otherwise noted in table II.1.", "The data we collected, however, were from test calls rather than \u201cactual\u201d customer calls.  Characteristics of the test calls that might affect the outcomes we measured, such as time of day, day of week, or subject matter, might not have mirrored the profile of these characteristics among \u201cactual\u201d customers\u2019 phone calls in any district during the test period. Therefore, the results displayed for individual districts might differ from the ones we might have obtained by sampling \u201cactual\u201d customer calls, by amounts larger than the stated sampling errors.", "At OWCP\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., we interviewed knowledgeable officials, reviewed strategic and operational plans for fiscal years 1995 through 2000 to identify goals and measures related to responding to customer inquiries, and obtained communication reports showing data that would indicate OWCP\u2019s performance for the same period.  We also discussed with these officials methods for testing the communications at OWCP district offices, and obtained claimant and medical provider information so that we could perform a telephone survey of the 12 district offices.", "We visited 5 of the 12 OWCP district offices\u2014Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. At these five offices, we conducted an in-depth review; we interviewed regional directors, district directors, claims managers, claims examiners, and workers compensation assistants to gain an understanding of the communications at OWCP from various perspectives. We obtained available communication reports, accountability review reports, reports measuring written and telephone communication performance, and other applicable communication data. We selected the five offices based on several factors to obtain a mixture of offices of differing sizes and levels of performance. The primary factors were (1) the number of employees and the number of cases managed at these offices, which ranged from among the lowest to among the highest of all the district offices; (2) OWCP\u2019s telephone and written responsiveness measures, which indicated that some offices had and some had not met national performance goals; and (3) the proximity of two of the offices to our Washington, D.C., and Dallas Regional Office staff.", "We surveyed the other seven district offices--Boston, Cleveland, Denver, Jacksonville, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia--via a questionnaire and obtained general information about their communication practices, such as the number of employees each assigned to respond to telephone calls.", "To compare OWCP\u2019s goals and practices for telephone communication with those of leading organizations, we also surveyed three agencies that have won awards for their telephone communication practices: the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Bureau of Benefits Administration, and state of Ohio\u2019s Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (BWC). We asked OWCP and the three agencies to identify which of 95 telephone \u201cbest practices\u201d they used that NPR identified in a 1995 study. We did not attempt to verify or validate their responses. In addition, we interviewed and obtained documents on communication performance goals and practices from officials at the three organizations and compared OWCP\u2019s performance goals and measures with those of private sector organizations identified in the NPR study and those of the three organizations we surveyed.", "We did our work between January and September 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access Rates For And Accuracy Of OWCP District Offices\u2019 Automated Interactive Voice Response Systems", "paragraphs": ["Number (percentage) of transactions with consistent data55(93) 48(94) 49(91)48(94) 56(93) 28(88)58(98) 47(90)55(93) 42(100) 561(94)", "The district office had separate telephone numbers for accessing the automated interactive voice response system and accessing an OWCP representative.
