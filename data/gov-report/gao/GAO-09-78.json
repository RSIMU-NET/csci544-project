GAO was asked to determine the extent to which NMFS (1) can accurately identify the marine mammal stocks--generally a population of animals of the same species located in a common area--that meet the MMPA's requirements for establishing such teams, (2) has established teams for those stocks that meet the requirements, (3) has met the MMPA's deadlines for the teams subject to them, and (4) evaluates the effectiveness of take reduction regulations. GAO reviewed the MMPA, and NMFS data on marine mammals, and take reduction team documents and obtained the views of NMFS officials, scientists, and take reduction team members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Significant limitations in available data make it difficult for NMFS to accurately determine which marine mammal stocks meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction teams. For most stocks, NMFS relies on incomplete, outdated, or imprecise data on stocks' population size or mortality to calculate the extent of incidental take. As a result, the agency may overlook some marine mammal stocks that meet the MMPA's requirements for establishing teams or inappropriately identify others as meeting them. NMFS officials told GAO they are aware of the data limitations but lack funding to implement their plans to improve the data. On the basis of NMFS's available information, GAO identified 30 marine mammal stocks that have met the MMPA's requirements for establishing a take reduction team, and NMFS has established six teams that cover 16 of them. For the other 14 stocks, the agency has not complied with the MMPA's requirements. For example, false killer whales, found off the Hawaiian Islands, have met the statutory requirements since 2004, but NMFS has not established a team for them because, according to NMFS officials, the agency lacks sufficient funds. NMFS officials told GAO that the agency has not established teams for the other stocks that meet the MMPA's requirements for reasons such as the following: (1) data on these stocks are outdated or incomplete, and the agency lacks funds to obtain better information and (2) causes other than fishery-related incidental take, such as sonar used by the U.S. Navy, may contribute to their injury or death, therefore changes to fishing practices would not solve the problem. For the five take reduction teams subject to the MMPA's deadlines, the agency has had limited success in meeting the deadlines for establishing teams, developing draft take reduction plans, and publishing proposed and final plans and regulations to implement them. For example, NMFS established three of the five teams--the Atlantic Large Whale, Pelagic Longline, and Bottlenose Dolphin--from 3 months to over 5 years past the deadline. NMFS officials attributed the delays in establishing one of the teams to a lack of information about stock population size and mortality, which teams need to consider before developing draft take reduction plans. NMFS does not have a comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of take reduction plans and implementing regulations that have been implemented. NMFS has taken some steps to define goals, monitor compliance, and assess whether the goals have been met, but shortcomings in its approach and limitations in its performance data weaken its ability to assess the success of its take reduction regulations. For example, without adequate information about compliance, if incidental takes continue once the regulations have been implemented, it will be difficult to determine whether the regulations were ineffective or whether the fisheries were not complying with them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Marine mammals\u2013\u2013such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises\u2013\u2013often swim  or feed in waters where commercial fishing occurs and can become  entangled in fishing gear, which may seriously injure or kill them\u2013\u2013this is  referred to as \u201cincidental take.\u201d The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration\u2019s (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)  estimates that commercial fishing operations result in thousands of such  incidental takes each year. For example, large whales, such as the North  Atlantic right whale, may become entangled in the lines that connect  lobster traps; smaller pilot whales may become entangled in longline  fishing gear used to catch fish such as tuna or swordfish; and dolphins and  porpoises may become entangled in commercial fishing nets used to catch  sardines, salmon, or cod. For at least five marine mammals, incidental  takes as a result of commercial fishing operations are occurring at  unsustainable levels.", "The 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of  1972 require NMFS to establish take reduction teams to develop regulatory  or voluntary measures for the reduction of incidental mortality and serious  injury to marine mammals during the course of commercial fishing  operations. Under the MMPA, NMFS, in general, must establish take  reduction teams for each marine mammal strategic stock that interacts  with a Category I or Category II commercial fishery. These key terms are  defined as follows:    A commercial fishery is a group of fishermen who use similar gear to catch  the same types of fish, in a common geographic area, and then sell them.", "A Category I fishery is a commercial fishery that has frequent incidental  takes of marine mammals, while a Category II fishery has occasional  incidental takes.", "A stock is a group of marine mammals of the same species located in a  common spatial arrangement that interbreed when mature.", "The MMPA defines a marine mammal stock as strategic, if it (1) is listed as  threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), (2) is  declining and likely to be listed as a threatened species under the ESA  within the foreseeable future, (3) is designated as depleted under the  MMPA, or (4) has a level of direct human-caused mortality and serious  injury that exceeds the stock\u2019s potential biological removal level. In this  report we use the term \u201cmaximum removal level,\u201d rather than potential  biological removal level; this term is defined as the maximum number of  animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a  marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its  optimum sustainable population.", "NMFS periodically surveys marine mammal populations to determine  whether they are growing, remaining stable, or declining, so that it can  calculate the maximum removal level. The results of this research are  published in annual stock assessment reports for 156 stocks that fall under  NMFS\u2019s jurisdiction. Additionally, NMFS annually publishes lists that  classify commercial fisheries as Category I, II, or III based on data such as  those from observers who are placed on boats, logbooks that are kept by  fishermen, and data gathered by scientists at universities and government  agencies, among others, documenting instances where marine mammals  are found stranded or dead as a result of fishing or other human causes.", "According to the MMPA, take reduction teams must include  representatives from the commercial fishing industry, Regional Fishery  Management Councils, interstate fisheries commissions, environmental  groups, academic and scientific organizations, and state and federal  governments. Once NMFS has established a team, the members meet,  review the available information regarding marine mammal takes and  fisheries interactions, and develop draft take reduction plans. The plans  recommend regulatory and voluntary measures, such as modifications in  fishing gear or practices that should reduce serious injury or mortality of  marine mammals caused by commercial fishing. As specified in the MMPA,  NMFS then translates these draft plans into final take reduction plans and  implementing regulations.", "The 1994 amendments to the MMPA set several deadlines for establishing  take reduction teams, developing draft take reduction plans, and  publishing proposed and final plans and implementing regulations.  Specifically,    NMFS must establish a take reduction team within 30 days after a final  stock assessment report indicates that a stock is strategic and it is listed in  the current list of fisheries as interacting with a Category I or II fishery.", "Take reduction team members must develop a draft plan and submit the  plan to NMFS within 6 months after the take reduction team is  established.", "NMFS must publish a proposed take reduction plan in the Federal Register  within 60 days of receiving the team\u2019s draft plan.", "NMFS must hold a public comment period on the proposed take reduction  plan for up to 90 days after its publication.", "NMFS must publish a final take reduction plan in the Federal Register 60  days after the public comment period on the proposed plan ends.", "As Congress prepares to consider the reauthorization of the MMPA, you  asked us to determine the extent to which (1) available data allow NMFS  to accurately identify the marine mammal stocks that meet the MMPA\u2019s  requirements for establishing take reduction teams; (2) NMFS has  established take reduction teams for those marine mammal stocks that  meet the statutory requirements; (3) NMFS has met the statutory deadlines  established in the MMPA for the take reduction teams subject to the  deadlines, and the reasons for any delays; and (4) NMFS has developed a  comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take  reduction plans that have been implemented.", "To determine the extent to which available data allow NMFS to identify  the marine mammal stocks that meet the MMPA\u2019s requirements for  establishing take reduction teams, we identified several key data elements,  such as human-caused mortality estimates and maximum removal levels,  that NMFS uses to determine whether a marine mammal stock meets the  statutory requirements for establishing a take reduction team, as well as  the criteria NMFS uses to assess data quality for these key data elements.", "We then reviewed all of the 2007 marine mammal stock assessment  reports and analyzed reports for the 113 stocks not currently covered by  take reduction teams and not listed as threatened or endangered species  or designated as depleted species. After removing those that lacked  human-caused mortality estimates or maximum removal levels, we  reviewed a sample of the remaining 74 stocks that did have these  determinations to assess the reliability of the information used to  determine human-caused mortality estimates and the maximum removal  levels. We reviewed a sample of the reports for these stocks to identify any  data uncertainties that may limit NMFS\u2019s ability to accurately identify  stocks that meet the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction  teams. To determine the extent to which NMFS has established take  reduction teams, we analyzed stock assessment reports and lists of  fisheries from 1995 through 2008 to identify marine mammal stocks that  meet the statutory requirements but are not currently covered by a team.  Additionally, we interviewed NMFS officials and obtained documentation  on the stocks for which the agency has established take reduction teams.  To identify the extent to which NMFS has met the deadlines established in  the MMPA, we identified the deadlines listed in the MMPA for take  reduction teams and obtained documentation, such as take reduction  plans and implementing regulations, to determine whether NMFS met the  statutory deadlines. To identify the reasons for any delays in meeting the  statutory deadlines, we interviewed the NMFS staff members that  coordinate the take reduction teams, staff from NOAA\u2019s Office of General  Counsel, marine biologists in NMFS\u2019s Fishery Science Centers, and  members of each of the five take reduction teams subject to the MMPA\u2019s  deadlines. To identify the extent to which NMFS has developed a  comprehensive strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of its take  reduction plans, we reviewed data from stock assessment reports on the  level of fishery-related mortality and serious injury as well as maximum  removal levels before and after a plan\u2019s implementation. We also  interviewed NMFS officials, including agency staff that coordinate take  reduction teams, regarding how they assess the effectiveness of take  reduction plans. We conducted this performance audit from September  2007 to December 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Among other  things, this act established the Marine Mammal Commission, which must  continually review the condition of marine mammal stocks and  recommend to the appropriate federal officials and Congress any steps it  deems necessary or desirable for the protection and conservation of  marine mammals. In 1994, the MMPA was amended to create a process  for establishing take reduction teams to manage incidental takes\u2013\u2013serious  injury or death\u2013\u2013in the course of commercial fishing operations.  Commercial fishing in areas where marine mammals swim, feed, or breed  is considered one of the main human causes of incidental take. Marine  mammals can become entangled in fishing equipment such as nets or  hooks, although specific threats vary by the fishing techniques used.  Appendix II provides details on commercial fishing techniques that can  result in incidental take, including gillnetting, longlining, trap/pot fishing,  and trawling, as well as examples of the marine mammals affected.", "Under the 1994 amendments to the MMPA, NMFS must establish take  reduction teams when two requirements are satisfied: (1) NMFS  designates the stock as strategic in a final stock assessment report, and (2)  the stock interacts with a commercial fishery listed as Category I or II in  the current list of fisheries. According to the MMPA, if there is insufficient  funding to develop and implement take reduction plans for all stocks that  meet the requirements, NMFS should establish teams based on specified  priorities. For the majority of stocks, NMFS determines strategic status  by comparing whether human-caused mortality exceeds the maximum  removal level (see fig. 1). Human-caused mortality and serious injury  (hereafter known as human-caused mortality) is estimated by adding  fishery-related mortality estimates to mortality caused by other human  sources, as follows:    Fishery-related mortality and serious injury estimates (hereafter known as  fishery-related mortality estimates) are generated based on data from  NMFS\u2019s fishery observer programs, whereby individuals board commercial  fishing vessels and document instances of incidental take. NMFS also uses  anecdotal information from scientists, fishermen, and others about  additional incidental take to make these estimates.", "Mortality and serious injury caused by other human sources such as  collisions with large ships or authorized subsistence hunting of marine  mammals by Alaska natives.", "The maximum removal level\u2014technically known as the potential  biological removal level\u2013\u2013is calculated for each marine mammal stock by  multiplying three factors:    The minimum population estimate (hereafter known as the population size  estimate) for the specific stock of marine mammals.", "Two adjustments designed to (1) factor in the expected rate of natural  growth for a stock and (2) reduce the risks associated with data  uncertainties, especially for stocks listed as endangered or threatened or  designated as depleted. By altering the values of these adjustments, NMFS  can make the maximum removal level more conservative\u2013\u2013meaning that  fewer incidental takes will be allowed\u2013\u2013in cases of uncertain data, and  therefore make it less likely that they will identify a stock as nonstrategic.", "The MMPA requires NMFS to assess the status of each stock under its  jurisdiction and determine whether it is strategic or not. NMFS publishes  annual stock assessment reports that include, among other things, the  strategic status of each marine mammal stock and the information used to  make these strategic status determinations. Information contained in the  reports must be based on the best scientific information available. NMFS\u2019s  Fishery Science Centers are responsible for publishing the stock  assessment reports, and the Office of Protected Resources, along with  NMFS regional offices, is responsible for using the data from the reports to  decide whether to establish a take reduction team. Regional Scientific  Review Groups\u2013\u2013composed of individuals with expertise in marine  mammal biology, commercial fishing technology and practices, and other  areas\u2013\u2013review all stock assessment reports prior to publication. NMFS  also uses fishery-related mortality estimates and maximum removal levels  in the stock assessment reports to categorize fisheries in its annual list of  fisheries. Under the amended MMPA, commercial fisheries are classified  as Category I if they have frequent incidental take of marine mammals and  as Category II if they have occasional take.", "Once a stock is identified as requiring a take reduction team\u2013\u2013because it is  strategic and interacts with a Category I or II fishery\u2013\u2013the MMPA requires  NMFS to establish a team and appoint take reduction team members. The  MMPA requires the take reduction team members to develop and submit a  draft take reduction plan designed to reduce the incidental take of marine  mammals by commercial fishing operations. If NMFS lacks sufficient  funding to develop and implement a take reduction plan for all stocks that  satisfy the MMPA\u2019s requirements, the MMPA directs NMFS to give highest  priority to take reduction plans for those stocks (1) for which incidental  mortality and serious injury exceed the maximum removal level, (2) with a  small population size, and (3) that are declining most rapidly. The MMPA  requires that draft take reduction plans be developed by consensus among  take reduction team members. If take reduction team members cannot  reach consensus, the members must submit the range of possibilities they  considered and the views of both the majority and minority to NMFS.  These draft plans may include regulatory measures (known as take  reduction regulations) such as gear modifications or geographical area  closures that fisheries would be required to follow and voluntary measures  such as research plans for identifying the primary causes and solutions for  incidental take or education and outreach for commercial fishermen.", "After the take reduction team members develop and submit a draft take  reduction plan to NMFS, the agency must publish a proposed plan in the  Federal Register. The MMPA requires NMFS to take the team\u2019s draft plan  into consideration when it develops a proposed plan but does not require  adoption of the draft plan. If the team fails to meet its deadline for  submitting a draft plan to NMFS, the MMPA requires NMFS to develop and  propose a plan on its own. For strategic stocks, the proposed plan must  include measures NMFS expects will reduce incidental take below the  maximum removal level within 6 months of the plan\u2019s implementation.  Once the proposed plan is published in the Federal Register, NMFS must  solicit public comments on the plan before the agency finalizes and  implements it by publishing a final plan in the Federal Register. NMFS\u2019s  development and publication of proposed and final plans are subject to  several laws, including the following:    Endangered Species Act: The act requires consultation among  federal agencies including NMFS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  to ensure that any take reduction plan is not likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of any endangered or threatened species.", "National Environmental Policy Act: The act requires NMFS to  evaluate the likely environmental effects of any take reduction plan  using an environmental assessment or, if the plans will likely have  significant environmental effects, a more detailed environmental  impact statement.", "Regulatory Flexibility Act: The act requires NMFS to assess the  economic impact of any take reduction plan on small entities.", "The proposed and final take reduction plans are also subject to the  requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act, Information Quality  Act, Magnuson-Stevens Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act, among  others. In addition to these laws, the proposed and final take reduction  plans are subject to the requirements of four executive orders. For  example, one executive order requires NMFS to submit the proposed and  final take reduction plans to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  for review if NMFS or OMB determines that the plan is a significant  regulatory action.", "The 1994 amendments to the MMPA provide deadlines to establish take  reduction teams and develop and publish proposed and final plans.

Our review of  stock assessment reports from 2007 found that 39 of 113 stocks are either  missing human-caused mortality estimates or maximum removal levels,  making it impossible to determine strategic status in accordance with the  MMPA requirements. As a result, for these 39 stocks, NMFS is  determining strategic status without key information and therefore might  not accurately determine whether a stock requires a take reduction team.  According to NMFS officials, maximum removal level and human-caused  mortality estimates are often missing because scientists have been unable  to gather the necessary data to make these determinations.", "In the absence of human-caused mortality estimates or maximum removal  levels, NMFS must make more subjective\u2013\u2013and potentially inaccurate\u2013\u2013 strategic status determinations for some marine mammal stocks. In these  cases, NMFS guidance directs scientists to use professional judgment to  determine whether a stock is strategic. According to NMFS officials,  scientists may use a variety of sources to make these decisions, including  scientists\u2019 field observations of the marine mammals. However, Marine  Mammal Commission officials we spoke with stated that decisions based  on professional judgment are less certain than those based on data about  human-caused mortality and maximum removal levels and could result in  some marine mammal stocks that should be identified as strategic not  being identified as such.", "Even in cases where the stock assessment reports include human-caused  mortality estimates and maximum removal levels for a stock, the human- caused mortality estimates may be inaccurate because the information on  which they are based is incomplete. Human-caused mortality estimates are  based in part on fishery-related mortality. However, according to Marine  Mammal Commission officials, in some cases, mortality may be occurring  in fisheries where NMFS does not systematically collect mortality  information. Specifically, NMFS\u2019s observer programs\u2013\u2013a key source of  data NMFS uses to calculate fishery-related mortality estimates-\u2013\u2013gather  information for only half of the total fisheries, but incidental take may also  be occurring in some fisheries that are not observed, especially those that  are classified as Category I or II. Observer program officials told us that  funding limitations prohibit coverage of all Category I or II fisheries.", "In addition, our review of 2007 stock assessment reports found instances  where fishery-related mortality estimates were missing important  information. For example, NMFS scientists identified spinner and  bottlenose dolphins in Hawaii as nonstrategic, but raised concerns about  these decisions because the estimates of fishery-related mortality for the  stocks were likely to be incomplete. Specifically, they stated that while the  agency has observer program data showing that incidental take from a  longline fishery was below the maximum removal level, it did not have  observer programs in gillnet fisheries that were also likely to incidentally  take the stocks, and therefore might have increased the fishery-related  mortality estimate if these fisheries had been observed.", "Furthermore, NMFS, Marine Mammal Commission, and Scientific Review  Group scientists expressed concern that strategic status decisions for  some stocks may not be accurate because NMFS does not have all of the  information needed to define the stocks accurately. Under the MMPA,  marine mammal species are treated as stocks\u2014populations located in a  common area that interbreed when mature. However, a 2004 NMFS report  found that the stock definitions for 61 percent of marine mammal stocks  were potentially not accurate. For example, a stock definition would not  be accurate if NMFS defined two distinct populations of a marine mammal  species incorrectly as one stock. If one of these two populations has a high  level of incidental take and the other does not, the combined human- caused mortality estimate might not be high enough to result in a strategic  status determination. However, if the two distinct populations were  defined as two stocks, the high incidental take of one stock could result in  it being considered strategic and triggering one of the requirements for  take reduction team establishment. The Alaska Scientific Review Group  has raised concerns that inaccurate stock definitions may be leading to  incorrect strategic status designations. Specifically, in a 2007 letter to  NMFS, the review group said that recent scientific information indicates  that the current stock definitions might inappropriately consolidate harbor  seal populations in Alaska. The review group chair said that this  consolidation may lead to some harbor seal populations being incorrectly  categorized as nonstrategic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outdated Information Reduces the Reliability of NMFS\u2019s Strategic Status Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Our review of a sample of stock assessment reports found that  approximately 11 of the 74 stocks used outdated information\u2013\u2013 information that is 8 years old or older\u2013\u2013to calculate the maximum  removal level, thereby reducing the reliability of the strategic status  determinations for these stocks. According to NMFS guidelines,  information that is 8 years old or older is generally unreliable for  estimating the current stock population. NMFS scientists estimate the size  of a stock\u2019s population to determine its maximum removal level. If human- caused mortality exceeds maximum removal levels, the stock is  considered strategic. However, when the data are 8 years old or older,  scientific research has shown that marine mammal stocks could have  declined significantly since the data were collected. This could lead  NMFS to inaccurately designate a stock as nonstrategic and therefore not  establish a take reduction team when one might be needed. In addition, if  a stock\u2019s population has increased significantly during the time period  since the last estimate was made, NMFS may inaccurately designate the  stock as strategic. Furthermore, our review found that for approximately  21 of the 74 stocks, the population size information was between 5 and 8  years old, a situation that is less of a concern than data that are 8 years old  or older, but could also lead NMFS to make an inaccurate strategic stock  determination. NMFS and Marine Mammal Commission scientists stated  that scientists\u2019 confidence in the accuracy of the information used to  estimate population size begins to decrease even before 8 years.

Furthermore, we also found that NMFS  could often not identify the level of precision for fishery-related mortality  estimates. Specifically, we found that    Approximately 48 of 74 stocks had population size estimates\u2014used to  determine maximum removal levels\u2014that were less precise than NMFS  guidelines recommend. According to NMFS officials, one reason for the  lack of precision is that the agency did not have adequate funding to  conduct thorough population surveys. When conducting a marine mammal  population survey, scientists document how frequently they observe  marine mammals during a set period of time and use this information to  estimate total population size. The duration of the survey and the number  of scientists observing different areas within the stock\u2019s natural habitat  affect the extent to which the survey is thorough and the population  estimate is precise.", "Scientists could not calculate the precision of fishery-related mortality  estimates\u2014used to determine human-caused mortality estimates\u2013\u2013for  approximately 48 of the 74 stocks. In addition, the estimates for  approximately 24 of the remaining 26 stocks were less precise than NMFS  guidance recommends. Specifically, precision cannot be calculated when  the sources of mortality data are anecdotal or the fishery-related mortality  estimate is zero. For these cases, NMFS does not have a systematic way  of determining how precise the estimates are and therefore how much  certainty it should have in their accuracy. NMFS and Marine Mammal  Commission officials identified inadequate observer coverage as one of  the main reasons for imprecise mortality estimates. According to National  Observer Program officials, 52 percent of Category I or II fisheries have  observer coverage; however, only 27 percent of Category I or II fisheries  have adequate or near-adequate coverage levels. Without adequate  observer coverage in fisheries likely to cause incidental take of marine  mammals, estimates will be less precise because they will be based on  fewer data. NMFS and Marine Mammal Commission officials also stated  that current funding levels for the observer program are inadequate to  gather enough data on fishery-related mortality.", "For the stocks for which we found that NMFS could calculate the level of  precision for population size or fishery-related mortality estimates but  these estimates were less precise than NMFS\u2019s guidance recommends,  NMFS policy guidelines directed scientists to make adjustments to these  estimates that increased the likelihood that the stocks were categorized as  strategic. By doing this, the imprecision in these estimates is less likely to  lead NMFS to overlook a stock that should be covered by a take reduction  team, but NMFS officials told us that it is possible these stocks would not  be designated as strategic if more precise estimates had been available and  therefore these adjustments had not been necessary. However, in the  approximately 48 of 74 stocks where NMFS cannot calculate the precision  of a fishery-related mortality estimate\u2013\u2013even though high levels of  imprecision may exist\u2013\u2013it cannot make these adjustments and therefore  may either overlook some stocks that should be designated as strategic or  inaccurately designate others as nonstrategic.

Specifically, NMFS officials told us they did not  establish a take reduction team for one marine mammal\u2013\u2013the false killer  whale\u2013\u2013due to lack of funding. False killer whales found in the waters off  the Hawaiian Islands have met the MMPA\u2019s requirements for establishing a  team since 2004 because the stock has been strategic and interacts with a  Category I longline fishery. Furthermore, since 2004, estimates of fishery- related mortality of false killer whales are at levels greater than their  maximum removal level, according to stock assessment reports.  According to the most recently available information, the false killer whale  is the only marine mammal for which incidental take by commercial  fisheries is known to be above its maximum removal level that is not  covered by a take reduction team. Since 2003, the Pacific Scientific  Review Group has recommended that NMFS establish a team for these  whales. Although NMFS officials told us that in accordance with the  MMPA, the false killer whales are their highest priority for establishing a  team, they said the agency does not have the funds to do so. NMFS  officials told us the agency instead decided to focus what they  characterized as their very limited funding on the already established take  reduction teams. However, in the absence of a take reduction team, the  Hawaii longline fishery continues to operate without a take reduction plan  designed to reduce incidental take of false killer whales.", "Outdated or incomplete data. NMFS has not established take reduction  teams for eight marine mammals that interact with commercial fisheries in  the Gulf of Mexico and the waters off of Alaska\u2019s coast because the  information the agency has on them is too outdated or incomplete for  agency officials to determine whether these marine mammals should be  considered a high priority for establishing a take reduction team. Also,  take reduction team members need better information about mortality  before they can propose changes to fishing practices in a draft take  reduction plan. However, because take reduction teams have not been  established for these eight marine mammal stocks, fisheries continue to  operate without take reduction plans that could decrease incidental take  of these stocks.", "Specifically, NMFS has not established teams for two stocks of bottlenose  dolphins found in the Gulf of Mexico and six stocks in the waters off  Alaska\u2019s coast, including three stocks of harbor porpoises, two stocks of  Steller sea lions, and one stock of humpback whales. Two stocks of  bottlenose dolphins found in the Gulf of Mexico have met the MMPA\u2019s  requirements for establishing a team since 2005 because they have been  strategic and interact with two Category II fisheries. According to stock  assessment reports, the best scientific information available about  population size for these two stocks is 8 years old or older. According to  NMFS documents, using such outdated information increases the  possibility that significant population changes of which NMFS is unaware  could have occurred. Agency officials told us that the 2008 survey to  collect new population size estimates was canceled due to insufficient  funding. Furthermore, according to stock assessment reports, the  available mortality estimates are incomplete because they are based on  anecdotal information. Consequently, scientists can use this information  only to make a minimum estimate of the number of marine mammals  being killed or injured. Agency officials told us they would like to begin  observing the two Gulf of Mexico fisheries, but are currently unable to do  so due to funding constraints.", "Similarly, NMFS has not established take reduction teams due to outdated  information for three stocks of harbor porpoises found in the waters off  Alaska\u2019s coast that have met the MMPA\u2019s statutory requirements for  establishing a team since 2006 because they have been strategic and  interact with multiple Category II fisheries. According to stock assessment  reports, the best scientific information available about population size for  harbor porpoises is outdated because the estimates are 8 years old or  older. NMFS officials told us harbor porpoises are a major conservation  concern for the agency, but they said funding constraints have limited  their ability to collect new population size estimates for these marine  mammals.", "In addition, NMFS has not established take reduction teams due to  incomplete information for two stocks of Steller sea lions that have met  the MMPA\u2019s requirements for establishing a team since 1996 because they  have been strategic and interact with multiple Category II fisheries. NMFS  officials told us the fishery-related mortality information for these stocks  is incomplete because they are uncertain whether incidental take is  occurring in commercial fisheries not covered by observer programs.  According to these same officials, lack of funding has limited the agency  from obtaining more complete fishery-related mortality information for  Steller sea lions.", "Last, NMFS has not established a take reduction team due to outdated  information for the Western North Pacific stock of humpback whales,  which has met the MMPA\u2019s requirements for establishing a team since  2006, because it has been strategic and interacts with two Category II  fisheries.

According to our analysis, these  sperm whales meet the statutory requirements for a team because they are  listed as an endangered species under the ESA, and therefore are a  strategic stock, and they interact with a Category I fishery. However,  NMFS officials told us that the commercial fishery with which these sperm  whales interact accounts for little or no incidental take, and therefore it  would be inappropriate to establish a team for them.

NMFS officials told us it would be  inappropriate to establish take reduction teams for these marine mammal  stocks because mortality and serious injuries are not being caused by  interaction with a commercial fishery. According to NMFS officials, they  proposed amending the MMPA in 2005 to require that take reduction  teams be established only for strategic stocks that interact with Category I  or II fisheries and that have some level of fishery-related incidental take of  those stocks, but Congress took no action on the proposal at that time.", "Population size is increasing.

The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  provides a foundation for examining agency performance goals and  results. Our work related to the act and the experience of leading  organizations have shown the importance of developing a comprehensive  strategy for assessing program effectiveness that includes, among other  things, program performance goals that identify the desired results of  program activities and reliable information that can be used to assess  results. In the context of NMFS\u2019s efforts to measure the success of take  reduction plans and implementing regulations, such a strategy would  include, at a minimum, (1) performance goals that identify the desired  outcomes of the take reduction regulations; (2) steps for assessing the  effectiveness of potential take reduction regulations, such as fishing gear  modifications, in achieving the goals; (3) a process for monitoring the  fishing industry\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the take reduction  regulations; and (4) reliable data assessing the regulation\u2019s effect on  achieving the goals. Instead of such a comprehensive strategy, we found  that although NMFS uses short- and long-term goals established by the  MMPA to evaluate the success of take reduction regulations, these goals  and the data that NMFS uses to measure the impact of the take reduction  regulations have a number of limitations. In addition, while NMFS has  taken steps to identify the impact of proposed take reduction regulations  prior to their implementation, the agency has limited information about  the fishing industry\u2019s compliance with the regulations once they have been  implemented.

NMFS  officials told us that NMFS staff and take reduction team members review  whether or not the goals have been met for the stocks covered by their  teams.", "However, NMFS officials, Marine Mammal Commission officials, and a  Scientific Review Group chair all considered the 6-month time frame for  meeting the short-term goal to be unrealistic. Specifically, some noted that  due to the extensive time needed to gather and publish data on the  maximum removal level and fishery-related mortality estimates, NMFS  does not have the necessary information to assess the goal within the 6- month time frame. A NMFS official also noted that fishing changes over  the year; therefore, assessing whether fishery-related morality is below the  maximum removal level during a 6-month time frame may not consider  mortality that may occur during both the busiest and the slowest fishing  seasons. While the MMPA sets this 6-month goal, it does not impose  consequences on NMFS or the regulated fisheries if the goal is not met.", "Furthermore, these goals may not help NMFS assess the success of the  regulations because we found that there was not always greater success in  meeting the goals after take reduction regulations were implemented than  before they were implemented. Also, if the goals had been met for a stock  in a given year, in some cases the goals did not continue to be met in the  following years. Specifically, we found that for two stocks, the short-term  goal had been met prior to the regulations being implemented but was no  longer being met in 2007. In addition, for two other stocks, the long-term  goal had been met prior to implementation of the regulations, but was no  longer being met in 2007. Furthermore, for two stocks, the short-term  goal had been met and for two stocks, the long-term goal had been met in  2007, but these goals had already been met prior to implementation of the  take reduction regulations. In cases where the goals were met prior to the  implementation of take reduction regulations, the goals cannot be used to  determine the regulations\u2019 impact on reducing take.", "In addition, according to NMFS officials, changes to the marine  environment that happen during the same time period as the  implementation of take reduction regulations make it difficult to assess  whether the regulations are the reason that the short- and long-term goals  for a stock have been achieved or whether it was other changes.  Specifically, state or federal fishing regulations unrelated to the take  reduction team process may result in less fishing in the fisheries covered  by the take reduction team. In such a scenario, fishery-related mortality  may decrease because there are fewer opportunities for fishing vessels to  interact with marine mammals. Therefore, a lower level of fishery-related  mortality may lead to achievement of the MMPA\u2019s goals for a stock even if  the take reduction regulations themselves were not the primary reason for  the lower level of incidental take.", "Moreover, limitations in some of the data used to determine whether the  MMPA\u2019s short- and long-term goals for reducing incidental take by  commercial fisheries have been met may lead to inaccurate conclusions  about the effectiveness of the take reduction regulations. We reviewed  the stock assessment reports for 9 of the 10 strategic stocks and all 3 of  the nonstrategic stocks covered by take reduction regulations and found  that for 2007, the short-term goal for 4 of the 9 strategic stocks had been  achieved and the long-term goal had been achieved for 3 of the 12 strategic  and nonstrategic stocks. However, we also found that the information  used to determine the maximum removal level or the fishery-related  mortality estimate for 6 of the 9 strategic stocks covered by these  regulations was less precise than NMFS guidelines recommend. Because  these are the two key sources of information for determining whether the  MMPA\u2019s short- and long-term goals have been met, this imprecision may  cause NMFS to incorrectly assess whether the take reduction regulations  have been successful.", "NMFS officials stated that limitations in the data make it difficult to know  the reason for changes in meeting the goals from one year to another. For  example, we found that the short-term goal for the Gulf of Maine stock of  humpback whales covered by the Atlantic Large Whale take reduction  team had been met prior to implementation of the take reduction  regulations; however, according to the stock assessment report, it did not  meet the goal in 2007. Meanwhile, between the year prior to when the  regulations were implemented and 2007, NMFS altered its stock definition  for these marine mammals in a way that decreased the number of animals  included in the population size estimate\u2014a key aspect of determining the  maximum removal level. This change made the maximum removal level  much lower than it had been before the regulations were implemented,  making it more difficult to achieve the goals. Because of this change in  NMFS\u2019s approach to calculating the maximum removal level, it is difficult  to determine whether ineffectiveness of the take reduction regulations or  the change in the maximum removal level led to the short-term goal no  longer being met for this stock."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NMFS Studies the Impact of Proposed Take Reduction Regulations prior to Their Implementation, but Has Limited Information about Industry Compliance", "paragraphs": ["NMFS has assessed the likelihood that proposed take reduction  regulations would achieve the short- and long-term goals of reducing  incidental take for all four teams with final take reduction plans and  regulations. Specifically, for all four plans, scientists evaluated whether  key proposed measures for modifying fishing gear or changing the times or  areas where fishing could occur were likely to decrease incidental take.  For example, NMFS scientists analyzed data from previous incidental take  in the gillnet fisheries of concern for bottlenose dolphins and found that  incidental take had occurred at a higher rate on the vessels that used nets  with larger mesh openings. Because this type of gear would be restricted  under the proposed regulations, NMFS had reason to believe that these  gear restrictions would result in reduced incidental take of bottlenose  dolphins. Similarly, according to the environmental assessment report for  the Harbor Porpoise take reduction team, a controlled experiment tested  the effectiveness of acoustic devices\u2014often called pingers\u2014attached to  fishing nets. Pingers emit a high-pitched sound that harbor porpoises can  hear, which results in them avoiding fishing nets. This experiment allowed  NMFS scientists to predict that proposed regulations to implement pingers  would likely result in a decline of incidental take.", "Although NMFS has conducted some assessments of the likelihood that  proposed take reduction regulations will achieve the goals of reducing  incidental take, they have limited information about the extent to which  fisheries comply with take reduction regulations once they have been  implemented. As a result, when incidental takes occur in fisheries covered  by take reduction regulations, it is difficult for NMFS to determine  whether the regulations were not effective in meeting the MMPA\u2019s goals or  whether the fisheries were not complying with the regulations.  Specifically, we determined that NMFS does not have comprehensive  approaches to measure the extent to which fisheries comply with the  regulations for the four take reduction plans that it has implemented.  However, for all of these implemented regulations, NMFS has some\u2014 albeit limited\u2014information from fisheries observer or enforcement  programs that provide an indication of whether fisheries are complying  with the regulations. For example, when incidental take of harbor  porpoises in the fisheries covered by the Harbor Porpoise take reduction  team recently increased, NMFS scientists used observer information about  incidental take to determine whether or not these takes occurred when  vessels were complying with the requirement to use pingers on their nets.  However, according to the scientists, the usefulness of this information in  determining actual compliance was limited because observers could only  identify whether the pingers were attached to the net, not whether these  pingers functioned properly. On the Pacific Offshore Cetacean team, the  team coordinator stated that in the past, NMFS has received information  from the observer program about fishing vessels monitored by observers  that were not in compliance with the take reduction regulations. However,  she stated that NMFS does not routinely review the observer information  to identify or document the extent of these instances or estimate the  extent of overall compliance with the take reduction regulations.", "In addition to the information that it receives from the observer programs,  NMFS receives some information about compliance from NOAA\u2019s Office  of Law Enforcement, the U.S. Coast Guard, or state enforcement agencies.  Specifically, team coordinators told us that officials from the U.S. Coast  Guard attend take reduction team meetings to discuss instances where the  agencies found vessels out of compliance with take reduction regulations  during the course of their enforcement work. However this information is  not generally extensive enough to provide overall assessments of the  extent to which fisheries are complying with the regulations.", "In 2007, we reported that NMFS lacked a strategy for assessing industry  compliance with the Atlantic Large Whale team\u2019s take reduction plan, and  we recommended that it develop one. In response to our report, the team  is beginning to develop a comprehensive approach to monitoring  compliance. NMFS staff members are currently developing a plan for take  reduction team members to review during their next meeting, which is  planned for early 2009. No other take reduction teams are developing  comprehensive approaches for monitoring compliance at this time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NMFS faces a very large, complex, and difficult task in trying to protect  marine mammals from incidental mortality and serious injury during the  course of commercial fishing operations, as the MMPA requires. Without  comprehensive, timely, and accurate population and mortality data for the  156 marine mammal stocks that NMFS is charged with protecting, NMFS  may be unable to accurately identify stocks that meet the legal  requirements for establishing take reduction teams, thereby depriving  them of the protection they need to help recover or maintain healthy  populations. Conversely, unreliable data may lead NMFS to erroneously  establish teams for stocks that do not need them, wasting NMFS\u2019s limited  resources.", "For those stocks that meet the requirements for establishing take  reduction teams, it is important that NMFS adhere to the deadlines in the  MMPA, as delays in establishing teams and developing and finalizing take  reduction plans could result in continued harm to already dwindling  marine mammal populations. However, we recognize that it may not be  useful to establish take reduction teams for those stocks that meet the  MMPA requirements but whose population declines are not being caused  by commercial fisheries. We also acknowledge it may not be possible for  NMFS to meet some of the MMPA\u2019s deadlines given the requirements of  other laws that NMFS must comply with in developing take reduction  plans and the need for various levels of review and approval. Nonetheless,  the MMPA\u2019s deadlines are clear, and unless the law is amended to address  these situations, NMFS has a legal obligation to comply with them.", "Finally, for stocks for which NMFS has developed take reduction  regulations, it is important for NMFS to assess their effectiveness in  reducing serious injury and mortality to acceptable levels. Doing so will  require more comprehensive information about the fishing industry\u2019s  compliance with take reduction regulations so that if the short- and long- term goals are not met, NMFS knows whether to attribute the failure to a  flaw in the regulations or to noncompliance with them. Without a  comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of its take  reduction plans and implementing regulations and industry\u2019s compliance  with them, NMFS may be missing opportunities to better protect marine  mammals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate the oversight of NMFS\u2019s progress and capacity to meet the  statutory requirements for take reduction teams, Congress may wish to  consider taking the following three actions:    direct the Assistant Administrator of NMFS to report on major data,  resource, or other limitations that make it difficult for NMFS to accurately  determine which marine mammals meet the statutory requirements for  establishing take reduction teams; establish teams for stocks that meet  these requirements; and meet the statutory deadlines for take reduction  teams;    amend the statutory requirements for establishing a take reduction team to  stipulate that not only must a marine mammal stock be strategic and  interacting with a Category I or II fishery, but that the fishery with which  the marine mammal stock interacts causes at least occasional incidental  mortality or serious injury of that particular marine mammal stock; and    amend the MMPA to ensure that its deadlines give NMFS adequate time to  publish proposed and final take reduction plans and implementing  regulations while meeting all the requirements of the federal rulemaking  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Assistant Administrator of NMFS develop a  comprehensive strategy for assessing the effectiveness of each take  reduction plan and implementing regulations, including, among other  things, establishing appropriate goals and steps for comprehensively  monitoring and analyzing rates of compliance with take reduction  measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to the Secretary of Commerce for  review and comment.

To do this, we first reviewed all 156 stocks  identified in NMFS\u2019s 2007 stock assessment reports and removed 19 stocks  currently covered by take reduction teams. Then we removed 24 stocks  that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species  Act (ESA) or designated as depleted under the MMPA because NMFS does  not use information about human-caused mortality and the maximum  removal level to make strategic status decisions for these stocks. We then  reviewed the remaining 113 stocks to identify those that lacked either a  human-caused mortality estimate or a maximum removal level. After  identifying those that lacked human-caused mortality or maximum  removal levels, we reviewed a sample of the remaining 74 stocks that did  have these determinations to assess the reliability of the information used  to determine human-caused mortality estimates and maximum removal  levels.", "We identified several key data elements in NMFS\u2019s stock assessment  reports that the agency uses to determine human-caused mortality  estimates and maximum removal levels:    abundance estimates (population size estimates) and NMFS calculation of  the estimates\u2019 precision,  the age of data used to calculate population size estimates, fishery-related mortality and serious injury estimates (hereafter known as  fishery-related mortality estimates) and NMFS calculation of the estimates\u2019  precision,   adjustments made to the maximum removal level in order to account for  fishery-related mortality estimate imprecision, information sources such as observer data used to calculate fishery- related mortality estimates, and   qualitative information identified in the stock assessment reports about  scientists\u2019 concerns regarding data strengths or limitations.", "We also identified criteria for assessing the quality of these data elements  using information from the MMPA and publications such as NMFS\u2019s  guidelines for preparing stock assessment reports and stock assessment  improvement plan and confirmed the criteria with NMFS officials. While  scientists and publications also identified bias in population size and  mortality estimates as a potential data reliability problem, we did not  assess the extent to which existing data sources included bias because  data and accompanying criteria to make such an assessment were not  available.", "We then analyzed the key data elements for a sample of stocks to  determine the extent to which the data met the criteria we identified. We  chose our sample of stocks to review by conducting a stratified random  sample of the 74 stocks that were not currently covered by take reduction  teams, did not receive strategic status due to MMPA designations or  listings under the ESA, and had both human-caused mortality and serious  injury estimates and maximum removal levels. The sample of 28 stocks  included all strategic stocks that met these criteria as well as a  representative sample of stocks from each of the three NMFS Fishery  Science Centers responsible for publishing the stock assessment reports.  We then extrapolated the results of our review for this sample to all 74  stocks that met the criteria listed above. We calculated 95 percent  confidence intervals for each of the estimates made from this sample. The  confidence intervals for these estimates are presented in table 8.", "We also spoke with NMFS and Marine Mammal Commission officials to  identify the potential impacts of using unreliable information to determine  human-caused mortality or maximum removal levels.", "In some cases, we found potentially conflicting information within  individual stock assessment reports about whether fishery-related  mortality was unknown or estimated as zero. In these cases, we used the  information that NMFS provided in stock assessment report summary  tables to resolve the inconsistencies within the individual stock  assessment reports because we considered these estimates to be the  agency\u2019s final decision. In all cases, these summary tables identified the  fishery-related mortality estimates for these stocks as zero rather than  unknown.", "To determine the extent to which NMFS has established take reduction  teams for those marine mammal stocks that meet the statutory  requirements, we analyzed stock assessment reports for 1995 through 2007  and lists of fisheries for 1996 through 2008 and identified marine mammal  stocks that met the statutory requirements for establishing take reduction  teams. To do this, we reviewed the MMPA and identified the statutory  requirements for establishing take reduction teams, then interviewed  officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s  (NOAA) Office of General Counsel to verify that we had identified the  correct requirements. We also analyzed the stock assessment reports and  list of fisheries and identified all of the stocks that have met the statutory  requirements, which include marine mammal stocks that (1) were listed as  strategic according to a final stock assessment report and (2) interacted  with a Category I or II fishery according to a current list of fisheries. We  developed a database and used it to analyze this information. Once we  identified the marine mammal stocks that met the statutory requirements,  we verified with NMFS officials the stocks for which the agency has  already established take reduction teams. On the basis of this information,  we determined which stocks met the statutory requirements but are not  covered by a team. We met with NMFS officials to review and verify our  findings, and interviewed NMFS officials to obtain reasons why the agency  has not established take reduction teams for these stocks. We also met  with representatives of the Marine Mammal Commission to review our  findings.", "To determine the extent to which NMFS has met the MMPA\u2019s deadlines for  the five take reduction teams subject to the deadlines and the reasons for  any delays, we  identified five key deadlines listed in the MMPA for NMFS and take  reduction teams and interviewed officials from NOAA\u2019s Office of General  Counsel to confirm the deadlines;   obtained and reviewed documentation, such as take reduction plans,  Federal Register notices announcing the establishment of teams, and  NMFS\u2019s proposed and final take reduction plans and implementing  regulations published in the Federal Register;    analyzed the dates published in the Federal Register documents to  determine whether each of the five take reduction teams had met their  statutory deadlines; and,    met with NMFS officials to confirm the accuracy of our analysis of  information published in Federal Register notices.", "To determine the reasons for any delays in meeting the statutory  deadlines, we interviewed take reduction team coordinators from NMFS\u2019s  Office of Protected Resources, officials from NOAA\u2019s Office of General  Counsel, marine biologists in NMFS\u2019s Fishery Science Centers, and  members of each of the five teams subject to the deadlines. We also  obtained and reviewed NMFS documentation about various laws and  executive orders that the agency must comply with when publishing  proposed and final take reduction plans in the Federal Register.", "To determine the extent to which NMFS has developed a comprehensive  strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the take reduction plans that  have been implemented, we reviewed the MMPA and relevant NMFS  documentation and spoke with NMFS officials and Scientific Review  Group chairs regarding the (1) performance goals used by NMFS to assess  the success of take reduction regulations, (2) actions taken prior to  implementing proposed regulations to increase the likelihood that the  regulations will achieve these performance goals, and (3) extent to which  NMFS has information about fisheries\u2019 compliance with implemented take  reduction regulations. We also reviewed stock assessment reports from  1995 through 2007 for stocks covered by three of the four take reduction  teams with final regulations in place to determine whether the stocks met  the short- and long-term goals in each of those years. To calculate  whether the goals were met prior to implementation of the take reduction  regulations, we used the last year for which the fishery-related mortality  estimates in the stock assessment reports did not include any information  about incidental take that was collected after the regulations were  implemented. We excluded the strategic bottlenose dolphins from our  review due to methodological differences between the way NMFS reports  on fishery-related mortality and maximum removal levels for them versus  for the other stocks. Specifically, due to concerns about the stock  definition for the Western North Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins  covered by the Bottlenose Dolphin take reduction team, NMFS further  divides this population into management units. NMFS identifies different  fishery-related mortality estimates for each of these management units,  but not for the Western North Atlantic coastal bottlenose dolphins as a  whole, making it difficult to determine whether the total population met  the short- and long-term goals. In addition, we assessed the reliability of  the data used to determine whether NMFS has met the goals for the  strategic stocks covered by three of the four take reduction teams with  final regulations. To do this, we analyzed the extent to which key data  elements met data quality criteria identified by the MMPA and NMFS. We  reviewed strategic stocks because they are most likely to be at continued  risk of fishery-related take leading to unsustainable population declines.  We also compared the data for the year prior to when the regulations were  first implemented with the data from 2007 to identify any changes that  occurred in meeting the goals before and after the take reduction  regulations went into effect.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to December  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
