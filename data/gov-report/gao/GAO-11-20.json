Although it has developed a policy for granting or denying access rights to its resources, employed mechanisms to prevent and respond to security breaches, and made use of encryption technologies to protect sensitive data, significant weaknesses pervade its systems. NARA did not fully implement access controls, which are designed to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. Specifically, the agency did not always (1) protect the boundaries of its networks by, for example, ensuring that all incoming traffic was inspected by a firewall; (2) enforce strong policies for identifying and authenticating users by, for example, requiring the use of complex (i.e., not easily guessed) passwords; (3) limit users' access to systems to what was required for them to perform their official duties; (4) ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords for system administration, was encrypted so as not to be easily readable by potentially malicious individuals; (5) keep logs of network activity or monitor all parts of its networks for possible security incidents; and (6) implement physical controls on access to its systems and information, such as securing perimeter and exterior doors and controlling visitor access to computing facilities. In addition to weaknesses in access controls, NARA had mixed results in implementing other security controls. For example: (1) NARA did not always ensure equipment used for sanitization (i.e., wiping clean of data) and disposal of media (e.g., hard drives) was tested to verify correct performance. (2) NARA conducted appropriate background investigations for employees and contractors to ensure sufficient clearance requirements have been met before permitting access to information and information systems. (3) NARA did not consistently segregate duties among various personnel to ensure that no one person or group can independently control all key aspects of a process or operation. The identified weaknesses can be attributed to NARA not fully implementing key elements of its information security program. Specifically, the agency did not adequately assess risks facing its systems, consistently prepare and document security plans for its information systems, effectively ensure that all personnel were given relevant security training, effectively test systems' security controls, consistently track security incidents, and develop contingency plans for all its systems. Collectively, these weaknesses could place sensitive information, such as records containing personally identifiable information, at increased and unnecessary risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or loss."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 11 recommendations to the Archivist of the United States to implement elements of NARA's information security program.

Accounting for and analyzing security problems and incidents are also  effective ways for an agency to improve its understanding of threats and  the potential costs of security incidents, and doing so can pinpoint  vulnerabilities that need to be addressed so that they are not exploited  again. FISMA requires that each federal agency implement an information  security program that includes procedures for detecting, reporting, and  responding to security incidents.

However, NARA was not able to locate all of its weekly reports  for incidents and did not consistently apply its criteria for incident  categorization. According to the NARA incident response methodology,  incidents involving the disclosures of personally identifiable information,  even if the disclosure did not involve an IT system, should be categorized  under \u201cInvestigation\u201d (Category 6).

Effective  implementation of such a program includes establishing appropriate  policies and procedures, providing security awareness training,  responding to incidents, and ensuring continuity of operations. Ensuring  that NARA implements key information security practices and controls  also requires effective management oversight and monitoring.

First, he disagreed that NARA\u2019s risk assessments in its  systems inventory were incorrectly applied. However, our finding does not  state that the risk assessments were incorrectly applied. Rather, as we  discuss in the report, NARA system documentation and system inventories  do not consistently reflect the FIPS 199 impact levels of its systems. These  inconsistencies may reduce NARA\u2019s assurance that adequate controls are  in place to protect its information and information systems. Thus, we  continue to believe our finding is appropriate.", "Secondly, the Archivist disagreed that NARA policies and procedures were  not always consistent with NIST guidance. As we discuss in our report,  NIST states that an agency must first determine the security category of its  information systems and then apply the appropriately tailored set of  baseline security controls. However, NARA\u2019s policy prescribed controls  based on the individual security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and  availability instead of applying controls based on a prior determination of  the system\u2019s impact.

Thus, we continue to believe our finding is valid.", "Lastly, the Archivist disagreed that the information owner role must be  identified in each system security plan. However, NARA\u2019s policy as  discussed in the report outlines key individual roles and responsibilities,  including the information owner, which should be assigned for each  system.
