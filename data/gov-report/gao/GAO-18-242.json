From fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DSCA reviewed 813 waivers and denied 3, resulting in an approval rate of 99 percent.

Agency officials stated that approving waivers helps ensure sales go through and such broader benefits are realized. DSCA's practice to approve waivers is consistent with the authority it has been delegated under the Arms Export Control Act and is influenced by these benefits.", "The process DOD has established to consider waivers is, at times, inefficient and repetitive. DSCA has final approval authority; however, multiple DOD offices must review and provide input on each waiver, with some offices reviewing waivers for the same purpose. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to allocate resources and assign responsibilities to achieve efficiency and effectiveness. DOD has already taken steps to improve the efficiency of the waiver review process; for example, by reducing the time a few offices take to review the waivers.

In cases where major defense equipment, which has  nonrecurring research and development costs greater than $50 million or  total production costs greater than $200 million, is sold to foreign  governments and international organizations through the Foreign Military  Sales (FMS) program, DOD is required under the Arms Export Control  Act and its implementing regulations to recover nonrecurring costs. For  fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD reported sales under the FMS  program totaling over $250 billion. These sales, which include major  defense equipment, create the potential for DOD to charge and recover  billions of dollars of nonrecurring costs from foreign governments. The  Arms Export Control Act, as delegated, also authorizes DOD to waive  collection of nonrecurring costs based on one of three primary  justifications: (1) to standardize U.S. military equipment with the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and select U.S. allies, (2) to achieve  cost savings for the U.S. government, or (3) to avoid a loss of sale.", "Within DOD, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) is  principally responsible for overseeing and administering the FMS  program.

Under the FMS program, foreign  governments pay the U.S. government to administer the acquisition of  defense articles and services on their behalf. Typically, defense  equipment made available for transfer or sale to foreign governments falls  under an acquisition program managed by one or more of the U.S.  military departments. Generally, this equipment has gone through  operational testing and has entered or is entering full-rate production.", "Multiple federal entities have a role in the FMS program, including DOD  and the Department of State (State). Within DOD, DSCA and the military  departments play an extensive role in administering the program and  managing FMS acquisitions, respectively. DSCA carries out key  administrative functions, such as coordinating the development and  execution of sales through the FMS program and conducting negotiations  with foreign governments. The military departments are involved early in  the development of the potential sale when the foreign government  identifies the defense equipment it needs to buy to achieve a desired  capability. Congressional oversight of the FMS program has resulted in  amendments to the Arms Export Control Act and other relevant legislation  to improve the FMS program.", "The first phase of the FMS process generally involves a foreign  government submitting a request, usually to State or DOD, to express  interest in purchasing defense articles or services. Depending on the size  and complexity of the items being purchased and the foreign  government\u2019s available budget, the process to finalize the terms of a sale  can take from a few days to years. In response to concerns that the FMS  process is slow and burdensome, Congress has increased oversight of  the program and recently passed legislation intended to improve the  timeliness of the FMS process. For example, in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, Congress required DOD to revise  its acquisition regulations to place new requirements on FMS contracting  and to establish a pilot program to seek ways to accelerate contracting  and pricing processes for FMS.", "According to DSCA officials, foreign governments interested in having  nonrecurring costs waived must request a waiver before DOD develops  and sends the sales agreement to the foreign government for acceptance  and signature. The sales agreement\u2014formally referred to as a letter of  offer and acceptance\u2014details the specific items, quantities, and total  estimated costs, among other things. The sales agreement, once signed,  is commonly referred to as a FMS case.

A foreign government generally initiates the  process by submitting a written request to waive the nonrecurring costs  for the major defense equipment it plans to purchase.

Once the  letter of offer and acceptance has been signed by the foreign  government, any increase in the quantity of items requires that the foreign  government submit a request to waive nonrecurring costs for the  additional equipment. If equipment quantities are reduced after the waiver  is approved, the total amount of nonrecurring costs waived will be less  than the value at the time the waiver was approved. For example, in  2013, DSCA approved a waiver for up to $799 million in nonrecurring  costs for 768 Patriot missiles. However, the foreign government reduced  its planned procurement to 248 missiles.

The  same process is applied despite the amount of nonrecurring costs  requested to be waived, complexity of the case, or ease (or difficulty) in  assessing the validity of the justification cited in the waiver request. DOD  has taken steps to reduce the time for a few offices to review waivers, but  we found there are opportunities for additional efficiencies to be realized.", "For 23 of the 24 waiver requests we reviewed, on average, the military  departments determined whether to endorse requested waivers around  270 days after they were submitted by the foreign government.

There is no policy regarding the time  frame for military departments to review a waiver request, as military  officials stated the review time can vary depending on whether additional  information must be obtained from the foreign government. However,  recognizing an opportunity to streamline the review process, DSCA has  worked with the Air Force to identify one office that did not add value,  reducing the Air Force review process from three offices to two. Officials  stated this action decreased the amount of time required for review.  DSCA officials also stated that they have improved their review times by  using digital signatures when concurring on waiver decisions.

These benefits are already assessed for certain FMS cases by an  in-country team that is comprised of officials from State and the relevant  DOD combatant command that manages military operations in  designated areas of responsibility. Once the waiver is requested by the  foreign government, DSCA and OUSD (AT&L) officials review the waiver  request to assess these benefits, even though military officials stated an  assessment has already been conducted to determine how the proposed  sale will advance U.S. national security objectives within the region. In  addition, DSCA officials stated that since foreign governments are  procuring equipment also used by the U.S. military, by default, purchasing  the equipment would result in standardization. After a potential sale has  received a favorable country team assessment, the only additional  requirement is to determine whether the customer is NATO or among the  34 countries eligible for the standardization waiver. Yet while this  requirement is easily confirmed, the waiver request may still be reviewed  by as many as 11 offices within the military department and DSCA, as  well as at the OUSD level.", "However, we found, for example, DSCA did not adjust its review process  based on the value of the nonrecurring costs to be waived.

DSCA then took  47 days to coordinate input from various OUSD offices to reach a final  decision on the requested waiver. Similarly, in another instance where the  value of the requested loss of sale waiver was substantially higher\u2014$337  million\u2014it took the Army 160 days to coordinate its review before passing  it on to DSCA, which took 29 days to finalize its decision. Other than  OUSD Policy\u2019s review of the loss of sale waiver, both of these waiver  requests required the same review process despite the substantial  difference in costs.", "For waiver requests that cite the loss of sale justification, DSCA and  military department officials told us that it is difficult to prove or disprove a  foreign government\u2019s claim that not waiving nonrecurring costs will likely  lead to a loss of sale. DOD guidance states these waiver requests should  include information on competing items and their cost, if available;  however, the guidance does not specify the type of information or level of  detail that should be provided. DSCA officials stated that they interpret  this guidance to mean this information is optional and therefore not  required. According to DOD officials, a foreign government\u2019s budget  constraints could limit its ability to pay nonrecurring costs. Of the 18 loss  of sale waiver requests that we reviewed, none included any additional  information on competing offers or spending limits, beyond the basic loss  of sale statement. Even if DOD received this type of information from the  foreign government, DSCA officials told us that corroborating this  information would be difficult. Therefore, DOD officials stated that they do  not assess the likelihood of loss of sale beyond the minimum criteria.  Although this assessment requires no additional analysis, loss of sale  waiver requests are subject to the same review process, but with OUSD  Policy as another required layer of review, bringing the possible total up  to 12 offices. DSCA and OUSD Policy officials were unsure of the origin  of the requirement for OUSD Policy to weigh in on waiver requests that  cite loss of sale. Further, OUSD Policy officials stated that they review  waiver requests for similar elements as other DOD entities, such as  whether the sale will support security objectives in the region.", "DSCA officials have acknowledged that identifying further opportunities to  streamline waiver reviews through a risk-based approach could enhance  efficiencies in the FMS program. Federal standards for internal controls  state that agencies should assign and delegate responsibilities in a  manner that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness. In light of the  significant growth in the FMS program in recent years, as well as the  resulting workload for DSCA and other cognizant DOD components,  continuing to streamline the waiver review process would better position  DSCA and the military departments in maximizing efficiencies in the FMS  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FMS program is a central component of U.S. foreign policy. Our work  has shown it enhances the capabilities of our allies, fosters  interoperability with foreign militaries, helps sustain our defense industrial  base, and serves our national security interests. In 1976, Congress  codified the requirement for DOD to recoup nonrecurring costs on sales  of major defense equipment to help ensure that FMS customers pay their  share of the full cost of this equipment. At the same time, Congress  provided for waiving nonrecurring costs for specified reasons. Over the  past 6 years, DOD has prioritized the benefits of the FMS program and  has typically waived rather than collected nonrecurring costs under these  specified reasons.", "Within DOD, there are opportunities to consider streamlining the waiver  review process to eliminate efforts that are potentially repetitive or  inefficient. The review process for waiver requests requires that multiple  offices review all waiver requests, regardless of the amount of  nonrecurring costs to be waived or the complexity of the specific  circumstances. The FMS program has been criticized for being slow and  burdensome. To create efficiencies in the overall FMS program, DOD  could take additional steps to streamline the FMS waivers review  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following recommendation to DSCA:  The DSCA Director should continue to identify opportunities to streamline  the review process for nonrecurring cost waiver requests.

We reviewed data for  fiscal years 2012 through 2017, as these years provided the most  complete data available to facilitate our analysis and gain insights about  the waivers requested based on the three allowable justifications within  the scope of our review\u2014equipment standardization, loss of sale  avoidance, and cost savings to the U.S. government. DSCA uses the  Defense Security Assistance Management System (DSAMS) to maintain  records on FMS case data from the time the case is initiated; however,  the system does not track nonrecurring cost data, such as data on  waivers requested or costs waived, for each individual FMS case.  Instead, DSCA provided a dataset on waivers requested that is  maintained in a spreadsheet. To assess the reliability of DSCA\u2019s data, we  tested for missing data, inconsistent coding, and compared data on  selected waiver requests to waiver documentation we obtained from  DSCA. In reviewing the documentation relative to the dataset we  obtained, we found a small amount of data that were incorrectly coded,  but these miscodings had minimal potential to affect our analysis. DSCA  corrected these miscodings when we brought the errors to their attention.  Overall, we found that the documentation for the selected waiver requests  generally matched the data DSCA provided. We interviewed DSCA  officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in place to  ensure the data are accurate and reliable. Based on these steps, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable to identify the extent to  which DOD approved nonrecurring cost waivers and to select a sample of  waiver requests to review.", "To identify the extent to which DOD approved nonrecurring cost waivers  for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, we analyzed data on nonrecurring  cost waiver requests, which included: the country requesting the waiver,  the justification under which the waiver was requested, the requested  amount of the waiver, whether or not the waiver was approved, the  approved value of the waiver, and the military department responsible for  managing the procurement of the major defense equipment associated  with the requested waiver. We analyzed the data to determine the  number and dollar value of waivers requested for each waiver justification  in total and by fiscal year. We also analyzed the data to determine the  value of nonrecurring cost waivers approved by geographic region.", "DSCA has various information management systems and methods to  track data related to FMS cases. However, these systems are not  integrated and data limitations precluded certain analysis:", "A DSCA official stated that DSCA does not track which FMS cases  include major defense equipment, which impeded our ability to  conclusively report on the total universe of all eligible FMS cases  during fiscal years 2012 through 2017 for which a nonrecurring cost  waiver could have been requested, and the percentage of cases  represented by the 813 requested waivers. DSCA processes  thousands of FMS cases each year; however, not all FMS cases meet  the threshold for collecting or waiving nonrecurring costs as this  requirement only applies to FMS cases where major defense  equipment is being purchased. We interviewed DSCA officials to  obtain information on how major defense equipment is recorded in  DSAMS and the process they use to determine whether a FMS case  includes major defense equipment. To identify the universe of eligible  FMS cases would have required a manual review of thousands of  cases to match the nonrecurring cost waiver data that DSCA  maintains in a separate spreadsheet with the case data captured in  DSAMS that itemizes the equipment purchased for each individual  FMS case. Because a FMS case can have multiple waivers, there is  an added challenge to accurately match the waiver with the  corresponding case.", "While DSCA maintains internal records that track the extent to which  waivers are used to their fullest value, we were unable to fully validate  certain data elements on equipment quantities. This precluded our  ability to report on the amount of total costs waived relative to the  value of the approved waiver. DSCA officials stated that when DSCA  grants a waiver there is a ceiling on the value of the waiver, which  functions similar to a coupon in that it cannot be used to waive  nonrecurring costs that exceed the value of the approved waiver.  DSCA maintains information on the equipment quantities for each  FMS case in DSAMS. However, in order to estimate the costs waived,  DSCA officials stated that they manually review each FMS case  associated with a waiver to identify the quantities purchased, which  may change through amendments to the FMS case. DSCA provided a  dataset that compares approved waivers to costs waived; however,  we could not verify equipment quantities from DSAMS. We also  interviewed DSCA officials to gain insight about their quality control  process to ensure the data are reliable. Our ability to verify equipment  quantities made it difficult to report on actual costs waived.", "To determine the factors DOD considers when reviewing waiver requests,  we selected a non-generalizable sample of 24 waiver requests and the  related documentation and files to identify the information the foreign  government submitted as part of the request, including any information on  competing items, and how these waivers are considered as part of the  overall FMS program. We selected the sample from the dataset provided  by DSCA on the total waiver requests from fiscal years 2012 through April  2017. The sample included waiver requests citing each of the three  justifications and represented different geographical regions. To enhance  our understanding of how anomaly waivers are processed, we selected 5  waiver requests to include in our sample because of their unique  characteristics:", "The only 2 waiver requests that cited cost savings to the U.S.", "The only 2 loss of sale waiver requests that were denied.", "One waiver request from a foreign government that would have been  eligible to use the equipment standardization justification but cited the  loss of sale justification in its waiver request.", "To select the remaining 19 waivers, we set a threshold for waivers  approved where the value of the nonrecurring cost was over $20 million  to capture high-value waivers, as these waivers represented 80 percent  of the total value of approved waivers within our time frame for our  sample selection. Next, we selected at least 2 waiver requests from each  fiscal year for the 6-year period included in our review and ensured a mix  of waivers requested by various foreign governments, including those that  had the highest value of waivers approved. We also ensured that the  waivers reflected a mix of FMS cases to be managed by the Air Force,  Army, and Navy, which also review and provide input to DSCA on the  waiver requests. Our sample includes a higher number of loss of sale  justifications to provide greater insight about how DOD considers these  requests given the minimal requirements and that these requests  represent the majority of costs requested to be waived. While our findings  are based on a non-generalizable sample and cannot be used to make  inferences about all FMS nonrecurring cost waivers requested, the  sample provides insight on the specific circumstances of waiver requests  and DSCA\u2019s decision in these cases.", "We recorded the information obtained from our review of the waiver  request files in a data collection instrument. One analyst entered  information in the data collection instrument and another analyst  independently reviewed the information to ensure accuracy. After  reviewing the waiver requests, we interviewed officials from military  departments associated with the waiver request files that we reviewed to  obtain clarifying information about specific waiver requests.", "To determine the efficiency of the waiver review process, we reviewed  documentation for the 24 selected waiver requests to identify the offices  involved in the review process, and the length of time taken to review and  decide on the waiver request from the time of submission. We used the  same data collection instrument to record this information as part of the  two analysts\u2019 reviews. We compared these offices\u2019 practices to review the  waivers with the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which calls for agencies to assign and delegate  responsibilities in a manner that maximizes efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition, we reviewed relevant DOD policy and interviewed officials  from the military departments, DSCA, the Office of the Undersecretary of  Defense (OUSD) Comptroller, OUSD for Policy, and OUSD for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) to discuss their roles in  reviewing nonrecurring cost waiver requests and the steps they take  during their review.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 to January 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
