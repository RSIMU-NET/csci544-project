DOD's Military Health System has long been engaged in efforts to acquire and deploy an electronic health record system. The latest version of this initiative--the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)--was expected to give health care providers real-time access to individual and military population health information and facilitate clinical support. However, the system's early performance was problematic, and DOD recently stated that it intended to acquire a new electronic health record system. GAO was asked to (1) determine the status of AHLTA, (2) determine DOD's plans for acquiring its new system, and (3) evaluate DOD's acquisition management of the initiative. To do this, GAO reviewed program plans, reports, and other documentation and interviewed DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After obligating approximately $2 billion over the 13-year life of its initiative to acquire an electronic health record system, as of September 2010, DOD had delivered various capabilities for outpatient care and dental care documentation. DOD had scaled back other capabilities it had originally planned to deliver, such as replacement of legacy systems and inpatient care management. In addition, users continued to experience significant problems with the performance (speed, usability, and availability) of the portions of the system that have been deployed. DOD has initiated efforts to improve system performance and enhance functionality and plans to continue its efforts to stabilize the AHLTA system through 2015, as a \"bridge\" to the new electronic health record system it intends to acquire. According to DOD, the planned new electronic health record system--known as the EHR Way Ahead--is to be a comprehensive, real-time health record for service members and their families and beneficiaries. The system is expected to address performance problems, provide unaddressed capabilities such as comprehensive medical documentation, capture and share medical data electronically within DOD, and improve existing information sharing with the Department of Veterans Affairs. As of September 2010, the department had established a planning office, and this office had begun an analysis of alternatives for meeting the new system requirements. Completion of this analysis is currently scheduled for December 2010. Following its completion, DOD expects to select a technical solution for the system and release a delivery schedule. DOD's fiscal year 2011 budget request included $302 million for the EHR Way Ahead initiative. Weaknesses in key acquisition management and planning processes contributed to AHLTA having fewer capabilities than originally expected, experiencing persistent performance problems, and not fully meeting the needs of users. (1) A comprehensive project management plan was not established to guide the department's execution of the system acquisition. (2) A tailored systems engineering plan did not exist to guide the technical development of the system, an effort that was characterized by significant complexity. (3) Requirements were incomplete and did not sufficiently reflect user and operational needs. (4) An effective plan was not used to improve users' satisfaction with the system. DOD has initiated efforts to bring its processes into alignment with industry best practices. However, it has not carried out a planned independent evaluation to ensure it has made these improvements. Until it ensures that these weaknesses are addressed, DOD risks undermining the success of further efforts to acquire electronic health record system capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD take six actions to help ensure that it has disciplined and effective processes in place to manage the acquisition of further electronic health record system capabilities.

The Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs establishes policy regarding health  care for all DOD beneficiaries and also plans and budgets for health care  operations and maintenance. At the same time, each military service has  its own medical department that operates medical facilities (referred to as  military treatment facilities) and recruits and funds military medical  personnel. Currently, the military treatment facilities include 59 military  hospitals and 650 medical and dental clinics. DOD provides about half of  MHS services through these military facilities, supplementing this by  contracting for health services with civilian contract providers. Active- duty members are required to obtain care at military treatment facilities if  such care is available; in contrast, retirees and dependents may obtain  care at either military facilities or through civilian contract providers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of DOD\u2019s Electronic Health Record System", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate the delivery of medical services, in 1988, DOD initiated the  acquisition of an electronic health record system to support all of its  hospitals and clinics. This system, the Composite Health Care System  (CHCS), was intended to be the primary medical information system  deployed worldwide to support the department\u2019s hospitals and clinics.  DOD envisioned that it would provide automated support for patient  administrative functions (such as registrations, admission, and  disposition); ordering and retrieving results of laboratory and radiology  procedures; ordering and recording prescriptions; and patient  appointment scheduling.", "CHCS was deployed in 1993; however, it was supported by numerous  stand-alone medical information systems, such as the department\u2019s  Ambulatory Data System, Preventive Health Care Application, and  Nutrition Management Information System, and was not designed to  facilitate the exchange of information from one system or military  treatment facility to the next. Specifically, CHCS was facility-centric, in  which each facility stored only its own medical information for patients  using different data standards. Therefore, if a medical provider wanted to  obtain complete information about a patient, a query would have to be  made to each of the CHCS locations\u2014a time- and resource-intensive  activity. Additionally, when a patient moved to another region, the  electronic records did not transfer across the CHCS locations because of  the different data standards at each location. The lack of an integrated  system perpetuated the reliance on paper-based records, leading DOD to  pursue a comprehensive electronic health care record.", "To this end, in 1997, the department initiated the CHCS II program to  address the need for a comprehensive, lifelong, computer-based health  care record for every service member and their beneficiaries. The vision  for CHCS II was to provide access to a patient\u2019s health care information  with a single query by providers in military treatment facilities.  Specifically, with this system, DOD planned to provide worldwide access  to outpatient, inpatient, dental, and vision records, and to make them  available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This new system was to be  accomplished with the use of a centralized repository of all health care  information derived using common data standards. The system was to  build on capabilities of existing systems, subsuming their functionality  over time, while adding new functionality to meet mission needs.", "CHCS II\u2019s architecture was to be an open system, client-server design of  three levels: the user (client) workstation at various DOD locations, the  DOD computers\u2019 (servers\u2019) operating system and storage hardware and  software, and a clinical data repository at a remote computing center  where the information would be stored. The department had planned to  connect all workstations at an installation\u2019s hospital or clinic to the  servers through the installation\u2019s local or wide area network. It had  planned to divide the system acquisition into seven software releases to be  delivered incrementally by June 2006 at an estimated cost of $4.3 billion  (in 1998 dollars).", "The department\u2019s original plan had called for deploying a prototype  system in October 1998 and beginning deployment of the initial version in  about April 1999. However, the department did not meet its schedule to  deliver initial CHCS II system capabilities and associated mission benefits  by April 1999; it reported that the initial deployment was delayed by 6  months because of a failure to meet initial performance requirements and  changes in system requirements.", "In July 2000, the department redefined its plans for the system to include  adopting a new technical architecture, establishing a means for controlling  changes to requirements, and committing to the incremental release of  system capabilities. It also delayed the decision date for deploying the  initial system capabilities (for outpatient documentation) to January  2001\u201421 months later than its original commitment for the system.", "However, the department did not meet this commitment, and subsequently  established a new plan that called for incrementally deploying  functionality to achieve the system\u2019s full operational capability. Delivery of  the system was to commence in July 2003 and was to be completed by  September 2007, yielding four blocks of capabilities that would  incrementally populate the system\u2019s electronic health record at a revised  estimated life-cycle cost of $3.8 billion through 2017.", "Block 1 was to make outpatient information available worldwide on a  continuous basis through the electronic health record system (as opposed  to CHCS legacy functionality which only made records available at a single  location), provide encounter documentation, aid in order entry/results  retrieval, assist in encounter coding support, provide alerts and reminders  (such as drug interaction alerts and special duty status), facilitate role- based security, and establish a health data dictionary and a master patient  index.", "Block 2 was to provide automated clinical practice guidelines, optometric  documentation, and dental documentation.", "Block 3 was to replace CHCS ancillary functionality for results retrieval  and order entry for outpatient encounters such as laboratory and  automatic pathology, pharmacy, and radiology.", "Block 4 was to provide for inpatient order entry and management,  including inpatient clinical and critical care documentation.", "When delivered, the system was to allow users to create and store  computer-based patient records using workstation- and computer-based  software packages. Each facility\u2019s workstations and servers were to be  connected via each installation\u2019s local or wide area networks. Further,  each installation was to be connected through a wide area network to a  defense computing center where the patient records would be stored in a  database known as the clinical data repository. DOD intended that medical  providers would ultimately be able to access a patient\u2019s computer-based  record from any military treatment facility, no matter where the patient  was being or had been treated.", "According to program documentation, the department began worldwide  deployment of Block 1 in January 2004. It completed the deployment of  this block in December 2006. However, program officials stated that users  experienced numerous performance problems with the capabilities that  were delivered, which impacted its usability, speed, and availability.  Specifically, the department reported experiencing the following problems  with the delivery of Block 1:    Usability. The system did not support varied clinical workflow to meet  the needs of various types of practitioners, had missing or incomplete  clinical capabilities (e.g., consult and referrals management, ancillaries,  specialty workflow support), did not support fully unified or user- customizable patient data, and did not have a user-friendly interface.", "Speed. The system did not have the speed or performance to efficiently  support the clinicians\u2019 workflow in certain environments and was affected  by problems such as coding and infrastructure which impacted its speed.", "Availability. The system was not reliable on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a- week basis; it had no backup for disaster recovery; and the data repository  experienced system shutdowns and functional interruptions.", "As a result of the system problems associated with Block 1, DOD set a new  date for system completion\u2014September 2011\u2014and increased the  projected life-cycle cost of the system to approximately $5 billion, which it  attributed primarily to the need for increased operations and maintenance  for Block 1.", "The department also took a number of other steps with regard to the  initiative. Specifically, in May 2005, it terminated plans for deploying the  Block 4 inpatient functionality with the intent of moving this functionality  into Block 3. However, due to continuing performance problems with the  functionality that had been delivered, and because the Block 3 deployment  had exceeded the department\u2019s 5-year limit for achieving initial  operational capability by January 2008, DOD terminated Block 3  (laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy) as well. This action left only one of  the four planned blocks\u2014Block 2\u2014for implementation. Although the  department reduced the scope of the initiative to only two blocks, the  estimated life-cycle costs were revised back to the original $3.8 billion  (through 2021). However, the department encountered performance  problems with the Block 2 dental module as well and, in December 2009,  MHS senior leadership implemented a strategic pause in its further  deployment.", "Beyond these actions, the department took other steps over the course of  the initiative. Specifically, in November 2005, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs announced a change in the name of the system  from CHCS II to AHLTA, but did not give a specific reason for doing so.  Further, as part of its attempt to improve the system, DOD awarded  several contracts between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2009 for a total  of approximately $40 million to address performance problems and  implement software enhancements.

Contracts  for system development and integration continued through fiscal year  2009.", "DOD also used noncompetitive contracts for the development of the  system. According to the program office, 11 noncompetitive contracts and  task or delivery orders, totaling approximately $44.6 million, were  awarded for the system from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year 2012.  Program officials stated that the noncompetitive contracts were awarded  on the basis that (1) DOD\u2019s need for the supplies or service was so urgent  that providing each awardee under a multiple award contact a fair  opportunity would have resulted in unacceptable delays; (2) only one  awardee was capable of providing the supplies or services required at the  level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered were  unique or highly specialized; or (3) an order was a logical follow-on to an  order already issued under the contract.", "According to AHLTA program documentation, the system acquisition was  guided by the defense acquisition system, which is documented in the  department\u2019s DOD 5000.02 Instructions.

Materiel solution analysis: The purpose of this phase is to assess,  through an analysis of alternatives, potential solutions to satisfy an  approved capability need. 2.  Technology development: The purpose of this phase is to determine  and mature the appropriate set of technologies to be integrated into  the investment solution by iteratively assessing the viability of the  various technologies while simultaneously refining user requirements.  To enter this phase, a program must have an approved analysis of  alternatives and pass milestone A. To exit this phase, the acquisition  must demonstrate affordable technology. 3.  Engineering and manufacturing development: The purpose of this  phase is to develop a system or an increment of capability, and  demonstrate integrated system design through developer testing to  show that the system can function in its target environment. To enter  this phase, a program must have approved requirements and pass  milestone B. To exit this phase, the acquisition must meet performance  requirements in the intended environment. 4.  Production and deployment: The purpose of this phase is to achieve  an operational capability that satisfies the mission needs, as verified  through independent operational test and evaluation, and to  implement the system at all applicable locations. To enter this phase, a  program must have completed development testing and pass milestone  C. To exit this phase, the system must be deployed and ready to  operate for all users. 5.  Operations and support: The purpose of this phase is to  operationally sustain the system in the most cost-effective manner  over its life cycle. DOD criteria do not require that the milestone  decision authority conduct milestone reviews during the period after a  system has been deployed and stabilized.", "For the purpose of conducting milestone reviews, AHLTA was assigned  the highest level of oversight for DOD information system acquisitions.

While the report  found that the program management office was using risk mitigation  techniques, such as risk management, lessons learned, and performance  monitoring, the program remained at high risk because of the complexities  of integrating commercial, off-the-shelf software into the existing program.  In particular, the report noted that the program office had not identified  any mitigation strategies to reduce and control program risk related to  integration of commercial, off-the-shelf software for the third block of  functionality. As a result, the Inspector General concluded that the  program was vulnerable to continued increases in cost, extended  schedules for implementation, and unrealized goals in performance from  underestimating the difficulties of integrating commercial, off-the-shelf  products. Subsequently, the program office developed mitigation  strategies, but the Inspector General reported that they were inadequate  and did not follow risk management guidance, including identifying  significant activities and milestones. Accordingly, the Inspector General  recommended that the program office develop more robust mitigation  strategies in accordance with the program office\u2019s risk management plan.", "We have also reported on DOD\u2019s management of the system acquisition,  noting the need for improvements. For example, in 2002, we reported that,  because the department had not estimated the cost of delivering the initial  system capabilities, it had lacked a cost commitment against which to  measure progress. In addition, we noted that program benefits were in  question since measurements had not yet begun and that costs were about  two-and-a-half times the l998 estimate. Further, DOD had initially  identified a single economic justification for the entire project, which had  been used as the basis for its system releases, and had not treated the  releases as separate investment decisions. Finally, DOD had not followed  performance-based contracting practices, resulting in the risk that the  system would take longer to acquire and cost more than necessary.", "Accordingly, we recommended that DOD expand its use of best practices  in managing the system by (1) modifying the project\u2019s investment strategy  to justify investment in each system release before beginning development  and measuring return on investment and (2) employing performance- based contracting practices where possible on all future delivery orders.  The department agreed with these recommendations and took actions to  update and validate its life-cycle cost estimate in September 2002.

In addition, although DOD  identified the plan as a keystone document for guiding the project, the  plan was last revised in 2005 and was not updated during subsequent  development work and the operations and maintenance phase to reflect  significant changes to the program. These changes included termination  and postponement of planned capabilities, and revisions to the acquisition  processes used to guide the AHLTA program.

In addition, the system design involved a network that had to  be integrated with a central patient database and multiple nonstandard  hardware and software platforms, such as commercial, off-the-shelf  products at over 800 military treatment facilities.", "Nonetheless, although the program office recognized these types of system  complexities as being part of the electronic health record system design,  the office never established a tailored systems engineering plan to guide  the acquisition, or to facilitate the resolution of the many performance  problems that have plagued the system since its initial deployment.", "In this regard, a particularly troublesome area for the department has been  in deploying enhancements to the system. For example, following Block 1  deployment in 2006, the department implemented local cache servers in an  attempt to improve the system\u2019s operational availability. According to the  department, the specific purpose of the local cache servers had been to  mitigate the need to access patient medical information in the central data  repository during system outages. However, after the servers were  deployed, DOD realized that the placement of the servers within the  system architecture did not resolve the problem and created a single point  of failure. Rather than yield operational improvements, department  officials acknowledged that these actions resulted in additional challenges,  including the need for a costly local cache server redesign, which was  begun in fiscal year 2009. Program documentation noted that the local  cache server effort was probably one of the most difficult engineering  challenges that the program office had faced so far. Further, as various  issues were faced, it became increasingly clear that detailed planning in  the earlier stages was not what it could have been. In April 2010, clinicians  demonstrating the system at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center stated  that the servers continued to be a major contributing factor to system  availability issues.", "The lack of a systems engineering plan to guide the program office  through this type of complexity is particularly notable in light of the DOD  Inspector General\u2019s report of 2006, which stated that inadequate planning  for technical complexities significantly impacts the cost, schedule, and  performance of a program. The report further stated that the AHLTA  program office had underestimated the technical complexity of integrating  products with the electronic health record system and, as a result,  remained at high risk for continued cost increases, schedule overruns, and  unrealized performance goals.", "In discussing this matter, agency officials stated that a tailored systems  engineering plan had not been developed to guide the design of AHLTA  because such a plan was not required when the system was originally  planned.

According to the documentation, users did not seek involvement  in the requirements development process and system developers did not  seek user input when making changes to requirements. As a result,  requirements were neither complete nor sufficiently detailed to guide  system development, and did not adequately provide a shared  understanding between the users and developers of how the system was to  be developed. Program documentation noted that requirements often were  not adequately specified and did not adequately reflect user needs. In  particular, the program documentation revealed that, while users were  involved in developing an initial set of requirements used to make system  acquisition decisions, they were largely not involved in identifying new  requirements and making changes to existing ones while the system was  being developed and deployed.", "In certain instances, because users were involved only at the beginning  and end of the requirements development process, they were only able to  determine that capabilities would not meet their needs after those  capabilities had already been deployed.

Program  officials stated that the requirements identified during the conference  were used to develop the AHLTA 3.3 software release. However, our  evaluation of the requirements traceability matrix used to develop the  AHLTA 3.3 release showed that bidirectional traceability had not been  fully established; thus, the requirements were not always linked to high- level operational requirements or to more detailed design specifications.
