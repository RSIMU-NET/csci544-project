The nation\u2019s interstate highway system has nearly been completed, but highway, air traffic, and other transportation and environmental problems are mounting. However, the federal budget deficit has made it increasingly difficult to fund infrastructure improvements either directly through federal grants or indirectly through tax exemptions. Consequently, the Congress and the administration have explored additional financing methods\u2014including some that involve America\u2019s pension plans, which were estimated to have over $4 trillion in assets in 1994\u2014to expand federal, state, and local financing of infrastructure projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Changing Federal Role in Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Substantial grant funding for infrastructure projects, including highways, wastewater treatment facilities, and mass transit began between 1956 and 1964.

But by the late 1970s, the growth of federal infrastructure spending had slowed and continued to slow into the 1990s. According to CBO, the share of all federal spending that was devoted to infrastructure declined from over 5.4 percent in 1977 to less than 3 percent in 1992. For example, in the area of environmental infrastructure, the Congress began to reduce funding for constructing wastewater treatment facilities in the late 1970s and decided in 1987 to phase out federal capitalization grants by 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Infrastructure Investment Debate", "paragraphs": ["The decline in infrastructure investment as a share of federal spending\u2014coupled with a growing backlog of infrastructure development and repair projects, and federal, state, and local budget deficits\u2014led to a widespread perception of an infrastructure crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. Estimates of how much investment was needed to resolve the crisis varied widely. A 1991 Office of Technology Assessment study estimated that federal, state, and local governments spent about $140 billion annually on building, operating, and maintaining infrastructure facilities, but others estimated that $40 billion to $80 billion more was needed each year.", "However, some experts and economists believe that the infrastructure problem has been overstated. They argue, for example, that the U.S. stock of \u201cpublic capital\u201d (that is, infrastructure) rose steadily between 1949 and 1991. Some also contend that past spending on infrastructure means less can be spent now; the interstate highway system is about 98-percent complete, for instance, and Americans have the highest quality drinking water in the world.

Public projects at the state and local levels are commonly financed through bonds for which the interest income is exempt from federal taxation. Tax-exempt bonds pay lower interest rates and, thus, hold down the cost of borrowing for state and local governments while providing a return to investors comparable with the after-tax return of taxable securities. At the same time, to encourage the development and growth of private pensions, the federal government exempts pension plans\u2019 earnings from taxation.

Federal law also exempts the plans\u2019 earnings from taxation. At the same time, the Internal Revenue Code and current federal grant and revolving fund programs encourage infrastructure project sponsors to finance public projects at lower interest rates through the municipal bond market.

These fiduciary standards require plan managers to, among other things, carry out their duties with the same care, skill, and diligence as a prudent person. These standards have been interpreted to mean that managers should obtain market-rate returns on their investments.", "DOL, which is responsible for enforcing the fiduciary standards in ERISA, interprets the standards as permitting infrastructure investment. DOL\u2019s Solicitor testified before the Infrastructure Commission that nothing in ERISA\u2019s fiduciary provisions specifically prevents pension plans from purchasing a security created to encourage investment in infrastructure facilities. Specifically, a pension plan must act solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries, and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and defraying reasonable expenses; act prudently; diversify plan investments; and not engage in certain kinds of transactions that may create conflicts of interests or result in self-dealing.", "This guidance generally means that private pension plans may invest in infrastructure projects only if the investments offer an equal or higher rate of return, adjusted for risk, as other potential investments. However, a pension plan can, according to the Solicitor\u2019s statement, consider \u201cnoneconomic\u201d factors even though it is required to act solely in the interests of its participants. For example, DOL advised a pension plan that it could invest in a mortgage pool that included only construction projects built by union labor because the mortgages had to meet rigorous financial criteria, and the investment was competitive with comparable investments available in the marketplace. However, according to the Solicitor\u2019s testimony, DOL has consistently opposed pension plan investments designed to achieve socially beneficial objectives at the expense of yield or security.", "A key ERISA requirement is that pension plan managers \u201cact prudently.\u201d Specifically, ERISA requires that a fiduciary use the care that \u201ca prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\u201d In fact, the Counsel to the Infrastructure Commission said that only large pension plans are likely to want to bear the cost of the \u201cdue diligence\u201d work to determine whether an infrastructure investment is prudent.", "In Interpretive Bulletin 94-1, issued on June 22, 1994, DOL reiterated its position that the fiduciary standards applicable to infrastructure are no different than the standards that apply to other investments. DOL stated that it issued its bulletin because \u201ca perception exists in the investment community\u201d that ETIs, including infrastructure, \u201care incompatible with ERISA\u2019s fiduciary obligations.\u201d The bulletin stated that sophisticated long-term investors, including pension plans, may invest in assets designed to create benefits to third parties in addition to their returns to investors.

The Internal Revenue Code exempts the earnings on municipal bonds from federal taxation; thus, states and localities financing infrastructure projects can hold down their costs by paying lower interest rates and still attract investors who do not have to pay taxes on the interest they collect. Typically, the interest rate paid on tax-exempt bonds is about 15 to 20 percent lower than that paid on taxable bonds of comparable risk and maturity. Given the high capital costs of some infrastructure projects such as environmental facilities, the interest savings can be considerable.", "Although tax-exempt bonds help states and localities hold down the cost of public projects, the comparatively low interest rates they pay make them relatively unattractive to pension plans, whose earnings are already tax exempt. The difference between yields on tax-exempt and taxable bonds changes over time, but we found that taxable bonds consistently pay a higher rate of return. CBO, for example, found that the yields on 30-year AAA-rated tax-exempt general obligation bonds (or bonds that are issued for state and local projects) have been an average of 1.4 percentage points lower than those on 30-year Treasury bonds since 1989. Our work shows that the yields on the tax-exempt bonds were lower than those on the Treasury bonds every month during the 11-year period, as shown in figure 2.1.", "The lower return on tax-exempt municipal bonds means that the securities cannot compete effectively for pension plan assets.

However, research suggests that it might be less costly to pay interest subsidies directly to state and local governments than it is to exempt state and local bonds from taxes. Paying interest subsidies directly to state and local governments might also eliminate the disincentive for pension plans to invest in state and local government bonds because the bonds would presumably pay investors competitive interest rates.

Also, the Infrastructure Commission recommended the establishment of an Infrastructure Insurance Corporation (IIC), initially an NIC subsidiary, that would insure infrastructure bonds.", "In general, the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposals are aimed at providing credit assistance to public and private sponsors seeking financing for infrastructure projects. Borrowers may have difficulty securing financing because their projects may be judged as too risky given the rate of return they promise to investors. When an entity assumes some of this risk (that is, by providing credit assistance or bond insurance) the investment becomes more attractive to the investor. At the same time, the state or locality seeking to obtain financing may do so on more favorable terms. The ability to bring borrowers and investors together by having an entity assume risk may involve the provision of a subsidy on the part of the federal government."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Functions of NIC and IIC", "paragraphs": ["The Infrastructure Commission proposed that NIC and IIC provide three forms of credit assistance. First, NIC would purchase \u201csubordinated\u201d bonds sold by state and local governments to finance new infrastructure projects. The payment on these bonds would be legally subordinated to, or not due before, payments on the remainder of the debt, called \u201csenior\u201d debt. The subordinated debt purchased by NIC typically would be for projects that are not eligible for investment-grade credit ratings (ratings BBB and above) in the marketplace.", "Second, NIC would insure private firms against a portion of the risk associated with developing new facilities, such as the risk of environmental lawsuits and voter disapproval of the issuance of bonds to provide long-term financing. NIC would be legally obligated to cover up to 70 percent of any losses incurred by developers if the projects were never completed.", "Third, IIC would bear a portion of a project\u2019s credit risk by insuring or reinsuring senior infrastructure bonds.

Since it is assumed IIC would generate a revenue stream of its own through fees paid by those seeking insurance for their bonds, the pension plans could earn a return. The size of such a return is not clear. Furthermore, the experience with Connie Lee suggests that those providing capital typically would invest only modest amounts. Thus, the potential equity participation in IIC by pension plans is likely to be of limited magnitude.", "The second option involves two parts. First, pension plans could directly purchase taxable project debt insured by IIC. Second, NIC could use its capital to purchase taxable project debt, some of which may have been insured by IIC. When a large volume of debt has been acquired, NIC could create a new security backed by the project debt that would then be sold to the market with NIC\u2019s guarantee. It is thought that this security would create a secondary market for project debt and reduce the risks of investing in specific project debt. Since it is presumed that this security would offer a competitive, taxable, market rate and be more liquid than specific project debt, pension plans might be attracted to it. Pension plans might, for example, support pollution control projects that are not eligible for tax-exempt financing because they benefit private businesses.", "However, this could only occur after some time, since NIC would need to develop a quality portfolio of loans over time as a precondition to issuing its own debt or securitizing its loans.", "In its third option for increasing pension plan investment in infrastructure, the Infrastructure Commission recommended modifying federal tax law to allow all or part of the earnings on a municipal or \u201cpublic benefit\u201d bond to be distributed tax free upon retirement to workers who participated in defined contribution pension plans, such as 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRA). Defined contribution plan participants would be willing to invest in such a bond because its after-tax rate of return would be comparable to a taxable market return. This would allow the localities issuing the bonds to finance projects at rates comparable to those in the municipal bond market while attracting direct investment from pension plans.", "The Infrastructure Commission\u2019s Secretary told us that he considers the public benefit bond proposal to be the \u201ccornerstone of the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposals related to pension plans.\u201d However, the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s Executive Director said that much of the investment in infrastructure would come from public, and perhaps union, pension plans\u2014not from corporate pension plans.

The proposed new federal incentives may result in further distortion of investment choices by displacing other investments, which in turn could result in economic inefficiency.", "The municipal bond market already receives a large federal subsidy and is generally considered to be functioning well. The market imperfections that affect the municipal bond market were not addressed by the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposals.", "Measuring and controlling the impact of new federal financial entities are influenced importantly by the organizational form of the proposed corporations. Establishing NIC as a government-sponsored enterprise carries high risk (through contingent liability) to the federal government.", "Concerning the specific incentives for pension plan involvement mentioned earlier, CBO made several additional points. With regard to pension plans investing in IIC\u2019s equity, CBO noted that the proposed IIC has little justification on efficiency grounds since the municipal bond insurance industry appears to be competitive. Hence, this first avenue for pension plans may not be necessary or attractive.", "The second avenue\u2014having pension plans buy debt securities issued directly by NIC\u2014is problematic because infrastructure projects are heterogeneous and, thus, are not likely to be easy to pool into securities to create a secondary market.", "The third avenue for pension plan investment\u2014having pension plans invest directly in funding infrastructure project debt through public benefit bonds\u2014also was questioned by CBO. It noted that the public benefit bonds might subsidize projects that are not really public in nature. This provision might circumvent the legal restrictions put in place during the 1980s to prevent the excessive use of tax-exempt municipal debt to finance private activities that were crowding out state and local spending and raising costs for public projects. CBO also noted that administrative costs may be associated with implementing a public benefit bond that gives a tax break to pension plan participants. Internal Revenue Service regulations would have to be put in place to require individuals to separate income from investing in infrastructure securities from other asset income.", "The CBO analysis concluded that the interaction of existing federal tax subsidies for pension plans and municipal bonds is the main cause of the low level of direct investment in infrastructure. It noted that existing subsidies for municipal debt could be reduced and that this could induce pension plans to invest in infrastructure. A similar effect could result from taking away the tax exemption for pension plans. However, the Infrastructure Commission did not advocate either approach.", "In reviewing other analysis and commentary on the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposals, we found substantial skepticism among economists as well (see app. II). The basic view was that there seems to be little reason to put new incentives in place to reallocate capital from its existing uses. Moving beyond the economic analysis framework implies that the issue becomes one of competing political values about how to allocate resources. In our discussions with Infrastructure Commission officials, it was noted that the rationale for the proposals was based more on \u201cpolicy\u201d considerations than on a strictly economic justification. In this regard, the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s rationale seems more rooted in the view that capital should be reallocated to public investment (in infrastructure), and the proposed entities and incentives are justified as an effort to implement that objective.", "This means that the justification for an expanded government role to encourage investment in infrastructure can depend on the values expressed by the voters. In other words, if individuals perceive a problem with infrastructure and want it to be addressed, then government may be chosen as the means to meet this demand.

Also, infrastructure investments may lack the liquidity that defined contribution plans require in order to repay beneficiaries.", "These views suggest a possible role for the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposed public benefit bond, which would pass through tax benefits to retirees.

Projects that meet this criterion might include \u201cstand-alone\u201d toll roads constructed by private developers for which there is adequate demand and that can generate identifiable revenue streams. Furthermore, according to the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s Secretary, toll roads that lacked a track record when they were initially financed could attract pension plans when they are refinanced based on a history of generating revenue.", "Economic research suggests that user fees could provide a revenue stream to finance a large share of many public works facilities such as transportation, water supply, wastewater treatment, and solid and hazardous waste systems. Because these facilities largely serve identifiable consumers, their use can be measured and priced, and the beneficiaries can be charged directly for the cost of services. If financing is linked to use, revenue can become steadier and more predictable, encouraging better maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement.", "Unless these niches are found, pension plans will not be significant investors in America\u2019s infrastructure, according to a managing director of a municipal bond-rating firm. Pension plans are not investing in infrastructure because \u201cthe deals aren\u2019t out there.\u201d One way to identify a niche, the managing director suggested, would be to establish a pilot program on one kind of project, such as highways or mass transit, so that pension plan managers would \u201clearn to walk before they run.\u201d", "Once these niches are found, then government incentives\u2014such as the development of industrywide standards for evaluating projects, and tax credits\u2014might help attract private capital. A transportation consultant said that any governmental actions to encourage investment in infrastructure must move in the direction of assisting the private sector\u2019s efforts in infrastructure investment, establishing standards for project evaluation, and pooling and securitizing private sector projects. We were also told that while government guarantees, by reducing risk, enable state and local governments to obtain lower interest rates, they also lower the return to investors.", "The view that niches must be found suggests the need for exploring alternative financing schemes but also seems to be broadly consistent with the notion of a government corporation that would work with localities to find projects and help make them attractive to pension plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Market Participants Express Concerns About an Increased Federal Role", "paragraphs": ["Creating NIC and IIC to attract pension plan capital to finance public projects may not be necessary, according to the pension plan representatives and experts we met with.

Pension plan managers are concerned about the possibility that the federal government will mandate certain investments, or classes of investments, said a managing director of a financial services company that manages assets for large corporate pension plan clients. In addition, partners in a global investment management firm that advises pension plans told us that they believed DOL\u2019s interpretive bulletin will subject private sector pension plans to a higher level of government scrutiny than they receive now. They believed that pension plan managers will become more circumspect about the possibility of investment losses in ETIs.", "State and local officials are unlikely to seek investment from private pension plans because it would increase their cost of borrowing, the chief economist of a bond-rating agency told us. An official of a private bond insurance company noted that NIC\u2019s insurance proposals would also be more costly than private insurance. Instead, she recommended that projects obtain low-interest loans and grants from the federal government. In financing infrastructure projects, pension plans would require a competitive rate of return as well as a government guarantee backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Thus, pension plan capital would be expensive for states and localities to borrow.", "Municipalities could finance their projects more efficiently by improving their bond credit ratings instead of relying on government guarantees or pooling of assets, according to a managing director responsible for municipal bond ratings. In this view of the capital markets, plenty of capital is available to finance creditworthy infrastructure projects.", "Moreover, the bond insurance function envisioned for IIC would compete with the functions currently being performed by private insurance companies. One insurance industry official stated that IIC could not do any more than the private insurance industry does. The managing director of a bond-rating company told us that IIC may not significantly increase infrastructure investment by offering bond insurance because municipal bonds are already privately insured.

They pointed out that other mechanisms for infrastructure financing already exist, such as municipal bonds, state revolving funds, user fees, and private bond insurance for creditworthy projects.", "In transportation finance, for example, some pointed out that ISTEA could be amended to allow states to create state revolving fund loans or to provide credit enhancement (such as guaranteeing local government bonds) with federal highway money. Some state officials and industry experts remain skeptical about the viability of state transportation revolving funds. One concern, for example, is whether even densely populated areas will generate many revenue-bearing projects with the capacity to repay loans.

Nevertheless, debate continues on the amount of infrastructure investment that is needed, the role of infrastructure in fostering future economic growth and higher productivity, and the appropriate degree of federal involvement. There is also a continuing effort to explore innovative and efficient ways to finance projects. The idea of attracting a portion of pension plan capital to infrastructure investment has become popular, and the proposals of the Infrastructure Commission offer an ambitious attempt to put that idea into practice.", "Our review of the Infrastructure Commission\u2019s proposals suggests that they could play a role in encouraging more infrastructure investment by pension plans. The government can foster marketplace innovations and has done so in the past. But this comes at a cost to the federal government. We found strong reservations among economists and market participants about the need for new federal entities and subsidies to encourage a reallocation of pension capital when significant existing tax subsidies discourage pension plans from investing in infrastructure projects.", "If the primary goal is increasing infrastructure investment, then there are many ways, including initiatives currently under way, to address this goal. Encouraging localities to make projects more creditworthy through the provision of adequate revenue streams could foster investment that is more in line with the demand from the public. Techniques to leverage grants at the state level seem promising. Establishing NIC and IIC might aid these efforts, but the evidence is insufficient to conclude that such entities are required to attain an adequate level of infrastructure investment.", "The goal of attracting pension capital to infrastructure is problematic. Advocates for new federal entities to encourage direct pension capital flows to infrastructure recognize that the subsidies accorded to pension plans and municipal bonds are well established and serve important policy objectives. Advocates also need to recognize that fostering significant pension plan investment in infrastructure would probably require a reevaluation of existing tax policy."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
