The 2018 Census Test marked the Bureau's last chance to test enumeration procedures for peak field operations under census-like conditions before 2020. Implementation of this test identified the following concerns:", "The Bureau experienced operational issues during implementation of the Non-Response Follow-Up (NRFU) as part of the 2018 Census Test. For example, the Bureau had not finalized procedures for data collection during late phases of NRFU (e.g., after multiple attempts to interview had been made) until after the work had already started. As a result, enumerators and their supervisors did not have standardized procedures during the test, which made it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the test procedures. GAO also observed a range of other NRFU implementation issues during the test, such as the Bureau's use of progress reporting that overstates the number of NRFU cases not needing any additional fieldwork and the Bureau having fewer of its enumerators work Saturdays, which can be among the most productive interview days. The Bureau is taking steps to assess and mitigate these and other issues that GAO identified.", "The Bureau's field workforce was not fully prepared to face all of the enumeration challenges that arose during the test. For instance, the Bureau expects census field supervisors to provide front-line coaching to enumerators but did not screen these employees to ensure they had the needed skills. Moreover, it did not provide them with the authorities and information that would have helped them serve that role. As a result, we believe that supervisors did not have the casework expertise, information, or authority to help enumerators with procedural questions, and higher-level census field managers ended up providing direct support to enumerators.", "While the Bureau provided extensive online and in-person training to enumerators prior to NRFU fieldwork for the 2018 Census Test, the Bureau lacked any standardized form of mid-operation training or guidance as new procedures were implemented. GAO observed that during the test some enumerators continued to have questions and were uncertain about procedures. Developing targeted, location-specific training could help ensure that, in 2020, enumerators receive the guidance they need to collect census data consistently and in accordance with NRFU procedures.", "The Bureau has made progress addressing prior test implementation issues but still faces challenges. For example, the Bureau improved its collection of enumerator case notes, which reflect real-time knowledge gained during enumeration. However, enumerators did not always report cases using flags built in to their interviewing device that would benefit from supervisory review, such as for language barriers. Moreover, supervisors were not systematically analyzing case notes to identify cases not flagged properly. As a result, critical data on fieldwork challenges were not being communicated effectively to those who could analyze and use them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Bureau (1) determine procedures for late-NRFU data collection; (2) align census field supervisor screening, authorities, and information flows; (3) prepare for targeted mid-operation training or guidance as needed; and (4) improve training on reporting cases that need supervisory attention and alternative ways to communicate these cases.", "The Department of Commerce agreed with GAO's findings and recommendations, and the Bureau provided technical comments that were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The cost of the decennial census has steadily increased over the past  several decades, with enumeration costs rising from about $16 per  household in 1970 to around $92 in 2010 (all in constant 2020 dollars).  The Census Bureau (Bureau) estimates that overall decennial costs will  increase by over $3 billion from the 2010 Census to $15.6 billion in 2020  (in current decennial time frame costs). During this period of increasing  costs, the percentage of households self-responding to mailed census  questionnaires has declined from 78 percent in 1970 to 63 percent in  2010. The Bureau anticipates that the self-response rate will further  decline to roughly 60 percent in 2020, in part because, as the Bureau has  noted, the population is overloaded with requests for information and has  become increasingly concerned about sharing information.", "When a household does not initially respond to the census, the Bureau  attempts to enumerate the residents through Non-Response Follow-Up  (NRFU), an operation where enumerators personally visit to count the  household. NRFU is labor intensive and is the largest and costliest  operation that the Bureau undertakes. Another enumeration operation  happening at about the same time is Group Quarters, when the Bureau  counts residents of group facilities (such as skilled nursing facilities and  correctional facilities).", "The Bureau planned its 2018 Census Test in Providence County, Rhode  Island, to rehearse most of the operations, systems, and procedures that  it will implement during the 2020 Census. Previously, the Bureau  conducted operational tests from 2013 through 2017, as well as multiple  small-scale tests designed to demonstrate specific functionalities (such as  submitting census data over the Internet).

This report  examines (1) the implementation of peak operations during the 2018  Census Test at the Providence County, Rhode Island, site; and (2) the  extent to which implementation issues raised in prior 2020 Census tests  have been addressed and what actions the Bureau could take to address  these issues.", "To address both of these research objectives, we visited the test site in  Rhode Island to observe implementation of the peak operations being  tested between May and August 2018. These visits included  nongeneralizable observations of door-to-door field enumeration and  office clerical work, as well as interviews with local managers. We also  observed debrief sessions held with multiple levels of the census field  workforce after the operations. From each of these visits, we documented  observations and provided feedback to Bureau managers in near real  time so that the Bureau could mitigate and adapt to issues raised by the  test\u2019s implementation in a timely manner. Implementation issues are a  natural part of the testing environment and are what testing is intended to  uncover. We also discussed any mitigation or evaluation strategies  developed in response to our observations with the cognizant Bureau  headquarters officials.", "In addition to our fieldwork, we collected real-time production data on the  tested operations. These data included tallies of case outcomes,  transactional case activity by enumerators, and hours worked by Bureau  employees. After testing the case tallies and distributions and interviewing  cognizant officials, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for our reporting purposes.

If the Bureau is unable to  enumerate the housing unit in the field, it may have to impute attributes of  the household based on the demographic characteristics of surrounding  housing units as well as administrative records.", "Within the test site in Providence County, Rhode Island, the Bureau set  up an area census office to administer field operations. Figure 1 provides  an overview of the managerial hierarchy of the area census office. The  area census office manager oversees day-to-day operations within the  office and acts as a liaison with the Bureau\u2019s New York Regional Census  Center, which is a Bureau regional office with jurisdiction over the  Providence area census office. Census field managers are to monitor  operational progress and performance indicators to understand any areas  of concern and shift resources as needed within the test site.

Such facilities can include skilled nursing facilities, college and university  student housing, and correctional facilities. Within the Group Quarters  enumeration, the Bureau also enumerates places such as soup kitchens,  homeless shelters, and other service-based enumeration facilities.", "Prior to Group Quarters enumeration in the field, the Bureau attempts to  establish the facilities\u2019 approximate population count and preferred  enumeration method through the Advance Contact operation. These  facilities can choose among methods including paper listing, where the  facility provides a roster of residents as of census day to the Bureau, and  in-person enumeration, where a team of enumerators count residents.  For the 2020 cycle, the Bureau is also adding an \u201ceResponse\u201d option,  tested on a small scale in 2016, whereby facility administrators can  electronically submit enumeration data at a date of their choosing within  operational time frames.", "The Bureau\u2019s testing of the peak operations that we observed during the  2018 Census Test was intended to test collection of census data from  those either not responding themselves via paper, telephone, or over the  Internet or those living in group quarters. Prior to the start of NRFU during  the 2018 test, roughly 45 percent of anticipated housing units in the test  area of Providence County, Rhode Island, self-responded, leaving more  than 140,000 remaining housing units to be attempted by NRFU itself,  which took place between May 9 and July 31, 2018. The Bureau  conducted a test of its Group Quarters enumeration from July 25 through  August 24, 2018, including service-based enumeration.

Bureau planning documentation from February 2018  described a late-operation \u201ccloseout\u201d phase of NRFU that would attempt  to resolve cases that had not yet responded. However, we found that the  Bureau had not determined the procedural modifications this phase would  involve, either in terms of rules enumerators followed or business rules for  how cases were to be assigned. By late May, nearly 3 weeks into the  operation, the Bureau issued a set of closeout procedures to census  areas where most cases had either been completed or where at least four  of the six allowable enumeration attempt day assignments had been  made. The Bureau also placed a priority on having high-performing  enumerators\u2014in terms of their ability to complete cases\u2014available to  work these cases during this phase of the NRFU testing.", "Table 2 summarizes the chronology for when the Bureau implemented  and documented procedural changes governing the transition from early  to late-NRFU data collection, as well as the nature of those changes.", "In late June 2018, the Bureau began testing the third phase of NRFU data  collection, what it referred to as the \u201cfinal attempt\u201d phase, with officials  citing a high incidence of non-interviews during prior phases as the  reason. However, the Bureau had also begun this phase\u2019s data collection  before it had established the procedural modifications it would be using.  The modifications were intended to further increase the chances of  enumerators completing cases in the field, such as by removing the limit  on the number of attempts enumerators could make at each remaining  case before NRFU ended.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agencies should implement control activities by, for example,  documenting policies. However, the Bureau did not determine  procedures for the final attempt phase until after testing for this phase of  NRFU had begun. Enumerators and census field supervisors thus began  working closeout and final attempt cases without a standardized set of  test procedures.", "Without determining the procedural changes the Bureau would be  testing\u2014or the business rules guiding when to make those changes\u2014the  Bureau was not well positioned to collect data to assess the alternatives it  used during the test to inform planning for 2020. Bureau officials shared  with us that they believed their automated case assignment approach is  most effective during initial data collection but that it is less effective at  targeting the toughest cases to resolve late in NRFU data collection. Yet,  in part because the Bureau had not established when the transition from  automated to manual case management would occur\u2014or the business  rules for determining when\u2014some of the highest-performing enumerators  were unavailable to receive assignments when the Bureau needed to  begin the final attempt phase, according to the area census office  manager. By not establishing the scope and timing of procedural changes  for late-NRFU data collection in 2020, the Bureau may not be in a position  to efficiently shift from its automated assignment approach to a manual  one at the right time and position its most effective enumerators to  receive assignments when needed.", "In November 2018, the Bureau provided a draft contact strategy for  NRFU in 2020 that included an outline of a multi-phase strategy for late- NRFU data collection. By including multiple phases of (1) shifting away  from a fully-automated case assignment process and (2) relaxing  management controls to complete as much casework as possible in  areas with continued high non-response rates, this strategy appears to  follow what the Bureau ultimately implemented during the 2018 test. It will  be important, however, for the Bureau to determine the business rules for  procedural changes and their timing in advance so that it can maximize  the value of NRFU in reducing the number of housing units that have to  be imputed for the 2020 Census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Did Not Fully Ready Its Field Workforce for Enumeration Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Census field supervisors were not integrated into casework  management. As described in the Bureau\u2019s training and operational  planning documents, census field supervisors were to be the primary  points of contact in fielding and addressing enumerator questions.  Census field managers\u2014the next step above census field supervisors\u2014 were to focus their efforts on monitoring progress in completing the  caseload, reviewing cases flagged by enumerators as problematic in one  of a small number of pre-defined ways (e.g., dangerous addresses), and  resolving significant performance issues. Among field supervisors\u2019 key  responsibilities, according to the Bureau\u2019s plan for NRFU, were providing  guidance to help enumerators understand procedural matters and to offer  coaching and problem-solving support to enumerators who may need it.  They also led enumerator training prior to the beginning of NRFU and  generally were to train their specific team of enumerators.", "However, census field managers and enumerators indicated that census  field supervisors were often not the primary actors involved in fielding and  addressing enumerator questions. Instead, enumerators and census field  managers reported having direct contact with each other over procedural  questions. Moreover, seven of the nine enumerators participating in the  Bureau\u2019s operational debrief focus group who responded said they  thought finding someone who could answer their questions was either  difficult or very difficult.", "We found that census field supervisors went underutilized in part because  the Bureau did not recruit and position them to assume front-line  supervising and coaching responsibilities. As outlined in training  documentation, the Bureau vested supervisory review authority (for  special cases, such as resident refusals and language barrier issues)  within census field managers, the area census office manager, clerks,  and office operations supervisors instead of census field supervisors.  Additionally, as part of the Bureau\u2019s reengineered field operations for  2020, census field supervisors are given automated tools to monitor  enumerators, and enumerators we observed told us that they generally  did not interact in person with their supervisors apart from training. We  believe that the combination of these factors resulted in census field  supervisors having limited exposure to NRFU casework and any  problematic situations enumerators might encounter. Officials also told us  that the Bureau did not screen census field supervisors for their  supervisory or coaching skillsets, though officials noted that this has been  the practice in prior censuses, too. Rather, they hired census field  supervisors based on their scores on the online enumerator training and  because they reported an interest in supervising.", "Additionally, census field supervisors lacked access to certain data  streams from the test that could have helped them answer or troubleshoot  enumerator questions. According to two census field managers, the  Bureau did not regularly share consolidated records of procedural  changes with census field supervisors. Information technology (IT) and  census field managers also noted that the Bureau did not share or  compare observations between the census field supervisor hotline and  the decennial IT hotline, even though enumerators could potentially call  either or both with technical or procedural questions. As a result, without  sharing how best to respond to similar questions across support lines,  enumerators could receive different answers for related questions  depending on which hotline they contacted.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agency management should demonstrate a commitment to recruit,  develop, and retain competent individuals. Management should establish  expectations for competence in key roles and should consider the level of  assigned responsibility and delegated authority when establishing  expectations. Yet, the role the Bureau envisioned census field  supervisors having was not aligned with the authority supervisors were  given, the skills for which the Bureau hired them, or the access to  information that they had for the 2018 test.", "When we raised this issue related to using census field supervisors,  Bureau officials agreed and cited feedback they had received that census  field managers felt inundated with the combination of the volume of  supervisory review cases that flowed to them and with troubleshooting  day-to-day enumerator questions. In October 2018, the Bureau provided  documentation to us proposing a set of questions that they could use in  screening applicants for the census field supervisor position to identify  supervisory skills. Officials also said they were still evaluating options for  granting census field supervisors more supervisory review authority. As  the Bureau continues to learn from the 2018 test as part of its planning for  2020, it will be important to align census field supervisor roles with their  authorities, skills, and information flows so that the Bureau does not  underutilize a key portion of its field management chain. Doing so could  also lessen the operational burden on higher-level census field managers.", "Enumerators did not receive training to address mid-operation  issues. Prior to the start of 2018 NRFU testing, the Bureau trained  enumerators with a series of online training modules and assessments  and one full day of in-person training facilitated by census field  supervisors. The training included modules on data stewardship  requirements, payroll responsibilities, and procedural directions for  conducting respondent interviews. However, officials acknowledged that  when the Bureau implemented its closeout and final attempt phases of  NRFU, it did not provide standardized training to enumerators on the  rollout of procedural changes. Five enumerators we observed during  these stages said they relied on informal communications from their  census field supervisors or census field managers for guidance. The  initial practice had been for enumerators to receive daily assignments and  follow pre-specified case sequencing and routing based on the Bureau\u2019s  automated system. During the final attempt phase, enumerators were  given discretion over the sequencing, routing, and number of attempts to  make for cases that could be manually assigned, yet they were not given  standardized training on how to handle this shift.", "During our field observations, some enumerators we spoke with said they  were uncertain about core procedures. For example, enumerators were  not consistently aware that they had some discretion in large multi-unit  settings to deviate from the assigned sequence of their cases provided by  the automated system. Enumerators we observed and spoke to were also  not always clear on how to flag within their field enumeration application  the commonly occurring cases with confusing address markings and  numberings. For example, enumerators had the option of selecting a case  outcome of \u201cmissing unit designation,\u201d but they were not always sure  whether this selection would capture the nuances of what they were  seeing on the ground or how it differed from other selection options.", "Standards for Control in the Federal Government states that agencies  should demonstrate a commitment to competence by, for example,  tailoring training based on employee needs and helping personnel adapt  to an evolving environment. Targeted informational training would help  the Bureau ensure that staff understand mid-operation procedural  changes, and the training could be an opportunity for the Bureau to  address commonly-observed and persistent implementation issues that  may be arising. By developing brief, targeted mid-operation training,  either as formal modules, guidance, or other standardized job aids, such  as \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d worksheets, the Bureau could better  position itself to react nimbly to enumerator feedback.", "We have previously reported challenges the Bureau faces with its field  work in other locations, such as connecting to the Internet during testing  of address canvassing in rural West Virginia in 2017 and dealing with  language barriers and other circumstances in unincorporated  communities in southern Texas or with migrant and seasonal farmworkers  in southern California during the 2000 Census. All challenges are not  universal to all locations. Given that some of the enumeration challenges  enumerators encountered in 2018 NRFU testing might not occur  everywhere, and that some other areas of the country will have their own  types of challenges, locally- or regionally-specific training or guidance  may better address some needs. By relying solely on pre-NRFU training,  the Bureau risks having little opportunity to course-correct with  enumerators who may not have absorbed all of the training and are  experiencing difficulty completing interviews or not collecting quality data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Is Assessing Other Implementation Issues That Arose during the 2018 Test", "paragraphs": ["We observed and discussed with Bureau officials in real time several  other implementation issues that occurred during the 2018 test. Bureau  officials acknowledged these issues and, as of September 2018, were  assessing them and developing mitigation strategies as part of their test  evaluation process. These issues include:  Training certification. Census field managers estimated that roughly  100 enumerators were unable to transmit their final test scores because  the Bureau\u2019s online learning management system had an erroneous  setting. According to Bureau officials, this problem delayed the start of  unsupervised work for these otherwise-qualified enumerators by an  average of 2 days per enumerator and resulted in the attrition of some  who were able to quickly find other work. Bureau officials told us they  have fixed the system setting and are considering an alternative means to  certify training, such as by having the option of trainees taking and  verifying their final assessment as part of their final capstone day of  classroom training. According to Bureau officials, development of this  backup strategy will begin in December 2018.", "Assigning cases manually in batches. During the 2018 test, the  Bureau\u2019s automated case management system was not configured for  non-Headquarters staff to manually assign multiple cases to an  enumerator at once. Rather, according to officials, census field managers  were faced with having to manually assign thousands of cases  individually during latter stages of NRFU. According to field management,  this problem presented an unexpected burden on them, delayed  assignments of the hardest-to-count cases, and contributed to high- performing enumerators not receiving work timely and in some cases for  days in a row. Officials told us that, as a work-around, the Bureau shifted  responsibility for assigning cases to a headquarters official with access  rights in the system to assign large numbers of cases at once. Bureau  officials acknowledge the unsustainability of this work-around if needed at  a national level and the importance of resolving this before the 2020  Census. As of October 2018, Bureau officials showed us system  screenshots of how census field managers would be able to manually  assign batches of cases and indicated that this functionality would be  ready for the 2020 Census.", "Monitoring operational progress. The Bureau\u2019s reporting on its  progress in completing the NRFU casework for the 2018 test emphasized  a process-oriented measure that overstated the extent to which the NRFU  efforts were resulting in completed workload. In planning documentation,  the Bureau listed the outcomes of interview attempts that it considered  complete and thus not in need of further enumeration assignments.  These outcomes\u2014such as a full interview of the household or  confirmation of a housing unit being vacant or nonexistent\u2014would also  result directly in reduction in the number of incomplete cases needing to  have some of their missing data imputed by the Bureau later.", "Yet the daily Bureau progress report and \u201cdashboard\u201d the Bureau  provided us for the 2018 test, which decennial leadership also identified  as their primary monitoring report, did not reflect these pre-planned  definitions of completed workload. Rather, as officials acknowledged, it  included cases that the Bureau had unsuccessfully attempted to  enumerate the maximum number of allowable times for the initial phase  of NRFU being tested, even though those cases could still\u2014and did\u2014 receive additional attempts during later phases of NRFU. Officials noted  that the measure reported could be helpful during early stages of the  operation in determining whether enough employees had been hired, or  whether case assignments were being worked quickly enough.", "Figure 2 demonstrates the gap that arose during 2018 NRFU test  implementation between the reported progress measure and the number  of cases actually being completed. The totals reflected in the Bureau\u2019s  reported measure include those that either have to be re-worked in the  field during the final attempt phase as discussed or have their data  imputed after fieldwork had ended. By contrast, an outcome-based  measure of operational progress, like the one the Bureau designed,  would capture only those cases where the Bureau had completed  enumeration of the nonresponding housing units and thus be a more  accurate representation of the operation\u2019s status.", "Bureau officials acknowledged the need to maintain measures that focus  on process as well as outcomes\u2014such as avoiding having to impute data  for cases after field work\u2014when measuring progress completing NRFU.  They said that managers in the field and in Bureau headquarters had  access to alternative measures and reports that more closely identified  outcomes. The officials noted that the reporting mechanism expected to  be used in 2020 was not fully available in time for the beginning of NRFU  testing in 2018, so the reporting format and measures will likely differ. In  addition, in October 2018, the Bureau provided a draft dashboard for  2020 that included greater detail on the number of cases that could still  require work to enumerate. Such detail could help assist with determining  when to transition to the final-attempt phase of the operation to address  cases without sufficient information yet collected.", "Integrating key systems settings. At the beginning of NRFU test  implementation, the Bureau\u2019s case assignment and case sequencing  systems were operating as if they were on time zones 4 hours apart.  Bureau officials said that this resulted in enumerators receiving  mismatched case assignment times, which hampered early NRFU  production, and census field supervisors having to process erroneous  \u201cwork not started\u201d supervisory alerts. Bureau officials said they addressed  the problem within the first week of the operation and that they would  ensure that future updates and key settings would be coordinated across  systems.", "Tracking employees and equipment. The Bureau used two different  sets of employee identification numbers to track their payroll status and  use of Bureau-issued equipment (e.g., smart phones), respectively,  without cross-walking them. According to census field managers, this  resulted in extra work when trying to monitor changes in enumerators\u2019  employment statuses and whether enumerators had returned their  equipment to the Bureau. The managers noted that office staff had to  spend extra time comparing different lists of staff, while one manager  developed a spreadsheet listing all staff by their two different identification  numbers. Bureau officials said they considered this a priority issue to be  resolved during final systems development for 2020 and had already  developed a fix within their case management system so that the cross- walk between the two systems would be integrated within their  management system. This would eliminate the need for manually  reconciling the differing identification numbers.", "Having more enumerators work weekends. Until the latter stages of  2018 NRFU testing, the Bureau assigned cases to enumerators based on  the alignment of the Bureau\u2019s estimated probability of finding respondents  at home at certain times and enumerator-reported work availability.  Bureau officials told us that Saturdays are generally one of the best days  to find a household member home to respond to the census. However,  during the test, our analysis showed that Saturdays had the second- fewest number of enumerators assigned to cases of any day of the week.  Bureau officials said that they would review whether the incentive  structure for working on Saturdays should be altered and that they would  examine ways to ensure that more enumerators are working on those  days. This includes exploring the feasibility of hiring and assigning work to  applicants who may only want to work weekends and being clearer with  enumerators about what the expected peak enumeration hours are.", "Increasing electronic completion rates for Group Quarters. The  Bureau hopes to reduce field costs for Group Quarters (such as skilled  nursing homes, college and university student housing, and correctional  facilities) by, for the first time, encouraging facilities to self-enumerate  electronically, when possible.

As  of September 2018, Bureau officials said they were still evaluating  potential causes of the low response rate by Group Quarters facilities but  noted that issues with the required format for the submission of response  files may have prevented some submissions.

We also reported that, during  the 2016 Census Test, the Bureau was not reviewing case notes written  by enumerators providing respondent information on better times-of-day  for future NRFU visits to their housing unit, and enumerators did not  always have this note-taking feature available. During the 2018 test,  enumerators were trained to take notes and, when appropriate, identify  special cases that would later require supervisory review. We also  observed that enumerators appeared to be consulting case notes from  prior enumerator visits when planning NRFU visits to the same housing  unit. Enumerators can use markings within their automated interview  instrument to describe certain types of cases (e.g., hearing barriers and  dangerous situations), which the automated system would then route to  receive supervisory review. Enumerators could select other case  outcomes that the automated system would apply predetermined  business rules to either reassign the cases (e.g., refusal, no one home) or  treat them as completed (verified vacant or not a housing unit).", "However, we identified multiple scenarios in which enumerators had  described cases in their case notes but for which the enumerators had  not selected the corresponding case flag for the situation that would have  resulted automatically in a supervisory review. One census field manager  described discovering several dozen cases that had been inactive where  enumerators had written case notes describing language barriers  encountered but had not specifically marked the flag within the device for  \u201clanguage barrier.\u201d Because these cases thus were not triggered for  supervisory review, they were eligible to be reassigned by the Bureau\u2019s  standard automated system. As a result, the Bureau was not controlling  for the requisite language skills in assigning the cases for subsequent  enumeration attempts.", "The Bureau\u2019s use of automated systems to apply business rules to  efficiently manage field casework for 2020\u2014including identifying which  cases receive supervisory review\u2014relies critically on field staff  understanding how to reflect what they are seeing on the ground within  the choices provided to them with which to flag cases in their interview  device. The Bureau\u2019s use of remote management as part of reengineered  field operations also relies on enumerators knowing when and how to  report issues to their supervisors.", "We observed multiple field scenarios that called these conditions into  question, however. For example, enumerators we observed during NRFU  told us that they indicated address listing issues in their case notes, such  as if the unit designation was missing or incorrectly marked. Yet, these  enumerators did not know how to flag such cases in their interview  instrument to trigger supervisory review. According to Bureau officials,  this type of address listing issue turned out to be a broadly experienced  challenge within the test area. Additionally, during Group Quarters, an  enumerator we observed received supplemental information about the  number of residents at a neighboring facility after that facility had been  enumerated. The enumerator made note of this discrepancy and included  the original facility\u2019s identifying information but was uncertain about how,  if at all, to alert the supervisor about the discrepancy.", "Moreover, we saw little evidence that census field supervisors or  managers were systematically reviewing case notes for the purpose of  identifying either cases not being marked properly or for which the  selected flags may not have been fully describing the case  characteristics. For example, a census field manager confirmed that case  notes recorded at Group Quarters facilities that were enumerated would  not be reviewed during clerical processing, leaving the possibility\u2014such  as we observed\u2014that if enumerators relied on case notes to  communicate information about the accuracy of data collected, it would  not be acted on. Bureau officials told us that reviewing all case notes  could require more staff time than budgeted for, and changing the  automation process to selectively present unflagged cases for  supervisory review could necessitate requirements changes to systems  whose development is already pressed for time.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agencies should use quality information by, for example, processing  reliable information to help it make informed decisions. Bureau  enumerators can record useful local knowledge about their cases with  their choice of case type flags and within their descriptive case notes.  While the Bureau has anticipated a broad range of types of cases for  enumerators to select from when documenting their casework,  enumerators we observed did not uniformly understand those options,  and the descriptors did not fully anticipate what enumerators were  encountering. Improving training and guidance to field staff on the  intended use of case notes and on alternative ways to communicate their  concerns about cases, such as flags for different types of cases, can help  ensure the Bureau has reliable data on the cases during its field  operations relying on automated interviewing instruments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leveraging Information on Enumerator-Reported Technical and Procedural Issues Remains a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["During the 2015 Census Test, we reported that certain technical and  procedural problems that enumerators were encountering in the field  were going unreported and that enumerators did not always know who to  contact for assistance.

The Bureau agreed with our recommendation.", "During the 2018 test, the Bureau had both an information technology (IT)  hotline and a census-field-supervisor hotline established for technical and  procedural questions, respectively. Yet, enumerators we observed told us  they did not always report to their support lines the technical issues that  they were easily able to resolve by, for example, turning their devices on  and off to reset. This lack of reporting kept the Bureau from getting  information on commonly-occurring challenges that might be useful real- time feedback in the testing environment. Moreover, a Bureau IT  manager noted that the Bureau does not formally review and share  observations and troubleshooting notes from IT hotline and census field  supervisor hotline calls. Because enumerators may call either or both  hotlines when having difficulty operating their Bureau-issued smart  phone, operators of these hotlines could be unaware of the prevalence of  or solutions to a given problem if the Bureau does not monitor  troubleshooting information across the two operational silos.

While determining staffing levels at these facilities can be  challenging, such overstaffing can lead to poor productivity and  unnecessarily high labor costs. We recommended that the Bureau  determine and address the factors that led to this overstaffing prior to  2020. The Bureau agreed with our recommendation.", "However, the Bureau has faced challenges determining the right staffing  ratios in light of complications with the Advance Contact phase of Group  Quarters. As previously noted, the Bureau used this phase to establish  facilities\u2019 enumeration method preferences. For the 2018 test, most Group  Quarters facilities selected the facility-provided paper listing and the  eResponse enumeration options. Therefore, the Bureau allocated a large  share of its enumerator and census field supervisor workforce in the test  area to the 44 known service-based enumeration facilities, which were  restricted in terms of the enumeration options they could select and  tended to select in-person enumeration. However, only 11 of these  facilities responded to initial inquiries, so the Bureau had less work than  anticipated for its enumerator crews. At multiple sites we observed in the  test area, enumerators appeared either idle or underutilized. Moreover,  several of the Group Quarters facilities we observed had changed their  initial choice of enumeration method on the day of enumeration.", "Enumerator crews thus ran the risk of either being overstaffed (in the  case of switching to a facility-provided paper listing) or understaffed (in  the case of switching to an in-person enumeration).", "The Bureau\u2019s Advance Contact activities have a potential benefit\u2014if the  Bureau can get accurate information on the method of enumeration and  approximate population within a facility ahead of time, Bureau managers  and enumerator crews can more proactively allocate resources and  prepare for the count.

Non-interviews are  cases where enumerators collect no data or insufficient data from  households either because enumerators made the maximum number of  visits without a successful interview, or because of special circumstances  like language barriers or dangerous situations. When this happens, the  Bureau may have to impute the census data for the case, such as  whether the housing unit is vacant or not, the population counts of the  households, or demographic characteristics of their residents. In January  2017, we reported that, during the 2016 Census Test, the Bureau  incurred what it considered high non-interview rates (31 and 22 percent  across the two test sites, respectively, as the Bureau preliminarily  reported at the time), and we recommended that the Bureau determine  the causes of these rates.", "Using the same method to calculate the rate of non-interviews for the test  as in 2016, the 2018 Census Test had similarly high non-interview rates\u2014 33 percent of all NRFU cases.

In our January 2017 report, we therefore  recommended that, as part of determining the causes of its non-interview  rate, the Bureau revise and test any needed changes to proxy procedures  and associated training.

Additionally, by not aligning the skills, responsibilities, and  information flows for census field supervisors, the Bureau limited their role  in support of enumerators within the reengineered field operation.
