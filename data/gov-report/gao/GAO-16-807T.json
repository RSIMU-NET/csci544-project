In an August 2015 report, GAO recommended that the two departments establish a time frame for identifying outcome-oriented metrics, define related goals as a basis for determining the extent to which the departments' systems are achieving interoperability, and update their guidance accordingly. Since that time, VA has established a performance architecture program that has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome-oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas and has begun to establish baseline measurements. GAO is continuing to monitor VA's and DOD's efforts to define metrics and report on the interoperability results achieved between the departments.", "Following an unsuccessful attempt to develop a joint system with DOD, VA switched tactics and moved forward with an effort to modernize its current system separately from DOD's planned acquisition of a commercially available electronic health record system. The department took this course of action even though, in May 2010, it identified 10 areas of health care business needs in common with those of DOD. Further, the results of a 2008 study pointed out that more than 97 percent of inpatient requirements for electronic health record systems are common to both departments. GAO noted that the departments' plans to separately modernize their systems were duplicative and recommended that their decisions should be justified by comparing the costs and schedules of alternate approaches. The departments agreed with GAO's recommendations and stated that their initial comparison indicated that separate systems would be more cost effective. However, the departments have not provided a comparison of the estimated costs of their current and previous approaches. Further, both departments developed schedules that indicated their separate modernization efforts will not be completed until after the 2017 planned completion date for the previous joint system approach.", "VA has developed a number of plans to support its development of its electronic health record system, called VistA, including a plan for interoperability and a road map describing functional capabilities to be deployed through fiscal year 2018. According to the road map, the first set of capabilities was delivered by the end of September 2014 and included a foundation for future functionality, such as an enhanced graphical user interface and enterprise messaging infrastructure. However, a recent independent assessment of health information technology (IT) at VA reported that lengthy delays in modernizing VistA had resulted in the system becoming outdated. Further, this study questioned whether the modernization program can overcome a variety of risks and technical issues that have plagued prior VA initiatives of similar size and complexity. Although VA's Under Secretary for Health has asserted that the department will complete the VistA Evolution program in fiscal year 2018, the Chief Information Officer has indicated that the department is reconsidering how best to meet its future electronic health record system needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In prior reports, GAO has made numerous recommendations to VA to improve the modernization of its IT systems.

Specifically, VistA is an integrated medical information system that was  developed in-house by the department\u2019s clinicians and information  technology (IT) personnel, and has been in operation since the early  1980s. The system consists of 104 separate computer applications,  including 56 health provider applications; 19 management and financial  applications; 8 registration, enrollment, and eligibility applications; 5  health data applications; and 3 information and education applications.  Within VistA, an application called the Computerized Patient Record  System enables the department to create and manage an individual  electronic health record for each VA patient.", "Electronic health records are particularly crucial for optimizing the health  care provided to veterans, many of whom may have health records  residing at multiple medical facilities within and outside the United States.  Taking these steps toward interoperability\u2014that is, collecting, storing,  retrieving, and transferring veterans\u2019 health records electronically\u2014is  significant to improving the quality and efficiency of care.

Table 1  summarizes a number of these key initiatives.", "In addition to the initiatives mentioned in table 1, VA has worked in  conjunction with DOD to respond to provisions in the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which required the departments  to jointly develop and implement fully interoperable electronic health  record systems or capabilities in 2009. Yet, even as the departments  undertook numerous interoperability and modernization initiatives, they  faced significant challenges and slow progress. For example, VA\u2019s and  DOD\u2019s success in identifying and implementing joint IT solutions has  been hindered by an inability to articulate explicit plans, goals, and time  frames for meeting their common health IT needs.", "In March 2011, the secretaries of VA and DOD announced that they  would develop a new, joint integrated electronic health record system  (referred to as iEHR). This was intended to replace the departments\u2019  separate systems with a single common system, thus sidestepping many  of the challenges they had previously encountered in trying to achieve  interoperability. However, in February 2013, about 2 years after initiating  iEHR, the secretaries announced that the departments were abandoning  plans to develop a joint system, due to concerns about the program\u2019s  cost, schedule, and ability to meet deadlines. The Interagency Program  Office (IPO), put in place to be accountable for VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s efforts to  achieve interoperability, reported spending about $564 million on iEHR  between October 2011 and June 2013.", "In light of VA and DOD not implementing a solution that allowed for the  seamless electronic sharing of health care data, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 included requirements pertaining  to the implementation, design, and planning for interoperability between  the departments\u2019 electronic health record systems. Among other actions,  provisions in the act directed each department to (1) ensure that all health  care data contained in their systems (VA\u2019s VistA and DOD\u2019s Armed  Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application, referred to as  AHLTA) complied with national standards and were computable in real  time by October 1, 2014; and (2) deploy modernized electronic health  record software to support clinicians while ensuring full standards-based  interoperability by December 31, 2016.", "In August 2015, we reported that VA, in conjunction with DOD, had  engaged in several near-term efforts focused on expanding  interoperability between their existing electronic health record systems.  For example, the departments had analyzed data related to 25 \u201cdomains\u201d  identified by the Interagency Clinical Informatics Board and mapped  health data in their existing systems to standards identified by the IPO.  The departments also had expanded the functionality of their Joint  Legacy Viewer\u2014a tool that allows clinicians to view certain health care  data from both departments in a single interface.", "More recently, in April 2016, VA and DOD certified that all health care  data in their systems complied with national standards and were  computable in real time. However, VA acknowledged that it did not expect  to complete a number of key activities related to its electronic health  record system until sometime after the December 31, 2016, statutory  deadline for deploying modernized electronic health record software with  interoperability.

Toward this end, the office issued guidance that identified a variety of  process-oriented metrics to be tracked, such as the percentage of health  data domains that have been mapped to national standards. The  guidance also identified metrics to be reported that relate to tracking the  amounts of certain types of data being exchanged between the  departments, using existing capabilities. This would include, for example,  laboratory reports transferred from DOD to VA via the Federal Health  Information Exchange and patient queries submitted by providers through  the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange.", "Nevertheless, in our August 2015 report, we noted that the IPO had not  specified outcome-oriented metrics and goals that could be used to  gauge the impact of the interoperable health record capabilities on the  departments\u2019 health care services.

Nevertheless, a modernized VA  electronic health record system that is fully interoperable with DOD\u2019s  system is still years away. Thus, important questions remain about when  VA intends to define the extent of interoperability it needs to provide the  highest possible quality of care to its patients, as well as how and when  the department intends to achieve this extent of interoperability with DOD.  In addition, VA\u2019s unsuccessful efforts over many years to modernize its  VistA system raise concern about how the department can continue to  justify the development and operation of an electronic health record  system that is separate from DOD\u2019s system, even though the  departments have common system needs.
