Fiscal year 2009's National Defense Authorization Act required GAO to report on the rationales, implications, and costs and benefits of defense contractors' use of offshore subsidiaries. We (1) assessed trends and purposes for contractors' offshore subsidiaries; (2) identified how contractors use subsidiaries to support defense contracts; (3) assessed DOD's oversight of contractors' use of offshore subsidiaries. To conduct our work, we reviewed data for the 29 U.S. publicly traded contractors with at least $1 billion in DOD spending in fiscal year 2008, reviewed several illustrative contracts selected based on categories of DOD services most often performed overseas, reviewed audit documents, and interviewed DOD officials about oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many of the top 29 U.S. publicly traded defense contractors--those with $1 billion or more in DOD contracts in fiscal year 2008--have created offshore subsidiaries to facilitate global operations. Between fiscal years 2003 and 2008, they increased their use of these subsidiaries by 26 percent, maintaining at least 1,194 in 2008. We interviewed 13 of the 29 contractors based on a range of the amount of government work, locations of subsidiaries, and industry types; they reported that 97 percent of the subsidiaries generally supported global commercial and foreign government clients, while the remaining 3 percent supported DOD contracts performed overseas. These subsidiaries also helped the 29 contractors reduce taxes, with about one-third decreasing their effective U.S. corporate tax rates in 2008 in part through the use of foreign affiliates, lower foreign tax rates, and indefinite reinvestment of foreign income outside of the United States. For five of the DOD contracts we reviewed, companies principally used offshore subsidiaries to hire U.S. workers providing services overseas on U.S. government contracts in order to avoid Social Security, Medicare--known as Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)--and other payroll taxes. This practice allowed contractors to offer lower bids when competing for certain services and thereby reduce costs for DOD. Our analysis of two contracts showed that the use of offshore subsidiaries saved DOD at least $110 million annually prior to the HEART Act, through payroll tax avoidance. While this practice provided contract cost savings for DOD, it resulted in these companies avoiding payroll taxes that would have contributed to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. The 2008 HEART Act resulted in offshore subsidiaries of U.S. companies paying FICA taxes for U.S. workers performing services overseas on U.S. government contracts. As a result, in fiscal year 2009, four of the case study contractors using offshore subsidiaries to support DOD work requested reimbursement from DOD of at least $140 million for new FICA payments. Federal and state unemployment payroll taxes, however, were not covered by the HEART Act, and several contractors that used offshore subsidiaries have continued to avoid these taxes. In one state, we reviewed documentation for about 140 former employees of several contractors who were denied unemployment benefits in 2009. State workforce officials indicated these benefits were denied because the employees worked for a foreign subsidiary and not an American employer. DOD officials were aware of the roles offshore subsidiaries played in the DOD contracts we reviewed and stated that oversight mechanisms, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency's reviews of incurred costs and oversight documents, inform them of the activities of offshore subsidiaries. In contracts we reviewed, evidence of offshore subsidiaries was present in contractor labor rates, cost accounting disclosures, and contractor price proposals.

From these 29 top defense contractors, we selected 13 to  interview based on a range of the amount of government work in fiscal  year 2008, location of identified subsidiaries, and industry type. In  addition, we interviewed three other defense contractors as part of the  case studies we conducted for a total of 16 contractors interviewed.

For each of these contracts, we reviewed data  on contractor performance and interviewed DOD oversight staff,  contracting commands, and company officials responsible for these  defense contracts. To determine whether contractors using offshore  subsidiaries selected for case studies were subject to payroll taxes,  including Social Security, Medicare, and federal and state unemployment  taxes for U.S. employees, we reviewed contract file documents for the  contractors and interviewed Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)  officials. As an illustrative example, we also selected one state, Texas, in  which four of the six selected contractors had a corporate presence, and  reviewed 2009 unemployment benefit claims data. We interviewed state  workforce officials to determine the impact on the ability of U.S.  personnel working overseas for offshore subsidiaries to claim  unemployment benefits.

U.S. and foreign tax regimes also influence  decisions of U.S. multinational corporations regarding how much to invest  and how many workers to employ in particular activities and in particular  locations. Tax rules also influence where corporations report earning  income for tax purposes.", "We have reported on the conditions under which a federal contractor in a  low-tax jurisdiction\u2014one that has no or nominal taxes and no requirement  for a substantive local presence\u2014may have a tax cost advantage when  competing for federal contracts. The extent of the advantage depends on  the relative tax liabilities of the contractor and its competitors. We also  previously reported that 63 of the 100 largest publicly traded federal  contractors in terms of fiscal year 2007 federal contract obligations  reported having subsidiaries in jurisdictions identified as tax haven or  financial privacy jurisdictions.", "Defense contractors may contain a number of separate legal entities. A  parent corporation may directly own, either wholly or partially, multiple  subsidiary corporations. In turn, these subsidiaries may own other  corporate subsidiaries, and any of these corporations may own stakes in  partnerships.

Employers withhold these taxes from employee\u2019s wages for Social  Security and Medicare and match the employee\u2019s contribution for these  taxes. Workers make contributions to Social Security through payroll  taxes that the Treasury credits to the Social Security Trust Fund. About 96  percent of the nation\u2019s workforce is in social security-covered employment  and pays tax on its annual earnings. When workers pay social security  taxes, they earn coverage credits, and 40 credits\u2014equal to at least 10 years  of work\u2014entitle them to social security benefits when they reach  retirement age. Different requirements govern the number of coverage  credits necessary to receive disability and survivors benefits for workers  who become disabled or die with relatively short work careers. Most  employers also pay both a federal and a state unemployment tax, which  provide unemployment compensation to workers who have lost their jobs.   Employees in most states do not contribute to unemployment taxes.", "DOD uses thousands of defense contractors to provide services ranging  from security details and interpreters to transportation and facility  management in support of U.S. forces in contingency operations around  the world.

DCAA, under the authority of the DOD Comptroller, plays a critical role in  contractor oversight by providing auditing, accounting, and financial  advisory services for DOD and other federal agency contracts.

Our analysis of SEC filings found that in 2008, 29 of the top  defense contractors\u2014accounting for 41 percent of DOD contracting  dollars in fiscal year 2008\u2014had at least 1,194 offshore subsidiaries. Of  the total offshore subsidiaries, about 200 were located in tax haven or  financial privacy jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Ireland, or  Luxembourg. Publicly traded defense contractors increased their  combined use of foreign subsidiaries by 26 percent from 2003 through  2008. Of these new subsidiaries, most were located in the United Kingdom  and Canada, while the largest rate of growth was in the British Virgin  Islands and Aruba. See table 1 for more information on the top 25 defense  contractor subsidiaries.", "According to 13 of the top defense contractors we interviewed, 718 of the  738 offshore subsidiaries\u2014or 97 percent\u2014that they reported to the SEC in  fiscal year 2008 were generally used to support global commercial clients,  and foreign government contracts rather than DOD contracts. In some  cases, contractors established offshore subsidiaries for market presence  and proximity to customers as they thought it was important to establish a  presence where they do business overseas to be more responsive to  customer needs. For example, one defense contractor established  subsidiaries in Singapore to assist with equipment manufacturing and  repairs of commercial aircraft operating throughout Asia because it is  more cost-efficient than sending the aircraft back to the United States for  repairs. Ten of the 13 defense contractors told us they establish or acquire  offshore subsidiaries to take advantage of foreign government markets. In  one case, a defense contractor explained that it created a subsidiary in the  Netherlands to hire local nationals in order to win a contract with the  Dutch government. Contractors also noted that, in certain circumstances,  they are required to create offshore subsidiaries to comply with foreign  government requirements. For example, one company told us it  established a subsidiary in Bahrain to comply with Bahrainian law for  doing business in that country. In another instance, one contractor said  that it registered as a local company in Iraq to conduct business in  compliance with Iraqi law.", "Aside from taking advantage of foreign government markets for  commercial work, a key benefit of using offshore subsidiaries cited by  contractors and other experts we spoke with was the ability to reduce  overall taxes. Several defense companies explained that the use of  offshore subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions helps them lower their U.S.  taxes. For example, one defense contractor\u2019s offshore subsidiary  structure decreased its effective U.S. tax rate by approximately 1 percent,  equaling millions of dollars in tax savings. Our review of 2008 SEC filings  for the 29 publicly traded defense companies found that approximately  one-third reported decreasing their 2008 effective U.S. tax rates through  the use of foreign affiliates, lower foreign tax rates, and indefinite  reinvestment of foreign income outside of the United States.", "Defense contractors also told us that creating subsidiaries, whether based  in the United States or offshore, protects U.S. parent companies from  certain legal liabilities, although company representatives said this was not  a primary reason for establishing offshore subsidiaries. For example,  defense companies and experts noted that subsidiary structures limit U.S.  parents from liabilities related to changes in foreign law and practices.  Defense contractors said an offshore subsidiary can be used to focus  liability in one place, thus shielding the rest of the company from potential  lawsuits because only the assets of the subsidiary would be susceptible.", "While almost all of the 738 offshore subsidiaries were used to support  commercial and foreign clients, 20\u2014about 3 percent\u2014were used to  support DOD contracts in fiscal year 2008. However, we do not know the  percentage of DOD contract dollars supporting activities of offshore  subsidiaries because contract data do not capture the use of offshore  subsidiaries specifically. Most of the 13 defense contractors we  interviewed directed work performed for DOD in a foreign country to a  company subsidiary in that country. For example, one defense  contractor\u2019s German subsidiary was the prime contractor for a facility  operations support services contract in Germany. Another contractor used  an Australian subsidiary to support a Navy research and development  contract performed in Australia. In contrast, we also identified some  defense contractors that used subsidiaries registered outside the place of  contract performance to support DOD service contracts abroad.

According to contractor officials, the practice used in the  cases we reviewed allowed the contractor to bid lower labor costs when  competing for labor-intensive DOD service contracts performed abroad.  Using offshore subsidiaries also permitted contractors to avoid other  payroll taxes, such as federal and state unemployment insurance. Before  the HEART Act took effect in August 2008, FICA tax payments were not  required for U.S. personnel working overseas on U.S. government  contracts for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.  Although this  practice resulted in contract cost savings for DOD, it meant that taxes  were not paid into the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds as they  would have been had the services been provided by U.S. personnel  employed by a domestic entity. Additionally, because these payments were  not made, employees did not receive coverage credits\u2014earned when  workers pay social security taxes\u2014for this work.", "DOD and defense contractor officials explained that the use of offshore  subsidiaries to hire U.S. workers to perform services overseas was a  practice used for labor-intensive service contracts, often for work  performed in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, because of  the potential for FICA cost savings. Four of the six contractors commonly  used offshore subsidiaries when hiring U.S. personnel to work on U.S.  government contracts beyond the contracts we reviewed. Defense  contractor officials explained that the need for security clearances for U.S.  personnel working on certain DOD contracts, as well export control  provisions, limit the types of defense work that can be conducted through  offshore subsidiaries. Typically, when contract functions required  personnel with security clearances, these personnel were hired through  the contractor\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, while personnel who did not require a  security clearance were hired though an offshore subsidiary. For one  contract task order we reviewed, more than 80 percent of the contractor\u2019s  staff were employed by its offshore subsidiary. See table 2 for information  on the six contracts selected for review.", "Three of the six DOD contractors used subsidiaries registered, but that did  not have any staff or business activity, in the Cayman Islands. Services  were provided in locations near the contract place of performance. For  example, one company used two Cayman Islands subsidiaries to hire and  pay employees for logistics support contracts performed in locations  around the world, including the Middle East. However, the subsidiaries\u2019  payroll processing work is conducted in Dubai. According to DOD, these  subsidiaries are registered in the Cayman Islands to avoid payroll taxes.  One company official explained that the Cayman Islands are a popular  choice for establishing offshore subsidiaries because of the ease with  which they can be registered due to local laws. Furthermore, employees of  Cayman Islands corporations do not pay taxes in that country. Figure 1  provides an example of how defense contractor subsidiaries were used to  hire and pay U.S. personnel for DOD work performed overseas prior to the  HEART Act.", "For five of the six cases we reviewed, DOD reduced contract costs as a  result of the use of offshore subsidiaries to provide payroll functions. Most  of the contracts were cost-reimbursement type contracts, which authorize  agencies to reimburse contractors for allowable costs to the extent  prescribed in the contract. Taxes are a type of allowable cost prescribed in  the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Consequently, if defense contractors  were required to pay taxes such as FICA or state and federal  unemployment insurance, DOD would usually reimburse these costs. Our  analysis of the two largest service contracts with a combined total of more  than $6 billion in fiscal year 2008 obligations indicates that DOD saved at  least $110 million per year by not having to provide reimbursement for  FICA taxes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HEART Act Resulted in Contractors Paying FICA Taxes and Impacted Use of Offshore Subsidiaries", "paragraphs": ["After the HEART Act took effect, defense contractors that were not paying  FICA taxes on U.S. personnel working on DOD contracts outside of the  United States began to submit requests for equitable adjustments to  recover their newly increased tax costs. For the four cost-reimbursement  contracts we reviewed that used an offshore subsidiary, the increased  costs were negotiated with DOD officials and were being processed as  contract modifications at the time of our review. DOD and company  officials stated that total contract costs have increased by approximately 8  to 10 percent in some cases due to both FICA tax payments and increased  contract award fees. As a result, in fiscal year 2009, four of the five  contractors using offshore subsidiaries to support DOD work requested  reimbursement of at least $140 million from DOD for new FICA payments  on the contracts we reviewed as well as some others.", "Several contractors stated that they initially used offshore subsidiaries to  hire U.S. workers to perform services overseas in order to offer  competitive prices when bidding for DOD contracts, and as this practice  grew, it became a competitive necessity. DOD officials said they did not  think that using an offshore subsidiary to avoid FICA taxes provided a  competitive advantage to companies since each competitor was free to  adopt the offshore structure if it chose. With the enactment of the HEART  Act, some defense companies have reconsidered the use of offshore  subsidiaries to hire U.S. workers. One contractor said it established a  subsidiary in 1993 to support a DOD logistics contract because, at that  time, company tax advisors proposed using offshore subsidiaries to  achieve cost savings that could be passed on to DOD. This contractor is  considering whether to continue using this subsidiary now that the cost  advantage from FICA tax savings has been removed. Another contractor  said that it had transferred U.S. personnel from its Cayman Islands  subsidiary to a U.S.-based subsidiary and is evaluating whether to close  the subsidiary. A third contractor said that the HEART Act removed the  cost advantage when hiring U.S. citizens and residents to perform work  overseas, but it still uses the subsidiary to manage foreign workers.", "Contractors noted that the requirement of the HEART Act that companies  hiring U.S. personnel overseas pay FICA taxes may have unintended  consequences, such as hiring fewer of these employees. Additionally, they  noted that foreign-based contractors now have a cost advantage in  competing for overseas DOD contracts because they are not required to  pay FICA taxes for their U.S. workers. Several company and DOD officials  also stated that a foreign subsidiary could continue to avoid FICA taxes if  the parent company changes its ownership stake in the foreign subsidiary  to 50 percent or less, which is below the ownership threshold defined in  the law. In fact, one defense contractor adopted this practice and sold 50  percent of its wholly owned subsidiary the day before the HEART Act took  effect in order for its foreign subsidiary to avoid paying FICA taxes for  U.S. workers performing DOD work abroad.

Of the six contracts  that met these selection criteria, three of the associated contractors were  among the 13 interviewed from the top 29 defense contractors. Table 4  lists the 16 DOD contractors interviewed.", "To assess the FPDS-NG data reliability for the contracts selected, we  corroborated the FPDS-NG data with DOD officials and the contract files.  We confirmed that contract information reported in FPDS-NG, including  the contract identification number, contract type, service provided,  contracted vendors, the contract place of performance, and the fiscal year  2008 dollars obligated were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To review DOD oversight and management of defense contractor\u2019s use of  offshore subsidiaries, for each of the six contracts selected, we reviewed  selected contract file documentation, including contracts and task orders,  price negotiation memorandums, requests for consent to subcontract, and  contractors\u2019 proposed pricing data. In addition, we reviewed relevant  Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit reports and documentation.  We also reviewed available guidance from contracting commands and  estimates related to implementing the Heroes Earnings Assistance and  Relief Tax (HEART) Act of 2008 and interviewed cognizant DOD officials,  including contracting officers, DCAA and Defense Contract Management  Agency (DCMA) where delegated, as well as the contractors. We reviewed  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense FAR  Supplement to identify any requirements regarding DOD contractors\u2019 use  of offshore subsidiaries as well as Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and  reviewed DOD\u2019s public comments on the CAS Board\u2019s review of the CAS  exemption for contracts performed entirely overseas.", "To determine whether contractors using offshore subsidiaries selected for  case studies owed payroll taxes, we reviewed contract file documents for  the contractors and interviewed DCAA officials. With regard to state and  federal unemployment taxes, we analyzed contractor proposed labor rate  information in 2009 to determine the amount of state and federal  unemployment tax that was avoided on DOD contracts through the use of  offshore subsidiaries. We also selected one state, Texas, in which four of  the six selected contractors had a corporate presence as an illustrative  example. We reviewed data and interviewed the state\u2019s workforce officials  to determine whether employees of those companies were denied  unemployment benefits in 2009 because the employees were hired through  a company\u2019s offshore subsidiary. We assessed the reliability of the state  unemployment data and determined it was sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. In addition, we reviewed guidance and interviewed Department  of Labor officials about federal and state unemployment insurance  eligibility requirements.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 through January  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["International Taxation: Large U.S. Corporations and Federal  Contractors with Subsidiaries in Jurisdictions Listed as Tax Havens or  Financial Privacy Jurisdictions.
