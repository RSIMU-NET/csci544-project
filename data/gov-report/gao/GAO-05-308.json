Information technology (IT) is central to strengthening the public health infrastructure through the implementation of systems to aid in the detection, preparation for, and response to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. Congress asked us to review the current status of major federal IT initiatives aimed at strengthening the ability of government at all levels to respond to public health emergencies.

These initiatives include one broad initiative at CDC--the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) initiative--which is intended to provide the nation with integrated public health information systems to counter national civilian public health threats, and two major initiatives at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which are primarily focused on biosurveillance. CDC's broad PHIN initiative encompasses a number of applications and initiatives, which show varied progress. Currently, PHIN's basic communications systems are in place, but it is unclear when its surveillance systems and data exchange applications will become fully deployed. Further, the overall implementation of PHIN does not yet provide the desired functionality, and so some applications are not widely used by state and local public health officials. For example, CDC's BioSense application, which is aimed at detecting early signs of disease outbreaks, is available to state and local public health agencies, but according to the state and local officials with whom we spoke, it is not widely used, primarily because of limitations in the data it currently collects. DHS is also pursuing two major public health IT initiatives--the National Biosurveillance Integration System and the Biological Warning and Incident Characterization System (BWICS). Both of these initiatives are still in development. The BWICS initiative, in addition, is associated with three other programs, one of which--BioWatch--is operational. This early- warning environmental monitoring system was developed for detecting trace amounts of biological materials and has been deployed in over 30 locations across the United States. Until recently, its three IT components were not interoperable and required redundant data entry in order to communicate with each other. As federal agencies work with state and local public health agencies to improve the public health infrastructure, they face several challenges. First, the national health IT strategy and federal health architecture are still being developed; CDC and DHS will face challenges in integrating their public health IT initiatives into these ongoing efforts. Second, although federal efforts continue to promote the adoption of data standards, developing such standards and then implementing them are challenges for the health care community. Third, these initiatives involve the need to coordinate among federal, state, and local public health agencies, but establishing effective coordination among the large number of disparate agencies is a major undertaking. Finally, CDC and DHS face challenges in addressing specific weaknesses in IT planning and management that may hinder progress in developing and deploying public health IT initiatives. Until all these challenges are addressed, progress toward building a stronger public health infrastructure will be impeded, as will the ability to share essential information concerning public health emergencies and bioterrorism."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It has been almost 4 years since the anthrax events of October 2001  highlighted the weaknesses in our nation\u2019s public health infrastructure.

For  example, it calls for steps to improve the nation\u2019s preparedness for  bioterrorism and other public health emergencies by increasing  coordination and planning for such events; developing priority  countermeasures; and improving state, local, and hospital preparedness  and response. The Secretary of HHS is required to provide for the  establishment of an integrated system or systems of public health alert  communications and surveillance networks among (1) federal, state, and  local public health officials; (2) public and private health-related  laboratories, hospitals, and other health care facilities; and (3) any other  entities that the Secretary determines are appropriate. These networks are  to allow for secure and timely sharing and discussion of essential  information concerning bioterrorism and other public health emergencies,  as well as recommended methods for responding to such an attack or  emergency. In addition, no later than 1 year after the enactment of the law,  the Secretary, in cooperation with health care providers and state and local  public health officials, was to establish any additional technical and  reporting standards, including those for network interoperability.", "Since fiscal year 2002, HHS has funded over $2.7 billion for public health  preparedness efforts through grants administered by CDC and just over $1  billion for hospital preparedness grants administered by the Health  Resources and Services Administration. To encourage the integration of  health care system response plans with public health department plans,  HHS has incorporated both public health preparedness and hospital  performance goals into the agreements that the department uses to fund  state and local public health preparedness improvements. The funding  guidance provided by HHS to state and local governments calls for  improvements in seven key areas:  preparedness planning and readiness assessment,  surveillance and epidemiology capacity,  laboratory capacity for handling biological agents,  laboratory capacity for handling chemical agents,  health alert network/communication and IT,  risk communication and health information dissemination, and  education and training.", "Over the past year, federal actions to encourage the use of IT for health  care delivery and public health have been accelerated. In April 2004, the  President established the goal that health records for most Americans  should be electronic within 10 years and issued an executive order to  \u201cprovide leadership for the development and nationwide implementation of  an interoperable health information technology infrastructure to improve  the quality and efficiency of health care.\u201d As part of this effort, the  President tasked the Secretary of HHS to appoint a National Coordinator  for Health Information Technology\u2014which he subsequently did 1 week  later. The President\u2019s executive order called for the Coordinator to develop  a strategic plan to guide the implementation of interoperable health IT in  the public and private health care sectors. In July 2004, HHS issued a framework for strategic action that includes four broad goals; goal four of  that framework is directed at improvements in public health.", "Further, DHS released the National Response Plan this past January, under  which HHS is to continue to lead the federal government in providing  public health and medical services during major disasters and emergencies.  In this role, HHS is to coordinate all federal resources related to public  health and medical services that are made available to assist state, local,  and tribal officials during a major disaster or emergency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Role of IT in Public Health Preparedness and Response", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in May 2003, IT can play an essential role in supporting  federal, state, local, and tribal governments in public health preparedness  and response. Development of IT can build upon the existing systems  capabilities of state and local public health agencies, not only to provide  routine public health functions, but also to support public health  emergencies, including bioterrorism. In addition, according to the Institute  of Medicine, the rapid development of new IT offers the potential for  greatly improved surveillance capacity. Finally, for public health  emergencies in particular, the ability to quickly exchange data between  providers and public health agencies\u2014or among providers\u2014is crucial in  detecting and responding to naturally occurring or intentional disease  outbreaks.", "Because of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of public health  emergencies, various types of IT systems may be used during the course of  an event. These include   surveillance systems, which facilitate the performance of ongoing  collection, analysis, and interpretation of disease-related and  environmental data so that responders and decision makers can plan,  implement, and evaluate public health actions (these systems include  devices to collect and identify biological agents from environmental  samples, and they make use of IT to record and transmit data); and  communications systems, which facilitate the secure and timely  exchange of information to the relevant responders and decision  makers so that appropriate action can be taken.", "Other types of IT may also be used, such as diagnostic systems, which  identify particular pathogens and those that include data from food, water,  and animal testing, but such systems are not among the major federal  public health IT initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Roles in Surveillance and Communications", "paragraphs": ["Although state health departments have primary responsibility for disease  surveillance in the United States, total responsibility for surveillance is  shared among health care providers: more than 3,000 local county, city, and  tribal health departments; 59 state and territorial health departments; more  than 180,000 public and private laboratories; and public health officials  from multiple federal agencies. In addition, the United States is a member  of the World Health Organization, which is responsible for coordinating  international disease surveillance and response actions.", "While health care providers are responsible for the medical diagnosis and  treatment of their individual patients, they also have a responsibility to  protect public health\u2014a responsibility that includes helping to identify and  prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Because health care providers  are typically the first health officials to encounter cases of infectious  diseases\u2014and have the opportunity to diagnose them\u2014these professionals  play an important role in disease surveillance. Generally, state laws or  regulations require health care providers to report confirmed or suspected  cases of notifiable diseases to their state or local health department.  States publish lists of the diseases they consider notifiable and therefore  subject to reporting requirements. According to the Institute of Medicine,  most states also require health care providers to report any unusual  illnesses or deaths, especially those for which a cause cannot be readily  established. However, according to CDC, despite state laws requiring the  reporting of notifiable diseases, a significant proportion of these cases are  not reported, which is a major challenge in public health surveillance.", "Health care providers rely on a variety of public and private laboratories to  help them diagnose cases of notifiable diseases. In some cases, only  laboratory results can definitively identify pathogens. Every state has at  least one public health laboratory to support its infectious diseases  surveillance activities and other public health programs. State laboratories  conduct testing for routine surveillance or as part of clinical or  epidemiologic studies. For rare or unusual pathogens, these laboratories  provide diagnostic tests that are not always available in commercial  laboratories. State public health laboratories also provide specialized  testing for low-incidence but high-risk diseases such as tuberculosis and  botulism. Results from state public health laboratories are used by  epidemiologists to document trends and identify events that may indicate  an emerging problem. Upon diagnosing a case involving a notifiable  disease, local health care providers are required to send the reports to state  health departments through state and local disease-reporting systems,  which range from paper-based reporting to secure, Internet-based  systems.", "States, through their state and local health departments, have principal  responsibility for protecting the public\u2019s health and therefore take the lead  in conducting disease surveillance and supporting response efforts.  Generally, local health departments are responsible for conducting initial  investigations into reports of infectious diseases, employing  epidemiologists, physicians, nurses, and other professionals. Local health  departments are also responsible for sharing information that they obtain  from providers or other sources with the state department of health. State  health departments are responsible for collecting surveillance information  statewide, coordinating investigations and response activities, and  voluntarily sharing surveillance data with CDC and others. States vary in  their requirements governing who should report notifiable diseases; in  addition, the deadlines for reporting these diseases after they have been  diagnosed vary by disease. State health officials conduct their own  analyses of disease data to verify cases, monitor the incidence of diseases,  and identify possible outbreaks.", "In reporting their notifiable disease data to CDC, states use multiple and  sometimes duplicative systems. States are not legally required to report  information on notifiable diseases to CDC, but CDC officials explained that  the agency makes such reporting from the states a prerequisite for  receiving certain types of CDC funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Role in Surveillance and Communications", "paragraphs": ["Generally, the federal government\u2019s role in disease surveillance is to collect  and analyze national disease surveillance data and maintain disease  surveillance systems. Federal agencies investigate the causes of infectious  diseases and maintain their own laboratory facilities. They also use  communications systems to share disease surveillance information. In  addition, federal agencies provide funding and technical expertise to  support disease surveillance at the state, local, and international levels.", "Federal agencies such as CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and  DOD conduct disease surveillance using systems that gather data from  various locations throughout the country to monitor the incidence of  infectious diseases. In addition to using surveillance systems to collect and  analyze notifiable disease data reported by states, federal agencies use  other surveillance systems to collect data on different diseases or from  other sources (e.g., international sources). These systems supplement the  state data on notifiable diseases by monitoring surveillance information  that states do not collect.", "In general, surveillance systems are distinguished from one another by the  types of infectious diseases or syndromes they monitor and the sources  from which they collect data. Some disease surveillance systems rely on  groups of selected health care providers who have agreed to routinely  supply information from clinical settings on targeted diseases. A relatively  new type of surveillance system, known as a syndromic surveillance  system, monitors the frequency and distribution of health-related  symptoms\u2014or syndromes\u2014among people within a specific geographic  area. These syndromic surveillance systems are designed to detect  anomalous increases in certain syndromes, such as skin rashes, that may  indicate the beginning of an infectious disease outbreak. Some monitor  data from hospital and emergency room admissions or data from over-the- counter drug sales. Other data sources may include poison control centers,  health plan medical records, first-aid stations, emergency medical service  data, insurer claims, and discharge diagnosis information. For syndromic  data to be analyzed effectively, information must be timely, and the analysis  must take into account the context of the locality from which the data were  generated.", "Because syndromic surveillance systems monitor symptoms and other  signs of disease outbreaks instead of waiting for clinically confirmed  reports or diagnoses of a disease, some experts believe that syndromic  surveillance systems could help public health officials increase the speed  with which they may identify outbreaks. However, as we reported last  September, syndromic surveillance systems are relatively costly to  maintain compared with other types of disease surveillance and are still  largely untested."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major CDC and DHS Public Health IT Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Two federal agencies are involved in major public health IT initiatives that  focus on disease surveillance and communications.", "CDC, one of HHS\u2019s divisions, has primary responsibility for conducting  national disease surveillance and developing epidemiological and  laboratory tools to enhance surveillance of disease, including public  health emergencies.

Among other things, we stated that HHS should set  priorities for information systems, supporting technologies, and other IT  initiatives. Since then, HHS appointed a National Coordinator for Health IT  in May 2004 and issued a framework for strategic action in July 2004. This  framework is a first step in the development of a national health IT  strategy. Goal four of the framework is directed at improvements in public  health and states that these improvements require the collection of timely,  accurate, and detailed clinical information to allow for the evaluation of  health care delivery and the reporting of critical findings to public health  officials. Two of the strategies outlined by HHS are aimed at achieving this  goal: (1) unifying public health surveillance architectures to allow for the  exchange of information among health care organizations, organizations  they contract with, and state and federal agencies and (2) streamlining  quality and health status monitoring to allow for a more complete look at  quality and other issues in real time and at the point of care. The  framework for strategic action states that the key challenge in harmonizing  surveillance architectures is to identify solutions that meet the reporting  needs of each surveillance function, yet work in a single integrated, cost- effective architecture.", "Like the national health care IT strategy, the federal health architecture is  still evolving, according to HHS officials in the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health IT. Initially targeting standards for enabling  interoperability, the federal health architecture is intended to provide a  structure for bringing HHS\u2019s divisions and other federal agencies together.  As part of achieving HHS\u2019s public health goal of unifying public health  surveillance architectures, the federal health architecture program  established a work group on public health surveillance that is responsible  for recommending a target architecture related to disease surveillance to  serve as the framework within the federal sector for developing and  implementing public health surveillance systems. The newly formed work  group, chaired by CDC and the Department of Veterans Affairs, met for the  first time in December 2004. Because the new work group is so recently  formed, plans are still being developed to address how CDC\u2019s PHIN  initiative and DHS\u2019s IT initiatives will integrate with the national health IT  strategy, such as plans to establish regional health information  organizations.", "In the absence of a completed strategy for public health surveillance  efforts, state and local public health officials have raised concerns about  duplication of effort across federal agencies. Some of the surveillance  initiatives in our review address similar functionality and may duplicate  ongoing efforts at other federal, state, and local agencies: for example, the  use and development of syndromic surveillance systems. CDC is  implementing BioSense at the national level, DHS is assisting local public  health agencies in implementing local syndromic surveillance systems such  as ESSENCE or RODS as part of its biosurveillance initiatives, and many  state and local public health agencies have their own ongoing syndromic  surveillance systems. As we have reported, syndromic surveillance systems  are relatively costly to maintain compared with other types of disease  surveillance and are still largely untested. According to HHS, with regard  to BioSense, the agency is taking steps to mitigate costs and risk.", "State and local public health officials also expressed concern about the  federal government\u2019s ability to conduct syndromic surveillance, because  they see this type of surveillance as an inherently local function.  Furthermore, last year the Council of State and Territorial  Epidemiologists reported that while state health departments are given  some guidance and leeway to use federal funding to enhance and develop  their own disease surveillance activities, no focused mechanism has been  established for states to share ideas and experiences with each other and  with CDC to determine what has or has not worked, and what efforts are  feasible and worth expanding. The Council recommended that to enhance  bioterrorism-related surveillance objectives, HHS and CDC form a  bioterrorism surveillance initiative steering committee to review current  federal surveillance initiatives affecting state and local health departments;  to review state-developed surveillance systems; and to recommend  surveillance priorities for continuation of funding, further development, or  implementation. HHS and CDC have taken steps to respond to these  recommendations, but according to the Council, it is not yet satisfied that  HHS and CDC have fully addressed its concerns.", "While HHS and other key federal agencies are organizing themselves to  develop a strategy for public health surveillance and interoperability,  decisions regarding development and implementation are being made now  without the benefit of an accepted national health IT strategy that  integrates public health surveillance-related initiatives. In the case of  BioSense, these decisions affect the spending of about $50 million this  fiscal year and an unknown amount in future years.

Currently, no formal mechanisms are in place  to ensure coordination and consensus among these initiatives at the  national level. HHS officials agree that leadership and direction are still  needed to coordinate the various standards-setting initiatives and to ensure  consistent implementation of standards for health care delivery and public  health. Within the federal health architecture structure, the Consolidated  Health Informatics initiative is focused on the adoption of data and  communication standards to be used by federal agencies to achieve  interoperability of IT within health IT initiatives. In March 2003, the  Consolidated Health Informatics initiative announced the adoption of 5  standards, and in May 2004, it announced the adoption of another 15  standards. Some of these standards are included as PHIN standards.", "As of March 1, 2005, CDC has adopted several industry standards and  published specifications for PHIN; these standards are grouped by type in  table 9.", "CDC has also initiated a PHIN certification process for its partners (e.g.,  state and local public health agencies), which is intended to establish  whether state and local systems can meet standards for the PHIN  preparedness functional areas. In the future, CDC plans to require system  owners to first perform self-assessment reviews to ensure that systems  meet PHIN standards, followed by reviews by CDC certification teams to  confirm PHIN compatibility. To be functionally compatible, systems must  be capable of supporting the standards outlined for each PHIN functional  area; accordingly, partners must demonstrate that their systems have this  capability.", "In general, state and local public health officials consider the PHIN  initiative to be a good framework for organizing the necessary standards  for public health interoperability. Most of the state and local officials we  spoke with agreed that CDC has done a commendable job of adopting and  promoting standards for IT in selected programs. In addition, they agreed  that CDC should continue to take a leadership role in pressing for industry  standards and providing guidance to states and local entities. However,  several officials stated that CDC should focus more of its attention on  setting standards and less on developing software applications, which  generally do not meet their needs and are not compatible with their specific  IT environments.

For example, most participating local government  agencies and state public health laboratories were told to implement the  BioWatch initiative in their metropolitan areas and were given the  procedures and software to use for sample management and data  collection. According to some public health officials, BioWatch was  implemented without a plan for how states and localities would respond to  a positive test result, and they were left to develop a response plan after  BioWatch had been deployed. One metropolitan area did not implement  BioWatch for a year after it became operational, because officials did not  have a response plan in place and did not want to be responsible for  responding to a potential incident without a plan for handling positive test  results. According to DHS officials, since local officials had received funds  for emergency preparedness, it was their understanding that BioWatch  locations had response plans in place; DHS officials have since developed a  methodology to target funds for specific purposes, such as response plans.", "CDC has been challenged by the need to coordinate with a diverse range of  state and local public health agencies. For example, CDC has found that it  is difficult to implement \u201cstandard\u201d systems that would address the full  range of different needs and levels of IT resources available at the state  level. HHS officials told us that the agency strives to address this challenge  by developing applications that are based on industry standards. It also  provides the standards and specifications to state and local agencies so  that they can build or purchase their own systems that can conform to  PHIN standards. Nonetheless, there was consensus among many of the  state and local officials in our review that federal agencies did not obtain  adequate input from state and local officials. A few state officials with  whom we spoke said that CDC does not appropriately consider their need  to comply with existing state IT architectures. In addition, in an informal e-mail survey, a small group of state chief information officers agreed that  federal agencies do not take into consideration state IT architectures.  According to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, no  mechanism has yet been established for state and federal partners to  collaboratively review initiatives developed over the past 3 years and plan  for the future. Instead, the approach to system design and implementation  remains top-down, mainly focused on expanding federally designed  syndromic surveillance for early outbreak detection without critical review  of its usefulness and cost and without systematic review of state-originated  systems and needs. The result is that public health responders may not buy  in to and use the federally designed systems, potentially constructive state- originated ideas may not get recognition and wider application, and  national bioterrorism-related surveillance will be suboptimal. According to  CDC, as part of its efforts to obtain state and local input, it hosts an annual  PHIN conference and holds meetings with business partner organizations,  such as a recent series of meetings on PHIN preparedness requirements  with selected state and local officials. In addition, under CDC\u2019s new  organizational structure, the new National Center for Public Health  Informatics has a division for communications and collaboration with its  partners.", "Further, CDC and DHS have coordinated with each other on specific  projects, but that coordination has not been optimal, according to officials  from both agencies.

Because PHIN and some of its initiatives (i.e., BioSense, NEDSS, the Health  Alert Network, and NEPHTN) are considered major investments for fiscal  year 2006, they required review by HHS. The HHS IT Investment Review  Board conducted budgetary reviews for these applications in June 2004 and  recommended that the projects move forward as major IT investments;  however, there is no documentation that additional HHS reviews were  conducted on PHIN and its major applications until this past February,  when HHS began implementing procedures for better monitoring of system  development projects. In January 2004, CDC announced its intention to  provide greater executive level oversight of IT investments, but it had been  reorganizing and did not begin conducting control reviews for major PHIN  investments until recently. In May 2004, CDC announced its new center for  public health informatics to better coordinate IT projects; this center was  formally recognized as operational as of mid-April 2005 when Congress  approved CDC\u2019s reorganization.

For some of the projects in this review,  we received limited documentation of project managers\u2019 tracking actual  dates against baseline schedules, and it appeared that a number of projects  had missed internal schedule dates. In November 2004, CDC started  requiring project managers to provide status reports to its program  management activity office on a biweekly basis.

We agree with HHS that the cost benefits of a standards-based  approach to public health systems are potentially considerable.  However, as we have reported before, the Center for Information  Technology Leadership acknowledges that their cost estimates are  based on a number of assumptions and inhibited by limited data that  are neither complete nor precise.  2. We agree with HHS that standards-based systems provide important  benefits. In our May 2003 report, we made several recommendations  regarding the establishment and use of standards that are highlighted in  this report. We also state that to support the compatibility,  interoperability, and security of federal agencies\u2019 many planned and  operational IT systems, the identification and implementation of data,  communications, and security standards for health care delivery and  public health are essential.  3. HHS states that our report does not mention a number of activities  related to the Federal Health Architecture and the Consolidated Health  Informatics initiative. We described the status of workgroup efforts  specific to public health surveillance. In terms of the standards adopted  by the Consolidated Health Informatics initiative, we presented the  relevant standards in our table of industry standards used by the Public  Health Information Network. We disagree with HHS that the paragraph  needs to be revised. While the development of standards and policies is  a key component of progress toward the implementation of a national  health IT strategy, the development of a national strategy and  corresponding federal architecture is equally important. 4. We disagree with HHS that we should delete our discussion of the  concerns of state and local public health officials regarding duplication  of effort across federal agencies. Neither we nor the state and local  public health officials suggest that early event detection at the federal  level is irrelevant. Rather, we are reporting the concerns of state and  local public health officials regarding the federal government\u2019s role,  which merits further discussion and more involvement of state and  local health officials. 5. We have adjusted our report to indicate that fiscal year 2006 costs for  BioSense are unknown. 6. HHS comments that not moving forward with its technology initiatives  presents greater risk than waiting for a completed national health IT  strategy. We are not suggesting that HHS stop its ongoing activities; we  only point out the risks associated with developing and implementing  major IT initiatives without a coordinated strategy in place."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comment from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["The following is GAO\u2019s comment on the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s letter dated June 3, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comment", "paragraphs": ["1.
