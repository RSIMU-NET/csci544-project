The departments have recognized the importance of developing capabilities for sharing electronic patient health information and have worked since 1998 to develop such capabilities. In February 2011, VA and DOD initiated a program to develop a single, common electronic health record system\u2014iEHR\u2014to replace their existing health record systems. This program was to be managed by the IPO and implemented by 2017. However, the departments made significant changes to the program in 2013. GAO was asked to review the iEHR program.

Specifically, in February 2013, the secretaries cited challenges in the cost and schedule for developing the single, integrated system and announced that each department would focus instead on either building or acquiring similar core sets of electronic health record capabilities, then ensuring interoperability between them. However, VA and DOD have not substantiated their claims that the current approach will be less expensive and more timely than the single-system approach. Major investment decisions\u2014including terminating or significantly restructuring an ongoing program\u2014should be justified using analyses that compare the costs and schedules of alternative proposals. Yet, the departments have not developed revised cost and schedule estimates for their new modernization efforts and any additional efforts needed to achieve interoperability between the new systems, and compared them with the relevant estimates for their former approach. In the absence of such a comparison, VA and DOD lack assurance that they are pursuing the most cost-effective and timely course of action for delivering the fully interoperable electronic health record the departments have long pursued to provide the best possible care for service members and veterans.", "The departments have initiated their separate system efforts. VA intends to deploy clinical capabilities of its new system at two locations by September 2014, and DOD has set a goal of beginning deployment of its new system by the end of fiscal year 2016. However, the departments have yet to update their joint strategic plan to reflect the new approach or to disclose what the interoperable electronic health record will consist of, as well as how, when, and at what cost it will be achieved. Without plans that include the scope, lines of responsibility, resource requirements, and an estimated schedule for achieving an interoperable health record, VA, DOD, and their stakeholders may not have a shared understanding of how the departments intend to address their common health care business needs.", "VA and DOD have not addressed management barriers to effective collaboration on their joint health information technology (IT) efforts. As GAO previously reported, the departments faced barriers to effective collaboration in the areas of enterprise architecture and IT investment management, among others. However, they have yet to address these barriers by, for example, developing a joint health care architecture or a joint IT investment management process to guide their collaboration. Further, the Interagency Program Office (IPO), established by law to act as a single point of accountability for the departments' development of interoperable health records, was to better position the departments to collaborate; but the departments have not implemented the IPO in a manner consistent with effective collaboration. For example, the IPO lacks effective control over essential resources such as funding and staffing. In addition, recent decisions by the departments have diffused responsibility for achieving integrated health records, potentially undermining the IPO's intended role as the point of accountability. Providing the IPO with control over essential resources and clearer lines of authority would better position it for effective collaboration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA and DOD develop and compare the estimated cost and schedule of their current and previous approaches to creating an interoperable electronic health record and, if applicable, provide a rationale for pursuing a more costly or time-consuming approach.

Electronic health records  are an essential part of delivering quality care to veterans and service  members\u2014especially the 5 million shared patients\u2014that is, those who  receive health care and services from both departments.", "Both VA and DOD have long recognized the importance of advancing the  use of shared health information systems and capabilities to make patient  information more readily available to their health care providers, reduce  medical errors, and streamline administrative functions. Toward this end,  in February 2011, the departments initiated a program to jointly develop a  single electronic health record system, known as the integrated Electronic  Health Record (iEHR), which was to replace the two departments\u2019  existing electronic health record systems. The DOD/VA Interagency  Program Office (IPO) was given responsibility for managing the iEHR  program. More recently, however, the departments have made significant  changes to the direction of the program.", "At your request, we conducted a review of the iEHR program.  Specifically, our objectives were to (1) describe the changes VA and DOD  have made to the iEHR program since its inception and evaluate the  departments\u2019 current plans for the program and (2) determine whether the  departments, including the IPO, are effectively collaborating on  management of the iEHR program.", "To accomplish the objectives, we reviewed relevant program  documentation and interviewed appropriate VA, DOD, and IPO officials.

Historically, patient health information has been scattered  across paper records kept by many different caregivers in many different  locations, making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a patient\u2019s  health information at the time of care. Lacking access to these critical  data, a clinician may be challenged to make the most informed decisions  on treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at greater  risk. The use of electronic health records can help provide this access  and improve clinical decisions.", "Electronic health records are particularly crucial for optimizing the health  care provided to military personnel and veterans. While in military status  and later as veterans, many VA and DOD patients tend to be highly  mobile and may have health records residing at multiple medical facilities  within and outside the United States. Making such records electronic can  help ensure that complete health care information is available for most  military service members and veterans at the time and place of care, no  matter where it originates.", "Although they have identified many common health care business needs,  both departments have spent large sums of money to develop and  operate separate electronic health record systems that they rely on to  create and manage patient health information. VA uses its integrated  medical information system\u2014the Veterans Health Information Systems  and Technology Architecture (VistA)\u2014which was developed in-house by  VA clinicians and IT personnel. The system consists of 104 separate  computer applications, including 56 health provider applications; 19  management and financial applications; 8 registration, enrollment, and  eligibility applications; 5 health data applications; and 3 information and  education applications. Besides being numerous, these applications have  been customized at all 128 VA sites. According to the department, this  customization increases the cost of maintaining the system, as it requires  that maintenance also be customized.", "In 2001, the Veterans Health Administration undertook an initiative to  modernize VistA by standardizing patient data and modernizing the health  information software applications. In doing so, its goal was to move from  the hospital-centric environment that had long characterized the  department\u2019s health care operations to a veteran-centric environment built  on an open, robust systems architecture that would more efficiently  provide both the same functions and benefits of the existing system and  enhanced functions based on computable data. VA planned to take an  incremental approach to the initiative, based on six phases that were to  be completed in 2018. The department reported spending almost $600  million from 2001 to 2007 on eight projects, including an effort that  resulted in a repository containing selected standardized health data, as  part of the effort to modernize VistA. In April 2008, the department  estimated an $11 billion total cost to complete, by 2018, the  modernization that was planned at that time. However, according to VA  officials, the modernization effort was terminated in August 2010.", "For its part, DOD relies on its Armed Forces Health Longitudinal  Technology Application (AHLTA), which comprises multiple legacy  medical information systems that the department developed from  commercial software products that were customized for specific uses. For  example, the Composite Health Care System (CHCS), which was  formerly DOD\u2019s primary health information system, is still in use to  capture information related to pharmacy, radiology, and laboratory order  management. In addition, the department uses Essentris (also called the  Clinical Information System), a commercial health information system  customized to support inpatient treatment at military medical facilities.  DOD obligated approximately $2 billion for AHLTA between 1997 and  2010. The department initiated efforts to improve system performance  and enhance functionality and planned to continue its efforts to stabilize  the AHLTA system through 2015 as a \u201cbridge\u201d to the new electronic  health record system it intended to acquire. According to DOD, the  planned new electronic health record system\u2014known as the EHR Way  Ahead\u2014was to be the department\u2019s comprehensive, real-time health  record for service members and their families and beneficiaries. In  January 2010, the department initiated an analysis of alternatives for  meeting system capability requirements it had identified.", "A key goal for sharing health information among providers, such as  between VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s health care systems, is achieving  interoperability. Interoperability enables different information systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information that has  been exchanged. Interoperability can be achieved at different levels. At  the highest level, electronic data are computable (that is, in a format that  a computer can understand and act to, for example, provide alerts to  clinicians on drug allergies). At a lower level, electronic data are  structured and viewable, but not computable. The value of data at this  level is that they are structured so that data of interest to users are easier  to find. At a still lower level, electronic data are unstructured and  viewable, but not computable. With unstructured electronic data, a user  would have to find needed or relevant information by searching  uncategorized data. Beyond these, paper records can also be considered  interoperable (at the lowest level) because they allow data to be shared,  read, and interpreted by human beings. However, they do not provide  decision support capabilities, such as automatic alerts about a particular  patient\u2019s health, or other reported advantages of automation. We have  previously reported that all data may not require the same level of  interoperability, nor is interoperability at the highest level achievable in all  cases. For example, unstructured, viewable data may be sufficient for  such narrative information as clinical notes.", "Interoperability allows patients\u2019 electronic health information to move with  them from provider to provider, regardless of where the information  originated. If electronic health records conform to interoperability  standards, they can be created, managed, and consulted by authorized  clinicians and staff across more than one health care organization, thus  providing patients and their caregivers the necessary information required  for optimal care. Interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon  standards to ensure that information can be shared and used.

The interface was expected to compile requested patient health  information in a temporary, \u201cvirtual\u201d record that could be displayed on a  user\u2019s computer screen. However, in reporting on this initiative in April  2001, we found that accountability for GCPR was blurred across several  management entities and that basic principles of sound IT project  planning, development, and oversight had not been followed, creating  barriers to progress. For example, clear goals and objectives had not  been set; detailed plans for the design, implementation, and testing of the  interface had not been developed; and critical decisions were not binding  on all partners. While both departments concurred with our  recommendations that they, among other things, create comprehensive  and coordinated plans for the effort, progress on the initiative continued to  be disappointing. The departments subsequently revised the strategy for  GCPR and, in May 2002, narrowed the scope of the initiative to focus on  enabling DOD to electronically transfer service members\u2019 health  information to VA upon their separation from active duty. The initiative\u2014 renamed the Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE)\u2014was  completed in 2004.", "Building on FHIE, VA and DOD also established the Bidirectional Health  Information Exchange (BHIE) in 2004, which was aimed at allowing  clinicians at both departments viewable access to records on shared  patients (that is, those who receive care from both departments, such as  veterans who receive outpatient care from VA clinicians and then are  hospitalized at a military treatment facility).

The departments had planned to be able to exchange  selected health information through CHDR by October 2005. However, in  June 2004, we reported that the efforts of VA and DOD in this area  demonstrated a number of management weaknesses. Among these  were the lack of a well-defined architecture for describing the interface for  a common health information exchange, an established project  management lead entity and structure to guide the investment in the  interface and its implementation, and a project management plan defining  the technical and managerial processes necessary to satisfy project  requirements. Accordingly, we recommended that the departments  address these weaknesses, and they agreed to do so.", "In September 2005, we testified that the departments had improved the  management of the CHDR program, but that this program continued to  face significant challenges\u2014in particular, with developing a project  management plan of sufficient specificity to be an effective guide for the  program.

Nonetheless, the  departments planned additional work to further increase their  interoperable capabilities, stating that these actions reflected the  departments\u2019 recognition that clinicians\u2019 needs for interoperable electronic  health records are not static. In this regard, the departments focused on  additional efforts to meet clinicians\u2019 evolving needs for interoperable  capabilities in the areas of social history and physical exam data,  expanding implementation of Essentris, and additional testing of  document scanning capabilities.", "Even with these actions, however, we identified a number of challenges  the departments faced in managing their efforts in response to the 2008  NDAA. Specifically, we identified challenges with respect to performance  measurement, project scheduling, and planning. For example, in a  January 2009 report, we noted that the departments\u2019 key plans did not  identify results-oriented (i.e., objective, quantifiable, and measurable)  performance goals and measures that are characteristic of effective  planning and can be used as a basis to track and assess progress toward  the delivery of new interoperable capabilities. We pointed out that  without establishing results-oriented goals and reporting progress using  measures relative to the established goals, the departments and their  stakeholders would not have the comprehensive picture that they needed  to effectively manage their progress toward achieving increased  interoperability. Accordingly, we recommended that DOD and VA take  action to develop such goals and performance measures to be used as a  basis for providing meaningful information on the status of the  departments\u2019 interoperability initiatives.

Based on this assessment, the departments  announced that they would rely on separate systems to achieve an  interoperable electronic health record, departing from their originally  planned solution of using a single system to meet their similar health  information system needs.

For its part, in May 2013, DOD  announced that it would competitively award a contract to acquire a  limited set of core capabilities that might include VistA-based commercial  solutions.

Best practices have  identified the development and use of cost and schedule estimates as  essential elements for informed decision making when selecting potential  IT investments. In particular, major investment decisions (which can  include, for example, terminating or significantly restructuring an ongoing  program) should be justified using analyses that compare relative costs  and schedules for proposed investments. When effectively implemented,  these practices help ensure that agencies have a sound rationale for their  investment decisions.", "However, VA and DOD have proceeded with their current plan without  developing cost and schedule analyses to support the assertion that the  current plan to pursue separate modernized systems while enabling  interoperability between them would be less expensive and could be  achieved faster than developing a single system. Consistent with best  practices, such analyses would require, for example, development and  documentation of revised cost and schedule estimates that include DOD\u2019s  commercial acquisition, VA\u2019s modernization of VistA, and the joint  interoperability effort, as well as a comparison of these with the estimates  for the original single-system approach. Instead of developing such a joint  analysis to consider their common health care business needs, however,  each department made its own individual determination on what the best  course of action would be. These determinations reflect VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s  divergent philosophies for pursuing IT systems development: VA strongly  supports in-house development and modernization of its homegrown  system, and DOD supports acquiring commercial solutions. Specifically,  according to the VA Under Secretary for Health, pursuing a modernization  of VistA instead of another solution was an obvious choice for VA  because the department already owns the system and has in-house  technical expertise to modernize and maintain it. Similarly, DOD  considered alternatives to replace its legacy electronic health record  system and concluded that pursuing a competitively based commercial  system would be best for the department. The Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&L) stated that  acquiring a commercial system was the right business decision for DOD  because the department is not in the business of developing IT systems,  particularly when more advanced electronic health record solutions are  available commercially. He added that VA\u2019s reasons for modernizing  VistA were logical for that department but did not apply to DOD.

For example, in July 2011 a former director of the office testified  that the IPO\u2019s 2009 charter had established a modest role for the office,  and thus, the office did not have control over the budget for those  initiatives for which it was responsible; rather, this control remained with  VA and DOD. When the departments re-chartered the IPO in 2011, they  included language related to the office having budgetary control over the  iEHR program. For example, this charter gave the IPO Director the  authority to manage budgeting and finances related to the planning and  acquisition of the iEHR capabilities. In addition, the charter provided the  director with the authority to develop and propose interagency budget  submissions for iEHR to the departments. Nevertheless, even with these  revisions to its charter, the IPO was not fully empowered to execute funds  related to iEHR because the departments have different processes for  budgeting IT programs and, in VA\u2019s case, for releasing funds for IT  development. According to the Deputy Chief Management Officer, DOD  had a dedicated fund for the iEHR program, which the IPO Director had  authority to execute. However, VA funded the iEHR program through  several funds, including IT appropriations that VA officials asserted could  only be executed by the Chief Information Officer (CIO). As a result, the  IPO Director was required to request funding for iEHR-related activities  from VA on a project-by-project basis. According to one of the iEHR  program managers, although this process did not necessarily cause  delays to iEHR projects, it was a source of continuous frustration for the  IPO Director because it did not provide the expected level of control over  the program\u2019s budget, as described in the office\u2019s charter.", "Staffing: When VA and DOD designated the IPO to lead the iEHR  program in 2011, they recognized that the office would need to be  expanded to accommodate its new responsibilities.

However, while each of the departments  provided personnel to the IPO through reassignments and short-term  details of personnel, the departments did not fully staff the office as  planned. For example, a staffing report from early November 2012  showed that, at that time, the IPO was staffed at about 60 percent.  Specifically, while the office consisted of 101 reassigned VA and DOD  staff and 43 detailed staff, 95 positions remained vacant. Further, in  January 2013, the IPO Director stated that the office was staffed at  approximately 62 percent and that hiring additional staff remained one of  its biggest challenges, partly due to a hiring freeze within the TRICARE  Management Activity. In addition, VA\u2019s iEHR program manager noted that  recruiting staff for the IPO was a persistent challenge because the  departments required health IT professionals with specialized technical  expertise. Further, the official noted that VA faced a disadvantage in  hiring qualified candidates because it had to compete with private-sector  companies and also had decided to generally limit the hiring pool to  candidates in the Washington, D.C., area.", "Within their respective departments, VA and DOD have established their own processes  for managing acquisitions and contracting. Although the IPO had a contracting officer on  staff at the time of our review, all of the contracts for work conducted for the iEHR program  had been issued and managed through existing VA and DOD contracting offices, including  VA\u2019s Technology Acquisition Center, the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command,  and the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity. inefficient approach.Information and Technology, this decision created an undue burden on  the iEHR program office because it had to meet the requirements of two  different contracting and acquisition processes. For example, according to  iEHR program documentation, the office would have had to develop over  1,300 documents for one of the planned iEHR increments composed of  14 projects in order to comply with both departments\u2019 acquisition  requirements.

Specifically, the co-chairs of the Health Architecture  Review Board raised concerns to the Health Executive Committee that  the IPO had not been receptive to involving the board throughout the  design and acquisition process for the iEHR program. According to these  officials, the board\u2019s inability to participate throughout the process  resulted in unnecessary delays to the IT acquisition process. In a  December 2012 assessment prepared to help define the iEHR program\u2019s  new direction, VA and DOD officials cited governance and oversight as  challenges to the program, including group decision making.

For example,  the charter states that the IPO Director reports through the DHMS  Program Executive Officer to the Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L),  while the IPO Deputy Director reports through the IPO Director to the  VA Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology and CIO.  However, the charter does not describe whether or how the IPO  Director reports to VA leadership. Further, the charter identifies  numerous executive-level individuals and organizations to provide  direction, oversight, and guidance to the IPO, including the Joint  Executive Committee, the Under Secretary of Defense (AT&L), the VA  CIO, and a DOD/VA Senior Stakeholder Group that will include  functional, technical, acquisition, and resource leadership from both  departments.oversight, it is unclear to what extent the IPO leadership will have  decision-making authority over the office\u2019s interoperability efforts.", "Given this extensive level of management and  Further, the IPO\u2019s 2013 charter maintains that the office will remain the  single point of accountability for the development and implementation of  interoperable electronic health records between VA and DOD. However,  in addition to reducing the IPO\u2019s role, responsibilities, and authority over  these efforts in its 2013 charter, the departments have identified other  offices to execute health data interoperability initiatives formerly managed  by the IPO. For example, in January 2014, the Under Secretary of  Defense (AT&L) decided to consolidate the execution of all DOD IT health  data-sharing projects formerly managed by the IPO and the Defense  Health Agency within a new program office under the DHMS Program  Executive Officer. These projects include VLER Health, ongoing data  federation efforts, and longtime data-sharing initiatives with VA, including  the Federal Health Information Exchange, the Bidirectional Health  Information Exchange, and the Clinical Data Repository/Health Data  Repository. According to the decision memo, resources associated with  these health data interoperability efforts will be reassigned from the IPO  and the Defense Health Agency to the DHMSM program. Similarly, in  January 2014 the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Chief Medical  Informatics Officer stated that interoperability programs are in the process  of being consolidated under their Office of Health Informatics and  Analytics and will be managed along with VA\u2019s Office of Information and  Technology.", "Overall, a disconnect exists between the IPO\u2019s responsibility to serve as  VA and DOD\u2019s single point of accountability for their health data  interoperability efforts and the role described in the office\u2019s December  2013 charter. When asked how the IPO will be able to serve as the single  point of accountability for the departments\u2019 joint health IT efforts given  these changes, the DHMS Program Executive Officer stated that he did  not think that the changes impact the IPO\u2019s role at all because the office  is responsible for ensuring that the departments adopt a sound technical  approach for interoperability. Nevertheless, VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s decisions to  diminish the IPO\u2019s role and move responsibilities for interoperability  elsewhere within their respective departments jeopardize the office\u2019s  ability to serve as the departments\u2019 single point of accountability for the  development and implementation of interoperable electronic health  records.

The departments are now in the  process of planning to use separate systems\u2014VA intends to modernize  its existing VistA system and DOD plans to acquire a commercially  available system\u2014while they are also to jointly develop capabilities to  provide interoperability between the systems. In abandoning the single- system approach, the departments asserted that their new, multiple- system approach will be less expensive and faster. However, the  departments\u2019 assertion is questionable because they have not developed  cost and schedule estimates to substantiate their claim or justify their  decision. In the absence of credible analyses to guide decisions about  how to cost-effectively and expeditiously develop the interoperable  electronic health record needed to provide service members and veterans  with the best possible care, VA and DOD have fallen back on the  divergent approaches that each department has determined to be best for  it\u2014VA intends to modernize VistA, and DOD expects to acquire a new  commercially available system.

Their slow pace in addressing  recommendations we made to address these barriers has hindered their  efforts to identify and implement IT solutions that meet their common  needs. Further, the departments\u2019 failure to implement the IPO consistent  with effective collaboration practices may hamper its efforts to serve as a  focal point for future collaboration. Moreover, the departments\u2019 recent  decisions to move certain interoperability responsibilities to other offices  within VA and DOD may further undermine the IPO\u2019s effectiveness.  Because the IPO is expected to play a key role\u2014establishing  interoperability between VA\u2019s modernized VistA and DOD\u2019s to-be- acquired system\u2014it is important that the departments take steps to better  implement the office as an effective mechanism for collaboration and the  single point of accountability for their joint health IT efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To bring transparency and credibility to the Secretaries of Veterans  Affairs and Defense\u2019s assertion that VA and DOD\u2019s current approach to  achieving an interoperable electronic health record will cost less and take  less time than the previous single-system approach, we recommend that  the secretaries develop a cost and schedule estimate for their current approach, from  the perspective of both departments, that includes the estimated cost  and schedule of VA\u2019s VistA Evolution program, DOD\u2019s DHMSM  program, and the departments\u2019 joint efforts to achieve interoperability  between the two systems; then,  compare the cost and schedule estimates of the departments\u2019 current  and previous (i.e., single-system) approaches.", "If the results of the comparison indicate that the departments\u2019 current  approach is estimated to cost more and/or take longer than the single- system approach, provide a rationale for pursuing the current approach despite its  higher cost and/or longer schedule and  report the cost and schedule estimates of the current and previous  approaches, results of the comparison of the estimates, and reasons  (if applicable) for pursuing a more costly or time-consuming approach  to VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s congressional authorizing and appropriations  committees.", "To better position VA and DOD to achieve an interoperable electronic  health record, we recommend that the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and  Defense develop a plan that, at a minimum, describes  the clinical domains that the interoperable electronic health record will  address; a schedule for implementing the interoperable record at each VA and  DOD location;  the estimated cost of each major component (i.e., VistA Evolution,  DHMSM, etc.) and the total cost of the departments\u2019 interoperability  efforts;  the organizations within VA and DOD that are involved in acquiring,  developing, and implementing the record, as well as the roles and  responsibilities of these organizations; major risks to the departments\u2019 interoperability efforts and mitigation  plans for those risks; and  the departments\u2019 approach to defining, measuring, tracking, and  reporting progress toward achieving expected performance (i.e.,  benefits and results) of the interoperable record.", "To better position the Interagency Program Office for effective  collaboration between VA and DOD and to efficiently and effectively fulfill  the office\u2019s stated purpose of functioning as the single point of  accountability for achieving interoperability between the departments\u2019  electronic health record systems, we recommend that the Secretaries of  Veterans Affairs and Defense ensure that the IPO has authority over dedicated resources (e.g., budget and staff), to develop interagency processes, and  to make decisions over the departments\u2019 interoperability efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in  appendix II), signed by the VA Chief of Staff and the Acting Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.
