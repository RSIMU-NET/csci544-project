Securing commercial aviation is a daunting task\u2014with hundreds of  airports, thousands of aircraft, and thousands of flights daily carrying  millions of passengers and pieces of baggage. In an effort to strengthen the  security of commercial aviation, the President signed into law the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) on November 19, 2001. ATSA  created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and mandated  actions designed to strengthen aviation security, including the  federalization of passenger and baggage screening at over 440 commercial  airports in the United States by November 19, 2002, and the screening of  all checked baggage using explosive detection systems. Notwithstanding  these efforts, recent reviews and covert testing conducted by us, the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Office of Inspector General,  and TSA\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review revealed  continuing weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the screening system.", "My testimony today focuses on the progress TSA is making in developing  and deploying tools to enhance and measure screener performance and  the challenges that remain. In particular, my testimony highlights four key  areas, including TSA\u2019s efforts to (1) hire and deploy passenger and  baggage screeners, (2) train the screening workforce, (3) measure  screener performance in detecting threat objects, and (4) leverage and  deploy screening equipment and technologies. My testimony is based on  our prior work and preliminary observations from our ongoing reviews of  TSA\u2019s passenger and baggage screening programs, and research and  development efforts.", "While TSA met its mandate to establish a federal screener workforce by  November 2002, it continues to face challenges in hiring and deploying its  screener workforce. To accomplish its security mission, TSA needs a  sufficient number of passenger and baggage screeners trained and  certified in the latest TSA screening procedures and technology. However,  staffing shortages and TSA\u2019s hiring process have hindered the ability of  some Federal Security Directors (FSD) to provide sufficient resources to  staff screening checkpoints and oversee screening operations at their  airports.", "TSA has taken steps to enhance its training programs for passenger and  baggage screeners. In addition to strengthening its basic and recurrent  training programs, TSA is also enhancing and standardizing remedial  training for screeners who fail covert tests conducted by TSA\u2019s Office of  Internal Affairs and Program Review. TSA has also established leadership  and technical training programs for screening supervisors. Although TSA  continues to make progress in this area, staffing shortages and lack of  high-speed connectivity at many airport training facilities have made it  difficult for screeners to fully utilize these programs and complete  required training.", "While TSA has undertaken several initiatives to measure the performance  of passenger screeners in detecting threat objects, it has collected limited  data related to the performance of baggage screeners. In response to its  July 2003 Passenger Screener Performance Improvement Study, TSA  developed a short-term action plan that identified key actions TSA planned  to take to strengthen the performance of passenger screeners. These  actions built on several initiatives that TSA already had underway,  including enhancing training for screeners and supervisors, increasing  covert testing, completing installation of the Threat Image Projection  System (TIP), and conducting annual recertification of screeners. TSA has  focused on assessing the performance of passenger screeners, but has  collected limited data related to the performance of baggage screeners.

TSA deployed this  equipment to all airports to screen checked baggage, but has been unable  to fully utilize this equipment due to screener and equipment shortages  and equipment being out of service for maintenance and/or repairs. When  EDS and ETD equipment cannot be used, TSA continues to use alternative  screening means identified in ATSA, including K-9 teams, manual  searches, and positive passenger bag match. TSA has ongoing initiatives  to increase the efficiency of screening all checked baggage using EDS and  ETD, including the development and construction of in-line baggage  screening systems\u2014which streamlines screening processes and airport  operations at larger airports.

Over the years, numerous initiatives have been  implemented to strengthen aviation security. However, as we and others  have documented in numerous reports and studies, weaknesses continue  to exist. It was due in part to these weaknesses that terrorists were able to  hijack four commercial aircraft on September 11, 2001, with tragic results.  Concerns continue to exist regarding the security of the aviation system,  as evidenced by the recent cancellations of several, mostly transatlantic  flights to and from the United States in response to intelligence  information regarding specific threats to those flights.", "In response to the attacks of September 11th, ATSA mandated specific  actions designed to strengthen aviation security, and established  ambitious deadlines for completing many of these initiatives.  Consequently, TSA initially focused on attempting to meet these deadlines,  particularly creating a federalized screener workforce at commercial  airports nationwide by November 19, 2002.  TSA also focused on screening  100 percent of checked baggage using explosive detection systems by the  original deadline of December 31, 2002. These efforts resulted in the  deployment of more than 55,000 federal screeners at over 440 commercial  airports nationwide by November 19, 2002, as well as the deployment of  thousands of EDS and ETD systems.", "Virtually all aviation security responsibilities now reside with TSA. Two of  the most important of these responsibilities are passenger and checked  baggage screening. Passenger screening involves the use of metal  detectors, X-ray machines, ETDs, and manual searches to examine  passengers and their carry-on baggage to identify threat objects. Checked  baggage screening involves the use of EDS, ETDs, K-9 teams, positive  passenger bag match, and manual searches to screen checked baggage.  Performing these screening functions can be cognitively demanding and  difficult for screening personnel.", "The results I am presenting today are based on our preliminary  observations of TSA\u2019s passenger and baggage screening programs and  related research and development efforts, based on our ongoing reviews of  these areas for this committee. As part of our ongoing reviews of TSA\u2019s  passenger and baggage screening operations, we interviewed TSA officials  and visited 15 category X airports; 11 category I airports; and 7 category II,  III, and IV airports. During these visits, we observed screening operations  and interviewed FSDs, their staffs, and, at some airports, airport authority  and airline officials. We plan to visit additional airports and conduct  additional analysis during the remainder of our review, including  conducting a survey of all 158 FSDs regarding their screening operations.   Additionally, we will continue to assess TSA\u2019s and DHS\u2019s research and  development programs and the views of a panel of security and technology  experts that we convened with the assistance of the National Academy of  Sciences.

To address these imbalances, as well as congressional  concerns regarding screener-staffing levels, TSA began attempting to right- size its screener workforce. Specifically, TSA established a goal to reduce  its screener workforce by 3,000 screeners by June 1, 2003, and an  additional 3,000 screeners by September 30, 2003. These reductions were  achieved through attrition, voluntary transfers from full to part-time, and  involuntary transfers to part-time or terminations based on screeners\u2019  scores on competency-based examinations.", "Currently, a congressionally imposed staffing cap prohibits TSA from  exceeding a screener staffing level of 45,000 full-time equivalents (FTE).  Figure 1 shows that based on annualized FTE data, TSA is currently below  the 45,000 cap.", "According to TSA officials, TSA has experienced an average annual  attrition rate of 14 percent for screeners. However, attrition among the  nation\u2019s more than 440 commercial airports is sometimes considerably  higher. For example, at 8 category X airports visited during our review,  FSDs reported that average annual attrition ranged from 15 to 36 percent.", "TSA has also experienced difficulties in hiring new staff, particularly part- time staff. FSDs at 11 of the 15 category X airports we visited reported that  they were below their authorized staffing levels due to attrition and  difficulties in hiring new staff. In addition, 3 of these FSDs noted that they  were never successful in hiring up to the authorized staffing levels. FSDs  said that some of the factors contributing to their inability to hire and  retain screeners were the location of their airport, the lack of accessible  and affordable parking and/or public transportation, and the high cost of  living.", "In addition, FSDs at several of the airports we visited stated that they  experienced difficulty in attracting needed part-time screeners, which they  believed to be due to low pay and benefits, as well as undesirable hours.  Additionally, FSDs stated that very few full-time screeners were interested  in converting to part-time status, and TSA officials stated that attrition  rates for part-time screeners were considerably higher than those for full- time screeners. TSA began actively recruiting part-time screeners during  the summer of 2003, and continues to recruit part-time screeners at more  than 80 airports.", "Due to screener shortages, FSDs at 6 of the category X airports we visited  stated that they frequently had to require mandatory overtime, particularly  during the holiday season, to accomplish passenger and baggage screening  functions. FSDs\u2019 use of overtime was particularly high during peak  summer and holiday travel seasons. Figure 2 shows that between May 2003  and January 2004, TSA used the equivalent of an annualized average of  2,315 full-time-equivalent screeners in overtime hours per pay period  (every 2 weeks).", "In an effort to right-size and stabilize its screener workforce, TSA hired a  consultant in September 2003 to conduct a study of screener staffing levels  at the nation\u2019s commercial airports. Specifically, the consultant was tasked  with:    evaluating TSA\u2019s current staffing methodology and systems to establish a  baseline for model development;    developing a method for collecting and analyzing data to realistically  portray specific airport conditions rather than using a generalized  large/small airport protocol;    developing a comprehensive modeling approach with appropriate details  to account for the considerable variability that occurs among airports;  integrating modeling parameters into TSA\u2019s screener scheduling system;  implementing a staffing analysis model to be used as a management tool to  determine daily and weekly staffing levels and deploy the model to  commercial airports nationwide; and    delivering user-friendly simulation software that will determine optimum  screener staffing levels for each of the more than 440 commercial airports  with federal screeners.", "TSA expects the consultant\u2019s study to be completed in April 2004. In the  interim, TSA officials stated that they will continue to review the staffing  allocation provided through their internal modeling efforts, which, among  other things, assesses air carrier and airport growth patterns, and makes  adjustments as appropriate.

This force replaced the Mobile Screening Force\u2014a  regionally-based force\u2014that was created in early 2002 primarily to support  the initial deployment of federal screeners to commercial airports.  The  National Screening Force currently consists of over 700 full-time  passenger and baggage screeners, of which about 10 percent are screening  supervisors. Members of the National Screening Force volunteer to  participate on the force for a 1-year period. TSA officials stated that while  these screeners have a home airport to which they are assigned, they  travel to airports in need of screening staff approximately 70 percent of  the year.", "TSA officials stated that they determine where to deploy members of the  National Screening Force based on four priorities. The highest priority is  given to those airports that need additional screeners in order to be able to  screen 100 percent of checked baggage using EDS and ETD.  The second  priority is given to small airports that have never met their authorized  screener staffing levels and have no permanent screeners. TSA officials  stated that several small airports have screening checkpoints that are  entirely staffed by the National Screening Force. They also stated that  some National Screening Force staff are deployed to airports, particularly  small airports, where they are only needed on a part-time basis. The third  priority is given to airports that are so understaffed that significant  screening delays would occur without additional staff. Finally, the fourth  priority is given to those airports with peak seasonal needs, such as Palm  Springs, airports that have a shortage of female passenger screeners; and  airports offering new commercial service. Additionally, when DHS  recently increased the threat condition from yellow (elevated) to orange  (high), TSA reportedly redeployed about 50 percent of the National  Screening Force to airports determined to be at a higher risk based on  intelligence data.", "TSA is also currently drafting standard operating procedures for the  National Screening Force.

The FSDs  also complained of the time lag between their request for additional staff  and having trained and certified screeners on board.  FSDs at 4 of the  category X airports we visited stated that the time lag between their  request for additional staffing and the opening of an assessment center  took several months.  For example, one FSD stated that in response to  continued attrition at his airport, he notified TSA in advance that  additional screeners would be needed before the peak summer travel  season.  However, an assessment center was not opened until mid-June  and the initial training did not begin until July.  The FSD reportedly had to  rely on the Mobile Screening Force and overtime to accommodate the  demand during the peak summer season.  This same FSD also stated that  the lengthy hiring process limited his ability to address screener  performance issues, such as absenteeism or tardiness, and contributed to  screener complacency because screeners were aware that they were  unlikely to be terminated due to staffing shortages.  In another example,  an FSD at one large airport found it difficult to fill the more than 100 part- time approved screener positions because the nearest assessment center  was too far away for local applicants to be processed.", "Several FSDs we interviewed also stated that not all of the applicants who  were offered positions showed up for initial basic screener training. For  example, in November 2003, at one large category X airport, the FSD  reported that 80 individuals who accepted screener positions were  scheduled to report for basic screener training, but following orientation,  only 15 individuals (less than 20 percent) reported for training. TSA  headquarters reported that an average of 13 percent of screeners who are  hired fail to attend basic screener training.", "FSDs also expressed concern regarding the lack of input they had during  the hiring process. Specifically, they stated that they do not have a role in  reviewing applications, interviewing applicants, or making hiring  decisions. In response to these concerns, TSA officials reported that they  plan to redesign and streamline their hiring process, particularly the  assessment center process (Phase II), to allow for more involvement by  FSDs and their staff. Specifically, officials reported that they are beginning  to (1) ensure that the recruiting contractor includes the FSD in  recruitment planning, including obtaining input regarding where and how  the contractor recruits; (2) allow FSDs to participate with the contractor  in the structured interview of the candidates during Phase II of the hiring  process; and (3) ensure that FSDs swear in the candidates and provides  organizational briefings on their first day of orientation. Officials also  reported that they plan to establish an advisory council of FSDs to help  guide the piloting and implementation of this new process. The goal of  these efforts is to make the hiring process more responsive to the wide  range of airports\u2019 needs while ensuring efficiency and quality.

FSDs and training coordinators also emphasized that screeners  needed to receive more hands-on training using threat simulators and  emulators. TSA headquarters also identified these training needs as part of  a study of passenger screener performance, and developed and deployed  training tools to help address these needs. For example, TSA officials  reported that they provided every airport with at least one Modular Bomb  Set kit and one weapons training kit. These Modular Bomb Sets and  weapons training kits are intended to fill an identified gap in training by  allowing screeners to touch and feel the threat objects that they are  looking for.

As it became apparent that TSA would be unable to attain the  December 31, 2002, deadline, the Congress authorized an extension of that  deadline for noncompliant airports until December 31, 2003. In its effort to  meet these deadlines, in June 2002, TSA and its contractors began to  deploy EDS and ETD equipment to the nation\u2019s commercial airports. This  effort involved designing and implementing facility modifications for EDS  and ETD equipment, installing equipment, and developing and  administering equipment training for baggage screeners. As EDS and ETD  were being deployed to airports, TSA implemented interim solutions to  screen 100 percent of checked baggage, until more permanent solutions  could be designed and constructed. For example, many large airports were  equipped with stand-alone EDS machines that were not integrated with  baggage conveyor systems. These minivan-sized machines were  sometimes deployed in airport lobbies, which led to crowding as  passengers filled lobbies waiting to have their checked baggage screened.  In addition, stand-alone EDS machines are both labor and time intensive  to operate since each bag must be physically carried to an EDS machine  for screening and then moved back to the baggage conveyor system prior  to being loaded onto an aircraft.", "Realizing the inefficiencies of these interim solutions, TSA and some  airport authorities are developing more permanent solutions, such as in- line systems. TSA also continues to look for ways to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of the baggage screening process, especially  ways that reduce reliance on screener personnel.", "TSA has made progress during 2003 in its efforts to deploy equipment to  screen 100 percent of checked baggage using explosive detection systems.   However, some airports are currently unable to use this equipment to  screen all checked baggage for explosives, or reported that they do not  have enough EDS or ETD to conduct baggage screening. These airports  are unable to achieve the requirement to screen 100 percent of checked  baggage, 100 percent of the time, using EDS and ETD due to insufficient  screener staff to operate screening equipment, insufficient staff and  equipment to meet surges in passenger volume, and equipment being out  of service for maintenance and/or repairs. As a way to monitor baggage- screening operations, FSDs are expected to report, using TSA\u2019s PMIS,  when they are unable to screen all checked baggage using EDS and ETD  and the reasons that prevented them from doing so.

Our  preliminary review of that data showed that the most frequently cited  reasons for not being able to meet the requirement\u2014noted by about two- thirds of the FSDs that reported they were not conducting 100 percent  screening using EDS or ETD ---were staff shortages, absenteeism, and a  lack of training. Almost half of these FSDs also identified that they did not  have sufficient EDS and ETD equipment to screen all checked baggage,  and/or that some of their EDS and ETD equipment was inoperable.", "Of the airports reporting that they were not screening 100 percent of  checked baggage using EDS or ETD, the number of consecutive days that  they were not conducting this screening ranged from 1 to 371 days.

This  reporting status can change daily as the events that caused airports to not  conduct 100 percent screening using explosive detection systems may be  corrected.  FSDs are also expected to report whenever there is need to use  alternative screening means because fewer than 100 percent of checked  bags are being screened using EDS and ETD.", "Furthermore, in our visits to several category X and I airports, FSDs  identified EDS and ETD machines that were unable to be used due to an  insufficient number of screeners to operate the equipment or because the  equipment was not in the locations where it was needed.
