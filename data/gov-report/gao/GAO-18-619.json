Also, DOE withdrew its support for four projects, and two projects were withdrawn by the recipients\u2014all before completion.

To assess the reliability of the  funding data, as well as the specific project information for the 794 R&D  projects, we interviewed data specialists at DOE Headquarters, FE, and  NETL and reviewed DOE internal guidance for the maintenance of  agency data. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also reviewed DOE websites and documentation, including  fact sheets, and interviewed officials from FE and NETL.

For example, DOE began its large  demonstration projects of advanced coal technologies in the mid-1980s;  this work focused on R&D to mitigate acid rain and to reduce the  pollutants released from coal combustion. More recently, DOE has  provided funding for advanced fossil energy R&D to reduce COemissions by developing beneficial uses for COfrom coal-fired power  plants, and to improve methods for CCS, among other things.

A grant agreement is  generally defined as a legal instrument of financial assistance between a federal awarding  agency and a non-federal entity that is used to enter into a relationship the principal  purpose of which is to transfer anything of value from the federal awarding agency to the  non-federal entity to carry out a public purpose authorized by law, and not to acquire  property or services for the federal awarding agency\u2019s direct benefit or use. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7  200.51. A cooperative agreement is distinguished from a grant in that it provides for  substantial involvement between the federal awarding agency and the non-federal entity in  carrying out the activity contemplated by the federal award. 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.24. For  purposes of our report, we use the term awards to refer to both grants and cooperative  agreements. organized primarily for profit.

After developing these definitions, three analysts  independently coded each recipient as a university, industry, or other. Our  method was to examine the identifying information on each recipient\u2019s  website and decide which category best described the entity. We also  had an independent analyst check the coding category that we had  assigned to each recipient and verify that we had made a reasonable  coding decision.", "To describe the status of DOE\u2019s advanced fossil energy loan guarantees,  we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, as well as past  GAO reports describing DOE\u2019s administration of the loan program. We  also reviewed summary information that DOE provided on applications for  loan guarantees for advanced fossil energy projects. We analyzed  information that DOE provided on applications for loan guarantees for  advanced fossil energy projects under the Loan Guarantee Program  (LGP) and other related information for fiscal year 2006 through August  2018. We used fiscal year 2006 as the start date because it was the first  year that DOE issued an advanced fossil energy project solicitation\u2014an  announcement of opportunities for loan guarantees for advanced fossil  energy projects\u2014and we used August 2018 as the end date in order to  provide the most up-to-date information as possible. We also reviewed  the advanced fossil energy project solicitations DOE issued during this  timeframe. To assess the reliability of the summary information, we  interviewed LGP staff who maintain the information for the advanced  fossil energy applications, and reviewed DOE documentation. We found  the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the Loan Programs Office who work on the  LGP.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2017 to September  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
