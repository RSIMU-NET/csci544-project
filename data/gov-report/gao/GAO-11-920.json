GAO was asked to (1) assess U.S. agency efforts to account for U.S. nuclear material overseas, (2) assess the Department of Energy's (DOE) and U.S. agencies' efforts to evaluate the security of U.S. material overseas, and (3) describe DOE's activities to secure or remove potentially vulnerable U.S. nuclear material at partner facilities. GAO analyzed agency records and interviewed DOE, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Department of State (State), and partner country officials. This report summarizes GAO's classified report issued in June 2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE, NRC, and State are not able to fully account for U.S. nuclear material overseas that is subject to nuclear cooperation agreement terms because the agreements do not stipulate systematic reporting of such information, and there is no U.S. policy to pursue or obtain such information. U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements generally require that partners report inventory information upon request, however, DOE and NRC have not systematically sought such data. DOE and NRC do not have a comprehensive, detailed, current inventory of U.S. nuclear material--including weapon-usable material such as highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium--overseas that includes the country, facility, and quantity of material. In addition, NRC and DOE could not fully account for the current location and disposition of U.S. HEU overseas in response to a 1992 congressional mandate. U.S. agencies, in a 1993 report produced in response to the mandate, were able to verify the location of 1,160 kilograms out of 17,500 kilograms of U.S. HEU estimated to have been exported. DOE, NRC, and State have established annual inventory reconciliations with five U.S. partners, but not the others it has transferred material to or trades with. Nuclear cooperation agreements do not contain specific access rights that enable DOE, NRC, or State to monitor and evaluate the physical security of U.S. nuclear material overseas, and the United States relies on its partners to maintain adequate security. In the absence of access rights, DOE's Office of Nonproliferation and International Security, NRC, and State have conducted physical protection visits to monitor and evaluate the physical security of U.S. nuclear material at facilities overseas when permitted. However, the agencies have not systematically visited countries believed to be holding the highest proliferation risk quantities of U.S. nuclear material, or systematically revisited facilities not meeting international physical security guidelines in a timely manner. Of the 55 visits made from 1994 through 2010, U.S. teams found that countries met international security guidelines approximately 50 percent of the time. DOE has taken steps to improve security at a number of facilities overseas that hold U.S. nuclear material but faces constraints. DOE's Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) removes U.S. nuclear material from vulnerable facilities overseas but can only bring back materials that have an approved disposition pathway and meet the program's eligibility criteria. GTRI officials told GAO that, of the approximately 17,500 kilograms of HEU exported from the United States, 12,400 kilograms are currently not eligible for return to the United States. Specifically, GTRI reported that over 10,000 kilograms of U.S. HEU are believed to be in fuels from reactors in Germany, France, and Japan that have no disposition pathways in the United States and are adequately protected. In addition, according to GTRI, 2,000 kilograms of transferred U.S. HEU are located primarily in European Atomic Energy Community countries and are currently in use or adequately protected. GAO suggests, among other things, that Congress consider directing DOE and NRC to compile an inventory of U.S. nuclear material overseas. DOE, NRC, and State generally disagreed with GAO's recommendations, including that they conduct annual inventory reconciliations with all partners, stating they were unnecessary. GAO continues to believe that its recommendations could help improve the accountability of U.S. nuclear material in foreign countries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has 27 nuclear cooperation agreements in force for  peaceful civilian cooperation with partners including foreign countries, the  European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and Taiwan. A nuclear cooperation  agreement is a bilateral agreement that establishes the legal framework  for significant civilian nuclear cooperation between the United States and  other parties, including the transfer of certain nuclear material, including  special nuclear material such as enriched uranium, and source material  such as natural uranium, nuclear reactors, and certain components of  nuclear reactors. The agreements are reciprocal, with both parties  generally agreeing to all conditions specified in them. Under the U.S.  Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, these agreements must  contain certain obligations that govern, among other things, the U.S.  rights of approval over the transfer, retransfer, enrichment, and  reprocessing of certain kinds of nuclear material transferred from the  United States and, in some cases produced overseas. A list of current  and former U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement partners can be found in  appendix II.", "Thousands of kilograms of U.S. highly enriched uranium (HEU) and tens  of thousands of kilograms of U.S. plutonium in spent fuel have  accumulated overseas, as a result of foreign nuclear research and  commercial nuclear power activities, which are subject to the terms in  U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements. Inventories of U.S. nuclear  material overseas could continue to grow as the result of reprocessing or  recovery activities. As we have previously reported, tracking and  accounting for nuclear materials are important to (1) ensure that nuclear  materials are used only for peaceful purposes, (2) comply with  international treaty obligations, and (3) provide data to policymakers and  other government officials. According to DOE and NRC officials, the  United States obtains written assurances from partners in advance of  each transfer of U.S.-obligated nuclear material that commits the partner  to treat the transferred nuclear material according to the terms of its  nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States. Nuclear material  transferred from the United States, as well as special nuclear material  produced overseas through the use of U.S.-supplied nuclear material or  reactors, is known as \u201cU.S.-obligated\u201d material.", "As the technology to design and create nuclear weapons has spread, one  of the most serious threats facing the United States and other countries is  the possibility that a nation or terrorist organization could steal weapon- usable nuclear materials from poorly secured stockpiles in various  locations around the world. In April 2009, President Obama made  securing all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide within the next 4 years  a key U.S. nonproliferation goal, and the Department of Energy (DOE)  has stated that doing so will require greater security cooperation with key  countries; pursuing new partnerships to secure nuclear material; and  strengthening nuclear security standards, practices, and international  safeguards.", "Securing nuclear material worldwide is a priority for DOE, through its  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which, as one of its  core mission areas, aims to keep dangerous nuclear materials out of the  hands of terrorists by securing nuclear weapons and nuclear materials at  their source and by improving security practices around the world. In  particular, two key DOE NNSA offices work with U.S. nuclear cooperation  agreement partners to strengthen nuclear security practices and identify  and secure vulnerable nuclear materials. First, DOE\u2019s Office of  Nonproliferation and International Security works with countries to ensure  that provisions in the agreements are met by, among other things,  providing physical protection training, assessment, and guidance on a  bilateral basis, and leading U.S. interagency physical protection visits to  countries with U.S. nuclear material. Second, DOE\u2019s Office of Global  Threat Reduction implements the Global Threat Reduction Initiative  (GTRI) and, among other things, identifies, secures, removes, and/or  facilitates the disposition of high-risk, vulnerable nuclear and radiological  material at civilian sites around the world that pose a threat.", "In November 2010, we reported on the export benefits facilitated by U.S.  nuclear cooperation agreements. In light of the quantities of nuclear  material exported overseas under the framework of U.S. nuclear  cooperation agreements, you asked us to also report on how U.S.  agencies account for nuclear material overseas and monitor and evaluate  the materials\u2019 physical security. Specifically, our objectives were to:   (1) assess U.S. agency efforts to account for U.S. nuclear material  overseas, (2) assess DOE\u2019s and other U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to monitor  and evaluate the physical security conditions of U.S. nuclear material  subject to the terms of nuclear cooperation agreements, and (3) describe  DOE\u2019s activities to secure or remove potentially vulnerable U.S. nuclear  material at partner facilities. In June 2011, we reported to you on the  results of our work in a classified report. This report summarizes certain  aspects of our classified report.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant statutes, including the AEA,  as amended, and the texts of all current U.S. nuclear cooperation  agreements. We obtained data from the Nuclear Materials Management  and Safeguards System (NMMSS), a database jointly operated by DOE  and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This database, among  other things, maintains data on U.S. peaceful use exports and retransfers  of enriched uranium and plutonium that have occurred since 1950. To  assess the reliability of data in NMMSS, we interviewed officials from  DOE and NRC and a former DOE contractor to identify any limitations in  NMMSS\u2019s data on the location and status of U.S. material overseas and  found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of accounting  for U.S. exports of nuclear material. We also compared NMMSS data with  other sources of information regarding U.S. nuclear material transfers,  including DOE data on nuclear material returns. We reviewed DOE, NRC,  and Department of State (State) records and interviewed officials at those  agencies to determine the extent to which DOE, NRC, and State are able  to identify where U.S. nuclear material was exported, retransferred, and is  currently held. We selected a non-probability sample of partners based  on, among other considerations, quantities of U.S. special nuclear  material transferred to them. We conducted site visits in four countries  that currently hold U.S.-obligated nuclear material and interviewed  governmental officials and nuclear facility operators in these countries to  discuss material accounting procedures and observe physical protection  measures. Further, we interviewed officials from several other partners  regarding their observations about working with the U.S. government to  account for material subject to the terms of nuclear cooperation  agreements. We reviewed IAEA\u2019s security guidelines, \u201cThe Physical  Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities,\u201d  INFCIRC/225/Rev.4, and relevant international treaties. We also  obtained and analyzed available records of U.S. physical protection visits  to partner facilities from 1974 through 2010. We reviewed agency  documents and interviewed officials from DOE, NRC, and State to  determine the process used for conducting physical protection visits at  partner facilities. We obtained information from GTRI regarding its  program\u2019s activities. We interviewed IAEA officials and reviewed relevant  documents to better understand IAEA\u2019s role in maintaining safeguards  and evaluating physical security measures. Additional details on our  scope and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2010 to June 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Safeguards: Safeguards, as agreed to by the parties, are to be  maintained over all nuclear material and equipment transferred, and  all special nuclear material used in or produced through the use of  such nuclear material and equipment, as long as the material or  equipment remains under the jurisdiction or control of the cooperating  party, irrespective of the duration of other provisions in the agreement  or whether the agreement is terminated or suspended for any reason.  Such safeguards are known as \u201csafeguards in perpetuity.\u201d 2.  Full-scope IAEA safeguards as a condition of supply: In the case of  non-nuclear weapons states, continued U.S. nuclear supply is to be  conditioned on the maintenance of IAEA \u201cfull-scope\u201d safeguards over  all nuclear materials in all peaceful nuclear activities within the  territory, under the jurisdiction, or subject to the control of the  cooperating party. 3.  Peaceful use guaranty: The cooperating party must guarantee that it  will not use the transferred nuclear materials, equipment, or sensitive  nuclear technology, or any special nuclear material produced through  the use of such, for any nuclear explosive device, for research on or  development of any nuclear explosive device, or for any other military  purpose. 4.  Right to require return: An agreement with a non-nuclear weapon  state must stipulate that the United States has the right to require the  return of any transferred nuclear materials and equipment, and any  special nuclear material produced through the use thereof, if the  cooperating party detonates a nuclear device, or terminates or  abrogates an agreement providing for IAEA safeguards. 5.  Physical security: The cooperating party must guarantee that it will  maintain adequate physical security for transferred nuclear material  and any special nuclear material used in or produced through the use  of any material, or production or utilization facilities transferred  pursuant to the agreement. 6.  Retransfer rights: The cooperating party must guarantee that it will not  transfer any material, Restricted Data, or any production or utilization  facility transferred pursuant to the agreement, or any special nuclear  material subsequently produced through the use of any such  transferred material, or facilities, to unauthorized persons or beyond  its jurisdiction or control, without the consent of the United States. 7.  Restrictions on enrichment or reprocessing of U.S.-obligated material:  The cooperating party must guarantee that no material transferred, or  used in, or produced through the use of transferred material or  production or utilization facilities, will be reprocessed or enriched, or  with respect to plutonium, uranium-233, HEU, or irradiated nuclear  materials, otherwise altered in form or content without the prior  approval of the United States. 8.  Storage facility approval: The cooperating party must guarantee not to  store any plutonium, uranium-233, or HEU that was transferred  pursuant to a cooperation agreement, or recovered from any source  or special nuclear material transferred, or from any source or special  nuclear material used in a production facility or utilization facility  transferred pursuant to the cooperation agreement, in a facility that  has not been approved in advance by the United States. 9.

Under the  safeguards system, IAEA, among other things, inspects facilities and  locations containing nuclear material, as declared by each country, to  verify its peaceful use. IAEA standards for safeguards agreements  provide that the agreements should commit parties to establish and  maintain a system of accounting for nuclear material, with a view to  preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses, and reporting  certain data to IAEA.", "IAEA\u2019s security guidelines provide the basis by which the United States  and other countries generally classify the categories of protection that  should be afforded nuclear material, based on the type, quantity, and  enrichment of the nuclear material. For example, Category I material is  defined as 2 kilograms or more of unirradiated or \u201cseparated\u201d plutonium  or 5 kilograms of uranium-235 contained in unirradiated or \u201cfresh\u201d HEU  and has the most stringent set of recommended physical protection  measures.

For example, Australia, which  exports about 13 percent of the world\u2019s uranium each year, conducts  annual reconciliations with each of its partners, and reports annually to  the Australian Parliament regarding the location and disposition of all  Australian nuclear material. NRC officials told us that Australia has some  of the strictest reporting requirements for its nuclear material.", "The United States conducts annual inventory reconciliations with five  partners but does not conduct inventory reconciliations with the other  partners it has transferred material to or trades with. According to DOE  officials, for the five reconciliations currently conducted, NMMSS data are  compared with the partner\u2019s records and, if warranted, each country\u2019s  records are adjusted, where necessary, to reflect the current status of U.S  special nuclear material. As of February 2011, the United States  conducted bilateral annual exchanges of total material balances for  special nuclear materials with five partners. Of these partners, the United  States exchanges detailed information regarding inventories at each  specific facility only with one partner. DOE officials noted that they  exchange information with particular trading partners on a transactional  basis during the reporting year and work with the partners at that time to  resolve any potential discrepancies that may arise. In the case of  EURATOM, material information is reported as the cumulative total of all  27 EURATOM members. For the purposes of nuclear cooperation with  the United States, EURATOM is treated as one entity rather than its 27  constituent parts. None of the 27 EURATOM member states have  bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements in force with the United States.", "According to a 2010 DOE presentation for NMMSS users, the difference  in reporting requirements results in a 69-page report for Japan and a   1-page report for EURATOM. In addition, information exchanged with  other trading partners also is not reported by facility. DOE and NRC  officials told us that the United States may not have accurate information  regarding the inventories of U.S. nuclear material held by its 21 other  partners.", "DOE officials told us that, in addition to benefits, there were costs to  pursuing facility-by-facility reconciliations and reporting. In particular, DOE  officials told us they have not pursued facility-by-facility accounting in  annual reconciliations with other partners because it would be difficult for  the United States to supply such detailed information regarding partner  material held in U.S. facilities. DOE and NRC officials told us this would  also create an administrative burden for the United States. According to  DOE officials, the relative burden with which the United States can  perform facility-by-facility accounting by foreign trading partner varies  greatly based on the amount of material in the United States that is  obligated to such partners. For example, the United States can perform  facility-by-facility accounting with one country, because U.S. officials told  us there is not much of that country\u2019s nuclear material in the United  States.

In addition, NMMSS officials emphasized that this  information would need to be systematically reported. According to these  officials, such reporting is not done on a regular basis by other DOE  offices and State.

This principle is reflected both in IAEA\u2019s guidelines on the  \u201cPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities\u201d and in  pending amendments to the Convention on the Physical Protection of  Nuclear Material. Our review of section 123 of the AEA and all U.S.  nuclear cooperation agreements currently in force found that they do not  explicitly include a provision granting the United States access to verify  the physical protection of facilities or sites holding material subject to U.S.  nuclear cooperation agreement terms.

Our review of the texts of all 27 U.S. nuclear  cooperation agreements in force found that most of them contain a  provision providing that the adequacy of physical protection measures  shall be subject to review and consultations by the parties. However,  none of the agreements include specific provisions stipulating that the  United States has the right to verify whether a partner is adequately  securing U.S. nuclear material.

In addition, NRC officials stated that  this government-to-government reconfirmation of the terms and  conditions of the agreement meets the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the AEA and  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and underscores that the  partner is aware of and accepts the terms and conditions of the  agreement.", "NRC officials also noted that the NNPA amendments to the AEA were  designed and intended to encourage foreign governments to agree to  U.S. nonproliferation criteria in exchange for nuclear commodities.  However, the AEA does not empower the U.S. government through  inspections or other means to enforce foreign government compliance  with nuclear cooperation agreements once U.S. nuclear commodities are  in a foreign country.

In 1974, DOE\u2019s predecessor, the  Energy Research and Development Administration, began leading teams  composed of State, NRC, and DOE national laboratory officials to review  the partner\u2019s legal and regulatory basis for physical protection and to  ensure that U.S. nuclear material was adequately protected. In 1988, the  Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency began to  participate in these visits, and officials from other agencies and offices,  such as GTRI, have participated. The visits have generally focused on  research reactors containing HEU but have also included assessments,  when partners voluntarily grant access, of other facilities\u2019 physical  security, including nuclear power plants, reprocessing facilities, and  research and development facilities containing U.S. nuclear material.", "According to DOE documents and DOE, NRC, and State officials, the  primary factors for selecting countries for visits are the type, quantity, and  form of nuclear material, with priority given to countries with U.S. HEU or  plutonium in Category I amounts. In addition, in 1987, NRC  recommended that countries possessing U.S. Category I nuclear material  be revisited at least every 5 years. DOE and NRC officials told us this has  become an official goal for prioritizing visits. According to DOE,  interagency physical protection visits are also made whenever the country  has had or expects to have a significant change in its U.S. nuclear  material inventory, along with other factors, such as previous findings that  physical protection was not adequate. These criteria and other factors are  used to help U.S. agencies prioritize visits on a countrywide basis and  also supplement other information that is known about a partner\u2019s  physical protection system and the current threat environment. Moreover,  while the U.S. physical protection program assesses physical security  conditions on a site-specific basis, NRC\u2019s regulations permit the  determination of adequacy of foreign physical protection systems on a  countrywide basis. Therefore, DOE, NRC, and State officials told us that  the results of the interagency physical protection visits, combined with  other sources of information such as country threat assessments, are  used as a measure of the physical security system countrywide.", "The U.S. teams visit certain facilities where U.S. nuclear material is used  or stored to observe physical protection measures after discussing the  relevant nuclear security regulatory framework with the partner  government. DOE and State officials told us these physical protection  visits help U.S. officials develop relationships with partner officials, share  best practices and, in some cases, recommend physical security  improvements.", "We visited four facilities that hold U.S.-obligated nuclear material. The  partner officials and facility operators we met shared their observations  regarding the U.S. physical protection visits. Representatives from one  site characterized a recent interagency physical protection visit as a  \u201ctour.\u201d These officials told us the U.S. government officials had shared  some high-level observations regarding their visit with government  officials and nuclear reactor site operators but did not provide the  government or site operators with written observations or  recommendations. On the other hand, government officials from another  country we visited told us that a recent interagency physical protection  visit had resulted in a useful and detailed exchange of information about  physical security procedures. These government officials told us they had  learned \u201cquite a lot\u201d from the interagency physical protection visit and that  they hoped the dialogue would continue, since security could always be  improved. In February 2011, DOE officials told us they had begun to  distribute the briefing slides they use at the conclusion of a physical  protection visit to foreign officials. State officials told us that the briefings  are considered government-to-government activities, and it is the partner  government\u2019s choice on whether to include facility operators in the  briefings.", "In addition, we reviewed U.S. agencies\u2019 records of these and other  physical protection visits and found that, over the 17-year period from  1994 through 2010, U.S. interagency physical protection teams made 55  visits. Of the 55 visits, interagency physical protection teams found the  sites met IAEA security guidelines on 27 visits, did not meet IAEA security  guidelines on 21 visits, and the results of 7 visits are unknown because  the physical protection team was unable to assess the sites, or agency  documentation was missing.", "According to DOE, State, and NRC officials, the visits are used to  encourage security improvements by the partner. For example, based on  the circumstances of one particular facility visited in the last 5 years, the  physical protection team made several recommendations to improve  security, including installing (1) fences around the site\u2019s perimeter, (2)  sensors between fences, (3) video assessment systems for those  sensors, and (4) vehicle barriers. According to DOE officials, these  observations were taken seriously by the country, which subsequently  made the improvements.", "When we visited the site as part of our review, government officials from  that country told us the U.S. interagency team had provided useful advice  and, as a result, the government had approved a new physical protection  plan. These government officials characterized their interactions with  DOE and other U.S. agency officials as positive and told us that the  government\u2019s new physical protection plan had been partly implemented.  Moreover, although we were not granted access to the building, we  observed several physical protection upgrades already implemented or in  progress, including: (1) the stationing of an armed guard outside the  facility holding U.S. Category I material; (2) ongoing construction of a 12- foot perimeter fence around the facility; and (3) construction of a fence  equipped with barbed wire and motion detectors around the entire  research complex. We were also told that, among other things, remote  monitoring equipment had been installed in key areas in response to the  interagency visit. The Central Alarm Station was hardened, and the  entrance to the complex was controlled by turnstiles and a specially  issued badge, which entrants received after supplying a passport or other  government-issued identification. Private automobiles were not allowed in  the facility.", "Not all U.S. physical protection visits proceed smoothly. In some cases,  U.S. agencies have attempted repeatedly to convince partner officials of  the seriousness of meeting IAEA security guidelines and to fund  improvements. For example, a U.S. interagency physical protection team  in the early 2000s found numerous security problems at a certain  country\u2019s research reactor. The site supervisor objected to the  interagency team\u2019s assessment because physical security was a matter  of national sovereignty, and IAEA security guidelines were subject to  interpretation. The site supervisor also objected to some of the U.S.  team\u2019s recommendations. In some instances, under U.S. pressure,  countries have agreed to make necessary improvements with DOE  technical and material assistance.", "Our review of agency records indicates that, in recent years, as the  number of countries relying on U.S. HEU to fuel research reactors has  continued to decline, U.S. agencies have succeeded in using a partner\u2019s  pending export license for U.S. HEU or expected change in inventory of  U.S. special nuclear material as leverage for a U.S. interagency physical  protection visit. For example, we identified two cases since 2000 where a  partner country applied for a license to transfer U.S. HEU, and a U.S.  interagency team subsequently visited those two sites. In addition, we  identified a recent situation where a partner country\u2019s inventory of U.S.  plutonium at a certain site was expected to significantly increase, and a  U.S. interagency team visited the site to determine whether the site could  adequately protect these additional inventories.", "According to DOE officials, requests for U.S. low enriched uranium (LEU)  export licenses have increased in recent years. In response, DOE  officials told us that U.S. agencies have begun to prioritize visits to  countries making such requests, and our review of agency documentation  corroborates this. For example, physical protection visit records we  reviewed state that recent interagency physical protection visits were  made to two sites to evaluate the facilities\u2019 physical security in advance of  pending U.S. LEU license applications.

As a result, the list of countries had not been properly  vetted at that time and did not represent an interagency agreed-upon  list. In February 2011, DOE officials told us that U.S. agencies will be  considering a revised methodology for prioritizing physical protection  visits.

The material must (1) pose a threat to national security, (2) be usable for  an improvised nuclear device, (3) present a high-risk of terrorist theft, and  (4) meet U.S. acceptance criteria.", "To date, GTRI has removed more than 1,240 kilograms of U.S. HEU from  Australia, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia,  Denmark, Germany, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, Philippines,  Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,  Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. It has also performed security upgrades  at reactors containing U.S. nuclear material that were not meeting IAEA  security guidelines in 10 partner countries. As we reported in September  2009, GTRI has improved the security of research reactors, and GTRI  officials told us in April 2011 that they plan to continue to engage other  countries to upgrade security.", "In a separate report published in December 2010, we noted that GTRI  has assisted in the conversion from the use of HEU to LEU or verified the  shutdown of 72 HEU research reactors around the world, 52 of which  previously used U.S. HEU. GTRI prioritizes its schedule for upgrading the  security of research reactors and removing nuclear material based on the  amount and type of nuclear material at the reactor and other threat  factors, such as the vulnerability of facilities, country-level threat, and  proximity to strategic assets. Our review identified several situations  where GTRI or its predecessor program removed vulnerable U.S. nuclear  material.", "Notwithstanding these successes, the GTRI program has some  limitations. GTRI cannot remove all potentially vulnerable nuclear material  worldwide because the program\u2019s scope is limited to only certain types of  material that meet the eligibility criteria. GTRI officials told us that, of the  approximately 17,500 kilograms of HEU it estimates was exported from  the United States, the majority\u201412,400 kilograms\u2014is currently not  eligible for return to the United States. According to GTRI officials, over  10,000 kilograms is contained in fuels from \u201cspecial purpose\u201d reactors  that are not included in GTRI\u2019s nuclear material return program because  they were not traditional aluminum-based fuels, TRIGA fuels, or target  material. As a result, this material does not have an acceptable  disposition pathway in the United States, according to GTRI officials.  GTRI officials stated that these reactors are in Germany, France, and  Japan, and that the material has been deemed to be adequately  protected. GTRI reported that the other approximately 2,000 kilograms of  transferred U.S. nuclear material is located primarily in EURATOM  member countries and is either currently in use or adequately protected.", "In addition, the potential vulnerability of nuclear material at certain high- income facilities was raised to us by officials at the National Security  Council (NSC)\u2014the President\u2019s principal forum for considering national  security and foreign policy matters\u2014and included in a prior report.  Specifically, we reported that, there may be security vulnerabilities in  certain high-income countries, including three specific high-income  countries named by the NSC officials. For sites in these countries, GTRI  officials told us the U.S. government\u2019s strategy is to work bilaterally with  the countries and to provide recommendations to improve physical  protection, and follow up as needed.", "Our analysis of available agency physical protection visit documents also  raises concerns regarding the physical security conditions in these  countries, including facilities that did not meet IAEA security guidelines  and interagency physical protection teams\u2019 lack of access issues.", "DOE also works with countries to remove material if it is in excess of the  country\u2019s needs and meets DOE acceptance criteria. The ability of DOE  to return U.S. nuclear material depends, however, on the willingness of  the foreign country to cooperate. As we reported in September 2009,   because GTRI\u2019s program for physical security upgrades and nuclear  material returns is voluntary, DOE faces some challenges in obtaining  consistent and timely cooperation from other countries to address security  weaknesses. Our report further noted that DOE has experienced  situations where a foreign government has refused its assistance to make  security upgrades. For example, we reported that one country had  refused offers of DOE physical security upgrades at a research reactor for  9 years. However, this situation was subsequently resolved when all HEU  was removed from this country, according to GTRI officials. In addition,  we reported that DOE had experienced two other situations where the  partner country would not accept security assistance until agreements  with the United States were reached on other issues related to nuclear  energy and security.", "There are several countries that have U.S. nuclear material that are  particularly problematic and represent special cases. Specifically, U.S.  nuclear material has remained at sites in three countries where physical  protection measures are unknown or have not been visited by an  interagency physical protection team in decades. GTRI removed a large  quantity of U.S. spent HEU recently from one of these countries.", "According to NRC and State officials, U.S. transfers to these three  countries were made prior to 1978, when the physical protection  requirements were added to the AEA. Therefore, these countries have  not made the same commitments regarding physical security of U.S.- transferred material. Finally, we identified another country that poses  special challenges. All U.S-obligated HEU has been removed from this  country, which was one of the GTRI program\u2019s highest priorities. Previous  U.S. interagency physical protection visits found a site in this country did  not meet IAEA security guidelines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The world today is dramatically different than when most U.S. nuclear  cooperation agreements were negotiated. Many new threats have  emerged, and nuclear proliferation risks have increased significantly. We  recognize that the United States and its partners share a strong common  interest in deterring and preventing the misuse of U.S. nuclear material\u2014 or any nuclear material\u2014and that flexibility in the agreements is  necessary to forge strong and cooperative working relationships with our  partners. The fundamental question, in our view, is whether nuclear  cooperation agreements and their underlying legislative underpinnings  need to be reassessed given the weaknesses in inventory management  and physical security that we identified.", "Specifically, we found these agreements may not be sufficiently robust in  two areas\u2014inventories and physical security. Without an accurate  inventory of U.S. nuclear materials\u2014in particular, weapon-usable HEU  and separated plutonium\u2014the United States does not have sufficient  assurances regarding the location of materials. As a result, the United  States may not be able to monitor whether the partner country is  appropriately notifying the United States and whether the United States is  appropriately and fully exercising its rights of approval regarding the  transfer, retransfer, enrichment and reprocessing and, in some cases,  storage of nuclear materials subject to the agreement terms. NRC and  multiple offices within DOE could not provide us with an authoritative list  of the amount, location, and disposition of U.S. HEU or separated  plutonium overseas. We are particularly concerned that NRC and DOE  could not account, in response to a 1992 mandate by Congress, on the  location and disposition of U.S. nuclear material overseas\u2014and that they  have not developed such an inventory in the almost two decades since  that mandate.", "We recognize that physical security is a national responsibility. We also  recognize that neither the AEA, as amended, nor the U.S. nuclear  cooperation agreements in force require that State negotiate new or  renewed nuclear cooperation agreement terms that include specific  access rights for the United States to verify whether a partner is  maintaining adequate physical security of U.S. nuclear material. Without  such rights, it may be difficult for the United States to have access to  critical facilities overseas\u2014especially those believed to be holding  weapon-usable materials\u2014to better ensure that U.S. material is in fact  adequately protected while the material remains in the partner\u2019s custody.  We note the agreements are reciprocal, with both parties generally  agreeing to all conditions specified in them. We acknowledge that any  change to the nuclear cooperation framework or authorizing legislation  will be very sensitive. Careful consideration should be given to the impact  of any reciprocity clauses on U.S. national security when negotiating or  reviewing these agreements. However, it may be possible to do so in a  way that includes greater access to critical facilities where weapon-usable  U.S. nuclear material is stored, without infringing on the sovereign rights  of our partners or hampering the ability of the U.S. nuclear industry to  remain competitive.", "In the course of our work, we identified several weaknesses in DOE,  NRC, and State\u2019s efforts to develop and manage activities that ensure  that U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements are properly implemented.  Specifically, the lack of a baseline inventory of U.S. nuclear materials\u2014in  particular, weapon-usable materials\u2014and annual inventory reconciliations  with all partners limits the ability of the U.S. government to identify where  the material is located. Currently, annual reconciliations with five partners  are undertaken. However, the information, with the exception of one  country, is aggregated and not provided on a facility-by-facility basis.  Without such information on facilities, it may be difficult to track U.S.  material for accounting and control purposes. No annual reconciliations  currently exist for the United States\u2019 other partners that it has transferred  material to or trades with. The NMMSS database could be the official  central repository of data regarding U.S. inventories of nuclear material  overseas if DOE and NRC are able to collect better data.", "We are concerned that DOE has not worked with NRC and State to  develop a systematic process for monitoring and evaluating the physical  security of U.S. nuclear material overseas, including which foreign  facilities to visit for future physical protection visits. In particular, U.S.  interagency physical protection teams have neither met a key  programmatic goal for visiting countries containing Category I quantities  of U.S. special nuclear material every 5 years, nor have they visited all  partner facilities believed to be holding Category I quantities of U.S.  nuclear material, nor revisited facilities that were found to not meet IAEA  security guidelines in a timely manner. Moreover, relying on reported  thefts of U.S. nuclear material as a gauge of security is not the best  measure of program effectiveness when accounting processes for  inventory of U.S. material at foreign facilities are limited. Improving the  U.S. government\u2019s management of nuclear cooperation agreements  could contribute to the administration achieving its goal of securing all  vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in 4 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["\uf0b7  Congress may wish to consider directing DOE and NRC to complete a  full accounting of U.S. weapon-usable nuclear materials\u2014in  particular, HEU and separated plutonium\u2014with its nuclear  cooperation agreement partners and other countries that may  possess such U.S. nuclear material.", "In addition, Congress may wish to consider amending the AEA if  State, working with other U.S. agencies, does not include enhanced  measures regarding physical protection access rights in future  agreements and renewed agreements, so that U.S. interagency  physical protection teams may obtain access when necessary to  verify that U.S. nuclear materials have adequate physical protection.

Careful consideration should be given to the impact of any  reciprocity clauses on U.S. national security when negotiating or  reviewing these agreements.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Energy, working with the  Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission take the following three actions:  \uf0b7  develop an official central repository to maintain data regarding U.S.  inventories of nuclear material overseas. This repository could be the  NMMSS database, or if the U.S. agencies so determine, some other  official database; \uf0b7  develop formal goals for and a systematic process to determine which  foreign facilities to visit for future interagency physical protection visits.  The goals and process should be formalized and agreed to by all  relevant agencies; and \uf0b7  periodically review performance in meeting key programmatic goals  for the physical protection program, including determining which  countries containing Category I U.S. nuclear material have been  visited within the last 5 years, as well as determining whether partner  facilities previously found to not meet IAEA security guidelines were  revisited in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of Energy and State,  and the Chairman of the NRC for their review and comment. Each agency  provided written comments on the draft report, which are presented in  appendixes IV, VI, and V, respectively. All three agencies generally  disagreed with our conclusions and recommendations. DOE, NRC, and  State disagreed with GAO in three general areas of the report.  Specifically, all the agencies (1) disagree with our recommendations to  establish annual inventory reconciliations with all trading partners and  establish a system to comprehensively track and account for U.S. nuclear  material overseas, because the agencies believe this is impractical and  unwarranted; (2) maintain that IAEA safeguards are sufficient or an  important tool to account for U.S. nuclear material overseas; and (3)  assert that any requirement in future nuclear cooperation agreements  calling for enhanced physical protection access rights is unnecessary and  could hamper sensitive relationships.", "With regard to the three general areas of disagreement, our response is  as follows:  \uf0b7  DOE, NRC, and State assert that it is not necessary to implement  GAO\u2019s recommendation that agencies undertake an annual inventory  reconciliation and report on a facility-by-facility basis for weapon- usable material where possible for all countries that hold U.S.- obligated nuclear material. We stand by this recommendation for  numerous reasons. First, as stated in the report, we found\u2014and none  of the agencies refuted\u2014that the U.S. government does not have an  inventory of U.S. nuclear material overseas and, in particular, is not  able to identify where weapon-usable materials such as HEU and  separated plutonium that can be used for a nuclear weapon may  reside. In fact, NRC commented that \u201cinventory knowledge is very  important for high-consequence materials, e.g., high enriched uranium  and separated plutonium.\u201d Because DOE, NRC, and State do not  have comprehensive knowledge of where U.S.-obligated material is  located at foreign facilities, it is unknown whether the United States is  appropriately and fully exercising its rights of approval regarding the  transfer, retransfer, enrichment, and reprocessing and, in some  cases, storage of nuclear materials subject to the agreements\u2019 terms.  In addition, the lack of inventory information hampers U.S. agencies in  identifying priorities for interagency physical protection visits. We are  particularly concerned that NRC and DOE, in response to a 1992  mandate by Congress, could only account for the location and  disposition of about 1,160 kilograms out of an estimated 17,500  kilograms of U.S.-exported HEU. Furthermore, the agencies have not  developed such an inventory or performed an additional  comprehensive review in the almost two decades since that mandate.  We believe it is important that DOE, NRC, and State pursue all means  possible to better identify where U.S.-obligated material is located  overseas\u2014and for weapon-usable HEU and separated plutonium,  seek to do so on a facility-by-facility basis. Annual inventory  reconciliations with all partners provide one way to do that. The United  States has demonstrated it has the ability to conduct such exchanges,  which none of the agencies disputed. Our report notes that the United  States conducts annual inventory reconciliations with five partners,  including one where facility-level information is annually exchanged.  We believe the recent signing of nuclear cooperation agreements with  India and Russia, as well as the situation where current partners  whose agreements are set to expire in coming years must be  renegotiated\u2014including Peru and South Korea\u2014provide a convenient  and timely opportunity for DOE, NRC, and State to pursue such  enhanced material accountancy measures. \uf0b7  DOE, NRC, and State commented that IAEA\u2019s comprehensive  safeguards program is another tool to maintain the knowledge of  locations of nuclear material in a country, including U.S.-obligated  material, and that IAEA inspection, surveillance, and reporting  processes are effective tools for material tracking and accounting. We  agree that IAEA safeguards are an important nuclear nonproliferation  mechanism. However, our report found IAEA\u2019s safeguards have a  limited ability to identify, track, and account for U.S.-obligated  material. Specifically, as our report notes, and as confirmed to us by  senior IAEA officials, IAEA does not track the obligation of the nuclear  material under safeguards and, therefore, IAEA may not have the  ability to identify whether and what volume of nuclear material at  partner country facilities is U.S.-obligated and subject to the terms of  U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements. In addition, our report notes  that IAEA considers member country nuclear material inventory  information confidential and does not share it with its member  countries, including the United States. Therefore, IAEA has a limited  ability to account for nuclear material subject to the terms of U.S.  nuclear cooperation agreements. Importantly, safeguards are not a  substitute for physical security and serve a different function. As our  report notes, safeguards are primarily a way to detect diversion of  nuclear material from peaceful to military purposes but do not ensure  that facilities are physically secure to prevent theft or sabotage of  such material. \uf0b7  DOE, NRC, and State disagreed with our recommendation that State,  working with DOE and NRC, should seek to negotiate terms that  include enhanced measures regarding physical protection access  rights in future and renewed agreements. They also raised concerns  with our Matter for Congressional Consideration to amend the AEA  should State not implement our recommendation. We do not agree  with agencies\u2019 comments that our recommendation that agencies  \u201cseek to include\u201d such measures is impractical. As we note in our  report, an enhanced measure for access rights is in place in the  recently negotiated U.S.-India arrangements and procedures  document. Further, while partner countries pledge at the outset of an  agreement that they will physically protect U.S.- obligated material,  the results of our work show that they have not always adequately  done so. Specifically, our report noted that, of the 55 interagency  physical protection visits made from 1994 through 2010, interagency  teams found that countries met IAEA security guidelines on only 27  visits; did not meet IAEA security guidelines on 21 visits, and the  results of 7 visits are unknown because the U.S. team was unable to  assess the sites or agency documentation of the physical protection  visits was missing. In addition, we identified 12 facilities that are  believed to have or previously had Category I U.S. nuclear material  that have not been visited by an interagency physical protection team.  We agree with the agencies\u2019 comments that the licensing process for  U.S. nuclear material offers some assurances that physical security  will be maintained and that an exchange of diplomatic notes at the  time of a transfer is designed to ensure the partners maintain the  material according to the terms of the agreements. However, these  measures are implemented at the time of licensing or material  transfer, and insight into the physical security arrangements of the  nuclear material over the longer-term, often 30-year duration of these  agreements is by no means guaranteed. Ensuring that the United  States has the tools it needs to visit facilities in the future\u2014even after  an initial transfer of material is made per a conditional export  license\u2014is important to supporting U.S. nuclear nonproliferation  objectives. We continue to believe that our recommendation and  Matter for Congressional Consideration are consistent with the  report\u2019s findings and would enhance the security of U.S.-obligated  nuclear material in other countries.", "In addition, DOE and NRC commented that (1) our report contained  errors in fact and judgment, (2) our report\u2019s recommendations could result  in foreign partners requiring reciprocal access rights to U.S. facilities that  contain nuclear material that they transferred to the United States, which  could have national security implications, and (3) our recommendation  that agencies establish a process for conducting annual reconciliations of  inventories of nuclear material and develop a repository to maintain data  regarding U.S. inventories of nuclear material overseas would be costly to  implement. Our response to these comments is as follows:  \uf0b7  None of the agencies\u2019 comments caused us to change any factual  statement we made in the report. DOE provided a limited number of  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.  Importantly, some of the facts that agencies did not dispute included:  (1) our analysis that found U.S. agencies made only a single attempt  to comprehensively account for transferred U.S. HEU almost 20 years  ago and, at that time, were only able to verify the amount and location  of less than one-tenth of transferred U.S. HEU; and (2) partner  countries did not meet IAEA physical security guidelines for protecting  U.S. nuclear material in about half of the cases we reviewed from  1994 through 2010. In our view, these security weaknesses place  U.S.-obligated nuclear material at risk and raise potential proliferation  concerns. These agreements for nuclear cooperation are long-term in  scope and are often in force for 30 years or more. As we noted in our  report, the world today is dramatically different than the time when  most of the agreements were negotiated. New threats have emerged,  and nuclear proliferation risks have increased significantly. NRC  commented that countries may not want to change the \u201cstatus quo\u201d as  it pertains to nuclear cooperation agreement terms, including those  regarding the physical protection of U.S.-obligated nuclear material. In  our view, the status quo, or business-as-usual approach should not  apply to matters related to the security of U.S.-obligated nuclear  material located at partner facilities throughout the world. Moreover,  implementing a more robust security regime is consistent with and  complements the administration\u2019s goal of securing all vulnerable  nuclear material worldwide within a 4-year period. \uf0b7  DOE and NRC\u2019s comment that the United States may be asked to  demonstrate reciprocity by nuclear cooperation agreement partners to  verify that adequate physical protection is being provided to their  nuclear material while in U.S. custody has merit and needs to be  taken into consideration when developing or reviewing nuclear  cooperation agreements. As a result, we added language to the  conclusions and recommendation sections to additionally state that  \u201ccareful consideration should be given to the impact of any reciprocity  clauses on U.S. national security when negotiating or reviewing these  agreements.\u201d", "In addition, DOE and NRC commented that we are suggesting a  costly new effort in recommending that agencies account for and track  U.S.-obligated nuclear material overseas. However, we noted in our  report that NMMSS officials told us that NMMSS is currently capable  of maintaining information regarding inventories of U.S. nuclear  material overseas. Moreover, DOE and NRC did not conduct an  analysis to support their assertion that such a system would be costly.  Although we did not perform a cost-benefit analysis, based on our  conversations with NMMSS staff and the lack of a DOE cost-benefit  analysis, to the contrary, there is no evidence to suggest that adding  additional information to the NMMSS database would necessarily  entail significant incremental costs or administrative overhead. We are  sensitive to suggesting or recommending new requirements on  federal agencies that may impose additional costs. However, it is  important to note that the U.S. government has already spent billions  of dollars to secure nuclear materials overseas, as well as radiation  detection equipment to detect possible smuggled nuclear material at  our borders and the border crossings of other countries. The  administration intends to spend hundreds of millions more to support  the president\u2019s 4-year goal to secure all vulnerable nuclear material  worldwide. If necessary, an expenditure of some resources to account  for U.S. nuclear material overseas is worthy of consideration. We  stand by our recommendations that State work with nuclear  cooperation agreement partners that the United States has  transferred material to, to develop a baseline inventory of U.S. nuclear  material overseas, and that DOE work with other federal agencies to  develop a central repository to maintain data regarding U.S.  inventories of nuclear material overseas.", "DOE disagreed with our findings that the U.S. interagency physical  protection visit program (1) lacked formal goals, and that (2) U.S.  agencies have not established a formal process for coordinating and  prioritizing interagency physical protection visits, in addition to the three  areas of general disagreement. During the course of our work, we found  no evidence of an interagency agreed-upon list of program goals. In its  comments, DOE stated that the formal goal of the program is to  determine whether U.S.-obligated nuclear material at the partner country  facility is being protected according to the intent of IAEA security  guidelines. This is the first time the goal has been articulated to us as  such. Moreover, we disagree with DOE\u2019s second assertion that it has  established a formal process for coordinating and prioritizing visits. Our  report notes that we found DOE has not (1) worked with NRC and State  to establish a plan and prioritize U.S. physical protection visits or (2)  measured performance in a systematic way. In particular, our report notes  that, in October 2009, a DOE Office of Nonproliferation and International  Security official reported to us that it had formulated a list of 10 countries  that contained U.S. nuclear material and were priorities for physical  protection teams to visit. However, a senior-level DOE nonproliferation  official told us that DOE had not discussed this list with State or NRC, or  other agency officials, and it could not be considered an interagency  agreed-upon list. In addition, NRC Office of International Program officials  told us they thought interagency coordination could be improved, and a  State Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation official told us  that agency coordination has improved in the past 6 months. Moreover,  as we further state in the report, in February 2011, DOE officials told us  that the department is conducting a study of its methodology for  prioritizing physical protection visits.", "In addition, in July 2011, in conjunction with the classification review for  this report, DOE officials stated that while DOE, NRC, and State work  together on coordinating U.S. government positions regarding priorities  and procedures for the interagency physical protection program, no  updated document exists that formalizes the process for planning,  coordinating, and prioritizing U.S. interagency physical protection visits.  We note that the documents that DOE refers to are internal DOE  documents presented to GAO in 2008 and 2009 in response to questions  regarding nuclear cooperation agreements. These documents are not an  interagency agreed upon document, but reflects DOE\u2019s views on  determining which countries and facilities interagency physical protection  teams should visit. Further, DOE officials in July 2011 stated that DOE,  NRC, and State do not have an agreed-upon way to measure  performance in a systematic way, and that while the goals for the  monitoring and evaluation activities have not yet been formalized through  necessary updated documents, a prioritized list of countries to visit does  exist. These officials noted that the U.S. government is working to update  its planning documents and examining its methodology for prioritizing  physical protection visits. Any changes will be included in these updated  documents. Therefore, we continue to believe that DOE should work with  the other agencies to develop formal goals for and a systematic process  for determining which foreign facilities to visit for future physical protection  visits, and that the process should be formalized and agreed to by all  agencies.", "NRC commented that in order to demonstrate that U.S. nuclear material  located abroad is potentially insecure, GAO made an assessment based  on U.S. agencies not conducting activities which are, according to NRC,  neither authorized nor required by U.S. law or by agreements negotiated  under Section 123 of the AEA. In fact, we acknowledge that U.S.  agencies are not required to conduct certain activities or collect certain  information. Moreover, we do not suggest that agencies undertake  activities that are not authorized by law. We recommend that the  agencies either expand upon and refine outreach they are already  conducting, contingent on the willingness of our cooperation agreement  partners, or negotiate new terms in nuclear cooperation agreements as  necessary. If the agencies find that they are unable to negotiate new  terms we recommend that Congress consider amending the AEA to  require such terms.", "State commented that determining annual inventories and reconciliations  of nuclear material, as well as establishing enhanced facility-by-facility  reporting for those partners with which the United States already has an  annual inventory reconciliation is a DOE function, not a State function.  We agree that DOE plays a vital role in carrying out these activities\u2014 once such bilaterally agreed upon measures are in place. However, we  believe it is appropriate to recommend that the Department of State\u2014as  the agency with the lead role in any negotiation regarding the terms and  conditions of U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements\u2014work with DOE and  NRC to secure these measures with all U.S. partners. State also  commented that there is a cost to the U.S. nuclear industry in terms of  lost competitiveness should the requirements in U.S. nuclear cooperation  agreements be strengthened to include better access to critical facilities  for U.S. interagency physical protection teams. State provided no further  information to support this point. Our report acknowledges that any  change to the nuclear cooperation framework or authorizing legislation  will be very sensitive and that flexibility in the agreements is necessary.", "We also stated that it may be possible to change the framework of  agreements in a way that does not hamper the ability of the U.S. nuclear  industry to remain competitive. While we would not want to alter these  agreements in such a way that our nuclear industry is put at a competitive  disadvantage, in our view, the security of U.S. nuclear material overseas  should never be compromised to achieve a commercial goal.", "Finally, State asserted that interagency physical protection teams have  been granted access to every site they have requested under the  consultation terms of U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements. As a result,  State believes the provisions of the current agreements are adequate. As  we note in our report, access to partner facilities is not explicitly spelled  out in the agreements and, in our view, this is a limitation for the U.S.  agencies in obtaining timely and systematic access to partner nuclear  facilities. While State may be technically correct that access has been  granted, our report clearly shows that many sites believed to contain  Category I quantities of U.S. nuclear material have been visited only after  lengthy periods of time, or have not been visited at all. We continue to  believe that enhanced physical protection access measures could help  interagency teams ensure that they are able to visit sites containing U.S.  nuclear material in a timely, systematic, and comprehensive fashion.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretaries of Energy and State, the Chairman of the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and other interested parties.

We obtained data from the Nuclear Materials  Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS), a database jointly run  by DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which, among  other things, maintains data on U.S. peaceful use exports and retransfers  of enriched uranium and plutonium that have occurred since 1950, and  reviewed DOE and GAO reviews of the NMMSS database. To assess the  reliability of data in the NMMSS database, we interviewed officials from  DOE and NRC and a former DOE contractor to identify any limitations in  NMMSS\u2019s data on the location and status of U.S. material overseas and  found these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of accounting  for U.S. exports of nuclear material. We compared NMMSS data with  other official and unofficial DOE sources of information regarding U.S.  nuclear material transfers, including DOE data on nuclear material  returns, to determine the reliability of DOE\u2019s inventory data for U.S.  nuclear material transferred overseas. We reviewed DOE, NRC, and  other U.S. agency records and interviewed officials at those agencies to  determine the extent to which DOE, NRC, and State are able to identify  where U.S. nuclear material was exported, retransferred, and is currently  held. We selected a non-probability sample of partners based on, among  other considerations, quantities of U.S. special nuclear material  transferred to them. Results of interviews of non-probability samples are  not generalizeable to all partners but provide an understanding of those  partners\u2019 views of the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to account for its nuclear  material inventories overseas subject to nuclear cooperation agreement  terms. We conducted site visits in four countries holding U.S.-obligated  material and interviewed governmental officials and nuclear facility  operators in these countries to discuss material accounting procedures.  Further, we interviewed officials from five partners regarding their  observations about working with the U.S. government to account for  material subject to the terms of nuclear cooperation agreements. We  analyzed the texts of administrative arrangements with key countries to  determine the extent to which DOE conducts inventory reconciliations of  inventory transferred between the United States and a partner country.", "To assess DOE\u2019s and other U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to monitor and  evaluate the physical security conditions of U.S. nuclear material  overseas subject to nuclear cooperation agreement terms and describe  DOE\u2019s activities to secure or remove potentially vulnerable U.S. nuclear  material at partner facilities, we reviewed all U.S. nuclear cooperation  agreements in force, as well as other U.S. statutes, and IAEA\u2019s security  guidelines, \u201cThe Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear  Facilities,\u201d INFCIRC/225/Rev.4, and other relevant international  conventions to determine the extent to which such laws and international  conventions provide for DOE and U.S. agencies to monitor and evaluate  the physical security of transferred U.S. nuclear material subject to U.S.  nuclear cooperation agreement terms. We interviewed officials from DOE,  NRC, and the Department of State (State) to gain insights into how  effective their efforts are, and how their efforts might be improved. We  selected a nonprobability sample of partners based on, among other  considerations, quantities of U.S. special nuclear material transferred to  them and interviewed officials to determine how DOE and other U.S.  agencies work with partner countries to exchange views on physical  security and the process by which U.S. nuclear material is returned to the  United States. Results of interviews of non-probability samples are not  generalizeable to all partners but provide an understanding of those  partners\u2019 views of the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to monitor and evaluate  the physical security conditions of U.S. nuclear material overseas subject  to nuclear cooperation agreement terms. We also obtained and analyzed  the records of all available U.S. physical protection visits to partner  facilities from 1974 through 2010. We reviewed agency documents and  interviewed officials from DOE, NRC, and State regarding the policies and  procedures for determining which partners to visit, how they conducted  physical protection visits at partner facilities, and mechanisms for  following up on the results of these visits. In particular, we compared the  sites visited with NMMSS records of U.S. material exported and  retransferred, and other information to evaluate the extent to which U.S.  physical protection visits were made to all sites overseas containing U.S.  special nuclear material. We obtained written responses from Global  Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), and reviewed other information  regarding their program activities. To better understand IAEA\u2019s role in  maintaining safeguards and evaluating physical security measures, we  interviewed IAEA officials and reviewed relevant documents.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2010 to June 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
