Consumable supplies are items discarded after use rather than repaired. Through its wholesale system, DLA manages 3.6 million of DOD\u2019s 4.4 million consumable items. For about 30 years, DLA has generally bought items in large quantities, stored the items until the services requested them, and then shipped them to the services\u2019 retail facilities. To receive, store, and issue these items and other inventories to the military services and other DOD organizations throughout the world, DLA maintains over 1,400 warehouses at 27 distribution depots, which are DOD facilities with several large warehouses that store a variety of supplies, and also uses other storage locations.

During the 1980s, competition and increasing inventory costs forced many private sector companies to assess inventory management practices and to adopt new methods that reduced inventories and associated operating costs. Recognizing that inventories can be reduced without affecting supply availability, private sector companies began to change the way they buy, store, and distribute large quantities of supplies. The private sector has tried new techniques on consumable items because these items are generally standard and low unit cost, are commonly stocked by several suppliers, and are used in large quantities.", "Many private sector facilities are analogous to the services\u2019 facilities in DOD\u2019s supply system.

In the private sector, many companies avoid these types of problems by using inventory practices that shift responsibilities for storing and managing inventory to suppliers. In fact, companies that are using the most aggressive practices no longer store inventory in intermediate locations at all; their suppliers deliver inventory only when needed. As a result, we recommended that DOD test the applicability of using similar types of private sector practices as an alternative to its current multilayered system.

DOD often stored inventories in as many as four different layers. In 1992, at the wholesale level, DLA stored $11 billion worth of consumable items in distribution depots and warehouses located throughout the United States. Our analysis indicated that this inventory could last DOD an average of over 2 years based on past demand. At the retail level, the services hold inventory at three different layers near the locations where the items are used\u2014base warehouses, central storerooms, and end-user locations. Service facilities we visited had retail stock on hand sufficient to last from 1 month to over 5 years. Several factors contribute to this multilayered system, including DOD\u2019s philosophy of relying on large stock levels at wholesale and retail locations to readily meet customer needs and the long procurement lead times that require DOD to hold inventory to ensure items are available until ordered supplies are received from suppliers.", "The private sector provides a sharp contrast to DOD\u2019s methods of managing and distributing consumable items. Private sector companies have modified their inventory practices to reflect an increasingly competitive business environment. Companies have reduced their number of suppliers by establishing a close partnership with only a few key ones that are often close to the end-users\u2019 facilities. Typically, suppliers are contracted to manage and distribute a company\u2019s supplies for a particular commodity or class of items. By using aggressive direct delivery arrangements with the suppliers, companies bypass the need for intermediate storage and handling locations. Once end-users order supplies, the suppliers deliver the items directly to the end-users\u2019 facilities close to the time the items are needed, commonly called \u201cjust-in-time.\u201d This technique allows companies to eliminate unnecessary inventory layers and reduce on-hand inventories and operating costs. Figure 2.1 compares DOD\u2019s multilayered system with a just-in-time inventory system.", "Private sector companies that remain competitive in today\u2019s marketplace are able to hold less inventory, fill orders more quickly, turn stock over more frequently, and obtain replenishment supplies significantly faster than DOD.

Other companies adopted practices that located suppliers at a supplier park near industrial centers, which allowed hardware items to be delivered directly to end-users frequently and regularly. As a result, we recommended that DOD conduct tests to demonstrate the applicability of using concepts such as prime vendors and supplier parks to better manage inventories at DLA and military facilities.", "Summarized below are the key issues addressed in our reports on medical items, food, clothing and textiles, maintenance and repair items, and electronics items and the actions DOD has taken in response to our recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medical Inventory", "paragraphs": ["We reported that DOD\u2019s health care system could save millions of dollars by increased use of inventory management practices pioneered by leading civilian hospitals.

In addition, DLA, through its depot system, stored another layer of supplies that would last approximately 8 months. Some items in this system were packed in the 1940s and 1950s. Figure 2.3 shows the medical inventory in one warehouse at the DLA depot near Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.", "In contrast, very progressive civilian hospitals maintained much smaller levels and fewer layers of supplies and had no depot system. These hospitals, through improved ordering systems, standardization of supplies, and better communication with vendors, greatly reduced inventories by having prime vendors deliver supplies where and when needed. One hospital, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, reduced inventory levels from $4.5 million to $2.8 million (38 percent) between 1986 and 1991 by taking an aggressive approach to inventory management, including requiring its two prime vendors to deliver supplies within 4 hours of ordering.", "Due to the significant opportunities for DOD to save millions of dollars, we recommended in our December 1991 report on medical supplies that DOD test the use of inventory management practices pioneered by leading civilian hospitals such as using prime vendors to deliver supplies directly to medical facilities.

Military base warehouses also held large food inventories, worth about $200 million. As a result, food items often sat on shelves for months or even years before reaching end-users. When this occurs, food items can spoil and become unfit for human consumption. During visits to military installations, we found numerous items that had an extended inspection date\u2014the date food producers stamp on their products to indicate when the first signs of deteriorating food quality may be detected.", "The private sector avoided many of the problems experienced by the military food supply system by relying on prime vendors to move food from suppliers to end-users. Because of heavy competition within the food industry, prime vendors had a financial incentive to cut their costs, keep their prices low, and provide quality service. Prime vendors deal with end-users (such as hospitals, restaurants, and hotels) on a daily basis, including taking orders and making direct deliveries. By relying on the prime vendors, end-users do not incur the direct costs of holding, handling, and transporting food. As a result, we believed many of the costs DOD incurred managing food inventories were unnecessary because the commercial distribution network could supply food to DOD much more efficiently.", "Because of the possible inventory reductions and cost savings that could be achieved by using private sector techniques, we recommended in our June 1993 report that DOD conduct a demonstration project of an expanded use of prime vendors delivering food directly to military dining facilities.

Commercial firms, on the other hand, rely on prime vendors to manage their clothing inventories. Prime vendors use quick order and delivery systems to satisfy customer demands, relieving the need for large inventories and helping to avoid items deteriorating or becoming obsolete before they are used. One prime vendor we visited managed an agency\u2019s employee uniform program through a central database, which enabled order information to be transmitted directly to a distribution point and issued to a customer in a few days. The agency estimated it had saved at least 15 percent of the amount it had allocated for clothing items over the previous year.", "Because DOD\u2019s inventory practices for clothing items differed significantly to best practices used in the private sector, we recommended in our April 1994 report on clothing and textiles that DOD conduct a pilot project to demonstrate whether a prime vendor concept is beneficial in providing clothing items to military installations, particularly recruit induction centers.

In 1994, OSD issued its logistics strategic plan, which focused on achieving improvements in logistics system performance while reducing associated infrastructure costs.

A prime vendor is a distributor that has been awarded a contract to store and distribute various medical products to individual military hospitals, which reduces the need for DOD wholesale and retail systems. Under this concept, DLA negotiates prices for medical products directly with the manufacturers or suppliers. DLA then contracts with the prime vendor to buy the products at these prices and distribute the products directly to the military hospital within 24 hours of receiving an order. In most cases, the prime vendor charges a distribution fee for these services. Once the products are delivered to the hospitals, DLA pays the prime vendor within 15 days.", "The use of this concept has allowed DOD to reduce stock levels at both wholesale and retail locations.

Military hospitals we visited still held inventories that could last the hospitals an average of 42 to 82 days. In comparison, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center reduced or eliminated unnecessary inventory layers and decreased hospital inventory levels to between 2 and 15 days of supply by taking an aggressive approach to inventory management. Vanderbilt, by establishing a close partnership with its prime vendors, arranged for supplies to be delivered several times a day, in many cases, directly to the point of use within the medical center.

All four services are participating in the 1-year project, which includes military facilities located in metropolitan and rural areas as well as Navy ships. Through this project, military personnel electronically order food items from a distributor who is required to deliver the items to the dining facility within 48 hours. As a part of this test, DOD will measure the monetary cost and benefits, customer satisfaction, and distributor performance by comparing the traditional military food supply system to the prime vendor method. If this project is successful, DOD plans to expand the program to all dining facilities in the continental United States and ships by the end of fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clothing and Textile Prime Vendor Program", "paragraphs": ["Under a demonstration project that is expected to start in January 1996, a military service recruit induction center will test the prime vendor concept for clothing items.

Although DLA is examining the potential application of some commercial practices for hardware items, DLA\u2019s overall progress is slow and results are limited.", "The central focus of DLA\u2019s efforts to improve management of hardware items has been to expand the use of direct delivery programs at the wholesale level. By using long-term contracting agreements and electronic data interchange systems, DLA makes arrangements with manufacturers or suppliers to deliver items directly to the services\u2019 retail facilities. DLA expects the use of direct vendor delivery to result in better service and reduced inventory levels and to eliminate the cost of receiving, storing, and issuing these items from wholesale depots. In fiscal year 1994, DLA reported that 13 percent of its hardware dollar-value sales resulted from direct delivery programs at this level. According to DLA, it expects to increase the use of direct delivery programs so that they account for 30 percent of all hardware dollar-value sales by 1997.", "These direct delivery programs, however, neither eliminate costs to manage, store, and distribute items at a service\u2019s retail location nor provide the same quick response achieved through best inventory practices such as the supplier park concept. With direct delivery programs, requisitions are sent from the services to DLA, where the orders are then electronically relayed to the supplier or manufacturer. The length of time from requisition to delivery of the item can take 30 days or longer. In comparison, private sector companies using just-in-time techniques often receive supplies from their key suppliers within hours after ordering. The use of such techniques allows these companies to reduce or eliminate the need to manage, store, and distribute these items from warehouse locations at their facilities.", "DLA\u2019s direct delivery programs provide only incremental reductions from hardware inventory levels held in 1992. DLA estimates that hardware inventories of $8 billion in 1992 will decrease to $6.4 billion in 1997, or approximately 20 percent. As of June 1994, DLA\u2019s hardware inventories were valued at $7.8 billion. Much of this overall reduction will result from the disposing of excess and obsolete items. Even then, based on DLA\u2019s projected inventory and demand for the four groups of hardware items (construction, electronics, general, and industrial), it could have enough inventory on hand to last for an average between 795 days and 1,381 days (see fig. 3.4). In comparison, private sector suppliers of similar types of items often hold only 90 days of supply to meet customer needs.", "Companies have applied innovative practices at industrial centers where they use large quantities of consumable hardware items, such as bearings, valves, and fasteners, to maintain and repair their equipment. According to private sector officials, these items offer the greatest opportunity because they are generally standard, used in large quantities, and commonly stocked by several suppliers. Through concepts like supplier parks, companies have reduced similar types of inventories and the costs to manage and store them. For example, PPG Industries and Bethlehem Steel Corporation have used supplier parks and similar just-in-time concepts to eliminate as much as 80 percent of their consumable item inventories. In addition, these companies estimate that they have saved millions in related operating costs.", "In September 1994, DLA contracted for a study of the feasibility of using supplier parks at three maintenance and repair facilities. In December 1994, the contractor reported that the concept of a supplier park was feasible and strongly recommended that DLA give serious consideration to using this concept at these facilities. The study concluded that a supplier park concept would provide enhanced customer support in terms of quicker response times and improved material availability while reducing both operating and inventory costs at DLA depots and maintenance and repair facilities. The contractor estimated a first year savings between $9.9 million and $16.8 million to DOD.

Private sector companies have moved away from this philosophy in an attempt to lower the cost of doing business, provide better service, and remain competitive. Private sector companies have changed their philosophy by relying on established commercial distribution networks where suppliers have a financial incentive to make their operations efficient and achieve savings. In response to competition, these suppliers must be extremely cost conscious and responsive to their customers in order to stay in business. DOD can achieve similar results by adopting a philosophy in which it relies more on the existing distribution network that supports the private sector.", "Another factor is that DOD will be continuously challenged to identify and adopt the best practices being used to improve logistics operations. Private sector companies that have achieved the greatest success continually seek new and better practices to further improve operations. For example, Vanderbilt University Medical Center officials told us that they plan to take the next step with their inventory system by controlling inventory consumption through closer supply arrangements with its prime vendor. According to these officials, the latest concept involves a risk-sharing strategy designed around the development of an agreed upon cost per medical treatment. Under this arrangement, the doctors, nurses, and the prime vendor agree on a standard medical supplies listing for each type of medical treatment. When a patient is admitted to the hospital for treatment, the prime vendor will be notified and a standard set of supplies will be delivered to the patient\u2019s floor. This concept is expected to minimize the amount of supplies used by the hospital staff to that amount necessary to perform the required treatment. The monetary risks and benefits of this arrangement are shared by both the prime vendor and the hospital."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["DOD has made progress in adopting best inventory practices for consumable items, but it could do more to further reduce inventories and operating costs. Private sector companies that have successfully adopted innovative just-in-time concepts for consumable items have taken several key steps. First, they selected high usage, low unit cost items to test these practices. Second, they arranged for suppliers to make small, frequent deliveries of these items to a point close to where the items are used. As they gained confidence in this new system and as suppliers refined the distribution process, the companies expanded this service to include a wider range of items. Finally, they established a close partnership between the supplier and end-user, thereby enabling the supplier to use its expertise and the pre-existing distribution network to maximize savings for its customers. As discussed in chapter 2, these savings can result in as much as an 80-percent reduction in inventory levels and in millions of dollars in lower annual operating costs.", "For personnel items, which represent 23 percent of DLA\u2019s inventory, DLA is beginning to take similar steps. The most successful program to date is the pharmaceutical prime vendor program, which is now in place at DOD hospitals nationwide. Thus far, DLA\u2019s implementation of the prime vendor concept has reduced wholesale pharmaceutical inventories by 49 percent. At the retail level, one of the most aggressive DOD medical facilities applying this concept is the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which has reported an inventory reduction of $3.8 million and a estimated savings of over $6 million annually in related inventory management expenses. To accomplish these savings, Walter Reed has turned over much of its inventory management responsibilities to the prime vendor.", "However, the aggressive steps taken by Walter Reed are not typical of those throughout all of the DOD medical facilities we visited. Because each service has used the prime vendor\u2019s services differently, and some even continue to retain unnecessary inventory layers, DOD has not realized the same improvements that progressive civilian hospitals have achieved. In fact, military hospitals we visited still held inventories that could last for many weeks compared to just days for some leading civilian hospitals. DOD\u2019s approach neither eliminates unnecessary inventory storage locations nor allows hospitals to fully use the inventory management expertise of the prime vendor. Under this approach, a partnership environment may not fully develop.", "For hardware items, which represent 77 percent of its inventory and a $7.8-billion investment, DLA has not taken the steps necessary to adopt just-in-time concepts. DOD operates industrial facilities that use large quantities of hardware items to repair and maintain aircraft, land vehicles, and ships. At these facilities, DOD uses the same types of hardware items for which private sector companies have established supplier parks and other innovative concepts that transfer management responsibilities to their suppliers and reduce inventory levels. Although we recommended a DOD test of the supplier park concept in our June 1993 report, it is still studying the feasibility of the concept 2 years later."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the medical prime vendor programs are more consistently and aggressively applied, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the secretaries of each of the military services to use the prime vendor program in enhancing the partnership between the DOD medical facilities and the prime vendors.
