Some types of military forces adapt more easily to peace operations. For example, support units providing food and supplies to troops participating in the Somalia peace operation performed the same functions they would in a more traditional combat operation but in a less centralized fashion because forces were spread out over 21,000 square miles. They also had additional responsibilities because they had to provide most of their own security.", "The tasks an infantry unit performs in a peace operation may be similar to the tasks it would encounter in combat, but they may be performed differently because the operating conditions, including rules of engagement, will be different. The peace operation in Haiti, for example, required that infantry units conduct mounted and dismounted patrols day and night, perform cordon and search, carry out reconnaissance, and provide security. These tasks are typically performed in a combat operation. However, in Haiti the night patrols were conducted under full illumination, as a show of presence, rather than in a more stealthy manner, as is the case in war. Further, in the cordon and search operations, before the military entered a building, occupants were given an opportunity to leave peacefully, and searches were conducted with limited inconvenience to the populace. This procedure reduced the level of violence and collateral damage that is likely to occur in war.", "DOD and non-DOD studies and our own work on this subject indicate that, even though there can be considerable overlap between skills required for peace operations and those required in war, personnel assigned to peace operations missions need some degree of additional preparation.", "Increasingly, military officials have recognized that peace operations pose a different set of challenges for the military, particularly ground forces. The Army\u2019s peace operations field manual states that units selected for these duties may be required to perform tasks that may be different from their wartime tasks and that training will be required. Military officials have noted that forces must learn to adjust to the unique rules of peace operations, such as restrained use of force.

As a result of the shoot down of two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters participating in Operation Provide Comfort in Turkey in April 1994, the Air Force has increased training requirements for many of the Air Force units participating in peace operations. For example, to better prepare for peace operations missions, the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) crews are undergoing (1) increased and improved study of the rules of engagement, including situational exercises, prior to deployment; (2) better predeployment training, including a certification briefing for their squadron commanders demonstrating their readiness for flying in the specific area of responsibility; and (3) increased training at the deployed location, including another formal, documented certification process. In addition, the Air Force has issued guidance for (1) fighter combat crew training to incorporate theater-specific rules of engagement and situational training into academic, simulator, and flying training; (2) major commands to develop a standard training program on theater orientation; and (3) the fielding of a computer-based aircrew visual identification training program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ground Combat Commanders Differ on When to Provide Peace Operations Training", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Commanders Incorporate Peace Operations Into Standard Unit Training", "paragraphs": ["Traditionally, Army and Marine Corps units begin training for the unique aspects of peace operations after the units have been notified of their participation.

These items included blinding lasers (which destroy or degrade optics or electronic devices) and several antipersonnel systems such as dazzling lasers, low frequency infrasound, and radio frequency systems.", "The Marine Corps formed a team that (1) developed and provided training on nonlethal systems and tactics to a selected battalion and (2) served as advisors in Somalia. One company within the battalion was designated as the primary force to use nonlethal equipment ashore. Marines from this company, however, also carried lethal weapons or lethal ammunition that could be used in lieu of nonlethal weapons or munitions if the situation required the use of deadly force. In addition, other Marines were armed with lethal weapons to ensure force protection. The unit equipped with nonlethal weapons received about 30 days of training on the equipment.", "The Marine Corps learned a number of lessons from its experience with nonlethal technology in Somalia. In responding to our questions on the use on nonlethal equipment, senior I MEF officials who planned and participated in the operation stated that the experience revealed shortcomings in the U.S. capability to identify and deploy military nonlethal systems. Specifically, because a joint task force commander should have a wide range of alternatives to control belligerents, they stated that nonlethal systems need to be developed and acquired in sufficient quantities to deploy with a task force.", "In a written response to us, the I MEF Commanding General expressed the need for separate, distinct, and flexible rules of engagement for nonlethal weapons and for training exercises to stress rules of engagement decisions at the tactical level. According to the response, limiting the use of less lethal technologies to the same conditions as deadly force in the rules of engagement caused confusion at all levels during Operation United Shield and was self-defeating. The systems could only be used under the same circumstances as lethal weapons, which would be when the security situation had already become critical. While the Marines made the situation work, it was not how they would have preferred to operate, according to the Commanding General. In responding to a draft of this report, DOD took issue with I MEF\u2019s position on rules of engagement, stating that there should be one clear, unambiguous set of rules of engagement.", "Because nonlethal weapons are new and evolving, neither the Marine Corps nor any other service has doctrine or training standards for their use. Consequently, to ensure the availability of nonlethal equipment and trained personnel for future operations, the officials recognized the need for doctrine, training, and approved nonlethal systems.", "The officials also suggested that public information on the military\u2019s use of nonlethal weapons needs to convey that nonlethal means will be used to control unarmed crowds and will not substitute for deadly force when it is justified. Also, personnel using nonlethal weapons will always be protected by others armed with lethal weapons. Lastly, the Marines learned how certain equipment is best used, and they pointed out that the decision to employ nonlethal options needs to be made at the lowest possible level due to the fluidity of situations and short response time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy on Nonlethal Weapons Is Being Developed", "paragraphs": ["Nonlethal weapons present unique legal and policy concerns. Because of these concerns, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict has drafted a policy statement\u2014currently under review\u2014governing the use of nonlethal weapons. The draft policy defines nonlethal weapons and would establish the policy of using them to allow the maximum possible flexibility in the employment of U.S. military forces across the spectrum of conflict. It points out that nonlethal weapons might be used in some circumstances to achieve military or political objectives while minimizing human fatalities and undesired harm to property or the environment. In operations other than war, the draft policy states that nonlethal weapons can be used to discourage, delay, or prevent hostile actions; limit escalation; take military action where intervention is desirable but use of lethal force would be inappropriate; and better protect U.S. forces once deployed. Nonlethal weapons can provide an effective, reversible, or more humanitarian means of denying an enemy the use of human and material assets and may also reduce the postwar economic cost of rebuilding.", "The draft policy places responsibility on the military services for developing and acquiring nonlethal weapons and developing doctrine, employment concepts, tactics, training, and logistics support for fielded systems. Priority is to be placed on acquiring the technology to support the following tasks: neutralizing combatants intermingled with noncombatants; controlling crowds; disabling or disrupting military logistics; disabling or disrupting communication, transportation, and energy infrastructure; and incapacitating/immobilizing weapons or weapon development and production processes.", "The military services recognize the need to develop doctrine and training programs for this rapidly developing technology. The Army Training and Doctrine Command has drafted a concept paper for nonlethal capabilities in Army operations. It points out that crowd control in conducting peacekeeping and humanitarian operations is as likely a task for the Army as is destroying enemy armor and infantry forces in war. The paper discusses how the Army will use nonlethal capabilities as a component of \u201coverwhelming, decisive power\u201d in military operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels and describes implications for doctrine, training, leadership development, organization, materiel, and support. Types of capabilities needed include those that (1) immobilize, disorient, impair, or disperse people; (2) disable systems; (3) provide security and surveillance; and (4) attack material support systems and infrastructure. The Marine Corps\u2019 experience with nonlethal weapons in Somalia underscored the need to ensure the proper use of nonlethal equipment in the future. On the basis of lessons identified from I MEF, the Marine Corps is considering doctrine for the use of nonlethal weapons."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred with a draft of this report but noted that it should include discussions of (1) peace operations training that has been conducted as part of the Partnership for Peace Program and (2) reserve force participation in peace operations. We have revised the report to include information about training provided by recent Partnership for Peace initiatives. We also revised our Objectives, Scope, and Methodology section to state that we did not report on reserve component participation in peace operations because the training provided for these missions was not significantly different than training for standard reserve missions, and, except in a few cases, the number of reserve component forces participating in these operations was relatively small.", "DOD took issue with I MEF\u2019s view described in our report concerning rules of engagement for the employment of nonlethal weapons, stating that there should be one clear, unambiguous set of rules of engagement.
