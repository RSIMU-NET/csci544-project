NRSRO critics often point to the conflict of interest created by the industry\u0092s predominant compensation model in which issuers of securities pay the rating agencies for their ratings (issuer-pays model). In 2006, Congress established Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight over NRSROs, and recently enhanced this authority through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). This act also requires GAO to study alternative means for compensating NRSROs. This report discusses (1) alternative models for compensating NRSROs and (2) SEC\u0092s actions to implement the act\u0092s requirements specific to its oversight of NRSROs. To do this work, GAO leveraged its 2010 report on NRSROs (GAO-10-782), reviewed comment letters submitted to SEC as part of its study of alternative compensation models, proposed and finalized rules issued under the act; and interviewed SEC staff and authors of alternative compensation models ."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of January 2012, GAO identified seven alternative models for compensating NRSROs (see table below). These models generally were designed to address the conflict of interest in the issuer-pays model, better align the NRSROs\u0092 interest with users of ratings, or improve incentives NRSROs have to produce reliable and high-quality ratings. However, the amount of detail currently available for each model varies and none has been implemented. According to some of the authors of the models, there is little incentive to continue developing these models because it appears unlikely they will receive attention from regulators or legislators. For example, these authors noted that SEC had not reached out to them to further discuss these models as part of its ongoing study of alternative compensation models for credit rating agencies.", "During debate on the Dodd-Frank Act, a model similar to the random-selection model was proposed through an amendment that would have added a section 15E(w) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15E(w) model). Although the amendment was not included in the final legislation, section 939F of the Dodd- Frank Act requires SEC to study, among other things, alternative means for compensating NRSROs. It also authorizes SEC to, upon completion of the study, establish by rule a system for assigning NRSROs to determine initial credit ratings and monitor the ratings of structured finance products in a manner that prevents the arranger from selecting the NRSRO that will determine the credit rating should SEC conclude that an alternative system is necessary or appropriate. In issuing any rule, SEC also must give thorough consideration to the section 15E(w) model and implement the model unless it determines that an alternative would better serve the public interest and protect investors. As part of its solicitation of comments for its ongoing study of alternative compensation models, SEC requested that interested parties use the framework GAO developed in the 2010 report on NRSROs to evaluate the section 15E(w) and other models. GAO created this evaluative framework to help identify the relative strengths and weaknesses and potential trade offs (in terms of policy goals) of the models. Based on GAO\u0092s analysis of comment letters to SEC, while a number of comment letters generally favored implementing the section 15E(w) model, slightly more opposed the implementation of any of the models. Those supporting the 15E(w) model highlighted the need to address the conflict of interests inherent in the issuer-pays model. Those opposed to the alternative compensation models cited concerns of replacing one set of conflicts of interest with another and the costs of implementation. A number of the letters either supported or made suggestions for improving existing SEC rules. A few comment letters also raised legal questions about the implementation or rulemaking for specific aspects of certain models.", "In addition to studying alternative compensation models, SEC has begun to implement a number of Dodd-Frank Act requirements pertaining to NRSROs. These requirements include additional rulemakings related to NRSROs\u0092 disclosures of performance statistics, credit ratings methodologies, third-party due diligence for asset-backed securities, and analyst training and testing standards. Of nine rulemaking requirements, SEC has adopted three final rules that implement all or part of certain requirements and proposed rules for the remaining requirements. SEC also has been working to establish an Office of Credit Ratings as required by the act. Moreover, SEC examination staff completed the first cycle of annual examinations of each NRSRO as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and published their summary report in September 2011. As part of its study on alternative compensation models for NRSROs, SEC solicited comment on SEC\u0092s authority to implement various alternative compensation models. According to SEC staff, they are reviewing the comment letters received and evaluating authority issues. Any recommendations for regulatory or statutory changes SEC determines should be made to implement the findings of the study are to be included in their report to Congress, due in July 2012. The model authors\u0092 opinions of the extent to which statutory changes would be needed to implement their alternative compensation models vary, with one stating that current law provides SEC with the necessary authority and another anticipating the need for legislation. Given that NRSROs continue to primarily use the issuer-pays, and to a lesser extent, the subscriber-pays models, the use of any alternative model or models would likely have to be at the direction of SEC or Congress. However, the extent to which SEC\u0092s existing authorities would allow it to implement any of the alternative models by rule largely will depend on the alternative model or models selected. Obtaining as complete information on the models as available, such as by consulting with the models\u0092 authors, will be important for SEC to fully assess each model in order to make its decision and any recommendations for statutory changes SEC determines should be made to implement the findings of its section 939Fstudy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["SEC should consult with the authors of the proposed models to obtain all available information as it considers the various alternative compensation models and any recommendations for", "statutory changes SEC determines should be made to implement the findings of its section 939F study.

Other requirements relate to  disclosures of performance statistics, credit ratings methodologies, third- party due diligence for asset-backed securities, and analyst training and  testing standards. In addition, section 939F requires SEC to study, among  other things, the credit rating process for structured finance products and  associated conflicts of interest, the feasibility of establishing a system in  which a public or private utility or a self-regulatory organization assigns  NRSROs to determine the credit ratings of structured finance products,  and alternative means for compensating NRSROs that would create  incentives for accurate credit ratings (hereafter referred to as the 939F  study).

Since then, SEC has  used the NRSRO designation in a number of regulations, and the term  has been embedded in numerous federal and state laws and regulations,  investment guidelines, and private contracts. As will be discussed, SEC  has issued a series of proposals regarding the removal of references to  credit ratings in its regulations in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act.", "NRSRO credit ratings are intended to measure the likelihood of default for  an issue or issuer, although some also measure variables such as the  expected value of dollar losses given a default. The NRSROs describe  ratings as being intended only to reflect credit risk, not other valuation  factors such as liquidity or price risk. To determine an appropriate rating,  analysts at rating agencies use publicly available information and market  and economic data, and may hold discussions and obtain nonpublic  information from the issuer.", "Issuers seek credit ratings for reasons such as improving the  marketability or pricing of their securities or satisfying investors, lenders,  or counterparties. Institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension  funds, and insurance companies, are among the largest owners of debt  securities in the United States and are substantial users of credit ratings.  Institutional investors may use credit ratings as one of several inputs to  their internal credit assessments and investment analyses, or to identify  pricing discrepancies for their trading operations. Broker-dealers also use  ratings to recommend and sell securities to their clients or determine  acceptable counterparties, and collateral levels for outstanding credit  exposures.", "CRARA established SEC oversight of credit rating agencies registered as  NRSROs. Specifically, CRARA added section 15E to the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 to provide SEC with examination authority and  establish a registration program for credit rating agencies seeking  NRSRO designation. SEC adopted final rules for a formal registration and  oversight program for NRSROs in June 2007. SEC amended several of  these rules in February and December 2009 with the goal of further  increasing transparency of NRSRO rating methodologies, strengthening  the disclosures of ratings performance, prohibiting NRSROs from  engaging in certain practices, and enhancing NRSRO record keeping.", "Since the implementation of CRARA, SEC has registered 10 credit rating  agencies as NRSROs. One of these credit rating agencies has recently  withdrawn from registration as an NRSRO.pays compensation model and three operate primarily under the  subscriber-pays compensation model, in which users pay a subscription  fee to the NRSRO for access to its ratings. Despite the growth in the  number of NRSROs and the availability of credit ratings from NRSROs  operating under a subscriber-pays model, the market remains highly  concentrated. In 2011, SEC reported that the three largest NRSROs  (Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s Investment Services, and Fitch Ratings)  issued approximately 97 percent of all outstanding ratings. Furthermore,  NRSROs operating under the issuer-pays model issued approximately 99  percent of the total currently outstanding NRSRO credit ratings.  Economists note that the credit rating industry has exhibited a high level  of concentration throughout much of its history. SEC and others have  noted that the regulatory use of ratings, economies of scale, high fixed  costs, and network effects (the value or utility of products or services  increasing with the number of users) as factors that have created barriers  to entry and led to concentration in the credit rating industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Developments on Alternative Compensation Models Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["In our 2010 report, we identified five proposed models\u2014random  selection, investor-owned credit rating agency, stand-alone, designation,  user-pays\u2014and summarized key features of these proposed models.", "When we conducted our 2010 study, the level of development for each  model varied and none had been implemented.

According to some of the authors of these models, there is little incentive  to continue developing these models, as the issue of alternative  compensation models for NRSROs and their possible implementation  appears unlikely to receive much, if any, attention from regulators or  legislators.

The clearinghouse could be a nonprofit,  a governmental agency such as SEC, or a private-public partnership that  would design the criteria by which new entrants could qualify as a credit  rating agency. All issuers or sponsors that wanted ratings for their  issuances would request them from the clearinghouse, which would use a  random number generator to assign an NRSRO registered in the relevant  asset class to produce the rating. The clearinghouse would notify the  NRSRO of the opportunity to rate the issuance and provide basic  information on the type of issuance but not the issuer\u2019s name. Not until  the NRSRO agreed to complete the rating would the clearinghouse  identify the issuer and details of the issuance. If the selected NRSRO  agreed to rate the issuance, the issuer would pay a fee to the  clearinghouse. The issuer also would pay to cover clearinghouse costs on  top of those required to rate the security. Upon completion of the initial  and maintenance ratings, the clearinghouse would distribute the fees to  the NRSRO. The clearinghouse would set the ratings fees for the NRSRO  depending on the type of security issued, but the letter rating would be  free of charge to the public.", "The proposed model incorporates a peer comparison review to create an  incentive for NRSROs to produce quality ratings. As part of this review,  the clearinghouse would evaluate the performance of all NRSROs on the  basis of two empirical tests. For instance, if the default percentage of debt  instruments rated by a given NRSRO differed from the default percentage  of its peers by a set parameter, then the NRSRO would be subject to  sanctions such as losing a percentage of business or rating fees. A  second test would compare annual yields of identically rated debt  securities from different asset classes. Securities in different asset  classes that are rated similarly should have the same yield. An NRSRO  would be subject to sanctions if the yields of identically rated securities  differed by a certain threshold.", "According to the author of this proposed model, by eliminating the linkage  between the NRSRO and the issuer, this model would eliminate the  conflict of interest stemming from the issuer-pays model. Furthermore,  the author stated that the peer comparison review coupled with economic  sanctions for poor performance would motivate the NRSROs to  continually adjust their models and produce quality ratings.", "Under this model, sophisticated investors\u2014referred to as \u201chighly  sophisticated institutional purchasers\u201d in the model\u2014would create and  operate an NRSRO that would produce ratings. Issuers would have to  obtain two ratings\u2014one from the investor-owned NRSRO and the second  from their choice of NRSRO. More specifically, an NRSRO could not  publicly release a rating for which an issuer or sponsor paid unless the  NRSRO received written notification that the issuer had paid an investor- owned NRSRO to publicly release its rating. The investor-owned NRSRO  would publish its rating on or before the date on which the solicited  NRSRO published its rating.", "Institutional investors would have to qualify as highly sophisticated  institutional purchasers before forming or joining an investor-owned  agency. To qualify, an institutional investor would have to demonstrate  that it was large and sophisticated, managed billions of dollars in assets,  and could be relied upon to represent the buy-side interest in accurately  rating debt market instruments. The investor-purchasers would hold  majority voting and operational control over the agency, which could be  for-profit or not-for-profit. Market forces would set the agency fees, which  likely would be comparable to fees currently charged by dominant  NRSROs. The letter rating and the underlying research would be free to  the public.", "Proponents of this model believe that it would improve the rating process  by changing incentive structures. They said that investor-owned agencies  would introduce new competition to the industry and balance the  investors\u2019 interests against issuers\u2019 interests.", "NRSROs would only be permitted to produce credit ratings in this  proposed model. They could interact with and advise organizations being  rated, but could not charge fees for advice. Instead of receiving issuer  fees, the NRSROs would be compensated through transaction fees for  original issuance and secondary market transactions. The issuer or  secondary-market seller would pay part of the fee, and the investor  purchasing the security (in the primary or secondary market) would pay  the other part. The NRSRO would be compensated over the life of the  security based on these transaction fees. The letter rating would be free  to the public.", "Proponents of this model believe that by creating a funding source  beyond the influence of both issuers and investors, NRSROs would focus  on producing the most accurate and timely credit analysis rather than on  satisfying the desires of any other vested interest.", "In this proposed model, all NRSROs could opt to rate a new issuance and  security holders would direct, or designate, fees to the NRSROs of their  choice. When an issuer brought a security to market, it would have to  provide all interested NRSROs with the information to rate the issuance  and pay rating fees to a third-party administrator, which would manage  the designation process. The investors that purchased the debt  issuance would each designate one or several NRSROs that rated the  security to receive fees, based on their perception of research underlying  the ratings. The third-party administrator would disburse the fees in  accordance with the designations. After the initial rating, the issuer  would continue to pay maintenance rating fees to the third-party  administrator. A final rating fee would be paid in conjunction with the  retirement (or repurchase) of the security. The letter rating would be free  to the public, while the research underlying it would be distributed to  security holders and (at the discretion of the relevant NRSROs) to  potential security holders.", "The authors of this proposed model said it would eliminate conflicts of  interest resulting from issuers paying for ratings and increase competition  by allowing all NRSROs access to the information necessary to rate any  issuance. The authors also stated that this model encourages NRSROs  to prepare ratings because each NRSRO that did could profit from its  ratings to the extent investors or other users find the ratings useful.", "Issuers would not pay for ratings under this proposed model; rather, all  users of ratings would enter into a contract with an NRSRO and pay for  rating services. The proposal defines \u201cuser\u201d as any entity that included a  rated security, loan, or contract as an element of its assets or liabilities as  recorded in an audited financial statement. For example, users could be  holders of long or short positions in a fixed-income instrument, parties  that refer to a credit rating in contractual commitments (that is, as parties  to a lease), or parties to derivative products that rely on rated securities or  entities. A user would have to pay for ratings services supplied during  each period in which it booked the related asset or liability.", "The proposed model relies on third-party auditors to ensure that NRSROs  receive payment for their services from users of ratings. The user would  have to demonstrate to the auditors that the holder of a rated instrument  or contract paid for the rating services. Until auditors were satisfied that  NRSROs had been properly compensated, they would not issue audit  opinions. The model would require the close cooperation of the auditing  community and the Public Company Auditing Oversight Board.", "The authors of this model stated that, while more cumbersome, the model  attempts to capture \u201cfree riders\u201d\u2014those users of ratings that do not  compensate NRSROs for the use of their intellectual property\u2014and  requires them to pay for ratings.", "The alternative user-pays model would pool creditors\u2019 resources to  secure ratings before debt was issued. A government agency or  independent board would administer a user-fee system financed by debt  purchasers, which would fund a competitive bidding process for the  selection of rating agencies. The agency or board would solicit ratings  before the debt issuance and then pay for the expense and related  administrative costs through the user fee. The user fee could be  assessed through a flat fraction of a percentage fee on the initial  purchasers of debt offerings. The user fee would allow the agency or  board to finance initial ratings on a rolling basis, with the ratings for a  given debt issuance being secured before the issuance of the debt.  Although the fee could be assessed in many ways, the author of the  model suggests a one-time fee at initial sale for administrative ease.", "NRSROs would bid on the right to issue ratings with the agency or board  determining how best to judge the bids and award the right to rate the  issuance. For example, the agency or board could weigh factors such as  price, extent of diligence the NRSRO proposed to undertake, and the  disclosures the NRSRO would demand from issuers as a condition for the  rating. The author believes the bidding process would serve to contain the  costs for ratings through price competition, level the playing field for  smaller competitors and new entrants, and balance the desire for market- based assessments of risk with a greater role for the government agency,  such as SEC, or an independent board in defining rating agencies\u2019  responsibilities.", "According to its author, this user-fee model creates additional  accountability mechanisms. Users of ratings would be given enforceable  rights and would require NRSROs to assume certification and mandatory  reporting duties to creditors. The system would set up creditor  committees that would serve as a channel for creditors to monitor ratings  and assert limited rights against NRSROs. If an NRSRO breached duties  owed to the creditors, the committee would serve as the representative in  any potential actions and preempt actions brought by individual creditors.  The model would require that all contracts with NRSROs detail duties  owed to their creditors, to delineate the potential liability exposure for  breach of these duties, and channel adjudication of any disputes to an  SEC administrative process. For example, NRSROs could be required to  certify on a quarterly basis that they exercised reasonable care in  conducting due diligence of issuers\u2019 financial and nonfinancial disclosures  to make accurate assessments of risk exposure. To provide NRSROs  with incentives for compliance without jeopardizing their financial viability,  the model would limit NRSRO financial liability to cases of gross  negligence, coupled with an earnings-based cap on liability and other  safeguards.", "This proposed model incorporates characteristics from a number of the  models described earlier and leverages an existing structure as the basis  for collecting and distributing ratings fees. Under the proposed issuer and  investor-pays model, accredited NRSROs would be assigned to rate new  issuances. Initially, all NRSROs would be placed in a continuous queue  and would receive rating assignments when their respective numbers  came up, unless they were unable or unwilling to rate a particular issue.  In the future, ratings would be assigned based on the performances of the  NRSROs, with those agencies that produced superior performance  receiving more assignments. Performance would be measured as the  correlation between an NRSRO\u2019s ratings and default and recovery rates  on issues rated, and tracked using a common, transparent, and  defensible methodology. To help ensure rigor and fairness, at least two  and possibly three NRSROs would be assigned to rate each issuance.", "Payments for ratings would come from a fee levied on issuers of new  debt issues and investors as parties of secondary market trades. These  fees would be deposited in a dedicated fund\u2014the U.S. Ratings Fund\u2014 and would be determined and reset periodically. The periodic review  would consider the historic and projected volumes of primary issuances  and of secondary market trading to determine a fee that would in the  aggregate allow the ratings business to attract and retain qualified  individuals. This fund would be modeled after the Municipal Securities  Rulemaking Board (MSRB), which is authorized to collect fees on new  and secondary market municipal issues to fund its activities, and would  be overseen by a governing board representing issuers, investors, rating  agencies, intermediaries, and independent directors. The fees collected  would be used to pay the selected accredited NRSROs for issuing each  solicited rating and other necessary administrative activities such as  tracking NRSRO\u2019s performance and tracking deals to be rated. The  authors note that these other activities could be outsourced or performed  by the U.S. Ratings Fund. The Fund also would advise SEC on the  eligibility and accreditation of the NRSROs. All ratings and related  research reports paid for through the U.S. Ratings Fund would be freely  available to the public.", "According to the authors, NRSROs would have incentives to provide  accurate ratings and be objective because ratings would be monitored by  a regulator and the accreditation of NRSROs would be subject to periodic  renewal. The authors also note that legislation likely would be required to  set up the new rating agency compensation model. Specifically, the  authors said that legislation would need to enumerate the functions and  the governance structure of the U.S. Ratings Fund, provide its mandate  and methodology for determining the fees to be charged for ratings, and  elaborate on how the new rating model would be introduced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comment Letters to SEC Supported Implementing One Alternative Model or Enhancing Existing Rules", "paragraphs": ["During debate on the Dodd-Frank Act, a system similar to the random  selection model was proposed through an amendment to the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934.

The Board would determine NRSROs that are  eligible to issue initial credit ratings for structured finance products and  assign NRSROs to rate the issuances (NRSROs could decline). The  method for selecting the qualified NRSROs would be based on a Board  evaluation of alternatives designed to reduce the conflicts of interest  under the issuer-pays model, including a lottery or rotational assignment  system.

SEC omitted the random selection model  from its request for comment because it is similar to the section 15E(w)  model.

None of  the comment letters supported any of the other alternative compensation  models described by SEC in its request for comment.addressed the alternative models individually and all were critical of these  alternatives.", "Only the section 15E(w) model received specific support from those that  supported the implementation of an alternative compensation model.  Generally, these letters highlighted the need to address the conflict of  interest inherent in the issuer-pays model. For example, one commenter  stated that an assignment system\u2014such as the one proposed in the  model\u2014best serves the public interest by increasing competition to allow  for new NRSRO participants. The author of another comment letter stated  that on balance he favored a system\u2014such as the one proposed in the  15E(w) model\u2014that would separate issuer payment for ratings on  structured finance products from issuer selection of NRSROs.", "Those opposed to the implementation of an alternative compensation  model, including the section 15E(w) model, cited concerns such as  replacing one set of conflicts of interest with another and raised issues  about the cost of implementation. According to a few comment letters,  each of the proposed models presents its own unique set of issues and  often substitutes one type of conflict of interest for another. For example,  one comment letter stated that each compensation model has  unavoidable conflicts of interest and that none of the alternatives  presented by SEC would offer practical or effective solutions to the risks  of potential conflicts engendered by the issuer-pays model. Another  comment letter cited specific conflicts various market participants may  have, concluding that changing \u201cwho pays\u201d the credit rating agency will  not eliminate the potential for conflicts: it will only shift the conflicts from  one set of interested parties to another. Comment letters also stated  that some of the models would create large costs. For example, one  comment letter stated that the selection board created in the section  15E(w) model would need to employ a significant staff with highly  specialized skills to credibly carry out its responsibilities. Another letter  described the extensive amount of infrastructure that would be needed to  assess fees on each trade, such as those required by the stand-alone  model.", "Rule 17g-5 requires an NRSRO hired to determine initial credit ratings for structured  finance products to maintain a password-protected Internet website containing a list of  each such structured finance product for which it currently is in the process of determining  an initial credit rating. The rule is designed to make it more difficult for arrangers to exert  influence over the NRSRO they hire because any inappropriate rating could be exposed to  the market through the unsolicited ratings issued by NRSROs not hired to rate the  structured finance product. However, the rule limits the number of times an NRSRO can  access the information without having to produce its own credit ratings. An NRSRO that  accesses information 10 or more times during the calendar year must produce a credit  rating for at least 10 percent of the issues for which it accessed information.

Of the 15 requirements for SEC contained in Title IX of the  Dodd-Frank Act, 9 require SEC to issue rules. As of January 2012, SEC  has adopted three final rules that implement all or part of certain  requirements and proposed rules to implement the remaining  requirements. Specifically, SEC has adopted rules removing the  exemption for NRSROs from the Fair Disclosure Rule; requiring NRSROs  to include a report accompanying a credit rating for an asset-backed  security describing representations, warranties, and enforcement  mechanisms available to investors; and removing references to NRSRO  credit ratings from certain securities registration requirements. SEC has  also proposed a number of amendments to existing rules or new rules to  implement the remainder of the Dodd-Frank Act requirements applicable  to NRSROs. Table 1 provides a summary of these proposals.", "In addition to its work on NRSRO oversight rules, SEC continues to work  on other Dodd-Frank Act requirements related to NRSROs. These  requirements include completing four studies on various aspects of the  credit rating industry. As of January 2012, SEC has completed one of  the four studies and issued a report which provided a summary of SEC  regulations requiring the use of an assessment of the creditworthiness of  a security or money market instrument and any references to or  requirements in such regulations regarding credit ratings. According to  SEC\u2019s website, SEC plans to complete two of the remaining three studies  by July 2012; the completion date for the other study has yet to be  determined.", "Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires SEC to establish an Office of Credit  Ratings and complete annual examinations of each NRSRO. Once  established, this office will be responsible for administering the rules of  SEC in certain areas, promoting accuracy in credit ratings, and  conducting annual examinations of each NRSRO. Although the office  has yet to be established, NRSRO examination staff from SEC\u2019s Office of  Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), staff from OCIE\u2019s  investment adviser/investment company and broker-dealer examination  groups, and NRSRO specialists from SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and  Markets recently completed the first cycle of annual examinations of each  NRSRO as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. SEC made public a staff  report summarizing the examinations in September 2011. According to  this report, limited SEC resources required that this year\u2019s examinations  focus on reviewing the areas mandated by section 15E(p)(3)(B)\u2014 specifically, whether the NRSRO conducts business in accordance with  its policies, procedures, and rating methodologies; management of  conflicts of interest; implementation of ethics policies; internal supervisory  controls; governance; activities of the designated compliance officer;  processing of complaints; and NRSRO\u2019s policies governing the post- employment activities of former staff of the NRSRO. The report  summarized the examination staff\u2019s notable observations and concerns  and the recommendations the staff made to each NRSRO about these  observations and concerns related to the following required review areas:  conducting business in accordance with policies, procedures, and  methodologies; management of conflicts of interest; internal supervisory  controls; and designated compliance officer activities. The report notes  that, as of the date of the report, SEC had not determined that any finding  constituted a \u201cmaterial regulatory deficiency,\u201d but noted that the  Commission may do so in the future. The staff also made the observation  that NRSROs appear to be trending even more toward employing the  issuer-pays business model, noting that two of the subscriber-pays  NRSROs recently have taken steps to focus more on issuer-pays  business, particularly with respect to ratings of asset-back securities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Is Conducting Its Required Study of Alternative Compensation Models, but Has Yet to Talk to the Models\u2019 Authors", "paragraphs": ["Section 939F of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that SEC conduct a study  that addresses, among other things, the feasibility of establishing a  system in which a public or private utility or an SRO assigns NRSROs to  determine the credit ratings of structured finance products. SEC\u2019s report  on the study, due by July 21, 2012, must include any recommendations  for regulatory or statutory changes that SEC determines should be made  to implement the findings of the study. As part of this study, SEC solicited  comment on its authority to implement various alternative compensation  models. According to SEC staff, the staff is reviewing the comment letters  received and is evaluating authority issues.", "Section 939F requires that, after submission of the report to Congress  resulting from the study, SEC shall, by rule, as the SEC determines is  necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of  investors, establish a system for the assignment of NRSROs to determine  the initial credit ratings of structured finance products, in a manner that  prevents the issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured finance  product from selecting the NRSRO that will determine the initial credit  ratings and monitor such credit ratings. In issuing any rule, SEC is  required to give through consideration to the provisions of section 15E(w)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as that provision would have  been added by section 939D of H.R. 4173 (111th Congress), as passed by  the Senate on May 20, 2010, and shall implement the system described  in such section 939D unless the Commission determines that an  alternative system would better serve the public interest and the  protection of investors. The need for any statutory changes likely will  depend on the system that SEC decides to implement. Therefore,  obtaining as complete information on the models as available, such as by  consulting with the models\u2019 authors, will be important for SEC to fully  assess each model in order to make its decision and any  recommendations for statutory changes SEC determines should be made  to implement its findings.", "As part of its request for public comment in connection with its study, SEC  requested comment on whether the securities laws provide SEC with  authority to implement the 15E(w) system and the four other models it  outlined. In particular, SEC asked for comment on whether, in terms of  legal feasibility, the role of SEC in overseeing the Credit Rating Agency  Board raised legal issues. Few comment letters directly addressed SEC\u2019s  questions concerning its authority to implement one or any of the  alternative compensation models outlined in its request for comment.  However, a few of the comment letters discussed potential legal  questions surrounding the implementation of or rulemaking for specific  aspects of certain models, or general constitutional questions. For  instance, two commenters argued that in their view, NRSRO ratings  legally are viewed as opinions and may not be subject to being proven  true or false. Thus any system that utilizes the accuracy of ratings as  criteria to determine which NRSROs would be eligible to rate certain  categories of securities\u2014such as the 15E(w) system\u2014may face legal  challenges. One comment letter also argued that any system aimed at  defining \u201cquality\u201d ratings could run afoul of Section 15E(c)(2) of the  Exchange Act, which provides that SEC may not \u201cregulate the substance  of credit ratings or the procedures and methodologies by which any  NRSRO determines credit ratings.\u201d The letter states that any decision  by SEC that an NRSRO\u2019s ratings (and, by extension, the criteria and  methodologies by which those ratings were formed) lack \u201cquality\u201d and  therefore must be changed to maintain participation in the proposed  system could well violate this provision. In addition, three comment letters  raised constitutional questions. Two comment letters questioned how  certain of the alternative models might affect an NRSRO\u2019s right to form  and publish opinions under the First Amendment. Another questioned the  ability of the government to force one private party to deal with another  private party of the government\u2019s choosing in a private business  transaction, which the commenter argues would occur if SEC  implemented the section 15E(w) model.", "The model authors also hold varying opinions on the extent to which  statutory changes would be necessary to implement their alternative  compensation model. For example, in their paper introducing the model  and in our discussions with them, the authors of the proposed issuer and  investor-pays model discussed that they anticipate that legislation would  likely be required to implement their proposed model. Specifically, authors  of the model stated that legislation would likely be necessary to establish  the self-regulatory organization and provide it with the authority to create  a fund to collect fees and impose data collection requirements on  issuances, the governance structure of the fund, the methodology for  determining fees, an initial rotating system of assignments of issues to be  rated, and broad parameters for incentive compensation. Alternatively,  the author of the proposed investor-owned credit rating agency model we  interviewed believes that current law, even before the Dodd-Frank Act  was passed, provides SEC with the authority to implement the model as a  means of managing the conflicts of interest generated by the issuer-pays  model. Specifically, the author points to sections 15E(h)(2) of the  Exchange Act, which grants SEC the authority to issue rules to prohibit,  or require the management and disclosure of, any conflicts of interest  relating to the issuance of credit ratings by the NRSRO. This includes  the authority to issue rules relating to the manner in which an NRSRO is  compensated by the issuer for issuing credit ratings. The author also  stated that section 15E(i)(1), which provides that SEC shall issue rules to  prohibit any act or practice relating to the issuance of credit ratings by an  NRSRO that SEC determines to be unfair, coercive, or abusive provides  additional statutory authority for the implementation of the investor-owned  credit rating agency model. As previously discussed, SEC has not  spoken to the authors of the proposed models to solicit additional details  about their models\u2014information that could help inform SEC\u2019s analysis of  the alternative compensation models and its report to Congress  containing any recommendations for regulatory or statutory changes that  it determines should be made to implement the findings of its study."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, academic researchers and industry experts have begun  to develop a number of alternative compensation models for credit rating  agencies in response to concerns about conflict of interest, ratings  integrity, and competition. As of January 2012, none of these models  have been fully developed, and given that NRSROs continue to primarily  use the issuer-pays, and to a lesser extent, the subscriber-pays models,  the use of any alternative model or models would likely have to be at the  direction of SEC or Congress. As directed by section 939F of the Dodd- Frank Act, SEC is currently studying, among other things, alternative  means for compensating NRSROs that would create incentives for  accurate credit ratings. As part of its study, SEC solicited public comment  on various alternative compensation models and whether it has sufficient  authority to implement these models.  Few of the comment letters SEC  received specifically addressed the alternative models or SEC\u2019s authority  to implement them, and only one of the model authors submitted a  comment letter to SEC. Currently, the staff is reviewing the comment  letters received and evaluating authority issues, however the extent to  which SEC\u2019s existing authorities would allow it to implement any of the  alternative models by rule largely will depend on the system selected. As  part of its 939F study, SEC has not met with the authors of the various  alternative compensation models to discuss the models in greater detail.  Doing so could help ensure that SEC has thoroughly explored all of the  available options in sufficient enough detail to adequately consider them.
