The letter went on to state that risks correspondingly increase as ranges that were once remote are encroached by development or as the public increases its use of these properties.

The Rule was intended to provide guidance to perform inventories and provide cleanup procedures at closed, transferred, and transferring ranges. The Rule was withdrawn in November 2000 and the cost analysis was never formally completed. However, a senior DOD official said that initial estimates in the cost analysis that was developed in 2000 put the cleanup costs of training ranges at about $40 billion to $140 billion for closed, transferred, and transferring training ranges.

Although cleanup of active and inactive ranges would not generally be recognized as a liability in the financial statements, there are circumstances when an environmental liability should be recognized and reported for these ranges. A liability should be recognized on active and inactive ranges if the contamination is government related, the government is legally liable, and the cost associated with the cleanup efforts is measurable. For example, contaminants from an active training range at the Massachusetts Military Reservation threaten the aquifer that produces drinking water for nearby communities. The problem was so severe that in January 2000, EPA issued an administrative order under the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring DOD to cleanup several areas of the training range.

The Army and the Air Force also developed their own questionnaires and issued them in September 2000.

For example, unexploded ordnance was unexpectedly found by a hiker in 1999 at Camp Hale in Colorado, a site used for mountain training during World War II and since transferred to the U.S. Forest Service.

Because of the complexity of the data gathering process and the many issues involved in the cleanup of training ranges, top management leadership and focus is essential. A senior-level official with appropriate management authority and resources is key to effectively leading these efforts to produce meaningful and accurate reports on training range cleanup costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense designate a focal point with the appropriate authority to oversee and manage the reporting of training range liabilities.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the designated focal point to work with the appropriate DOD organizations to develop and implement guidance for inventorying all types of training ranges, including active, inactive, closed, transferred, and transferring training ranges. We recommend that this guidance, at a minimum, include the following requirements:   key site characterization information for training ranges be collected for unexploded ordnance removal; identification of other constituent contamination in the soil and/or water;   performance time frames, including the requirements to perform the necessary site visits to confirm the type and extent of contamination; and the necessary policies and procedures for the management and maintenance of the inventory information.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the designated focal point to work with the appropriate DOD organizations to develop and implement a consistent and standardized methodology for estimating training range cleanup costs to be used in reporting its training range cleanup liabilities in DOD\u2019s agency-wide annual financial statements and other reports as required. In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require that the designated focal point validate the cost model in accordance with DOD Instruction 5000.61.", "Further, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require the DOD Comptroller to revise the DOD Financial Management Regulation to include guidance for recognizing and reporting a liability in the financial statements for the cleanup costs on active and inactive ranges when such costs meet the criteria for a liability found in the federal accounting standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it has made significant progress in estimating and reporting environmental liabilities on its financial statements; however, much work remains to be done. DOD\u2019s response also indicated that as the department increases its knowledge related to this area, the appropriate financial and functional policies will be updated to incorporate more specific guidance for recognizing and reporting environmental liabilities.", "DOD concurred with our recommendations, but provided several comments in response to our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense require the DOD Comptroller to revise the DOD Financial Management Regulation to include guidance for recognizing and reporting a liability in the financial statements for the cleanup costs on active and inactive ranges when such costs meet the criteria for a liability.", "DOD stated that it revised Volume 6B, Chapter 10, of the DOD Financial Management Regulation to clarify instances when a liability should be recognized for an active or inactive range on an active installation. However, this revision of the DOD Financial Management Regulation does not address the recognition of an environmental liability at active and inactive ranges in accordance with the criteria of SFFAS No. 5. For example, as stated in our report, the total $300 million cleanup cost estimate on the active range at the Massachusetts Military Reservation should be recognized as a liability in accordance with the criteria in SFFAS No. 5.", "DOD further stated that since it intends to continue to use its active and inactive ranges in the foreseeable future, the removal of ordnance to maintain safety and usability is considered an ongoing maintenance expense. DOD stated that this expense is not accrued as a liability except in those few specific instances in which an environmental response action\u2014beyond what is necessary to keep the range in operation\u2014is probable and the costs of such a response is measurable. Although this position is consistent with SFFAS No. 5, it is not specifically indicated in the DOD Financial Management Regulation.", "Finally, DOD stated that as the Department gains additional experience in this area, it will review appropriate chapters in the DOD Financial Management Regulation to determine what, if any, additional specific guidance may need to be included regarding recognizing and reporting liabilities. While we agree that such a review is appropriate, we continue to recommend that the DOD Financial Management Regulation be revised to include guidance in those instances when active and inactive ranges meet the criteria in SFFAS No. 5.", "DOD also provided several technical comments, which we have incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable John Spratt, Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on the Budget, and to other interested congressional committees. We are also sending copies to the Honorable Donald H. Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense; the Honorable David R.

The focus of our review was on DOD efforts to gather and collect information on its training ranges and the environmental costs associated with the cleanup of the training ranges. As a result, other sites containing unexploded ordnance were not included in the scope of our review. These sites include munitions manufacturing facilities, munitions burial pits, and open burn and open detonation sites used to destroy excess, obsolete, or unserviceable munitions. To accomplish these objectives, we: reviewed relevant standards and guidance applicable to environmental liabilities including Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government; SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment; and DOD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 6B, Chapter 10, and Volume 4, Chapters 13 and 14; reviewed DOD guidance to the military services for performing the training range inventory survey; reviewed the military services\u2019 survey documents used to collect information on training ranges; interviewed officials from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security (DUSD(ES)); Director Defense Research and Engineering; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and the Army, Navy, and Air Force involved in planning and conducting the data collection efforts and analyzing the data; interviewed an official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); interviewed officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; interviewed environmental officials from the states of Colorado and Alabama; interviewed officials from the Department of Energy; interviewed the contractor selected by DOD, which assisted in planning and analyzing the data and preparing the cost analysis for the March 2001 report; and   visited two locations\u2014Lowry Bombing Range, Denver, and Ft.
