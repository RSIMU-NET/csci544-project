While the Department of the Treasury estimated that 51 percent of Direct Loan borrowers were eligible for Income-Based Repayment as of September 2012, the most recent available estimate, Education data show 13 percent were participating as of September 2014. An additional 2 percent were in Pay As You Earn. Moreover, Education has reported ongoing concerns regarding borrowers' awareness of these plans.

As of September 2014, Education's loan servicer for the program had certified employment and loans for fewer than 150,000 borrowers; however, borrowers may wait until 2017 to request certification. While the number of borrowers eligible for the program is unknown, if borrowers are employed in public service at a rate comparable to the U.S. workforce, about 4 million may be employed in public service. It is unclear whether borrowers who may be eligible for the program are aware of it. Although Education has a strategic goal to provide superior information and service to borrowers and provides information about Public Service Loan Forgiveness through its website and other means, it has not notified all borrowers in repayment about the program.

They are: Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR);  Income-Based Repayment (IBR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Key  features of these income-driven repayment plans include lower monthly  payments, repayment periods of up to 25 years, and forgiveness of any  remaining loan balances at the end of the repayment period. (See table  2.) The plans have provided progressively more generous repayment and  forgiveness terms to help borrowers manage their federal student loan  debt, and additional changes are expected. Specifically, Education issued  proposed regulations on July 9, 2015, that would expand PAYE to Direct  Loan borrowers regardless of when the borrower took out the loans.  Education officials said they intend to complete rulemaking on the  Revised Pay As You Earn plan by the end of 2015. The President and  congressional leaders have also proposed streamlining these plans.", "As part of the application to participate in one of the income-driven  repayment plans, borrowers must provide documentation of their adjusted  gross income and certify their family size to their loan servicer, which  determines eligibility on behalf of Education. Income-driven repayment  plan participants must re-certify their adjusted gross income and family  size annually, which may increase or decrease their monthly payments. In  order to initially qualify for IBR and PAYE, borrowers must have income  and student loan debt such that their monthly payment would be less  under one of these plans than under the 10-year Standard repayment  plan. These borrowers are described as having a \u201cpartial financial  hardship.\u201d Once enrolled, borrowers can remain on the plans and be  eligible for loan forgiveness regardless of whether they have a partial  financial hardship. However, the monthly payment for borrowers found to  no longer have a partial financial hardship is based on (and never  exceeds) the payment they would have owed under 10-year Standard  repayment. Because of the number of payments required before loan  forgiveness can be considered, Education officials said the earliest  possible date that any borrower may receive loan forgiveness under ICR  and the original IBR plan is July 1, 2019; PAYE is October 1, 2027; and  IBR for new borrowers is July 1, 2034.", "Although loan forgiveness is a key feature of income-driven repayment  plans, under current tax law any amount forgiven under these plans is  subject to federal income tax.

To receive forgiveness, borrowers must make 120 on-time,  scheduled, monthly payments while employed full-time by a qualified  public service organization, such as a government or nonprofit  organization. Borrowers must also be working for a public service  organization at the time they apply for forgiveness and when the  remaining balance on their loan is forgiven.

Moreover, in this  example, the federal government would collect less on the loan than it  would on the 10-year Standard plan.  In contrast, for Borrower B, who begins repayment with a higher  annual adjusted gross income of $25,000, repaying with IBR or PAYE  would initially reduce monthly payments, but the total cost of the loans  would be higher than on the 10-year Standard plan. Compared to  Borrower A, Borrower B has higher total loan costs under both IBR  and PAYE due to paying more each month based on the higher  income.

The emails provided general information  about income-driven repayment terms and benefits and directed  borrowers to Education\u2019s website for more information. Education officials  said the department emailed these borrowers directly instead of having  loan servicers do so because customer feedback has shown borrowers  are not always familiar with their servicer. Education officials told us in  June 2015 that they plan to email in-grace borrowers with over $25,000 in  loan debt twice per year. In addition, Education has partnered with  Treasury since 2014 to include a message about income-driven  repayment options on the back of tax refund envelopes, and with Intuit  Inc. to include information about these options for borrowers who used  TurboTax to file their taxes.

Although Education provides general  information about PSLF on its website and through social media,  borrowers must actively seek information through these sources.  Education also provides information about PSLF in the borrower rights  and responsibilities statement that is provided when borrowers receive  their loans, and through entrance and exit counseling that borrowers  complete when they begin and end school. In addition, Education has  included information about the program in targeted emails sent to  borrowers in their grace period who had more than $25,000 in debt.  However, Education has not examined borrower awareness of PSLF to  determine how well these efforts are working. For example, although  Education conducts regular surveys of borrowers to measure customer  satisfaction, it has not included an assessment of borrower awareness of  PSLF in these surveys. Beyond its current efforts, Education officials told  us they are considering a PSLF email campaign targeted to borrowers on  income-driven plans and an effort to publicize the program to public  service employers. Education officials told us they have not provided  information about PSLF to those employed in public service because they  do not have a way to identify and target such Direct Loan borrowers.  Apart from its targeted efforts, Education does not directly provide  information about PSLF to all borrowers once they have entered  repayment, which would eliminate the need to identify and target those  employed in public service. Because borrowers are to apply for PSLF at  least 10 years after they enter repayment and after they receive exit  counseling, information provided during repayment could help them make  decisions about forgiveness.", "While Education primarily relies on loan servicers to communicate with  borrowers who have entered repayment, it has established few  requirements about what information the servicers should provide on  PSLF and when. Although Education requires servicers to provide  documents on PSLF when borrowers request them\u2014including the  employment certification form and related information\u2014they are not  required to notify other borrowers about the program. While loan servicers  make information about PSLF available through their websites and  customer service representatives, borrowers may not seek this  information if they are not aware the program is available. Education  officials said they rely on a performance-based system to provide  incentives to servicers to manage their loan portfolios and keep borrowers  in repayment, rather than setting specific requirements about how  servicers communicate with borrowers. However, our review of sample  written communications from 2014 for the three selected loan servicers,  which serve about half of borrowers with loans owned by Education,  showed limitations in the PSLF information provided to all borrowers who  have entered repayment. For example, two servicers mentioned PSLF in  their billing statements but did not describe the program terms or benefits;  instead, they directed borrowers to websites with more information.  Another servicer representing about 23 percent of borrowers (more than 5  million) did not provide any information on PSLF to borrowers unless they  requested it. As a result, many of these borrowers may be uninformed  about PSLF. After discussing our preliminary findings with Education in  June 2015, Education officials reported that they are developing plans to  require servicers to include information about PSLF in their initial  communications to borrowers, such as the welcome letter sent when  borrowers are assigned or transferred to a servicer, by the end of  September. However, Education had not yet specified the information  servicers must provide. In addition, servicers would not be required to  provide PSLF information in ongoing communications with borrowers  beyond the initial notification or to the millions of borrowers already in  repayment.", "Assessing its efforts to increase borrower awareness of PSLF could  better position Education to identify gaps in borrower awareness of the  program and strengthen its outreach as needed. Such efforts would  support Education\u2019s goal to provide superior information and service to  borrowers. Borrowers who have entered repayment and have not been  notified about the program may be making decisions without complete  information and might miss the opportunity to benefit from the program  when it becomes available in 2017. For example, borrowers might fail to  account for the value of PSLF forgiveness in weighing decisions about  whether to enter public service. Other borrowers who are employed in  public service and meet all program requirements may forfeit potentially  large amounts of loan forgiveness if they are unaware of the program or  do not learn about it in time to make changes that ensure their payments  count toward forgiveness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Borrowers need sufficient and timely information to ensure they are aware  of their eligibility for and can make informed decisions about available  repayment options. Although Education has used a variety of approaches  to raise awareness about IBR and PAYE and participation in the plans  has increased, the gap between participation and eligibility and  Education\u2019s own assessment of borrower feedback suggests that  borrowers are not receiving sufficient information about income-driven  repayment plans. Thus, providing consistent information to all borrowers  who have entered repayment would support Education\u2019s goal to provide  superior information and service to borrowers. Moreover, the lower  default rates among borrowers in IBR and PAYE suggest that these plans  may be an important tool for preventing default on federal student loans.  Borrowers also need sufficient and timely information about Public  Service Loan Forgiveness. However, Education has little assurance that  borrowers know about the program, given that it has not assessed its  efforts to raise awareness and relatively few borrowers have had their  employment and loans certified for PSLF.

In written comments, Education generally agreed  with our recommendations, stating that it is committed to ensuring the  federal student loan borrowers have the information they need to manage  their debt, including details regarding income-driven repayment plans and  loan forgiveness programs. However, Education stated that it is not clear  that providing information on repayment options to all borrowers is the  most efficient or effective way to achieve this goal. Education indicated  that the steps it is taking to raise awareness about income-driven  repayment would include streamlined processes for learning about,  applying for, and recertifying eligibility for income-driven repayment plans  with enhanced communications targeted to borrowers most likely to  benefit from these plans. While these are positive steps, because  Education does not have income and family size information needed to  determine which borrowers could benefit from income-driven repayment,  we maintain it is important for Education to notify all borrowers of these  options. In response to our recommendation regarding Public Service  Loan Forgiveness, Education agreed to examine borrower awareness  and use the results to inform its outreach efforts. Beyond our  recommendations, Education expressed concern that the draft report  overstated the extent to which borrowers lack awareness of income- driven repayment plans. We made revisions to acknowledge the increase  in borrower participation in these repayment plans and to clarify  Education\u2019s ongoing concerns regarding borrower awareness of these  plans.

We chose  these parameters in order to get as close as possible to the eligibility  criteria for IBR and PAYE. To determine participation in IBR and PAYE,  we focused on data for 11.2 million borrowers in active repayment (not in  deferment, forbearance, or default). For borrowers with multiple loans, the  repayment plan was based on the most recent loan that either entered  repayment or was loaded into NSLDS. While borrowers with multiple  loans are able to participate in different repayment plans, we found that to  be the case for only 1 percent of borrowers in our analysis.", "In addition, we reviewed available estimates of IBR eligibility from a  Treasury analysis of tax return data and Education\u2019s student loan data for  a random sample of borrowers. These estimates, which are based on  September 2012 NSLDS data for borrowers who entered repayment in  2010 or earlier and Internal Revenue Service tax return data from 2010  and 2011, depending on the most recent available for each borrower, are  the most recent and only available estimates of IBR eligibility we  identified.

Specifically, we analyzed the number of certifications over time,  repayment plan participation, and available borrower characteristics (i.e.,  sector of employment, amount of student loan debt, and adjusted gross  income).", "To approximate the percentage of Direct Loan borrowers who may be  eligible for PSLF, we used 2012 Bureau of Labor Statistics data\u2014the  most recent available. We calculated the percentage of workers  nationwide who were employed by federal, state, and local government  agencies and 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, and applied it to our  summary NSLDS data on 16.3 million Direct Loan borrowers (excluding  parent PLUS) who were in repayment, deferment, or forbearance as of  September 2014.

We  developed repayment scenarios by assigning selected levels of adjusted  gross income and loan debt to a set of hypothetical borrowers to simulate  their total payments under IBR, PAYE, and 10-year Standard plans, and  under PSLF. In each of our scenarios, we assumed: each borrower is single with no dependents; borrowers\u2019 initial annual adjusted gross incomes will increase 5  percent annually, consistent with the assumption Education uses for  its loan calculator;  the poverty threshold will increase at an average annual rate of 2.3  percent, which is based on the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s inflation  rate projections from 2014 through 2024, and is consistent with the  assumption Education uses for its loan calculator; all loans have an interest rate of 6.8 percent, the rate for certain  borrowers with federal student loans disbursed from July 1, 2006  through June 30, 2013; all Direct Loans are subsidized. While borrowers may have a  combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans, making this  assumption allowed us to show the effect of Education paying the first  3 years of interest if an IBR or PAYE borrower\u2019s payments do not fully  cover the interest owed on a subsidized loan. This assumption  means we might understate total loan costs for IBR and PAYE  borrowers with unsubsidized loans whose payments do not fully cover  interest. Education\u2019s loan calculator assumes that all Direct Loans are  unsubsidized and therefore does not account for this potential interest  benefit for IBR and PAYE borrowers with subsidized loans. Education  officials told us this assumption would have a slight effect on total loan  costs, and that the department plans to revise the calculator by  December 2015 to account for this potential interest benefit.", "Changing the assumptions explained above would change the monthly  and total loan costs for borrowers in our scenarios. To the extent  possible, we validated our results against Education\u2019s loan calculator and  worked with Education officials to resolve discrepancies. These scenarios  are intended for illustrative purposes only; they do not incorporate  experiences that could affect individual borrowers\u2019 eligibility for income- driven repayment or their payment amounts. For example, individual  borrowers could experience periodic unemployment or job promotions,  and get married or form families.
