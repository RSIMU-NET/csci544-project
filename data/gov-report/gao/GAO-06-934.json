Although the Corps stated that it had restored prehurricane levels of protection to the area by June 1, 2006, it used temporary solutions and developed emergency procedures to protect against flooding, in the event of a hurricane, for sections where permanent repairs could not be completed in time. For example, the Corps constructed interim gates on three canals to prevent storm surges from flooding New Orleans. When construction of one canal gate fell behind schedule and could not be completed by June 1, 2006, the Corps devised an emergency plan to drive sheet piling into the canal and close it off if a hurricane threatened before the gate was completed. More importantly, because these initial repairs were performed only on levees and floodwalls with obvious visual damage, the reliability of those adjacent to them is still unknown. The Corps originally allocated $801 million for initial repairs, but the current allocation has increased to over $1 billion. After completing the initial repairs, the Corps plans to conduct additional repairs and construction on the existing hurricane protection system. These plans include (1) repairing all damaged pumps, motors, and pumping stations by about March 2007; (2) restoring sections of existing hurricane protection projects that have settled over time to their original design elevations; and (3) completing construction of incomplete portions of five previously authorized hurricane and flood control projects by September 2007. An additional $941 million had been allocated for this additional work, but the Corps expects actual costs will be greater because of subsequent decisions to change the design of these projects, cover the local sponsor's share, and because of rapidly escalating construction costs. In addition, the Corps plans to undertake further work to enhance and strengthen the hurricane protection for southeastern Louisiana. These projects are estimated to take years and require billions of dollars to complete. Since September 2005, the Congress has appropriated more than $7 billion for some aspects of this work and additional appropriations are expected. According to an external review organization established by the Corps, hurricane protection systems should be deliberately designed and built as integrated systems to enhance reliability and provide consistent levels of protection. However, the Corps does not have a comprehensive strategy and implementation plan to integrate the repairs already authorized and planned and that would ensure the efficient use of federal funds. Instead, the Corps appears to be following a piecemeal approach, similar to its past practice of building projects without giving sufficient attention to the interrelationships between various elements of those projects or fully considering whether the projects will provide an integrated level of hurricane protection for the area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina came ashore near Buras, Louisiana,  about 60 miles southeast of New Orleans, with wind speeds of up to 127  miles per hour and a storm driven wave surge of up to 30 feet. The size and  strength of the storm and subsequent flooding resulted in one of the  largest natural disasters in U.S. history, as storm waters flowed over  floodwalls and breached levees in Louisiana\u2019s Orleans and neighboring  parishes, causing widespread flooding, billions of dollars of property  damage, and more than 1,300 deaths.", "The Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) began constructing hurricane  protection projects in southeastern Louisiana almost 60 years ago, in the  1940s. Over the years, the Corps constructed five major hurricane and  flood damage reduction projects in southeastern Louisiana, comprising  about 350 miles of earthen levees and concrete floodwalls across six  parishes. These projects were designed to provide various levels of  hurricane protection, and generally could withstand storms with  maximum wind speeds between 87 and 115 miles per hour. The hurricane  protection projects in Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes  suffered the greatest damage from Hurricane Katrina. The Corps estimates  that more than one-half of the 269 miles of federally constructed levees  and floodwalls in these three parishes were damaged by the storm\u2019s winds  and flood waters.", "The Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Act of 1941, as amended,  authorizes the Corps to respond in cases where flooding occurs due to a  storm and repair or restore flood control and hurricane protection  projects including levees, floodwalls, and other flood control structures  damaged or destroyed by flood waters. Generally, it is Corps policy to pay  for the full costs of repairs to federally constructed levees and to fund   80 percent of the cost to repair certain nonfederally constructed levees,  and the local sponsor or government funds the remaining 20 percent.  However, because of the unprecedented damage and loss caused by  Hurricane Katrina, the Corps deviated from its usual policy and has funded  100 percent of the repair, restoration, and construction costs for both  federal and nonfederal levees and flood control structures.", "The official Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30,  when 97 percent of all tropical storms and hurricanes normally occur.

After June 2006, the Corps had planned to  repair damaged pumps, pump motors and pump stations, restore all  hurricane protection structures that had subsided over time to their  authorized design heights (the elevation specified in their design), and  complete construction of incomplete portions of previously authorized  hurricane protection projects. In April 2006, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency released advisory flood elevations for New Orleans  and the surrounding area based on a 1 percent annual chance of flooding,  also called a 100-year flood. In response, the Corps is revising its plans and  cost estimates to raise the height of levees and floodwalls to provide the  area with a 100-year level of protection. In addition, the Congress required  the Corps to conduct an analysis and design for comprehensive  improvements in the coastal area of Mississippi in the interest of hurricane  and storm damage reduction and for several other purposes, and to  provide an interim report of its findings on June 30, 2006, and issue a final  report by December 30, 2007.", "We have prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative, as part of our continued effort  to assist the Congress by (1) monitoring the extensive damage to  southeastern Louisiana caused by Hurricane Katrina and (2) evaluating  ongoing efforts to repair and strengthen the region\u2019s hurricane protection  projects.

While construction of hurricane protection projects in southeastern  Louisiana began almost 60 years ago, construction of three major projects  began about 40 years ago in the 1960s. Segments of those were still  incomplete when Hurricane Katrina struck the area in late August 2005.  The projects were designed to provide protection from hurricanes with  maximum wind speeds of 87 to 115 miles per hour (115 miles per hour  being roughly equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane). Hurricane Katrina  made landfall with wind speeds equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane, or  winds up to 127 miles per hour, and record high storm surge. To determine  the extent of the damage to levees and floodwalls caused by Hurricane  Katrina, the Corps contracted for an initial assessment in September 2005  and a second assessment in April 2006. Both assessments were based on  visual inspections of the levees and floodwalls. For the first assessment,  engineers walked the levees and floodwalls in Orleans, Plaquemines and  St. Bernard parishes and looked for damage. The second assessment  reexamined only those sections that were initially reported to be  undamaged. The first assessment found 169 miles of damaged levees and  floodwalls of which 128 miles were moderately damaged and 41 were  severely damaged or destroyed. Most of the damage was found in  Plaquemines Parish where 150 miles of levees and floodwalls were  damaged. The second assessment of those sections initially found to be  undamaged found additional cracks in the levees, soil erosion near  floodwalls, and levee heights that had settled below their design elevation.  Subsequently, the Corps and the contractors conducted sampling and  other tests to determine the extent of the damage, but this was only done  where exterior damage\u2014such as cracks, depressions, or seepage\u2014was  observed. Both assessments documented obvious external damage but did  not indicate whether other structures without visible damage\u2014but similar  in design and composition to damaged levees and floodwalls\u2014were, in  fact, damaged or weakened.", "In its May 2006 draft final report, an independent team sponsored by the  National Science Foundation reviewed the failures of the hurricane  protection projects and concluded that the pervasiveness of problems and  failures calls into question the integrity and reliability of other sections of  flood protection projects that did not fail during Hurricane Katrina. In its  June 2006 draft final report, the Interagency Performance Evaluation Task  Force\u2014a team of 150 experts from the Corps and about 50 federal, state,  international, academic, and industrial organizations\u2014found that repaired  sections of levees and floodwalls were likely the strongest parts of the  system until remaining sections could be similarly upgraded and  completed. The task force report concluded that since there are many  areas where protection levels are only the same as before Hurricane  Katrina, the New Orleans metropolitan area remained vulnerable to storm  surge and wave conditions equivalent to or greater than Hurricane Katrina.", "The most severely damaged portions of the hurricane protection projects  in the area were found in the three parishes of Orleans, Plaquemines, and  St. Bernard. Within these three parishes, there are approximately 243 miles  of earthen levees and 26 miles of floodwalls. The 26 miles of floodwalls  comprised 19 miles of I-walls and 7 miles of T-walls. I-walls are vertical  concrete barriers anchored to levees by steel sheet pile driven vertically  into the levees. T-walls are vertical concrete barriers with a horizontal  concrete base anchored by multiple steel beams driven diagonally into the  levees and are stronger than I-walls (see fig. 1).", "Corps officials told us that T- or L-walls will be constructed to replace  floodwalls that were destroyed and need to be replaced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Corps of Engineers Has the Authority and Responsibility to Rebuild and Restore Damage to Hurricane Protection Projects", "paragraphs": ["Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1941, as amended, commonly  referred to as Public Law 84-99, authorizes the Corps to conduct  emergency operations and rehabilitation activities when levees fail or are  damaged during storms.

However, in September 2005, the Corps  noted that Hurricane Katrina had caused unprecedented damage and loss  of infrastructure in the Gulf Coast region. According to the Corps, damage  to the region eroded the tax base to such an extent that local sponsors  would have great difficulty funding their share of rebuilding expenses. In  response, the Corps requested a one-time waiver from the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Civil Works from the policy requiring local  sponsors to fund 20 percent of the cost of rehabilitating nonfederal flood  and hurricane protection projects. For federally authorized projects that  were under construction when Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the Corps  also requested a waiver from the policy requirement that local sponsors  fund a share of the repair cost. In October 2005, the Assistant Secretary of  the Army for Civil Works approved both requests.

The  most commonly used method is to build an earthen embankment sloped  on both sides and rising to a flat crown (see fig. 2).", "Depending on local conditions and the availability of suitable materials,  levees can be built in one or more stages. The number of stages is  generally dependent on the ability of the local soil to provide an adequate  base, and not sink under the weight of levees, and to compact and provide  suitable strength. When appropriate conditions exist, levees can be built in  a single stage. In other cases, levees may need to be built in stages (also  called lifts) that allow for subsidence of the foundation soil or settlement  of the fill material. Between stages the levees are allowed to settle for up  to 5 years. Because the soil in southeastern Louisiana has a tendency of  settling, historically most levees built in the New Orleans area were  required to be built in three to four stages, and construction took 15 to 20  years. Because of the urgency of the repairs that the Corps made after  Hurricane Katrina, earthen levees in the New Orleans area had to be  rebuilt in only several months. To do this, the Corps relied on mechanical  compaction by heavy construction equipment to compensate for the  normal settlement that would occur over time.", "Building levees quickly can pose risks, however, as was witnessed on   May 30, 2006, when a 400-foot section of a reconstructed levee in  Plaquemines Parish slipped 3 to 4 feet under its own weight.

Between October 2005 and March 2006, the  Corps awarded 59 contracts to repair and rebuild earthen levees, concrete  floodwalls, and other hurricane protection structures, and to construct  interim repairs in areas where final repairs could not be completed by  June 1.

The remaining work includes grading,  compacting, and shaping the levees, as well as grass seeding and  fertilizing.", "In some instances, to restore prehurricane levels of protection, the Corps  decided to change the design of the existing hurricane structure. For  example, in the Orleans East Bank, the Corps determined that it did not  have the time to assess the stability of existing canal walls nor could it  complete repairs to all of the breaches along the drainage canals before  June 1, 2006. As a result, at a cost of $111 million, the Corps decided to  install interim gated closure structures (gates) on all three canals\u201417th  Street, London Avenue, and Orleans Avenue\u2014where they intersect Lake  Pontchartrain to prevent storm surge from entering the canals and to  install 34 temporary pumps to drain floodwaters from the Orleans East  Bank portion of the city (see fig. 8). According to Corps officials, the  agency planned to install interim gates and temporary pumps because it  did not have the authority to install permanent gates and pumps under its  emergency flood control authority. The Corps expects the interim gates  and temporary pumps to remain in place for 3 to 5 years, after which the  Corps will construct permanent gates and pumps. The 2006 emergency  supplemental appropriation provides $530 million for permanent gates and  pumps at the three drainage canals.", "According to the Corps, the interim gates will be operated manually, and  the temporary pumps will not be enclosed. If a major storm or hurricane  should occur, the Corps plans to close the gates when water levels in the  17th Street and London Avenue canals reach 5 feet and the water level in  the Orleans Avenue canal reaches 9 feet. The Corps is reviewing the  results of recent soil samples collected in the area and may change its  plans, depending on these results, a Corps official said. The temporary  pumps being installed by the Corps can only pump out a portion of the  drainage water that would normally be pumped into the canals during a  storm event. As a result of the restriction being placed on the water levels  pumped into the canals and the limited pump capacity of the temporary  pumps, the Corps has acknowledged that some flooding could occur from  the heavy rainfall that normally occurs during a hurricane.", "In instances where the Corps did not expect permanent repairs to be  completed by June 1, 2006, the Corps devised some interim and temporary  solutions to provide the same level of protection that existed before  Hurricane Katrina. For example, as of June 1, 2006, construction of one of  the three interim gates\u2014the 17th Street canal gate\u2014was behind schedule.  The Corps estimated it would be completed by September 15, 2006. If a  hurricane threatens before the interim gate is in place, the Corps plans to  drive sheet piling in front of the Hammond Highway Bridge that crosses  the 17th Street canal to close off the canal from Lake Pontchartrain. On  June 12, 2006, the Corps announced that the temporary pumps built for the  drainage canals could not provide the required pumping capacity. The  Corps plans to procure replacement pumps with different specifications  for the 17th Street canal and repair new pumps already installed at the  Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals. Under normal conditions, the  Corps said it would have conducted hydraulic modeling and testing to  determine the correct pump configuration. The Corps did not perform  modeling and testing, officials said, because the process can take months,  and there was insufficient time to do so before the start of the hurricane  season. If the canals must be closed due to a hurricane, before pumping  capacity is restored at the drainage canals, the Corps plans to use a  combination of temporary and portable pumps.", "Similarly, in Plaquemines Parish, the Corps made temporary repairs to 5  miles of levees along the Mississippi River after the Corps concluded that a  floodwall located on top of a section of levee was not reliable. The Corps  decided to add a temporary reinforcement because there was not enough  time to replace 5 miles of floodwalls before the start of the 2006 hurricane  season. To provide this interim protection, the Corps added compacted  clay along the backside of the damaged levee.

These projects are in addition to the other work described  in prior sections of this report.", "The 2006 emergency supplemental also appropriated nearly $1.6 billion to  the Corps to reinforce or replace floodwalls in the New Orleans  metropolitan area and provided that at least $495 million of the amounts  appropriated for construction be used to raise levees for the Lake  Pontchartrain and West Bank levee projects to provide a level of  protection necessary to satisfy the certification requirements of the  National Flood Insurance Program (often referred to as the 100-year flood  standard.) In April 2006, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  announced the release of new advisory flood elevations for New Orleans  and the surrounding area based on a 1 percent annual chance of flooding,  or a 100-year flood.

The final study must consider alternative designs to protect against a  storm surge produced by a Category 5 hurricane originating from the Gulf  of Mexico. According to the Corps, alternatives being considered include a  structural design consisting of a contiguous line of earthen or concrete  walls along southern coastal Louisiana, a nonstructural alternative  involving only environmental or coastal restoration measures, or a  combination of those alternatives. The Corps\u2019 July 2006 preliminary  technical report did not specifically identify which alternatives the Corps  would recommend but instead provided a conceptual framework for both  structural and nonstructural components that should be considered in  developing long-term solutions for the region.

Without such a strategy, we believe that the Corps may end up replicating  past missteps, which occurred because it was required to follow a  piecemeal approach to developing the existing hurricane protection that,  according to experts, is not well integrated. For example, the draft final  report issued May 2006 by the investigation team sponsored by the  National Science Foundation stated (1) that there was a failure to integrate  the individual parts of a complex hurricane system, (2) that insufficient  attention was given to creating an integrated series of components to  create a reliable overall system, and (3) that projects were engineered and  constructed in piecemeal fashion to conform to incremental  appropriations. In its June 2006 draft final report, the Interagency  Performance Evaluation Task Force also concluded that hurricane  protection systems should be deliberately designed and built as integrated  systems to enhance reliability and provide consistent levels of protection.", "According to the Corps, the technical report due to the Congress in  December 2007 will include the long-range strategy that will provide an  integrated and comprehensive review of flood control, coastal restoration,  and hurricane and storm damage reduction measures for the southeastern  Louisiana region, and the preliminary framework for this strategy is  included in the report provided to the Congress on July 10, 2006. However,  according to a senior Corps official, there is currently no other strategic  plan in place to guide its efforts. We are concerned that the Corps has  embarked on a multibillion dollar repair and construction effort in  response to the appropriations it has already received, without a guiding  strategic plan, and appears to be simply doing whatever it takes to comply  with the requirements placed on it by the Congress and other  stakeholders. Consequently, we are concerned that the Corps is once  again, during this interim period, taking an incremental approach that is  based on funding and direction provided through specific appropriations  and is at risk of constructing redundant or obsolete structures that may be  superseded by future decisions, thereby increasing the overall costs to the  federal government for this project.", "During the past 4 years, we reported that the Corps\u2019 planning for civil  works projects were fraught with errors, mistakes, and miscalculations  and used invalid assumptions and outdated data. We recommended, and  the Corps agreed, that an external peer review of its plans and decisions  was needed, especially for high risk and costly proposed projects. In the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Corps established the Interagency  Performance Evaluation Task Force and used the task force\u2019s findings and  lessons learned to improve its engineering practices and policies to  provide hurricane protection.
