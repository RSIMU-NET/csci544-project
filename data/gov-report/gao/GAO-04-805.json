Additional expenses may include the costs associated with home repairs, automobile maintenance, and childcare that could have been performed by the deployed servicemember. Over the years, the eligibility requirements for the family separation allowance have changed. Today, the family separation allowance is authorized for officers and enlisted in all pay grades at a flat rate. The rationale for establishing the 30-day threshold is unknown. DOD has not identified frequent short-term deployments as a family separation allowance issue. No proposals seeking modifications to the family separation allowance because of frequent short-term deployments have been provided to DOD for consideration as part of DOD's Unified Legislation and Budgeting process, which reviews personnel pay proposals. Further, DOD officials were not aware of any specific concerns that have been raised by frequently deployed servicemembers about their eligibility to receive the family separation allowance. Based on group discussions with Air Force strategic airlift aircrews, who were identified as examples of those most likely to be experiencing short-term deployments, we did not identify any specific concerns regarding the lack of family separation allowance compensation associated with short-term deployments. Rather, many aircrew members indicated the high pace of operations and associated unpredictability of their schedules was a greater concern due to the negative impact on their quality of life. In addition to basic military compensation, DOD has several special pays and allowances to further compensate servicemembers deployed for short periods. Servicemembers who are deployed for less than 30 days may be eligible to receive regular per diem. The per diem amount varies depending upon location. For example, these rates range from $86 to $284 per day within the United States and from $20 to $533 per day when outside the United States. However, DOD has not implemented the high deployment allowance designed, in part, to compensate those frequently deployed for shorter periods. Congress supported DOD's legislative proposal to authorize a monthly high deployment allowance. This allowance permits the services to compensate members for lengthy as well as frequent shorter deployments. The most recent amendment to this provision provides DOD with the authority to adjust a cumulative day threshold to help compensate servicemembers experiencing frequent short deployments. DOD has flexibility to exclude all occupations except those that it wishes to target for additional pay. However, DOD has not established criteria to implement this allowance, nor has DOD set a timetable for establishing such criteria."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) considers a servicemember as  deployed when a member is on orders and performing duties in a training  exercise or operation at a location or under circumstances that make it  impossible or infeasible for the member to spend off-duty time at the  member\u2019s permanent duty station or homeport. While deployed, in  addition to receiving basic military compensation, servicemembers can  receive a variety of special pays and allowances intended to (1) help the  uniformed services meet specific manpower requirements and  (2) compensate servicemembers for hardships associated with their  deployments. For example, servicemembers who have dependents and are  deployed for more than 30 consecutive days are eligible to receive the  family separation allowance. In April 2003, Congress temporarily  increased the amount of the family separation allowance by 150 percent  (from $100 to $250 per month) as part of the Emergency Wartime  Supplemental Appropriations Act. Congress has since extended this  increase until December 2004; at which time it will expire unless renewed  or made permanent. According to DOD officials, the latest estimated cost  of the family separation allowance for fiscal year 2004 is $1.1 billion with  an average of 359,000 monthly recipients. When this estimated cost is  compared to the fiscal year 2002 obligations, the budget for the family  separation allowance increases by 850 percent. This increase is primarily  due to the increase in the monthly rate paid for family separation  allowance and the increased number of personnel deployed in support of  the global war on terrorism.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 directed GAO  to assess the special pays and allowances for servicemembers who are  frequently deployed for less than 30 days.

We focused  our study on the Air Force since the reported average number of days Air  Force personnel were deployed in fiscal year 2002, the latest available  data, was less than 30 days. Further, through discussions with Air Force  officials we identified strategic airlift C-5 aircrews managed by the Air  Mobility Command (AMC) as examples of those who would most likely be  experiencing short-term deployments. We assessed the reliability of AMC  deployment data and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. To explore family separation allowance  issues at a location overseen by AMC, we conducted group discussions  with officers and enlisted servicemembers at Travis Air Force Base.

Unlike other Air  Force aircraft, the C-5 is rarely deployed for more than 30 days, since it is  primarily used to move cargo from the United States to locations  worldwide. As a result, C-5 aircrews are deployed away from home for  several weeks and then return to their home station. Other Air Force  aircraft, such as the KC-10, can carry cargo but are primarily used to refuel  other aircraft and can be deployed to locations around the world for  extended periods of time.

Over the years, the eligibility requirements for the family  separation allowance have changed. For example, while the family  separation allowance was initially authorized for enlisted members in pay  grades E-5 and above as well as to enlisted members in pay grade E-4 with  4 years of service, today the family separation allowance is authorized for  servicemembers in all pay grades at a flat rate of $250 per month.  Servicemembers must apply for the family separation allowance, certifying  their eligibility to receive the allowance. The rationale for establishing the  30-day threshold is unknown. However, DOD officials noted that  servicemembers deployed for more than 30 days do not have the same  opportunities to minimize household expenses as those who are deployed  for less than 30 days. For example, servicemembers who are able to return  to their permanent duty locations may perform home repairs and do not  have to pay someone to do these tasks for them.", "The 1963 family separation allowance legislation was divided into two  subsections, one associated with overseas duty and one associated with  any travel away from the servicemembers home station. The first  subsection was intended to compensate servicemembers who were  permanently stationed overseas and were not authorized to bring  dependents. The second subsection was intended to compensate  servicemembers for added expenses associated with their absence from  their dependents and permanent duty station for extended periods of time  regardless of whether the members were deployed domestically or  overseas. Originally, this aspect of family separation compensation was  also to be based on the allowance for living quarters. At that time,  members would receive one-third the allowance for living quarters or a flat  rate of $30 per month, whichever amount was larger. In July of 1963, the  Senate heard testimony from DOD officials who generally agreed with the  proposed legislation, but raised concerns about using the allowance for  living quarters as a baseline. Their concerns were related to the  complexity of determining the payments and the inequities associated with  tying payment to rank.

According to a DOD official, while this  proposal was not endorsed by DOD, Congress ultimately passed legislation  that clarified the use of family separation allowance for joint military  couples. The family separation allowance is now payable to joint military  couples, provided the members were residing together immediately before  being separated by reason of their military orders.

According to  the aircrew members and both officer and enlisted leadership with whom  we met, the unpredictability of their missions is expected to continue for  the foreseeable future due to the global war on terrorism.

Generally, these periods have been intended to ensure that  aircrew members have enough rest prior to flying another mission.  However, aircrew members noted that crew rest periods also allow them  to perform other assigned duties and spend time with their families.

After  implementing the waiver authority, DOD sought legislative changes to the  high deployment compensation in an effort to better manage deployments.", "DOD\u2019s proposal sought, among other things, to: (1) change high- deployment compensation from a per diem rate to a monthly allowance,  (2) reduce the dollar amount paid so that it was more in line with other  special pays (e.g. hostile fire pay), and (3) allow DOD to recognize lengthy  deployments as well as frequent deployments. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 reflects many of DOD\u2019s proposed  changes. The act changed the $100 per diem payment into an allowance  not to exceed $1,000 per month. To help compensate those  servicemembers who are frequently deployed, the act established a  cumulative 2-year eligibility threshold not to exceed 401 days. Also, the act  provided the Secretary of Defense with the authority to prescribe a  cumulative threshold lower than 401 days. Depending upon where the  Secretary of Defense establishes the cumulative threshold,  servicemembers, such as the C-5 aircrews, serving multiple short-term  deployments may be compensated through the high deployment  allowance. Once a servicemembers\u2019 deployments exceed the established  cumulative day threshold for the number of days deployed, the member is  to be paid a monthly allowance not to exceed $1,000 per month at the  beginning of the following month. From that point forward, the  servicemember will continue to qualify for the allowance as long as the  total number of days deployed during the previous 2-year period exceeds  the cumulative threshold established by the Secretary of Defense. The high  deployment allowance is in addition to per diem and any other special  pays and allowances for which the servicemember might qualify.  Moreover, the servicemember does not have to apply for the allowance, as  the act mandated that DOD track and monitor days deployed and make  payment accordingly. Finally, DOD may exclude specified duty  assignments from eligibility for the high deployment allowance (e.g.,  sports teams or senior officers). According to DOD officials, this provision  also provides additional flexibility in targeting the allowance to selected  occupational specialties, by allowing DOD to exclude all occupations  except those that it wishes to target for additional compensation because  of retention concerns. The Senate report accompanying the bill that  amended the high deployment provision encouraged DOD to promptly  implement these changes. However, DOD officials told us that a timetable  for establishing the criteria necessary to implement the high deployment  allowance has not been set.

DOD will need to assure adequate compensation for servicemembers  using all available special pays and allowances in addition to basic pay.  While the aircrews with whom we met did not express specific concerns  about compensation, they, like other servicemembers, are concerned  about quality-of-life issues. The high deployment allowance could help to  address such issues for servicemembers, while helping to mitigate DOD\u2019s  possible long-term retention concerns.

These  additional flexibilities include providing DOD with the opportunity to  tailor the allowance to meet current or expected needs. Since the purpose  of special pays and allowances is primarily to help retain more  servicemembers, the high deployment allowance could be used as another  compensation tool to help retain servicemembers during a time of war. As  our report clearly states, given the expectations for a long-term  commitment to the war on terrorism, developing the criteria for  implementing the high deployment allowance would provide DOD with an  additional option for compensating those military personnel who are  frequently deployed for short periods of time. Regarding DOD\u2019s use of  other flexible pay authorities to compensate servicemembers who are  away from home for inordinate periods, the examples DOD cites for  lengthy or protracted deployments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Korea are not  applicable to those servicemembers deployed for less than 30 days, the  focus of this review.", "Finally, the vagueness of when and how the high deployment allowance  will be implemented runs contrary to the congressional direction, which  encouraged DOD to promptly implement the new high deployment  allowance authority.

We were not able to use the database for the purposes of our  report to discern the number of deployments by location lasting less than  30 days, since more than 40 percent of the data for location was not  included in the database. In addition, the database did not contain  information related to some types of non-deployment activities (e.g.  training), which we deemed important to our review. We focused our  study on the Air Force since the fiscal year 2003 Secretary of Defense  Annual Report to the President and Congress showed that the Air force  was the only service whose members were deployed less than 30 days on  average in fiscal year 2002. Further, through discussions with Air Force  officials we identified strategic aircrews managed by the AMC as examples  of those who would most likely be experiencing short-term deployments.  We visited AMC, where we met with officials from personnel, operations,  finance, and the tactical airlift command center. To understand the views  of one group of short-term deployers, we visited Travis Air Force Base in  California where we met with officer and enlisted leadership for the C-5  and KC-10 aircraft. We held discussion groups with 12 officers and  12 enlisted aircrew members from both aircraft, for a total of 48 aircrew  members. We visited Dover Air Force Base in Delaware where we met  with C-5 officer and enlisted leadership. We also met with officials  representing personnel, operations, and finance offices at both Travis and  Dover Air Force Bases. We assessed the reliability of AMC C-5 copilot  deployment data, as well as data contained in the fiscal year 2003  Secretary of Defense Annual Report to the President and Congress. GAO\u2019s  assessment consisted of (1) reviewing existing information about the data  and the systems that produced them, (2) examining the electronic data for  completeness, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about  the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To assess what special pays and allowances are available, in addition to  basic compensation, to further compensate servicemembers deployed for  less than 30 days, we identified special pays and allowances that do not  have a time eligibility factor through the DOD\u2019s Military Compensation  Background Papers, legislative research, and discussions with  OSD officials. We reviewed the legislative history regarding recent  legislative changes to special pays and allowances and how DOD has  implemented these changes.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness); the Secretaries of the  Army, the Air Force, and the Navy; the Commandant of the Marine Corps;  and the Director, Office of Management and Budget.

The purpose of our congressionally directed review was to assess the  special pays and allowances available to DOD that could be used to  compensate servicemembers who are frequently deployed for less than  30 days. Consequently, our scope did not include an assessment of  compensation for servicemembers serving lengthy, or protracted,  deployments of 30 days or more. We found that DOD has available and  is using several special pays and allowances, in addition to basic  compensation, to further compensate servicemembers deployed for  less than 30 days. However, we also found that DOD has one special  allowance, the high deployment allowance, that is not available to  provide further compensation to servicemembers who frequently  deploy for less than 30 days and that DOD has not set a timetable to  establish criteria to implement the allowance. During our review, we  could not ascertain exactly why DOD had not taken action to develop  criteria for implementing the high deployment allowance. During  several discussions, OSD officials stated that the services had difficulty  reaching agreement on what constitutes a deployment for the purposes  of the high deployment payment. DOD\u2019s response to our draft report  noted that it has elected to exercise the waiver given to it by Congress  to suspend the high deployment allowance for reasons of national  security. We recognized this waiver in our report. We also noted that  after DOD waived application of the high deployment payment on  October 8, 2001, DOD sought legislative modifications of the high  deployment payment that would give it more flexibilities to better  manage this type of compensation. Congress granted DOD these  flexibilities and encouraged DOD to promptly implement these  changes. As noted in our report, given the expectations for a long-term  commitment to the war on terrorism, developing the criteria for  implementing the new high deployment allowance would provide DOD  with an additional option for compensating those military personnel  who are frequently deployed for short periods of time. Also, the high  deployment allowance, unlike the family separation allowance, could  be used to compensate servicemembers regardless of whether or not  they have dependents and thus would reach more servicemembers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Military Personnel: Active Duty Compensation and Its Tax Treatment.
