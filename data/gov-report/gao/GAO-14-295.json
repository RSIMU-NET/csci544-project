There  is a clear need for NNSA to replace the old, deteriorating, and high- maintenance facilities at the Y-12 plant. NNSA is currently reevaluating  the UPF project and may decide to construct a facility that is smaller and  contains only select enriched uranium processing capabilities. Whether  NNSA continues with the UPF project or chooses to undertake a smaller  project, the facility will likely cost billions of dollars, and its ability to meet  critical national security needs will depend on the successful development  and deployment of new technologies. It is encouraging that NNSA has  taken some steps to manage the development of these technologies.  However, as we have detailed in this and other reports, we are concerned  that, nearly a decade after the project started, the UPF project continues  to face key technology-related risks, including the potential transition risks  associated with NNSA\u2019s recent decision to consider alternatives to a new  uranium purification technology. NNSA is in the process of making key  programmatic decisions with the UPF and has some ongoing efforts that  may address identified risks if fully and successfully implemented. We will  continue to monitor NNSA\u2019s progress in addressing these risks as part of  our UPF critical decisions reviews as directed by the Fiscal Year 2013  National Defense Authorization Act.", "In addition, NNSA has not taken action to address the two  recommendations related to UPF technology development we made in  our November 2010 report: (1) that NNSA ensure that new technologies  reach the level of maturity called for by best practices prior to CDs being  made on the UPF project and (2) that the agency report to Congress any  decisions to approve cost and schedule performance baselines or to  begin construction of UPF without first having ensured that project  technologies are sufficiently mature. NNSA generally agreed with those  recommendations, and we continue to believe that best practices followed  by other federal agencies for managing technology development,  particularly reaching TRL 7 at the start of construction, are important. By  not fully incorporating these practices, NNSA may not be able to ensure  that the UPF and its other projects can be completed on time and within  budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We are not making any new recommendations in this report. We provided  a draft of this report to NNSA for comment.  In written comments (see  Appendix I), the acting NNSA Administrator stated that NNSA\u2019s existing  TRL guidance, which encourages the achievement of TRL 7 prior to the  start of construction (CD 3), provides adequate protection against the  premature commitment of resources while giving projects flexibility to  make decisions between seeking TRL 6 and TRL 7. In addition, the acting  NNSA Administrator stated the agency is closely overseeing and  managing UPF\u2019s ongoing technology development efforts using on-site  personnel and independent reviews to confirm reported progress while  also keeping senior management informed of development efforts.", "We continue to believe that DOE should fully adhere to best practices in  its technology development activities. DOE\u2019s guidance recognizes that  achieving a TRL 7 at the start of construction is a best practice and DOE  encourages\u2014but does not require\u2014projects to achieve this level of  readiness.  Achieving TRL 7\u2014the level where a prototype is  demonstrated in an operational environment, has been integrated with  other key supporting subsystems, and is expected to only have minor  design changes\u2014does require more time, effort, and money than  achieving TRL 6. However, TRL 7 is seen as a best practice because it  provides greater assurance the new technologies will work as intended  before making very significant resource investments in construction  activities, which for the UPF will total billions of dollars. Notably, DOD  follows best practices in this area and recommends projects reach TRL 7  before production and deployment, or the equivalent of beginning  construction on a DOE project.", "Regarding NNSA\u2019s oversight of technology development efforts, it is clear  that certain NNSA actions, such as the August 2013 UPF independent  peer review, helped identify and respond to some technology  development issues.  However, since NNSA is currently considering  alternatives to UPF and developing the Uranium Infrastructure Strategy  for the Y-12 plant, it is too early to determine if the oversight and  management actions cited by NNSA will be sufficient to fully address all  the risks we identified.", "NNSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of NNSA, and  other interested parties.
