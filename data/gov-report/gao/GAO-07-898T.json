The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), enacted in 2002, encourages the manufacturers, or sponsors, of drugs that still have marketing exclusivity--that is, are on-patent--to conduct pediatric drug studies, as requested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If they do so, FDA may extend for 6 months the period during which no equivalent generic drugs can be marketed. This is referred to as pediatric exclusivity. BPCA also provides for the study of off-patent drugs. GAO was asked to testify on the study and labeling of drugs for pediatric use under BPCA. This testimony is based on Pediatric Drug Research: Studies Conducted under Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, GAO-07-557 (Mar. 22, 2007). GAO assessed (1) the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under BPCA for on-patent drugs, (2) the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under BPCA for off-patent drugs, and (3) the impact of BPCA on the labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling was changed. GAO examined data about the drugs for which FDA requested studies under BPCA from 2002 through 2005 and interviewed relevant federal officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Drug sponsors have initiated pediatric drug studies for most of the on-patent drugs for which FDA has requested such studies under BPCA, but no drugs were studied when sponsors declined these requests. Sponsors agreed to 173 of the 214 written requests for pediatric studies of on-patent drugs. In cases where drug sponsors decline to study the drugs, BPCA provides for FDA to refer the study of these drugs to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), a nonprofit corporation. FNIH had not funded studies for any of the nine drugs that FDA referred as of December 2005. Few off-patent drugs identified by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that need to be studied for pediatric use have been studied. BPCA provides for NIH to fund studies when drug sponsors decline written requests for off-patent drugs. While 40 such off-patent drugs were identified by 2005, FDA had issued written requests for 16. One written request was accepted by the drug sponsor. Of the remaining 15, NIH funded studies for 7 through December 2005. Most drugs granted pediatric exclusivity under BPCA (about 87 percent) had labeling changes--often because the pediatric drug studies found that children may have been exposed to ineffective drugs, ineffective dosing, overdosing, or previously unknown side effects. However, the process for approving labeling changes was often lengthy. For 18 drugs that required labeling changes (about 40 percent), it took from 238 to 1,055 days for information to be reviewed and labeling changes to be approved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although children suffer from many of the same diseases as adults and are  often treated with the same drugs, only about one-third of the drugs that  are prescribed for children have been studied and labeled for pediatric  use. This has placed children taking drugs for which there have not been  adequate pediatric drug studies at risk of being exposed to ineffective  treatment or receiving incorrect dosing. In order to encourage the study of  more drugs for pediatric use, Congress passed the Best Pharmaceuticals  for Children Act (BPCA) in 2002 to provide marketing incentives to drug  sponsors for conducting pediatric drug studies. Drug sponsors (typically  drug manufacturers) may obtain 6 months of additional market exclusivity  for drugs on which they have conducted pediatric studies in accordance  with pertinent law and regulations. This market exclusivity is known as  pediatric exclusivity. When a drug has market exclusivity, it is protected  from competition for a limited period; for example, the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) is prohibited from approving a generic copy for  marketing. Generally, pediatric exclusivity can only be granted to those  drugs that are on-patent\u2014that is, those that still have market  exclusivity\u2014and for which FDA has issued a written request for pediatric  drug studies. However, FDA can also request pediatric drug studies for  off-patent drugs\u2014drugs for which the patent or market exclusivity has  expired. BPCA also included provisions designed to provide for the study  of both on-patent and off-patent drugs that drug sponsors have declined to  study.", "When FDA determines that a drug may provide health benefits to children,  it may issue a written request to the drug sponsor to conduct pediatric  drug studies on that drug. When a drug sponsor accepts a written request  and conducts studies, FDA reviews the report from the pediatric drug  studies to determine whether to grant pediatric exclusivity to the drug. If  FDA is satisfied that the studies have been conducted and reported  properly, the drug in question may receive additional market exclusivity.  FDA also reviews these pediatric drug study reports to see if the drug  requires labeling changes.", "BPCA provides for pediatric drug studies when the drug sponsor declines  the written request. First, if a drug sponsor declines a written request from  FDA to study an on-patent drug, BPCA provides for FDA to refer the drug  to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), which can  fund the study if funds are available. Sponsors cannot receive pediatric  exclusivity for on-patent drugs that drug sponsors decline to study.  Second, BPCA provides for the funding of the study of off-patent drugs by  the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which, in consultation with FDA  and experts in pediatric research, identifies off-patent drugs that need to  be studied for pediatric use.", "My remarks today provide an overview of the study and proper labeling of  drugs for pediatric use under BPCA. I will focus on (1) the extent to which  pediatric drug studies were being conducted under BPCA for on-patent  drugs, (2) the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted  under BPCA for off-patent drugs, and (3) the impact of BPCA on the  labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling  was changed. My remarks are based upon our report assessing the effect  of BPCA on pediatric drug studies and labeling.", "In carrying out the work for our report, we collected and analyzed a  variety of data from FDA, NIH, and FNIH about written requests and  pediatric studies for both on- and off-patent drugs from January 2002  through December 2005. Our work focused on actions regarding these  drugs prior to 2006. To evaluate the impact of BPCA on the labeling of  drugs for pediatric use and the process by which labeling was changed, we  reviewed summaries of the labeling changes for drugs studied from the  enactment of BPCA through 2005. In addition, to assist with our review in  general, we interviewed officials from FDA, NIH, and FNIH. The work  done for this statement was performed from September 2005 through  March 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, most of the on-patent drugs for which FDA requested  pediatric drug studies under BPCA were being studied, but no studies  resulted when the requests were declined by drug sponsors. Drug  sponsors agreed to study 173 of the 214 on-patent drugs (81 percent) for  which FDA issued written requests for pediatric drug studies from January  2002 through December 2005.

BPCA specifies   that FDA generally has 90 days to review the study reports to determine  whether the pediatric drug studies met the conditions outlined in the  written request.

FNIH, which is a nonprofit corporation and independent of  NIH, supports the mission of NIH and advances research by linking private  sector donors and partners to NIH programs. FNIH and NIH collaborate to  fund certain projects. As of December 2005, FNIH had raised $4.13 million  to fund pediatric drug studies under BPCA.", "Second, to further the study of off-patent drugs, NIH\u2014in consultation with  FDA and experts in pediatric research\u2014develops a list of drugs, including  off-patent drugs, which the agency believes need to be studied in children.  NIH lists these drugs annually in the Federal Register. FDA may issue  written requests for those drugs on the list that it determines to be most in  need of study. If the drug sponsor declines or fails to respond to the  written request, NIH can contract for, and fund, the pediatric drug studies.

Generally, the labeling includes important information for health  care providers, including proper uses of the drug, proper dosing, and  possible adverse events that could result from taking the drug. FDA may  determine that the drug is not approved for use by children, which would  then be reflected in any labeling changes.", "The agency refers to its review to determine the need for labeling changes  as its scientific review. BPCA specifies that study results submitted as a  supplemental new drug application\u2014which, according to FDA officials,  most are\u2014are subject to FDA\u2019s general performance goals for a scientific  review, which in this case is 180 days. FDA\u2019s process for reviewing study  results submitted under BPCA for consideration of labeling changes is not  unique to BPCA. FDA\u2019s action can include approving the application,  determining that the application is approvable, or determining that the  application is not approvable.

The labeling for these drugs was changed to reflect these  study results. For example, studies of the drug Sumatriptan, which is used  to treat migraines, showed that there was no benefit derived from this  drug when it was used in children. There were also certain serious adverse  events associated with its use in children, such as vision loss and stroke,  so the labeling was changed to reflect that the drug is not recommended  for children under 18 years old.", "Other drugs have had labeling changes indicating that the drugs may be  used safely and effectively by children in certain dosages or forms.  Typically, this resulted in the drug labeling being changed to indicate that  the drug was approved for use by children younger than those for whom it  had previously been approved. In other cases, the changes reflected a new  formulation of a drug, such as a syrup that was developed for pediatric  use, or new directions for preparing the drug for pediatric use were  identified in the pediatric drug studies conducted under BPCA.", "Although FDA generally completed its first scientific review of study  results\u2014including consideration of labeling changes\u2014within its 180-day  goal, the process for completing the review, including obtaining sufficient  information to support and approve labeling changes, sometimes took  longer. For the 45 drugs granted pediatric exclusivity that had labeling  changes, it took an average of almost 9 months after study results were  first submitted to FDA for the sponsor to submit and the agency to review  all of the information it required and approve labeling changes.
