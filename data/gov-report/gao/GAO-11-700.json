Of that total, 11 UN agencies obligated roughly $288 million for assistance in various sectors, including food, health, water and sanitation, and agriculture. The U.S. government provided about $38 million of the UN's total as part of its roughly $85 million in obligations for emergency response and longer-term recovery activities. Of the $85 million U.S. response, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which led U.S. efforts, obligated about $72 million. The Department of Defense obligated about $13 million to procure and deliver emergency relief supplies. USAID took actions to help ensure U.S. funds were used as intended and did not benefit sanctioned entities, but had some monitoring weaknesses. USAID took actions prior to the delivery of assistance, including selecting partners experienced in working with USAID and in Burma and providing extra guidance to help ensure funds were not misused. To monitor assistance, USAID has conducted some site visits. However, USAID's monitoring contains little financial oversight and we found that two grantees charged USAID for unapproved international travel. Also, in some cases site visits were not sufficiently documented. USAID relies on external audits of grantees, but relevant USAID staff were not aware of audit findings related to one grantee's cash payments to villagers in Burma. The grantee subsequently addressed the audit findings. Lastly, U.S. and UN agencies said they examined reports of misuse of assistance in their programs and found no evidence that assistance had been misused. GAO's review of 16 after-action reports from donors, NGOs, and UN agencies, showed that those responding to Cyclone Nargis experienced similar challenges and developed lessons learned in four main areas: access, coordination, implementation, and limited in-country disaster response capacity. Responders found it difficult to reach affected areas because the Burmese government limited their travel and the infrastructure was poor. Responders also had difficulty coordinating between headquarters and field offices for several reasons, including limited telecommunication services. A U.S. report highlighted coordination challenges amongst U.S. agencies, stating that agencies' conflicting agendas resulted in difficulties related to the appropriateness, timing, procurement, and distribution of aid. Implementation challenges include supplies that were incompatible with local conditions, such as medicines with instructions printed in non-Burmese languages and difficulties monitoring aid. Capacity challenges included a lack of experienced disaster specialists in Burma, which resulted in nonqualified individuals being placed in positions out of necessity. To address some of these challenges, reports suggested that organizations increase support staff and use the same reporting systems. Other reports prioritized involving local communities in decision making and improving emergency preparedness and local response capacity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of USAID (1) take four actions to improve the management of grants related to Burma, including enhancing financial monitoring and reinforcing the requirement to document site visits, and (2) review the questionable costs for international travel GAO identified.

In  response, UN OCHA reports that the international community mobilized  more than $600 million in aid as of May 2011, including $334.8 million  from U.S. and UN agencies. The Burmese military government initially  blocked most international access to the affected region; however, amidst  international pressure, it slowly began allowing aid to be delivered  throughout May 2008 and finally allowed international aid workers into the  cyclone-affected delta by late May 2008. The United States has provided  funds for Cyclone Nargis emergency response and recovery activities  largely through UN agencies and international nongovernmental  organizations (NGO).

The  U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) implements many elements  of the sanctions program, including the prohibitions on exports of financial  services to Burma and the targeted financial prohibitions. Congressional  committees mandated that we assess the assistance that the United  States provided in response to the cyclone. To address the mandate, in  this report we (1) describe the assistance UN and U.S. agencies have  provided in response to Cyclone Nargis, (2) assess USAID actions to help  ensure funds are used as intended and do not benefit sanctioned entities,  and (3) describe the challenges responders experienced and the lessons  learned.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed financial and program  documents from USAID, DOD, State, Treasury, UN agencies, and NGOs.

For examples of Cyclone Nargis\u2019s destruction in  the delta region, see figure 2 and our video. The assessment stated that the  cyclone destroyed or severely damaged more than 50 percent of schools  and nearly 75 percent of health facilities in the affected areas. The cyclone  also impaired access to clean water because the salt water contaminated  communal water collection systems and destroyed household rainwater  collection containers. Prior to the cyclone, Burma had significant  humanitarian needs resulting from decades of chronic underinvestment in  essential services by the Burmese government, ongoing ethnic conflict, and  government policies that stifle economic growth.", "In the week following the cyclone, the Government of Burma said it was  accepting international aid but was not ready to accept international aid  workers, insisting that the disaster could be handled internally and  therefore they did not need experts. Due to the inability to enter Burma,  many foreign donors, including the U.S. government, began assembling  staff in Bangkok, Thailand, to be ready for quick deployment if granted  access. The U.S. and other donors also had military ships anchored off  the coast of Burma, ready to supply humanitarian assistance if allowed by  the Burmese government.", "The Government of Burma restricted the movement of the few  international aid workers who were in Burma when the cyclone hit as well  as those it eventually allowed to enter the country. The Burmese  Government has had a longstanding policy requiring approval for any  international staff to travel outside of Rangoon.

International agencies already in  Burma launched operations within a few days, working through their local  staff or in partnership with local organizations.

One U.S. official  reported that the Burmese military set up a logistics center in Rangoon  and delivered some relief supplies. One report also suggested that the  Burmese army and navy rescued some people stranded in remote areas;  set up camps for displaced people; and restored some electricity,  communication, and transportation links.", "Burmese citizens and local organizations also assisted cyclone victims.  According to the same report, within hours of the cyclone, the first local  response efforts were underway, led by monks, doctors, students, artists,  intellectuals, travel agents, and small business owners. Several hundred  new and existing groups, including a contingent of Burmese citizens  returning from abroad, provided relief. While most of the larger  international agencies initially focused on the main population centers,  many of these small, informal groups assisted the most isolated areas.

The Association of South East  Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Burma is a member, played a leading  role in getting international disaster response workers into Burma.  ASEAN took the lead in coordinating assistance offered by the  international community, with full support from the UN, and in late May  2008 formed the Tripartite Core Group (TCG).

Upon completion of air operations in August 2008, WFP reported that  it had transported 4,177 tons of food and relief supplies from the UN  staging area in Bangkok. Helicopters delivered 1,088 tons of  emergency food and nonfood items to 160 remote locations.

As a result, their immediate priorities included preventing  disease outbreaks, ensuring availability of safe drinking water,  establishing temporary learning spaces for children, creating child- friendly spaces for traumatized children, and tracing and reintegrating  the families of separated children. UNICEF said it constructed and  maintained 300 emergency latrines, installed 558 large rainwater  containers and 8 water treatment plants, administered more than  110,000 measles vaccinations to children in cyclone-affected areas  and deployed health assistants to severely affected townships,  provided school kits to 2,322 schools to facilitate resuming of the  school year and renovated 965 schools and 702 staff houses, and  supported 27,000 children through a range of care and protection  activities in 272 locations in 13 affected townships.  \uf0b7  UNDP.

Given that the Government of Burma insisted on  receiving and distributing all aid in the initial days of the response, U.S.  agencies said they chose their mix of relief supplies carefully to limit the  risk of diversion by the Government of Burma. A State official told us that  they chose certain goods, such as bottles of water and plastic sheeting,  specifically with this purpose in mind. This official stated that the  Government of Burma requested items such as helicopters and vehicles  that could have been diverted, which the U.S. government did not  provide.", "Third, USAID/RDMA included written guidance in its agreements to  emphasize restrictions and help grantees determine who in Burma is  restricted from receiving U.S. assistance. For example, each agreement  contains a clause clarifying that assistance cannot be provided to or  through the Government of Burma, while recognizing that situations may  arise where government workers, such as teachers or local health  officials, may observe USAID-funded training. U.S. officials told us that  they provide this extra guidance to help organizations better understand  the restrictions. USAID/RDMA has also tried to design its programs to  reduce the risks that U.S. assistance will benefit Government of Burma  employees. For example, since U.S. funds generally cannot be used to  provide any benefit to official village midwives because they are  Government of Burma employees, USAID/RDMA approved grantees to  work with community health workers, who are not government  employees, as part of their health sector programs. In addition to the  guidance in the agreements, USAID conducted post-award briefings with  all partners to discuss the terms of the agreements, with an emphasis on  ensuring that U.S. assistance does not benefit sanctioned entities.

USAID does  not have an official presence in Burma, so staff must request permission  to enter Burma weeks prior to any planned monitoring site visits;  however, the Burmese government often does not grant permission in a  timely manner, according to USAID officials. In addition, the Government  of Burma placed numerous and significant restrictions on international  travel to the affected region, which USAID officials said negatively  affected their ability to conduct monitoring. USAID/OFDA officials also  reported difficulties in conducting monitoring due to staffing constraints.  They stated that a disaster of this magnitude could warrant fifteen to  twenty members on the response team. However due to the inability to  get visas for all team members, there were only four members in Burma  during the height of the emergency response, and ultimately only seven  team members gained access to Burma. USAID\u2019s ability to monitor is also  constrained by the remoteness of the cyclone-affected areas. For  example, one USAID grantee runs programs that are located on Middle  Island, which took us 16 hours of travel by car and boat to reach under  good conditions from Rangoon, where the U.S. embassy is located.", "As discussed below, despite the numerous constraints, USAID conducted  some monitoring of its programs:  \uf0b7  Emergency assistance. USAID and State officials told us they  monitored emergency assistance from May 2008 through May 2009.  USAID/OFDA officials reported that members of USAID\u2019s disaster  assistance response team made visits to the cyclone-hit delta region  to oversee implementation of USAID-funded grant activities and to  discuss results with beneficiaries from May 2008 to July 2008.  However, the USAID-provided documentation of visits during this time  focuses on the assessment of needs in the region, with no detailed  discussion of monitoring of USAID programs. Further, USAID  assigned an emergency disaster response coordinator\u2014who was  stationed in Burma from September 2008 to May 2009\u2014to monitor  program activities. She told us that during her time in Burma, she  made only one monitoring site visit to each partner because of  Burmese government-imposed travel restrictions. While she did not  prepare formal trip reports, she told us that she reported her activities  to USAID/OFDA staff members through e-mails and conversations  and also reported her activities and findings to embassy staff for  inclusion in classified cables issued by the embassy. However, while  she was sometimes asked to clear information on the cables, she  reported that she never saw finalized cables containing information  she submitted.  \uf0b7  Food aid. To oversee USAID\u2019s food aid contributions to Burma,  USAID assigned a food aid official to the disaster assistance response  team in Bangkok roughly 2 weeks after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma.  However, the food aid official returned to Washington, D.C., when she  was unable to obtain a visa and monitored food aid activities from  there, relying on disaster assistance response team members, other  embassy officials, and WFP staff in Burma to monitor food assistance  in a limited capacity. The official said she had regular informal  communication via e-mail and telephone with WFP staff in  Washington, D.C., and Burma. She was able to travel to Burma  several months later, in September 2008, during which time she  conducted site visits with WFP personnel across the Irrawaddy Delta.  Her site visits included observations of food distributions and an  inspection of a WFP warehouse. Upon returning, she drafted a trip  report that was circulated within USAID, but was never finalized. The  report included, among other things, her observations from the field  visits and challenges encountered in the response.  \uf0b7  Recovery assistance. To monitor recovery assistance, USAID officials  visited cyclone-affected areas three times between 2010 and 2011  and made several other visits to Rangoon, where they met with  grantees. USAID officials said that while the Burmese government  typically grants access, the level of uncertainty surrounding when they  will grant the access makes it difficult to monitor aid delivery on short- term notice, limits the number of site visits they make, and precludes  them from properly planning monitoring visits. USAID officials  responsible for monitoring recovery assistance provided us with nine  trip reports, including two for trips to monitor grantee activities. The  trip reports include headings for information such as activities  monitored, key meetings, issues identified, recommendations, and  photographs from site visits. We found that one of the two reports was  generally lacking in detail. For example, the report included no detail  on what the officials actually observed during the visit or any  discussion of the activities they monitored in terms of potential issues  or progress.", "USAID staff reported that State officials from the embassy in Rangoon  also conducted some monitoring activities; however, they did not receive  instructions on monitoring procedures. According to a USAID official,  State officials provided additional support for USAID staff on some site  visits, or if traveling in the vicinity of USAID programs, they were asked to  observe some of the activities and report back to USAID. While this  monitoring was helpful, a USAID official told us that these State officials  had not received formal USAID training on what to look for during site  visits or how to conduct effective monitoring visits. All USAID agreement  officers and their technical representatives are required to attend  mandatory training that includes monitoring procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s Monitoring Includes Limited Financial Oversight and Relies on External Audits, but Staff Were Not Aware of Relevant Audit Findings", "paragraphs": ["USAID\u2019s monitoring activities, including their limited number of site visits,  involve little financial oversight, which is to help ensure funds are used as  intended. USAID monitoring consists of program and financial monitoring.  Program monitoring is focused on the effectiveness of USAID programs  and is carried out by field officers, program officers, and the relevant  agreement officer\u2019s technical representative (AOTR). Financial  monitoring is carried out by the AOTR and the relevant mission\u2019s office of  financial management.

These reports include cumulative financial transactions,  such as drawdowns and expenditures. The office of financial  management and the AOTR review these reports to assess the  reasonableness of grantee drawdowns. USAID does not require grantees  to provide supporting documentation, such as invoices or detailed  transactions. An official in USAID/RDMA\u2019s office of financial  management told us that the AOTR, who is also the relevant program  officer, compares these reports to information obtained from site visits  and progress reports to ensure the information grantees report is  reasonable.", "USAID officials said that staff conducting monitoring in Burma, including  the relevant AOTR, focused their site visits on programmatic issues but  did not review grantee internal control frameworks or review  disbursements to determine whether funds were used for intended  purposes. However, USAID officials told us they consider their  observation of grantees\u2019 use of materials procured with grant funds and  the connection of those materials to the program activities described in  the grant agreement to be a review of grantee financial actions. A USAID  contracting officer reported that, given the limited amount of time the  AOTR spends in the field monitoring, the emphasis is often on the  programmatic side of her monitoring responsibilities. Further, the AOTR  stated that the administrative burden associated with obtaining  permission to enter Burma and travel to grantee sites detracts from  USAID\u2019s ability to monitor the Cyclone Nargis-related programs more  closely and make more meaningful assessments.", "USAID officials also told us they rely on the grantees\u2019 annual single  audits, in addition to their review of grantee financial reports, to monitor  compliance with their grant agreements; however, we found that relevant  USAID program staff were not aware of some internal control  weaknesses and questioned costs included in a grantee\u2019s single audit  report. Two of the three grantees we reviewed were required to submit  single audits, and one had significant findings. We reviewed the June 30,  2009, and June 30, 2010, single audits of one of the grantees and the  December 31, 2009, single audit of a second grantee. We found that the  June 30, 2009, single audit of the first grantee had 11 findings related to  internal controls and compliance with federal program requirements. For  example, the auditors questioned cash payments to Burmese villages  totaling $641,695 because the grantee did not provide the auditor with  sufficient documentation for the cash payments. Officials from the  grantee\u2019s Bangkok office told us that they addressed the auditor\u2019s findings  and that they now maintain records of cash payments made to  beneficiaries. We reviewed the same grantee\u2019s June 30, 2010, single  audit report and noted that 9 of the 11 prior year findings related to the  grantee\u2019s programs in Burma had been resolved, and the grantee is  taking steps to resolve the remaining two findings.", "During our fieldwork, USAID program officials responsible for overseeing  the Burma programs said that they were not aware of the single audit  findings. USAID officials told us that the USAID Inspector General\u2019s office  reviews the single audit reports and distributes the audit packages to the  relevant program offices. In this instance, because the Bangkok program  staff did not receive any information from the Inspector General\u2019s office,  they assumed that the single audits did not contain any findings related to  the programs in Burma. USAID/RDMA officials told us that they would  also have expected to uncover any audit findings during their preaward  survey conducted in March 2010; however, the 2009 audit that contained  the relevant findings for the first grantee was not released until a month  after USAID\u2019s request for audits, and the grantee did not forward the  report when it was released. USAID/RDMA officials stated that if they  had been informed of the single audit findings, they most likely would  have awarded the grant to the NGO, but they would also have requested  information from the grantee about how they were addressing the audit  findings.", "In conducting a limited transaction review of selected USAID grantees,  we found that two of the three grantees incurred questionable costs  because they failed to obtain USAID\u2019s mandatory prior approval for each  international trip funded by the grants. According to USAID regulations,  the grantees may only charge international travel costs to the award when  USAID has previously approved each separate international trip for which  such costs are incurred. Under USAID regulations, prior approval  means securing USAID\u2019s permission in advance of incurring costs on  restricted items, and such advance permission may be obtained by  specifying items in an approved budget. According to USAID guidance,  \u201cailure to comply with prior approval requirements generally causes  USAID to deem the costs unallowable.\u201d", "Although the USAID award agreements require grantees to obtain prior  approval for international travel, we found that this was not always done.  For example, we found that for one grantee who has completed a $4.9  million grant, USAID had approved one traveler for six international trips  between Thailand and Burma. However, this grantee incurred costs for 15  trips in 2008\u201410 trips between Thailand and Burma and 5 trips between  Thailand and other countries, including Pakistan and Japan\u2014at a total  cost of about $7,357. A grantee official told us that they did not seek  USAID prior approval for the additional trips, but that they did  subsequently inform USAID of the trips in their required periodic reports.  For another grantee, although the USAID agreement did not authorize  any international travel, a grantee official told us that four international  trips totaling approximately $3,633 had been paid for under their ongoing  USAID award.", "USAID officials told us that their practice is to review written requests that  grantees submit for international travel and to grant approval if the work  and travel proposed are to be performed in conformance with the award  terms and sufficient funds are available. They also said that unplanned  international travel can arise as a legitimate need for grantees in Burma  due to the challenges in obtaining visas for non-Burmese staff. With  regard to the international trips taken by the two grantees mentioned  above, USAID/OFDA officials told us that they rely on some monitoring by  the program staff and annual audits to detect unapproved travel;  however, they said they did not approve the first grantee\u2019s international  trips we questioned. Under USAID regulations on grant administration,  USAID retains the right to recover funds from its grantees for any costs  charged to the grant that a final USAID audit determines to be disallowed  costs. USAID/RDMA officials told us that for the second grantee, USAID  approval for international trips was not necessary because they were  within the budget limitations specified in the agreement for travel and  transportation. However, we reviewed the agreement, noting that the  travel and transportation budget is approximately $137,000; however, the  agreement did not expressly specify any international travel. Therefore  compliance with existing regulations, guidance, and the USAID award  agreement would require USAID\u2019s prior approval for each separate  international trip. This grantee did not obtain such prior approval, and  therefore incurred questionable costs that may be unallowable under its  agreement. In this grantee\u2019s agreement USAID reserved the right to an  earlier recovery of unallowable costs, which includes requiring the  grantee to refund the disallowed amount during the grant\u2019s performance  period. Additionally, USAID policy provides that in certain circumstances  USAID may ratify the grantee\u2019s activities by approving the disallowed  international travel expenditures after the travel has occurred and the  costs have been incurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Relies on Partners\u2019 Monitoring and Reporting of Activities", "paragraphs": ["Given the difficulties in traveling to USAID-funded project sites in Burma  to conduct monitoring, USAID relies on its partners\u2019 monitoring of  program activities and self-reporting to gauge program progress and to  identify any issues for follow-up during their limited number of site visits.  USAID told us that both the UN and NGO partners had established  operations in the cyclone-affected region and had procedures for  monitoring assistance. The UN agencies we reviewed told us that they  had established a presence in the delta and conducted monitoring visits  using Burmese local staff, supplemented by international staff site visits,  as feasible. In addition, the UN agencies are subject to internal audits on  a regular basis. For example:  \uf0b7  WFP relied on both its existing oversight mechanisms as well as  international organizations\u2019 staff present in the delta prior to Cyclone  Nargis to carry out monitoring and oversight of its operations.  According to a WFP official, these mechanisms helped the agency  account for the purchase of commodities, their transport to  established warehouses, and their distribution to implementing  partners for distribution to affected communities.  \uf0b7  UNICEF set up five hubs throughout the delta region responsible for  monitoring and oversight. In addition, UNICEF headquarters has an  office of internal audit that audits each country office on a regular  basis. The September 2009 audit of UNICEF\u2019s Burma Country Office  included all major areas related to operations and programs, including  emergency funds. The audit did not find any problems in the way  UNICEF conducts its business in Burma.  \uf0b7  UNDP reported that all of its projects were implemented at the village  level, with direct implementation and supervision by UNDP project  personnel and by NGOs with direct UNDP supervision. In addition, an  Independent Assessment Mission is organized annually to verify  UNDP compliance with its mandate in Burma. The three missions in  2008, 2009, and 2010 concluded that UNDP\u2019s program fully complied  with the mandate. In addition, UNDP has provided written assurance  to State each year to certify its compliance with the following U.S.  conditions: (1) UNDP\u2019s work must focus on eliminating human  suffering and addressing the needs of the poor, while providing no  benefit to the Government of Burma, and (2) UNDP\u2019s work must be  undertaken only through internal or international private voluntary  organizations independent of the Government of Burma and in  consultation with stakeholders, including the leadership of the  National League for Democracy and National Coalition Government of  the Union of Burma.", "USAID also reported that NGOs established local offices in the delta  region to oversee operations, conducting site visits with local and  international staff. During our site visits with three implementing partners,  we observed field-level internal controls, which are designed to safeguard  funds. For example, several NGOs had cash transfer programs. To  address the risk that individuals could steal or misuse funds, the  organizations developed systems for documenting cash receipts and  disbursements and for ensuring physical control over funds. For example,  as illustrated in figure 6, one village we visited safeguarded cash by  establishing lock boxes that required four assigned villagers be present to  open\u2014three key holders and the village president. Similar processes for  documenting cash receipts and disbursements and ensuring physical  controls were also utilized by other partners we examined. In addition,  each implementing partner used methods to encourage local oversight by  beneficiaries, such as forming local committees to make important  resource allocation decisions and distributing transparency flyers to  advertise the amount and recipients of delivered aid. In addition, one  partner hired young female villagers as bookkeepers because, according  to program officials, in this culture, Burmese villagers would more likely  be willing to ask young females questions, as opposed to older males.  Bookkeepers in two villages told us they had received several inquiries  into the bookkeeping and expenditures from fellow villagers.", "USAID has also relied on UN and NGO partners\u2019 required reports and  informal communication to monitor progress and keep informed of issues.  USAID required most NGO grantees to formally report to USAID  quarterly, with some required to report semiannually. USAID requires  UN partners to report based on standard guidelines in ADS for awards to  public international organizations.", "USAID/OFDA and USAID/RDMA officials also communicated informally  with grantees in Bangkok and Rangoon. Even with this communication  and reporting, we found that USAID program staff still observed issues  requiring follow-up during the site visit to one grantee, reinforcing the  importance of USAID site visits. During our site visit, USAID staff  expressed concern about the way the grantee reported program results  and the possibility that the reports may not be fully accurate because the  local manager may be reluctant to raise issues or problems, given the  Burmese cultural norms which discourage providing negative information.

However, USAID officials  told us this may not be a misuse of assistance as it still allows  beneficiaries to obtain goods they need. USAID and DOD officials said  they kept very detailed lists of all relief supplies provided. USAID said  they gave these lists to U.S. Embassy staff who used them in market  surveys. In these surveys, Embassy staff, including Burmese national  staff, monitored local markets in the delta and Rangoon for evidence that  U.S.-provided relief materials were being sold.

The most frequently cited challenge regarding  restricted access was obtaining travel authorizations from the Burmese  government, both to enter Burma and to travel around the country. The  Government of Burma initially restricted foreigners from entering into  Burma and required government issued authorizations for international  staff to travel within Burma. Consequently, the emergency relief and  humanitarian efforts became highly dependent on Burmese nationals and  international staff already in Burma. These responders were often  overworked and operated beyond their mandate or outside their areas of  expertise. In addition, responders faced poor roads and infrastructure and  high transportation costs. Many areas were only accessible by boat or by  air and, given the scarcity of boats, hiring them became very difficult and  air drops were too expensive. The reports we reviewed suggest that  similar access and infrastructure constraints call for creative approaches  to negotiating with the host country government and looking for ways to  modify normal operations, such as by bringing in national staff from other  countries and owning boats as opposed to trying to hire them in a market  experiencing shortages and inflated prices.", "Our review found that coordination among donors was also problematic  (see fig. 8). Difficulties in communicating between headquarters in either  Bangkok or Rangoon and the field were the most commonly reported  coordination challenge. As a result, occasionally decisions made at  headquarters conflicted with those made in the field. Reports mentioned  the physical distance between the locations and the limited, and  unreliable, telecommunication services in the delta, as some of the  reasons contributing to the communication challenges. Reliable internet  access was generally lacking in the field, and the Burmese government  restricted the importation and use of communications equipment. Another  widely experienced challenge was gathering and sharing data among  responding organizations. Many reports noted that shared information  was often inaccurate, unreliable, and inconsistent. Some reports  attributed this challenge to factors such as mistrust among organizations,  poor information management practices of some groups, and a lack of  commonly used and readily available reporting mechanisms or common  databases accessible by all responding organizations. Lastly, USAID\u2019s  after action report on the U.S. Cyclone Nargis Emergency Response cited  a challenge within the U.S. government of carrying out a coordinated  response. Conflicting agendas amongst USAID, DOD, and State officials  resulted in coordination difficulties related to the appropriateness, timing,  procurement, and distribution of aid. USAID officials reported that, while  their response was based on humanitarian needs, State and DOD also  had political motives which included engagement with the Burmese  government. As a result, USAID officials reported that DOD conducted  air lifts for a longer period of time than some USAID officials thought was  necessary, and in some cases provided aid that USAID considered  inappropriate. The lessons we identified emphasize the need for installing  common reporting formats for all organizations to use and improving  support to the field offices, including providing more resources such as  local information centers.", "The reports we reviewed highlighted implementation challenges, including  the use of incompatible relief supplies, inappropriate targeting, and  inability to monitor (see fig. 9). Many reports cited examples of donated or  procured assistance supplies that were inferior in quality or incompatible  with local conditions, which limited their usefulness. Examples included  tents, which proved to be inappropriate given the delta\u2019s hot and  humid conditions;  \uf0b7  5-gallon water bottles, which were heavy and difficult to transport; and  \uf0b7  medical supplies that had instructions printed only in non-Burmese  languages.", "In addition, cultural norms and inadequate information about affected  populations complicated responders\u2019 efforts to effectively target and  distribute aid. For example, some organizations based targeting decisions  on the level of need of individuals; however, Burmese culture values  fairness and equality, and as a result many villages would redistribute  supplies to ensure all villagers received something, thereby reducing the  efficacy of the organizations\u2019 efforts to target the neediest with their aid.  Lastly, the lack of trained personnel in the field, the remoteness of certain  locations, or lack of government approval hindered robust monitoring and  evaluation mechanisms. Strategies reported to improve effectiveness of  implementation included engaging with local beneficiaries to involve them  in the development of procurement, targeting, and distribution strategies.", "Our review found that limited emergency preparedness and response  capacity in Burma exacerbated the impact of the disaster and hindered  efforts throughout the response (see fig. 10). One of the most frequently  cited capacity challenges was the inability to meet the high demand for  technical, skilled, and experienced disaster responders. The number of  staff in Burma experienced or trained in disaster relief was below what  was needed. As a result, some positions had to be filled with personnel  that had no previous experience and limited knowledge of humanitarian  response principles, which caused delays or difficulties in carrying out the  response. Also, many organizations described their interaction with local  organizations in coordinated response activities as limited due to  Burmese political, cultural, or capacity factors. These factors included  language and cultural barriers, lack of access to electronically shared  information, limited modes of transportation, and insufficient time and staff  to attend coordination meetings. In addition, the response to Cyclone  Nargis was hampered by weak early warning systems and disaster  preparedness plans in Burma, as well as among international  organizations. Lastly, emergency supply stocks and prepositioned food  supplies were lacking within the country.

Given USAID\u2019s limited  ability to visit project sites in Burma, actions such as conducting more  comprehensive financial oversight, documenting site visits, and  communicating past audit findings become even more important to help  ensure funds are used for intended purposes. The fact that single audit  reports are issued several months after the end of an entity\u2019s fiscal year,  further supports the need for current, on-going financial monitoring.  Periodic reviews of grantee internal controls together with a review of  some of the grantee\u2019s disbursement transactions and supporting  documentation would strengthen USAID\u2019s financial oversight and help  ensure compliance with the terms of the grant agreements, including  compliance with international travel requirements. Reviewing  questionable costs for international travel under the completed and  ongoing grants could enable USAID to recover any costs that USAID  determines to be unallowable. Documenting site visits, as required by  USAID policy, provides a record that can be particularly useful when  program staff change.

Reports cited rainwater harvesting,  ceramic water filters, and earthenware water storage as successful  local solutions. The Red Cross found that bamboo and timber shelter  kits were better accepted than generic versions. With regard to fishing  gear kits, FAO recommends supplying materials that can be used by  beneficiaries to construct gear to meet their own requirements.  Furthermore, nonlocal varieties of seed and livestock should only be  distributed if local counterparts are not available. Because tents are  inappropriate in Burma, UNICEF recommends developing and  propositioning a \u201csemi-permanent school kit\u201d or temporary spaces that  could be used as schools capable of withstanding the Burmese  climate.  \uf0b7  Economic recovery should be identified and initiated as soon as  possible after a disaster, with improved coordination of livelihood  strategies between the Agriculture and Early Recovery Clusters.  According to Save the Children, cash distribution and in-kind grants,  such as those distributed through their Livelihood Quick Impact  Project, were effective in promoting early recovery. In situations where  markets were functioning, UNDP found that cash grants and cash-for- work were more effective than in-kind assistance.  \uf0b7  Targeting efforts should factor in the Burmese tradition of equity that  underlines redistribution. FAO recommends engaging communities in  discussions of aid and allowing them to decide how it should be  distributed in a transparent way.  \uf0b7  The Protection of Children and Women Cluster Review describes the  established Vulnerability Network as a creative response to the  challenging operating environment in Burma prior to Cyclone Nargis  but also states the need for a broader protection cluster to address  remaining protection gaps.  \uf0b7  Analyzed reports also emphasized the need for improved  procurement resources and processes, such as local market  assessments, \u201cpreferred supplier\u201d relationships for key commodities,  and joint buying agreements.
