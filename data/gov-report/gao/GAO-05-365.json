This report assesses (1) TSA's use of budgeted funds to install EDS and ETD systems and the impact of initially deploying these systems, (2) TSA and airport actions to install EDS machines in-line with baggage conveyor systems, and the federal resources made available for this purpose, and (3) actions taken by TSA to optimally deploy checked baggage screening systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA has made substantial progress in installing EDS and ETD systems at the nation's more than 400 airports to provide the capability to screen all checked baggage using explosive detection systems, as mandated by Congress. However, in initially deploying EDS and ETD equipment, TSA placed stand-alone ETD and the minivan-sized EDS machines--mainly in airport lobbies--that were not integrated in-line with airport baggage conveyor systems. TSA officials stated that the agency's ability to initially install in-line systems was limited because of the high costs and the time required for airport modifications. These interim lobby solutions resulted in operational inefficiencies, including requiring a greater number of screeners, as compared with using EDS machines in-line with baggage conveyor systems. TSA and airport operators are taking actions to install in-line baggage screening systems to streamline airport and TSA operations, reduce screening costs, and enhance security. Eighty-six of the 130 airports we surveyed either have, are planning to have, or are considering installing full or partial in-line systems. However, resources have not been made available to fund these capital-intensive systems on a large-scale basis. Also, the overall costs of installing in-line baggage screening systems at each airport are unknown, the availability of future federal funding is uncertain, and perspectives differ regarding the appropriate role of the federal government, airport operators, and air carriers in funding these systems. Moreover, TSA has not conducted a systematic, prospective analysis to determine at which airports it could achieve long-term savings and enhance efficiencies and security by installing in-line systems or, where in-line systems may not be economically justified, by making greater use of stand-alone EDS systems rather than relying on the labor-intensive and less efficient ETD screening process. However, at nine airports where TSA has agreed to help fund the installation of in-line baggage screening systems, TSA conducted a retrospective cost-benefit analysis which showed that these in-line systems could yield significant savings for the federal government. TSA further estimated that it could recover its initial investment in the in-line systems at these airports in a little over 1 year."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As demonstrated by the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner over Lockerbie,  Scotland, U.S. commercial aircraft have long been a target for terrorist  attacks through the use of explosives carried in checked baggage. In 1996,  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established a long-term goal of  screening all checked baggage for explosives to prevent such attacks and a  timetable for deploying explosive detection systems at all airports by 2014.  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, however, increased the  federal government\u2019s focus on screening checked baggage for explosives  at U.S. airports. On November 19, 2001, the Aviation and Transportation  Security Act (ATSA) was signed into law, creating the Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) and mandating, among other things, the  screening of all checked baggage using explosive detection systems by  December 31, 2002. To satisfy this mandate, TSA deployed two types of  screening equipment to all airports in the United States where screening is  required: (1) explosives detection systems (EDS), which use computer- aided tomography X-rays adapted from the medical field to automatically  recognize the characteristic signatures of threat explosives and   (2) explosives trace detection (ETD), which uses chemical analysis to  detect traces of explosive materials\u2019 vapors and residue.", "As we reported in February 2004, largely because of shortages of  equipment and insufficient time to modify airports to accommodate EDS  machines, TSA was unable, at certain airports, to meet the 2002  congressionally established deadline to screen all checked baggage for  explosives using EDS and ETD machines. Recognizing the obstacles   encountered by TSA, Congress passed, and the President signed into law,  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which, in effect, extended the  deadline for screening all checked baggage for explosives until December  31, 2003, for airports at which TSA was unable to meet the earlier deadline  established by ATSA. We also reported that TSA fell short of fully  satisfying the extended 2003 mandate and continued to face challenges in  deploying and leveraging screening equipment and technologies. To  further assess TSA\u2019s efforts to deploy equipment and screen checked  baggage for explosives using EDS and ETD, we addressed the following  questions: (1) How did TSA use the funds it initially budgeted to procure  and install EDS and ETD systems and make associated airport  modifications, and what was the impact of the initial deployment of EDS  and ETD systems? (2) What actions are airports and TSA currently taking  to install automated in-line EDS baggage screening systems, and what are  the federal resources that have been made available to fund these  systems? (3) What actions, if any, is TSA taking to plan for the optimal  deployment of EDS and ETD equipment, including in-line checked  baggage screening systems, in order to ensure the efficiency, cost  effectiveness, and security of its checked baggage screening operations?", "To address these objectives, we reviewed available documentation on  TSA\u2019s checked baggage screening program, including contract obligations  for modifying airports and procuring and installing EDS and ETD systems,  inventory listings of EDS and ETD systems, funding and planning  documentation for in-line systems, and cost analysis of in-line and stand- alone EDS equipment. Although we could not independently verify the  reliability of all of this information, we compared it with other supporting  documents, when available, to determine data consistency and  reasonableness. On the basis of these efforts, we believe the information  we obtained is sufficiently reliable for this report. We also reviewed the  results of covert testing (undercover and unannounced) of checked  baggage screening operations conducted by TSA\u2019s Office of Internal  Affairs and Program Review and questioned TSA officials about the  procedures used to ensure the reliability of the covert test data. Based on  their answers, we believe that the covert test data are sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our review. Further, we interviewed officials from  TSA, air carriers, airports, EDS and ETD equipment manufacturers, and  airport industry associations to obtain information regarding TSA\u2019s efforts  to improve checked baggage screening operations using EDS machines.  We performed our work at TSA headquarters and 22 airports throughout  the United States. At the airports we visited, we observed baggage  screening procedures and discussed these procedures with TSA, airport,  and airline officials. We chose these 22 airports based on one or more of  the following factors: a large number of passenger boardings, the  existence of an operational in-line system, whether the airport had  received or requested TSA funding for an in-line system, whether the  airport had begun screening all checked baggage using EDS or ETD, and  the proximity to a larger airport also being visited by GAO. In addition, we  surveyed all 155 federal security directors, who oversee federal security  operations at one or more airports in the United States where screening is  required to obtain their perspectives on the implementation of checked  baggage screening operations at 263 airports under their supervision, and  to obtain information on these airports\u2019 plans regarding the incorporation  of EDS machines within the airports\u2019 baggage conveyor systems for  screening checked baggage for explosives. We conducted our work from  September 2003 through January 2005 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. A detailed discussion of our  scope and methodology is contained in appendix I. Terms used in this  report are further defined in a glossary at the end of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["With the passage of ATSA in November 2001, TSA assumed from FAA the  majority of the responsibility for securing the commercial aviation  system. Under ATSA, TSA is responsible for ensuring that all baggage is  properly screened for explosives at airports in the United States where  screening is required, and for the procurement, installation, and  maintenance of explosive detection systems used to screen checked  baggage for explosives. ATSA required that TSA screen 100 percent of  checked baggage using explosive detection systems by December 31, 2002.  As it became apparent that certain airports would not meet the December  2002 deadline to screen 100 percent of checked baggage for explosives,  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in effect extended the deadline to  December 31, 2003, for noncompliant airports. Prior to the passage of  ATSA in November 2001, only limited screening of checked baggage for  explosives occurred. When this screening took place, air carriers had  operational responsibility for conducting the screening, while FAA  maintained oversight responsibility. With the passage of ATSA, TSA  assumed operational responsibility from air carriers for screening checked  baggage for explosives. Airport operators and air carriers continued to be  responsible for processing and transporting passenger checked baggage  from the check-in counter to the airplane.", "Explosive detection systems include EDS and ETD machines (see figs. 1  and 2). EDS machines use computer-aided tomography X-rays adapted  from the medical field to automatically recognize the characteristic  signatures of threat explosives. By taking the equivalent of hundreds of   X-ray pictures of a bag from different angles, the EDS machine examines  the objects inside of the baggage to identify characteristic signatures of  threat explosives. TSA has certified, procured, and deployed EDS  machines manufactured by two companies. ETD machines work by  detecting vapors and residues of explosives. Human operators collect  samples by rubbing bags with swabs, which are chemically analyzed to  identify any traces of explosive materials. ETD is used both for primary, or  the initial, screening of checked baggage, as well as secondary screening,  which resolves alarms from EDS machines that indicate the possible  presence of explosives inside a bag. TSA has certified, procured, and  deployed ETD machines from three manufacturers.", "The operational processes for conducting screening of checked baggage  for explosives using ETD and EDS machines differ. Specifically, the ETD  screening process requires the screener to manually screen checked  baggage by (1) swabbing an area of, or item in, the checked bag and   (2) placing the swab in the ETD machine. The ETD machine then  evaluates the sample on the swab to detect trace amounts of explosive  residue. If these steps are not conducted correctly, the test may fail to  detect explosives that are present. Since the first steps of this process  require screeners to collect explosive particles, they are vulnerable to  human error. In contrast, when using EDS machines as the primary means  of detection, the screening is automated and the machine either alarms  indicating the possible presence of explosives or does not alarm without  screener involvement.", "As we reported in February 2004, to initially deploy EDS and ETD  equipment to screen 100 percent of checked baggage for explosives, TSA  implemented interim airport lobby solutions and in-line EDS baggage  screening systems. The interim lobby solutions involved placing stand- alone EDS and ETD machines in the nation\u2019s airports, most often in  airport lobbies or baggage makeup areas where baggage is sorted for  loading onto aircraft. For EDS in a stand-alone mode (not integrated with  airport\u2019s or air carrier\u2019s baggage conveyor system) and ETD, TSA  screeners are responsible for obtaining the passengers\u2019 checked baggage  from either the passenger or the air carrier, lifting the bags onto and off of  EDS machines or ETD tables, using TSA protocols to appropriately screen  the bags, and returning the cleared bags to the air carriers to be loaded  onto departing aircraft.", "In addition to installing stand-alone EDS and ETD machines in airport  lobbies and baggage makeup areas, TSA collaborated with some airport  operators and air carriers to install integrated in-line EDS baggage  screening systems within their baggage conveyor systems. While each in- line baggage screening system is unique, these systems generally operate  in a similar manner, as shown in figure 3. Typically, in-line systems involve  checked baggage undergoing automated screening while on a conveyor  belt that sorts and transports baggage to the proper location for its  ultimate loading onto an aircraft. During this automated process, all  checked baggage on the conveyor belt passes through EDS machines  where the bags are screened for explosives. If no explosives are detected  during this primary screening, the bag continues forward on the main  conveyor belt to be loaded onto the aircraft. If an EDS machine alarms,  indicating the possibility of explosives, TSA screeners, by reviewing  computer-generated images of the inside of the bag, attempt to determine  whether a suspect item is actually a threat. If the screener determines  that the suspect item is not a threat, the cleared bag continues on the  conveyor belt system to be loaded onto the aircraft. If the screener is  unable to make this determination, the bag is diverted from the main  conveyor belt into an area where it receives a secondary screening in  which the bag is opened and the contents of the bag are screened by a  screener using an ETD machine and physical inspection. If the bag  successfully clears secondary screening, it is placed on the main conveyor  belt system to be loaded onto the aircraft. If the bag tests positive for  explosives during secondary screening, TSA screeners are required to  notify the appropriate officials.", "Both airports and the federal government have cooperated to jointly fund  the installation of in-line EDS baggage screening systems. The federal  government has used three funding mechanisms to modify airport  facilities to install in-line EDS systems\u2014LOIs, other transaction  agreements, and Airport Improvement Program funds from the FAA. In  2003, Congress authorized TSA to issue LOIs for airport modifications  related to the installation of in-line baggage screening systems. When an  LOI is established to provide multiyear funding for a project, the airport  operator is responsible for providing\u2014up front\u2014the total funding needed  to complete the project, even though the LOI is not a binding commitment  of federal funds. Work proceeds with the understanding that TSA will, if  sufficient funding is appropriated, reimburse the airport operator for a  percentage of the facility modification costs. Congress initially mandated a  75 percent federal government cost-share for LOIs in February 2003, but in  December of that year it increased the cost-share to 90 percent. However,  the fiscal year 2005 DHS Appropriations Act subsequently re-established  the federal government cost-share at 75 percent for fiscal year 2005. Also,  the President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request for TSA proposes to  maintain the 75 percent federal government cost share for projects funded  by LOIs at large and medium airports.", "TSA also uses other transaction agreements, which are administrative  vehicles used by TSA to directly fund airport operators engaged, or  planning to engage, in smaller in-line airport modification projects without  undertaking a long-term commitment. These transactions, which can take  many forms and are generally not required to comply with federal laws  and regulations that apply to contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements,  enable the federal government and others entering into these agreements  to freely negotiate provisions that are mutually agreeable.", "In addition, airports have utilized Airport Improvement Program grants,  which are awarded by the Secretary of Transportation for airport planning  and development to maintain a safe and efficient nationwide system of  public airports and for limited aviation security purposes. Some airport  operators used the Airport Improvement Program in fiscal years 2002 and  2003 to fund facility modifications needed to accommodate installing in- line systems. However, provisions of ATSA and the Vision 100\u2014Century of  Aviation Reauthorization Act (Vision 100), as well as fiscal years 2004 and  2005 appropriations language, have limited the future availability of the  Airport Improvement Program to fund in-line systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Equipped More than 400 Airports to Screen Checked Baggage for Explosives, but the Initial Deployment Led to Operational Inefficiencies, and Additional Security Risks", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception in November 2001 through September 2004, TSA  obligated about $2.5 billion (93 percent) of the approximately $2.7 billion it  budgeted for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for the procurement and  installation of EDS and ETD machines to screen checked baggage for  explosives and to modify airport facilities to accommodate this equipment.  Although TSA made significant progress in fielding this equipment, TSA  used most of the $2.5 billion to design, develop, and deploy interim lobby  screening solutions rather than install more permanent in-line EDS  baggage screening systems. TSA employed these as interim solutions in  order to meet the congressional deadline for screening all checked  baggage for explosives because of the significant costs required to install  in-line systems and the need to reconfigure many airports\u2019 baggage  conveyor systems to accommodate the equipment. TSA officials also  stated that they did not have time to conduct the planning needed or make  airport modifications required for longer-term and more streamlined  baggage screening operations. However, these interim lobby screening  solutions used by TSA resulted in operational inefficiencies and additional  security risks. Specifically, TSA\u2019s use of stand-alone EDS and ETD  machines required a greater number of screener staff and resulted in  screening fewer bags for explosives per hour, as compared with using EDS  machines in-line with baggage conveyor systems. Also, screening with  ETD machines, as is the case for more than 300 airports, is more labor- intensive and less efficient than screening using the EDS process.

As shown in table 1, the  Congress earmarked about $1.5 billion of the $2.7 billion budgeted amount  specifically to install EDS and ETD equipment, and to modify and prepare  airport facilities to incorporate the use of this equipment for screening  checked baggage for explosives. Congress earmarked and TSA budgeted  the remaining $1.2 billion for the procurement of EDS and ETD machines.", "As of the end of fiscal year 2004, TSA used about one-half of the   $2.5 billion that it had obligated to modify airport facilities and to install  EDS and ETD machines, and the remaining half primarily to procure EDS  and ETD machines. As of September 30, 2004, TSA had obligated  approximately $1.3 billion of the approximately $1.5 billion that had been  earmarked for airport modifications and the installation of EDS and ETD  equipment. As shown in table 2, TSA had used about $885 million (about  68 percent) of these obligated funds for the general deployment and  installation of EDS and ETD equipment at various airports as part of  interim lobby solutions to quickly install checked baggage screening  equipment. Also included in this amount are funds that TSA used for  installing interim partial in-line baggage screening systems at some  airports. In general, these systems were for sections of an airport, were  not fully integrated into the airport\u2019s baggage handling system, and most  often were temporary until a permanent in-line system could be installed.  For example, TSA awarded the Port of Seattle about $9 million for the  construction of interim partial in-line systems and modification of the   baggage handling systems serving four airlines at the Seattle-Tacoma  International Airport. These interim partial in-line systems, which are not  fully integrated with the baggage handling systems, will be replaced by  permanent in-line baggage screening systems that will be fully integrated  with the airport\u2019s baggage handling systems by March 2007. Most of the  remaining airport modification and equipment installation obligations are  being used by TSA for work related to the permanent in-line integration of  EDS baggage screening equipment into airportwide or individual terminal  baggage conveyor systems at 33 airports. See appendix III for a listing of  the 33 airports having in-line baggage screening systems installed and the  source of TSA funding for the in-line systems.", "TSA contracted with Boeing Service Company in June 2002 to be the  prime contractor for deploying EDS and ETD equipment at the nation\u2019s  airports. This effort involved designing and implementing airport facility  modifications for EDS and ETD equipment, such as new construction,  infrastructure reinforcement, and modification of electrical systems  required to install the EDS and ETD equipment. Originally, the period of  performance for this contract was to expire on December 31, 2002.  However, TSA extended the contract\u2019s period of performance in order for  Boeing to perform activities associated with installing interim lobby  solutions to help airports meet or to maintain compliance to screen   100 percent of checked baggage with explosive detection systems. These  contract extensions have resulted in a $486.3 million increase in TSA  obligations against this contract for work related to airport modifications  and EDS and ETD installation from $372.6 million in fiscal year 2002 to  $858.8 million as of September 30, 2004.

TSA fielded most of the EDS and  ETD machines needed to screen checked baggage for explosives to the  nation\u2019s over 400 airports by the congressionally mandated date of  December 2003 (extended from the original deadline of December 2002),  despite limited time to deploy the equipment and some of the equipment  not being available when needed. In 1996, FAA, the organization then  responsible for the procurement of checked baggage screening equipment,  established a long-term goal of fielding explosive detection systems at all  airports within 18 years\u2014by 2014. As of June 2002, we reported that FAA  had fielded 200 EDS and 200 ETD systems to 56 airports. In about two  and one-half years following the mandate to screen all checked baggage  for explosives, TSA\u2019s deployment of equipment resulted in 1,228 EDS  machines and 7,146 ETD machines being available in over 400 airports, as  shown in table 4. Initially, EDS manufacturers were unable to produce and  deliver the number of machines needed by TSA, and TSA determined that  a mix of EDS and ETD technologies would provide an efficient and  effective means of passenger protection.", "During our site visits to 22 category X, I, and II airports, we observed that  in most cases, TSA used stand-alone EDS machines and ETD machines as  the primary method for screening checked baggage. Generally, this  equipment was located in airport lobbies and in baggage makeup areas. In  addition, in our survey of 155 federal security directors, we asked the  directors to estimate, for the 263 airports included in the survey, the  approximate percentage of checked baggage that was screened on or  around February 29, 2004, using EDS, ETD, or other approved alternatives  for screening baggage such as positive passenger bag match or canine  searches. As shown in table 5, the directors reported that for   130 large to medium-sized airports in our survey (21, 60, and 49 category X,  I, and II airports, respectively), most of the checked baggage was screened  using stand-alone EDS or ETD machines. The average percentage of  checked baggage reported as screened using EDS machines at airports  with partial or full in-line EDS capability ranged from 4 percent for  category II airports to 11 percent for category X airports. In addition, the  directors reported that ETD machines were used to screen checked  baggage 93 to 99 percent of the time at category III and IV airports,  respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim Solutions Resulted in Operational Inefficiencies and Additional Security Risks", "paragraphs": ["TSA\u2019s interim solution of using stand-alone EDS and ETD machines as the  primary method to screen checked baggage for explosives led to  operational inefficiencies including (1) the increased use of screener staff,  (2) a lower baggage throughput rate per hour for screening baggage for  explosives, and (3) an increase in on-the-job injuries. Further, at many  airports, TSA\u2019s placement of the minivan-sized stand-alone EDS machines  and ETD machines in airport lobbies at times resulted in passenger  crowding, which presented unsafe conditions and may have added  security risks for passengers and airport workers.", "Stand-alone EDS and ETD machines are both labor- and time-intensive to  operate since each bag must be physically carried to an EDS or ETD  machine for screening and then moved back to the baggage conveyor  system prior to being loaded onto an aircraft. With an in-line EDS system,  checked baggage is screened within an airport\u2019s baggage conveyor system,  eliminating the need for a baggage screener or other personnel to  physically transport the baggage from the check-in point to the EDS  machine for screening and then to the airport baggage conveyor system.  Further, according to TSA officials, ETD machines and stand-alone EDS  machines are less efficient in the number of checked bags that can be  screened per hour per machine than are EDS machines that are integrated  in-line with the airport baggage conveyor systems. As shown in table 6, as  of October 2003, TSA estimated that the number of checked bags screened  per hour could more than double when EDS machines were placed in-line  versus being used in a stand-alone mode. According to a senior TSA  official in the Office of Security Technology, these throughput numbers  could change as TSA gains greater operational experience.", "In January 2004, TSA, in support of its planning, budgeting, and acquisition  of security screening equipment, reported to the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) that the efficiency benefits of in-line rather than stand- alone EDS are significant, particularly with regard to bags per hour  screened and the number of TSA screeners required to operate the  equipment. According to TSA officials, at that time, a typical lobby-based  screening unit consisting of a stand-alone EDS machine with three ETD  machines had a baggage throughput of 376 bags per hour with a staffing  requirement of 19 screeners. In contrast, TSA estimated that  approximately 425 bags per hour could be screened by in-line EDS  machines with a staffing requirement of 4.25 screeners.", "In order to achieve the higher throughput rates and reduce the number of  screener staff needed to operate in-line baggage screening systems, TSA  (1) uses a screening procedure known as \u201con-screen alarm resolution\u201d and  (2) networks multiple in-line EDS machines together, referred to as  \u201cmultiplexing,\u201d so that the computer-generated images of bags from these  machines are sent to a central location where TSA screeners can monitor  the images of suspect bags centrally from several machines using the on- screen alarm resolution procedure. When an EDS machine alarms,  indicating the possibility that explosive material may be contained in the  bag, the on-screen alarm resolution procedure allows screeners to  examine computer-generated images of the inside of a bag to determine if  suspect items identified by the EDS machines are in fact suspicious. If a  screener, by viewing these images, is able to determine that the suspect  item or items identified by the EDS machine are in fact harmless, the  screener is allowed to clear the bag, and it is sent to the airline baggage  makeup area for loading onto the aircraft. If the screener is not able to  make the determination that the bag does not contain suspicious objects,  the bag is sent to a secondary screening room where the bag is further  examined by a screener. In secondary screening, the screener opens the  bag and examines the suspect item or items, and usually swabs the items  to collect a sample for analysis using an ETD machine. TSA also uses this  on-screen alarm resolution procedure with stand-alone EDS machines.", "A TSA official estimated that the on-screen alarm resolution procedure  with in-line EDS baggage screening systems will enable TSA to reduce by  40 to 60 percent the number of bags requiring the more labor-intensive  secondary screening using ETD machines. In estimating the potential  savings in staffing requirements, TSA officials stated that they expect to  achieve a 20 to 25 percent savings because of reductions in the number of  staff needed to screen bags using ETD to resolve alarms from in-line EDS  machines.", "TSA also reported that because procedures for using stand-alone EDS and  ETD machines require screeners to lift heavy baggage onto and off of the  machines, the interim lobby screening solutions used by TSA led to  significant numbers of on-the-job injuries. In addition, in responding to  our survey about 263 airports, numerous federal security directors  reported that on-the-job injuries related to lifting heavy baggage onto or  off the EDS and ETD machines were a significant concern at the airports  for which they were responsible. Specifically, these federal security  directors reported that on-the-job injuries caused by lifting heavy bags  onto and off of EDS machines were a significant concern at 65 airports,  and were a significant concern with the use of ETD machines at   110 airports. To reduce on-the-job injuries, TSA has provided training to  screeners on proper lifting procedures. However, according to TSA  officials, in-line EDS screening systems would significantly reduce the  need for screeners to handle baggage, thus further reducing the number of  on-the-job injuries being experienced by TSA baggage screeners.", "In addition, during our site visits to 22 large and medium-sized airports,  several TSA, airport, and airline officials expressed concern regarding the  security risks caused by overcrowding due to ETD and stand-alone EDS  machines being located in airport lobbies. The location of the equipment  resulted in less space available to accommodate passenger movement and  caused congestion due to passengers having to wait in lines in public areas  to have their checked baggage screened. TSA headquarters officials also  reported that large groups of people congregating in crowded airport  lobbies, as shown in figure 4, increases security risks by creating a  potential target for terrorists. The TSA officials noted that crowded airport  lobbies have been the scenes of terrorist attacks in the past. For example,  in December 1985, four terrorists walked to the El Al ticket counter at  Rome\u2019s Leonardo DaVinci Airport and opened fire with assault rifles and  grenades, killing 13 and wounding 75.

In its analysis,  TSA also found that a key factor driving many of these costs is  throughput\u2014how many bags an in-line EDS system can screen per hour  compared with the rate for a stand-alone system. TSA used this factor to  determine how many stand-alone EDS machines could be replaced by a  single in-line EDS machine while achieving the same throughput.

However, the actual number of TSA screeners and supervisor  positions that could be eliminated would be dependent on the individual  design and operating conditions at each airport.", "TSA also reported that aside from increased efficiency and lower overall  costs, there were a number of qualitative benefits that in-line systems  would provide over stand-alone systems, including:  fewer on-the-job injuries, since there is less lifting of baggage when EDS  machines are integrated into the airport\u2019s baggage conveyor system;  less lobby disruption because the stand-alone EDS and ETD machines  would be removed from airport lobbies; and    unbroken chain of custody of baggage because in-line systems are more  secure, since the baggage handling is performed away from passengers.", "TSA\u2019s retrospective analysis of these nine airports indicates the potential  for cost savings through the installation of in-line EDS baggage screening  systems at other airports, and it provides insights about key factors likely  to influence potential cost savings from using in-line systems at other  airports. This analysis also indicates the merit of conducting prospective  analyses of other airports to provide information for future federal  government funding decisions as required by the OMB guidance on cost- benefit analyses. This guidance describes best practices for preparing  benefit-cost analysis of government programs or projects, one of which  involves analyzing uncertainty.

Stand-alone EDS  machines are able to screen a greater number of bags in an hour than the  ETD used for primary screening while lessening reliance on screeners  during the screening process. For example, TSA\u2019s analysis showed that an  ETD machine can screen 36 bags per hour, while the stand-alone EDS  machines can screen 120 to 180 bags per hour. As a result, it would take  three to five ETD machines to screen the same number of bags that one  stand-alone EDS machine could process. In addition, greater use of the  stand-alone EDS machines could reduce staffing requirements. For  example, one stand-alone EDS machine would potentially require 6 to 14  fewer screeners than would be required to screen the same number of  bags at a screening station with three to five ETD machines.

The smaller size of the  system creates opportunities for TSA to transfer screening operations to  other locations such as airport check-in counters.

With the objective of initially  fielding this equipment largely accomplished, TSA needs to shift its focus  from equipping airports with interim screening solutions to systematically  planning for the more optimal deployment of checked baggage screening  systems. The need for sound planning is also recognized by Congress  through the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and  through the fiscal year 2005 DHS Appropriations Act Conference Report,  which, among other things, directs TSA to develop a comprehensive plan  for expediting the installation of in-line explosive detection systems. Part  of such planning should include analyzing which airports should receive  federal support for in-line EDS baggage screening systems based on cost  savings that could be achieved from more effective and efficient baggage  screening operations and on other factors, including enhanced security.  Also, for airports, where in-line systems may not be economically justified  because of high investment costs, a cost effectiveness analysis could be  used to determine the benefits of additional stand-alone EDS machines to  screen checked baggage in place of the more labor-intensive ETD  machines that are currently being used at the more than 300 airports. In  addition, TSA should consider the costs and benefits of the new  technologies being developed through its research and development  efforts, which could provide smaller EDS machines that have the potential  to reduce the costs associated with installing in-line EDS baggage  screening systems or to replace ETD machines currently used as the  primary method for screening.

In fact, the analysis showed that using  in-line systems instead of stand-alone systems at these nine airports would  save the federal government about $1 billion over 7 years and that TSA\u2019s  initial investment would be recovered in a little over 1 year. In considering  airports for in-line baggage screening systems or the continued use of  stand-alone EDS and ETD machines, a systematic analysis of the costs and  benefits of these systems would help TSA justify the appropriate screening  for a particular airport, and such planning would help support funding  requests by demonstrating enhanced security, improved operational  efficiencies, and cost savings to both TSA and the affected airport.", "In addition to identifying the most optimal baggage screening solutions at  the nation\u2019s airports, a systematic analysis of baggage screening  operations and solutions\u2014including an estimate of savings that could be  achieved through the installation of in-line EDS baggage screening  systems\u2014would assist the Administration and Congress in determining  the appropriate role of the federal government and aviation industry in  funding capital-intensive in-line baggage screening systems. By identifying  efficiencies that could be achieved for both TSA\u2014such as savings  achieved through reduced TSA staffing needs for screeners\u2014and the  airports and airlines\u2014such as increased security due to less crowding in  airport lobbies and the faster processing of baggage and passengers\u2014the  Administration and Congress would have information identifying the costs  and benefits of in-line baggage screening systems for all parties involved to  assist in determining an appropriate cost-share between the federal  government and aviation industry in funding these systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In developing the comprehensive plan for installing in-line EDS baggage  screening systems, as directed by the fiscal year 2005 DHS Appropriation  Act Conference Report, and in satisfying the requirements set forth in the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, we recommend  that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security direct the  Administrator for the Transportation Security Administration to  systematically assess the costs and benefits of deploying in-line baggage  screening systems at airports that do not yet have in-line systems installed.

Regarding our recommendation that TSA  systematically assess the costs and benefits of deploying in-line baggage  screening systems at airports that do not yet have in-line systems installed,  DHS stated that TSA has initiated an analysis of deploying in-line checked  baggage screening systems and is in the process of formulating criteria to  use to identify those airports that would benefit from an in-line system.  According to DHS, TSA believes that it can focus on approximately 40  airports that handle anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of all checked  baggage nationwide. Once TSA officials have finalized the criteria and  determined those airports at which in-line systems should be installed,  they plan to conduct an airport-specific analysis to determine the  individual costs and operational benefits. We are encouraged that TSA is  proceeding with this analysis, which should provide a sound business case  to justify resource allocation decisions. It is important, however, that TSA  establish milestones and time frames for completing the analysis and  documenting and reporting the results, such that they are available in a  timely manner for DHS and congressional budget decisions.", "Concerning our recommendation that TSA assess the feasibility, expected  benefits, and costs of replacing ETD machines with stand-alone EDS  machines for primary screening at those airports where in-line systems  would either not be economically justified or justified for other reasons,  DHS stated that TSA has started conducting an analysis of the airports that  rely on ETD machines as the primary checked baggage screening  technology to identify those airports that would benefit from replacing  ETDs with stand-alone EDS equipment. Again, we are pleased that TSA  officials are conducting this analysis, which should provide them with the  basis for optimizing the use of its EDS machines for screening checked  baggage. Further, DHS stated that TSA continues to review and refine the  protocols and training of all screening procedures including screening  checked baggage, and are in the process of implementing the  recommendations made by the DHS Inspector General regarding improved  screener training and other improvements for both the passenger and  checkpoint and checked baggage.", "TSA also provided additional technical comments on our draft report,  which we have incorporated where appropriate.", "We will send copies of the report to the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security, the TSA Administrator, and interested congressional  committees as appropriate.

(2) What actions are airports and TSA currently taking  to install automated in-line EDS baggage screening systems, and what are  the federal resources that have been made available to fund these  systems? (3) What actions, if any, is TSA taking to plan for the optimal  deployment of in-line baggage screening systems in order to ensure the  efficiency, cost effectiveness, and security of its checked baggage  screening operations?", "To determine how TSA used its funding for procuring and installing EDS  and ETD systems and modifying airports, we obtained and analyzed  relevant legislation and appropriate budget documents, contracts, and  inventory reports from TSA related to checked baggage screening with  EDS and ETD machines. We interviewed TSA officials from the Office of  Budget and Performance, the Office of Acquisition, and TSA\u2019s Security  Technology Deployment Office. We also obtained and reviewed funding  and contractual documents from these locations. To determine what  impact the initial deployment of EDS and ETD systems had on TSA and  airport operations, we conducted a literature search to obtain information  on the purpose and use of explosive detection screening equipment to  screen checked baggage at airports for explosives. This search identified  various TSA reports, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector  General reports, Congressional Research Service reports, and aviation  industry reports documenting TSA\u2019s use of this equipment for screening  checked baggage. Also, we obtained and reviewed relevant documents  from TSA and interviewed TSA headquarters officials from TSA\u2019s Office of  Aviation Operations, Office of Chief Counsel, Office of Technology  Deployment and Maintenance, and Office of Internal Affairs and Program  Review. This documentation included information on staffing  requirements and the number of bags per hour that can be screened by in- line EDS systems as compared with stand-alone EDS and ETD machines.  We also interviewed officials from TSA, air carriers, airports, explosive  detection systems equipment manufacturers, and airport industry  associations to obtain information regarding TSA\u2019s efforts to improve  checked baggage screening operations using EDS machines. Although we  could not independently verify the reliability of all of this information, we  compared it with other supporting documents, when available, to  determine data consistency and reasonableness. Based on these efforts,  we believe the information we obtained is sufficiently reliable for this  report. Further, we reviewed the results from unannounced, undercover  covert testing of checked baggage screening operations conducted by  TSA\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review and questioned TSA  officials about the procedures used to ensure the reliability of the covert  test data. On the basis of their answers, we believe that the covert test data  are sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.", "To address our second and third objectives\u2014to determine what actions  airports and TSA are taking to develop in-line EDS baggage screening  systems and what resources are available for these systems; and to  determine what TSA is doing to optimally deploy these systems in order to  improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness, and security of its checked  baggage screening operations\u2014we obtained briefings and other  documents related to the planned use and installation of in-line systems  and interviewed officials from the Office of Chief Counsel and the Office  of Security Technology. We also interviewed officials from the TSA\u2019s  Transportation Security Laboratory in Atlantic City, New Jersey, to discuss  the agency\u2019s efforts to examine future baggage screening technologies and  the certification process for EDS and ETD equipment. We also used  information related to checked baggage screening from a Web-based  survey of all 155 federal security directors about 263 of the airports under  their supervision. This survey is described below. We also followed up by  telephone with airport officials from 70 of those airports to obtain  additional information about their plans for in-line systems. These airports  were selected primarily based on the responses from the federal security  directors regarding whether the airport had or planned on installing in-line  EDS checked baggage screening systems. In addition, GAO\u2019s Office of  General Counsel formally requested that TSA describe its means for  compliance with the baggage screening requirements of the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and  inquired how TSA would approach its letters of intent for funding in-line  checked baggage screening systems in light of changes mandated by the  Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. Also, to assess  potential savings, we reviewed a TSA cost model showing savings  expected to be achieved with in-line rather than stand-alone EDS  equipment at nine airports. We assessed the model\u2019s logic to ensure its  completeness and correctness of calculations. Also, as discussed in  appendix IV, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to: (1) illustrate  sensitivity of potential cost savings of replacing stand-alone with in-line  EDS systems to alternative values of key cost drivers and (2) to explore  the variability in the key factors used by TSA in their model. Based on our  review of TSA\u2019s cost model, we believe that it is sufficiently reliable for the  analyses we conducted and the information included in this report.", "In addition, in addressing all three objectives, we conducted site visits and  a Web-based survey. Specifically, we conducted site visits at   22 airports (12 category X airports, 9 category I airports, and 1 category II  airport) to observe airport security baggage screening procedures and  discuss issues related to the baggage screening processes with TSA,  airport, and airline officials. We chose these airports on the basis of one or  more of the following factors: a large number of passenger boardings; the  existence of an operational in-line system; whether the airport had  received or requested TSA funding for an in-line system; whether the  airport had begun screening all checked baggage using EDS or ETD; and  the proximity to a larger airport being visited by GAO. The results from  our airport visits provide examples of checked baggage screening  operations and issues but cannot be generalized beyond the airports  visited because we did not use statistical sampling techniques in selecting  the airports. We administered a Web-based survey to all 155 federal  security directors who oversee security at each of the airports falling  under TSA\u2019s jurisdiction. The questionnaire contained questions related to  the status of checked baggage screening operations and planning and  implementation of in-line EDS checked baggage screening systems. A GAO  survey specialist designed the questionnaire in combination with other  GAO staff knowledgeable about airport security issues. We conducted  pretest interviews with six federal security directors to ensure that the  questions were clear, concise, and comprehensive. In addition, TSA  managers and an independent GAO survey specialist reviewed the  questionnaire.", "For this Web-based survey, each federal security director received one or  two airport-specific questionnaires to complete, depending on the number  of airports for which he or she was responsible. Where a federal security  director was responsible for more than two airports, we selected the first  airport based on the federal security director\u2019s location and the second  airport to obtain a cross-section of all airports by size and geographic  distribution. In all, we requested information on 265 airports. However,  two airports were dropped from our initial selection because the airlines  serving these airports suspended operations and TSA employees were  redeployed to other airports. As a result, our sample size was reduced to  263 airports, which included all 21 category X airports,   60 category I airports, 49 category II airports, 73 category III airports, and  60 category IV airports. In that we did not use probability sampling  methods to select the sample of airports, we cannot generalize our  findings beyond the selected airports in these categories.", "We conducted this Web-based survey from late March to mid-May 2004.  We received completed questionnaires from all 155 federal security  directors for all 263 separate airports for which we sought information for  a 100 percent response rate. We called selected survey respondents, or  other TSA officials designated to respond on the respondent\u2019s behalf, to  obtain answers to key survey questions that may have been left blank, to  look into situations where instructions were not followed and to  investigate answers that looked suspicious or out of range. The survey  results are not subject to sampling errors because all federal security  directors were asked to participate in the survey and we did not use  probability sampling techniques to select specific airports. However, the  practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For example,  inconsistencies in how a particular question is interpreted, in the sources  of information that are available to respondents, or in how the data are  entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce unwanted  variability in the survey results. We took steps in the development of the  questionnaires, the data collection, and the data editing and analysis to  minimize these non-sampling errors. Also, in that these were Web-based  surveys whereby respondents entered their responses directly into our  database, data entry or transcription errors were possible. In addition, all  computer programs used to analyze the data were peer-reviewed and  verified to ensure that the syntax was written and executed correctly.", "We performed our work from September 2003 through January 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To make these estimates, TSA made a variety of  assumptions about in-line and stand-alone EDS systems, including how  many bags can be processed per hour by both, how many screeners both  would need, and how much it would cost to purchase, install, and operate  these systems. In addition, TSA used data on how much it cost to modify  these nine airports to accommodate in-line systems. In considering the  accuracy of TSA\u2019s estimates, uncertainties inherent in many of these  assumptions should be considered. TSA could have analyzed uncertainty  in their estimate by conducting sensitivity or other analyses to determine  how variations in these assumptions would change its estimate of cost  savings. Analyzing uncertainty in this way is consistent with best practices  for preparing benefit-cost analysis of government programs or projects  called for by OMB Circular A-94. Nonetheless, TSA\u2019s cost model for these  nine airports offers insights about key factors likely to influence potential  cost savings at other airports.", "To illustrate taking uncertainty into account, we conducted a Monte Carlo  analysis using TSA\u2019s cost model. We found that TSA\u2019s cost savings  estimate of $3.5 million per in-line EDS machine as compared to stand- alone could range from a loss of $1.6 million to a savings of $8.3 million  per machine using generalized assumptions about cost uncertainty in  TSA\u2019s model. The most important source of uncertainty causing this wide  range in possible savings was the cost to modify an airport to  accommodate an in-line EDS system. Variation in modification costs  explained over 60 percent of the variation in potential cost savings from  in-line EDS as compared to stand-alone EDS. The next most important  variable, the number of bags per hour that in-line and stand-alone  machines can screen per hour, each accounted for about 15 percent of the  variation in cost savings. In this way, Monte Carlo analysis can offer  insights on factors to focus on when determining the appropriateness of  an in-line EDS baggage screening system for a particular airport.", "The analysis provided by TSA aggregated the nine airports to present a  total estimate. Using TSA\u2019s analysis, we were able to determine the results  for each of the nine airports. Figure 7 illustrates the variation in  modification costs at the nine airports TSA studied, ranging from over   $14 million per in-line EDS machine at Seattle to less than $2 million for  Boston and Dallas-Fort Worth. Figure 8, which shows the cost savings  from in-line EDS compared to stand-alone EDS, identifies that Seattle  could end up spending more for an in-line EDS system than from using  stand-alone EDS machines. Further, as shown in figure 9, at Seattle the  relatively large costs for upfront in-line EDS are not offset by the  estimated $48 million in operation and maintenance cost savings;  therefore, the in-line EDS system may be more costly than EDS stand- alone. By contrast, at Dallas-Fort Worth, the upfront costs of in-line EDS  are lower than for stand-alone EDS, and there is an estimated $252 million  in operation and maintenance cost savings.
