It has goals of adding 100,000 officer positions, funded by grants, to the streets of communities nationwide and of promoting community policing.", "Under the Community Policing Act, the Attorney General had discretion to decide which Justice component would administer community policing grants. Justice officials believed that a new, efficient customer-oriented organization was needed to process the record number of grants. The result was the creation of the new Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).

According to the COPS Office program regulations, there is no one approach to community policing implementation. However, community policing programs do stress three principles that make them different from traditional law enforcement programs: (1) prevention, (2) problemsolving, and (3) partnerships (see app. II). Community policing emphasizes the importance of police-citizen cooperation to control crime, maintain order, and improve the quality of life in communities. The police and community members are active partners in defining the problems that need to be addressed, the tactics to be used in addressing them, and the measurement of the success of the efforts.", "The practice of community policing, which emerged in the 1970s, was developed at the street level by rank-and-file police officers. Justice supported community policing and predecessor programs for more than 15 years before the current COPS grant program was authorized. Previous projects noted by Justice officials as forerunners to the funding of community policing included Weed and Seed, which was a community- based strategy to \u201cweed out\u201d violent crime, gang activities, and drugs and to \u201cseed in\u201d neighborhood revitalization.", "House and Senate conferees, in their joint statement explaining actions taken on the Community Policing Act, emphasized their support of grants for community policing. The conferees noted that the involvement of community members in public safety projects significantly assisted in preventing and controlling crime and violence.", "As shown in table 1, $5.2 billion was authorized for the COPS grant program from its inception in fiscal year 1995 to the end of fiscal year 1997; $4.1 billion of which was appropriated over this period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "COPS Grants Not Targeted to Specific Law Enforcement Agencies and Supplanting Is Prohibited", "paragraphs": ["The Community Policing Act does not target grants to law enforcement agencies on the basis of which agency has the greatest need for assistance. Rather, agencies are required to demonstrate a public safety need and an inability to address this need without a grant. Grantees are also required to contribute 25 percent of the costs of the program, project, or activity funded by the grant, unless the Attorney General waives the matching requirement. According to Justice officials, the basis for waiver of the matching requirements is extraordinary local fiscal hardship.", "In one of our previous reports, we reviewed alternative strategies, including targeting, for increasing the fiscal impact of federal grants. We noted that federal grants have been established to achieve a variety of goals. If the desired goal is to target fiscal relief to areas experiencing greater fiscal stress, grant allocation formulas could be changed to include a combination of factors that allocate a larger share of federal aid to those states with relatively greater program needs and fewer resources.", "The Community Policing Act also requires that grants be used to supplement, not supplant, state and local funds. To prevent supplanting, grantees must devote resources to law enforcement beyond those resources that would have been available without a COPS grant. In general, grantees are expected to use the hiring grants to increase the number of funded sworn officers above the number on board in October 1994, when the program began. Grantees are required to have plans to assume a progressively larger share of the cost over time, looking toward keeping the increased hiring levels by using state and local funds after the expiration of the federal grant program at the end of fiscal year 2000.", "Assessing whether supplanting has taken place in the community policing grant program was outside the scope of our review. However, in our previously mentioned report on grant design, our synthesis of literature on the fiscal impact of grants suggested that each additional federal grant dollar results in about 40 cents of added spending on the aided activity. This means that the fiscal impact of the remaining 60 cents is to free up state or local funds that otherwise would have been spent on that activity for other programs or tax relief."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "COPS Office Grant Monitoring Was Limited", "paragraphs": ["Monitoring is an important tool for Justice to use in ensuring that law enforcement jurisdictions funded by COPS grants comply with federal program requirements. The Community Policing Act requires that each COPS Office program, project, or activity contain a monitoring component developed pursuant to guidelines established by the Attorney General. In addition, the COPS program regulations specify that each grant is to contain a monitoring component, including periodic financial and programmatic reporting and, in appropriate circumstances, on-site reviews. The regulations state that the guidelines for monitoring are to be issued by the COPS Office.", "COPS Office grant-monitoring activities during the first 2-1/2 years of the program were limited. Final COPS Office monitoring guidance had not been issued as of June 1997. Information on activities and accomplishments for COPS-funded programs was not consistently collected or reviewed. Site visits and telephone monitoring by grant advisers did not systematically take place.", "COPS Office officials said that monitoring efforts were limited due to a lack of grant adviser staff and an early program focus on processing applications to get officers on the street. According to a COPS Office official, as of July 1997, the COPS Office had about 155 total staff positions, up from about 130 positions that it had when the office was established. Seventy of these positions were for grant administration, including processing grant applications, responding to questions from grantees, and monitoring grantee performance. The remaining positions were for staff who worked in various other areas, including training; technical assistance; administration; and public, intergovernmental, and congressional liaison.", "In January 1997, the COPS Office began taking steps to increase the level of its monitoring. It developed monitoring guidelines, revised reporting forms, piloted on-site monitoring visits, and initiated telephone monitoring of grantees\u2019 activities.", "As of July 1997, a COPS Office official said that the office had funding authorization to increase its staff to 186 positions, and it was in the process of hiring up to this level. In commenting on our draft report, COPS officials also noted that they were recruiting for more than 30 staff positions in a new monitoring component to be exclusively devoted to overseeing grant compliance activities.", "COPS Office officials also said that some efforts were under way to review compliance with requirements of the Community Policing Act that grants be used to supplement, not supplant, local funding. In previous work, we reported that enforcing such provisions of grant programs was difficult for federal agencies due to problems in ascertaining state and local spending intentions. According to the COPS Office Assistant Director of Grant Administration, the COPS Office\u2019s approach to achieving compliance with the nonsupplantation provision was to receive accounts of potential violations from grantees or other sources and then to work with grantees to bring them into compliance, not to abruptly terminate grants or otherwise penalize grantees. COPS Office grant advisers attempted to work with grantees to develop mutually acceptable plans for corrective actions.", "Although the COPS Office did not do proactive investigations of potential supplanting, its three-person legal staff reviewed cases referred to it by grant advisers, grantees, and other sources. COPS Office officials said that they also expected that referrals to Justice\u2019s Legal Division will result from planned monitoring activities. Of the 506 inquiries that required follow-up by the Legal Division as of December 1996, about 70 percent involved potential supplanting.", "In addition, Justice\u2019s Inspector General began a review in fiscal year 1997 that was to assess, among other things, how COPS grant funds were used, including whether supplanting occurred. In the course of this review, the Inspector General planned to complete 50 audits of grantees by the end of fiscal year 1997. The Office of Justice Programs also conducted financial monitoring of COPS grants, which officials said is to include review of financial documents and visits to 160 sites by the end of fiscal year 1997.", "In April 1997, COPS Office officials said that they were discussing ways to encourage grantees to sustain hiring levels achieved under the grants, in light of the language of the Community Policing Act regarding the continuation of these increased hiring levels after the conclusion of federal support. The COPS Office officials also noted in commenting on our draft report that they had sent fact sheets to all grantees explaining the legal requirements for maintaining hiring levels.

The projects illustrated three key principles of community policing identified by the COPS Office: prevention, problemsolving, and partnerships. Representatives of community groups and other local government agencies working with the police on community policing activities were generally supportive of the community policing concept.", "Table II.3 provides examples of community policing projects in these locations. The projects ranged from starting 18 community advisory boards in neighborhoods throughout a major city to curbing drug activity by working with the resident manager and residents of an apartment complex.", "The police department established 18 Community Police Advisory Boards. Each board consisted of 25 volunteers whose roles were to advise and inform area commanding officers of community concerns (e.g., enforcement of curfew laws and education on domestic violence). Each board used community and police support to address the problems that had been identified. Interviewees said the boards had been effective in helping the police to build trust, involve citizens, solve problems, and reduce citizens\u2019 fear of crime.", "The transit authority was part of a task force that addressed problems associated with loitering and drinking by day laborers on railroad property. Using community policing techniques such as problem identification and specific actions, such as clearing shrubs, painting over graffiti, and securing railroad ties that were being used to build tents for shelter, the task force resolved the problems.", "Oxnard, CA, Police Department \u201cStreet Beat\u201d was an award-winning cable television series sponsored by local businesses and the cable company. Interviewees said the weekly series had been one of the department\u2019s most effective community policing tools. Over 500 programs had been aired since 1985. Street beat offered crime prevention tips and encouraged citizens to participate in all of the department\u2019s community policing activities. Over 300 departments contacted the Oxnard Police Department for information on replicating the television series in their cities. (continued)", "Citizens, the resident manager, and a community policing officer worked to remove drug dealers from an apartment complex. The community policing officer used several successful tactics, including citing suspected drug dealers, most of whom were not residents, for trespassing and taking photographs of them. Citizens formed a coalition that met with the community policing officer in her on-site office, thereby increasing the willingness of residents to come forward with information on illegal activities. Some disorderly tenants were evicted. The resident manager estimated that drug dealing at the complex was reduced by 90 percent.", "Community policing helped to improve relations between police officers and the residents of a shelter run by the Center Against Spouse Abuse. Interviewees said that the shelter had a policy, until about 1992, that police could not enter the property. Residents were distrustful of the police. Some had negative experiences when officers went to their homes to investigate complaints of abuse. For example, residents reported that officers failed to make arrests when injunctions were violated. Since the inception of community policing, interviewees said that officers were more sensitive to victims when they investigated spouse abuse cases. Officers visited the shelter to discuss victims\u2019 rights, and residents were favorably impressed by their openness. The community policing officer in the neighborhood was praised by the shelter director for his responsiveness. On two occasions, he responded quickly to service calls, arresting a trespasser and assisting a suicidal resident.", "A police official noted that the department was in the early development phase of community policing, attempting to demonstrate a few successful projects that could be used in locations throughout the over 26,000-square-mile reservation. One interviewee said that gang activity was partially a result of teens having nothing to do on the reservation. A community policing project had officers working with youth groups to develop positive activities and encourage participation by organizing a blood drive, sponsoring youth athletic teams, and recruiting young people to help elderly citizens. Another community policing project was the development of a computer database on gang activities and membership."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Community Groups and Local Government Representatives Generally Supported Community Policing in Their Neighborhoods", "paragraphs": ["We asked interviewees representing community groups and local government agencies participating in community policing activities to characterize the level of support their organization had for community policing in their neighborhoods.

Seven other interviewees offered no specific response to this question, except to say that they felt it was too early in their implementation of community policing to make assessments.", "We also asked interviewees representing law enforcement agencies, community groups, and local government agencies what they felt were the major successes and limitations of community policing. Responses on community policing successes emphasized improved relationships between the police and residents and improvements in the quality of life for residents of some neighborhoods. Responses on limitations emphasized that there was not enough funding and that performance by some individual community policing officers was disappointing.", "Summaries of several responses on the major successes of community policing were the following: \u201cI have seen a big turnaround in some apartment complexes. The entire atmosphere of these places has changed. People are outside. Children are playing. This is due to efforts of community policing officers to get drug buyers and sellers off of the properties.\u201d (A community group representative.) \u201cThere have been big-time changes here as a result of community policing.", "The police have developed a much higher level of trust from public housing residents than existed before. Residents will work with the police now and provide them with information. In this public housing complex, the sense of safety and security has increased. Before the community policing officers were on patrol, residents did not want to walk past the basketball courts into the community center. That is not a problem any longer. The police worked with the Department of Parks and Recreation to improve lighting and redesign a center entrance. We are now offering a well-attended course on computers at the center. People are enjoying the parks. They are even on the tennis courts. Our community policing officer has been successful in working with problem families and the housing authority staff. We provide referrals, counseling, and other resources. We have either helped families address their problems or had them evicted from our units. There are many individual success stories of young people developing better self-esteem and hygiene as a result of interacting with the community policing officer.\u201d (A housing authority director.) \u201cCommunity policing has changed how we practice law enforcement in a substantial way. We applied community policing strategies to a distressed neighborhood plagued by crime. The area had prostitution and drug dealing, and service calls to the police were high. We worked with residents and landlords to improve the situation. Closer relationships developed, and we began working on crime prevention with community groups, schools, and parents. Property managers provided better lighting for their property, cut their weeds, and screened tenants more carefully.\u201d (A community policing officer.)", "Summaries of several responses on major limitations to community policing were: \u201cCommunity policing is working here, but we still have a long way to go.", "The challenge for the department is to convince the force that community policing is not a fad and is not a select group of officers doing touchy/feely work, but that it is a philosophy for the whole department. I think we need to reengineer the entire police department structure to fully integrate community policing into the community. I don\u2019t believe we have decentralized the department enough. For example, I think detectives should be out in the community with community policing officers, instead of at police headquarters. They should know the people in the areas to which they are assigned.\u201d (A director of public safety.) \u201cWe don\u2019t have \u201cOfficer Friendly\u201d yet, even though overall attitudes have improved. The concept is good. The limitations are in the individuals doing the work. Some are good. Some are not.\u201d (A community group member.) \u201cSome residents have an unrealistic expectation of what community policing can do and what it cannot do.
