GAO was asked to examine 401(k) plans' use of these policies. Among other objectives, this report examines 1) what is known about the prevalence of these policies and why plans use them, and 2) the potential effects of these policies on workers' retirement savings.", "GAO conducted a nongeneralizable survey of 80 plan sponsors and plan professionals regarding plans' use of eligibility and vesting policies and the reasons for using them; reviewed industry data on plans' use of eligibility and vesting policies; and projected potential effects on retirement savings based on hypothetical scenarios. GAO also interviewed federal officials and 21 retirement professionals and academic researchers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's nongeneralizable survey of 80 401(k) plans ranging in size from fewer than 100 participants to more than 5,000 and its review of industry data found that many plans have policies that affect workers' ability to (1) save in plans (eligibility policies), (2) receive employer contributions, and (3) keep those employer contributions if they leave their job (vesting policies). Thirty-three of 80 plans surveyed had policies that did not allow workers younger than age 21 to participate in the plan. In addition, 19 plans required participants to be employed on the last day of the year to receive any employer contribution for that year. Fifty-seven plans had vesting policies requiring employees to work for a certain period of time before employer contributions to their accounts are vested. Plan sponsors and plan professionals GAO surveyed identified lowering costs and reducing employee turnover as the primary reasons that plans use these policies.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) allows plan sponsors to set eligibility and vesting policies. Specifically, federal law permits 401(k) plan sponsors to require that workers be at least age 21 to be eligible to join the plan. The law also permits plans to use rules affecting 401(k) plan participants' receipt of employer contributions and the vesting of contributions already received. However, over time workers have come to rely less on traditional pensions and more on their 401(k) plan savings for retirement security. Further, while the rules were designed, in part, to help sponsors provide profit sharing contributions, today 401(k) plan sponsors are more likely to provide matching contributions and today's workers may be likely to change jobs frequently. GAO's projections for hypothetical scenarios suggest that these policies could potentially reduce workers' retirement savings. For example, assuming a minimum age policy of 21, GAO projections estimate that a medium-level earner who does not save in a plan or receive a 3 percent employer matching contribution from age 18 to 20 could have $134,456 less savings by their retirement at age 67 ($36,422 in 2016 dollars). Saving early for retirement is consistent with Department of Labor guidance as well as previous legislation and allows workers to benefit from compound interest, which can grow their savings over decades. In addition, the law permits plans to require that participants be employed on the last day of the year to receive employer contributions each year, which could reduce savings for today's mobile workforce. For example, GAO's projections suggest that if a medium-level earner did not meet a last day policy when leaving a job at age 30, the employer's 3 percent matching contribution not received for that year could have been worth $29,297 by the worker's retirement at age 67 ($8,150 in 2016 dollars). GAO's projections also suggest that vesting policies may also potentially reduce retirement savings. For example, if a worker leaves two jobs after 2 years, at ages 20 and 40, where the plan requires 3 years for full vesting, the employer contributions forfeited could be worth $81,743 at retirement ($22,143 in 2016 dollars).The Department of Treasury (Treasury) is responsible for evaluating and developing proposals for legislative changes for 401(k) plan policies, but has not recently done so for vesting policies. Vesting caps for employer matching contributions in 401(k) plans are 15 years old. A re-evaluation of these caps would help to assess whether they unduly reduce the retirement savings of today's mobile workers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO suggests Congress consider a number of changes to ERISA, including changes to the minimum age for plan eligibility and plans' use of a last-day policy. GAO is also making two recommendations, including that Treasury reevaluate existing vesting policies to assess if current policies are appropriate for today's mobile workforce. Treasury had no comment on the recommendation. GAO believes that such an evaluation would be beneficial, given the potential for vesting policies to reduce retirement savings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Employers frequently sponsor and contribute to defined contribution  plans, such as 401(k) plans, in which workers can save for retirement.

Plan sponsors\u2014employers who offer 401(k) plans\u2014have the authority  and flexibility to customize certain aspects of plans, but such  customization can also affect workers\u2019 retirement savings.

We assessed the reliability of these data  by interviewing the staff who maintain the data, reviewing related  documentation, and testing the data for missing or erroneous values. We  determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To examine why plans use eligibility and vesting policies, we  included questions in our survey about what factors were important to  plans in choosing specific policies. We based these questions on  information we obtained from interviews and a discussion group with plan  professionals. The survey also provided respondents with the opportunity  to cite their own reasons for using eligibility and vesting policies. We also  interviewed officials from the Department of Labor (DOL), Treasury, the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Securities and Exchange  Commission, as well as a total of 21 retirement professionals and  academic researchers to obtain their perspectives on why plans use  eligibility and vesting policies.

Four  companies agreed to help us facilitate this participant questionnaire. We  analyzed the accuracy of responses from 46 401(k) plan participants by  comparing their responses about plan policies against the summary plan  descriptions for their actual plans. This allowed us to determine the  accuracy of their knowledge rather than rely on their self-reported  knowledge.

Our survey asked respondents to identify the importance of  various reasons for having eligibility and vesting policies (see table 5).", "According to retirement professionals, plans use policies that restrict plan  eligibility to reduce administrative costs\u2014which include maintaining  accounts for separated, short-tenured workers\u2014although these costs are  often borne by participants and not by plans. A retirement professional we  interviewed explained that after a worker separates from an employer, the  plan sponsor must still keep track of the former worker\u2019s account if the  worker remains a participant in the plan, and provide the worker with plan  communications and account statements, all of which are additional  administrative costs. Several retirement professionals we interviewed  noted that plan sponsors pay the administrative costs of maintaining  small, dormant accounts after short-tenure workers leave their  employer. Because young workers have shorter average tenure than  older workers, according to federal workforce data, some plans may use  a minimum-age policy to exclude the youngest workers and reduce the  administrative costs of dealing with short-tenured employees joining the  plan and then leaving. However, it is unclear the extent to which  additional plan participants increase plans\u2019 administrative costs. Our prior  work found that participants generally paid part or all of administrative  fees, and that regardless of who incurs added administrative costs for  accounts left behind by workers, plans are not obliged to maintain those  accounts. Plans can require account holders to transfer their savings out  of the plan if their balances fall below a threshold set by federal law.", "Reducing the direct costs of employer contributions was also cited by  plans that we surveyed as an important reason for using eligibility  policies, although savings for some plans may be minimal. Minimum- age policies reduce costs because employers do not need to make  contributions to otherwise eligible workers. If plans do not use minimum- age policies they can incur some added direct costs in the form of  employer contributions to additional workers. However, our projections  suggest that the direct costs associated with including workers under age  21 in existing plans may be small because younger workers earn less, on  average, than older workers, so the same percentage match from the  employer costs less for younger workers. According to a retirement  professional, plans may use a minimum-service policy for employer  contributions to reduce costs for sponsors because the sponsor avoids  making contributions to a participant account if that worker leaves their  job before satisfying the policy.", "Eligibility policies and policies that delay employers\u2019 contributions until the  end of the year are also used by some plans for administrative  convenience, according to government officials we interviewed and plans  we surveyed, though delayed enrollment is possible without delayed  eligibility and today\u2019s employer contribution formulas make delayed  employer contributions often unnecessary. First, government officials said  that some plans may use eligibility policies to delay workers\u2019 enrollment  because it takes administrators time to determine eligibility and to process  workers\u2019 enrollment in the plan. However, plans may delay a worker\u2019s  enrollment up to 6 months after eligibility, which can help plans to mitigate  administrative concerns. According to PSCA\u2019s survey, about 25 percent  of 401(k) type plans delay the enrollment of newly eligible workers and  the rest enroll workers \u201canytime\u201d after they are eligible. Moreover, a  retirement professional told us that, for medium and large-size plans, the  payroll systems used to administer plan benefits can support the  provision of employer contributions during the year as opposed to just at  the end of the year. Second, some plans that we surveyed indicated they  also delay employer contributions until the end of the year for  administrative convenience. For example, one respondent reported that it  is less work for the plan to make employer contributions once, at year\u2019s  end. However, a government official told us that the reason most plans  make employer contributions each pay period is that doing otherwise  would have adverse effects on the plan sponsor by requiring a large  outflow of cash at the end of the plan year. By making employer  contributions more frequently, a company can spread that cost over the  year. A retirement professional told us a likely reason that some plans  make delayed employer contributions is employer inertia in keeping a  policy that is a remnant of the past, when employer contributions were  based on the employers\u2019 year-end profits. However, today, most plans  are 401(k) plans and often provide matching employer contributions  based on participants\u2019 own contributions, which are typically made each  pay period.", "Vesting policies can also reduce costs for plan sponsors by resulting in  forfeited employer contributions when participants separate without fully  satisfying the vesting policy. Those forfeitures can offset employer  expenses and contributions. According to retirement professionals we  interviewed and plans we surveyed, vesting policies reduce the direct  cost of employer contributions for shorter-tenure employees who do not  stay employed long enough to satisfy the vesting policy and keep  employers\u2019 contributions. However, tax benefits to employers from  making employer contributions can partially offset direct costs to  employers of making contributions to participant accounts, because they  reduce an employer\u2019s taxable corporate income in proportion to the  amount spent on contributions.", "Finally, both eligibility and vesting policies were also used to reduce  employee turnover by plans we surveyed. Retirement professionals and  an academic researcher we interviewed explained that some plans see  delayed eligibility in the 401(k) plan as an incentive that may convince  new employees to stay longer in their job. Sponsors also use vesting  policies to reduce turnover, according to government officials, retirement  professionals, and an academic researcher we interviewed. For example,  a retirement professional said that companies with a generous matching  contribution and high employee turnover prefer to use a vesting schedule  because it incentivizes employees to stay with the employer. However,  the extent to which vesting policies are effective in changing behavior and  reducing turnover depends in some measure on whether participants  actually understand vesting policies. For example, if a participant  incorrectly believes he or she is fully vested but is actually only partially  vested, the vesting policy will not effectively incentivize the worker to  extend tenure to fully vest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Hypothetical Projections Suggest Current Plan Eligibility, Employer Contribution, and Vesting Policies Can Result in Lower Retirement Savings", "paragraphs": ["Plan sponsors use eligibility and vesting policies for a number of reasons.

As discussed earlier, we found that plan  sponsors may use these policies to reduce the costs and challenges  incurred when short-term workers enroll in the plan and leave behind  small accounts. While the law gives plan sponsors flexibility in  establishing plan eligibility policies that meet their needs, federal caps on  minimum age and minimum service policies serve to balance plan  sponsors\u2019 needs with workers\u2019 interests in accessing and saving for  retirement in workplace plans. In addition, because of the potential for  compound interest to grow savings over time, it is a widely accepted best  practice for workers to start saving for retirement as early as possible,  even if the amounts they save seem small.

Because minimum-age policies can prevent young workers from  saving for retirement in their workplace 401(k) plan early in their careers,  they miss the opportunity to accrue compound interest and grow their  initial contributions over the remaining decades of their working life. For  example, an 18-year-old worker earning $15,822 per year who is  ineligible to enroll in an employer\u2019s plan until age 21 may forego savings  at retirement of $85,857 ($23,258 in 2016 dollars) if they had been able  to save and invest 5.3 percent (the average contribution level for non- highly compensated employees reported by plans in PSCA\u2019s 57th Annual  Survey) of their salary over those 3 years.", "Because of the effects of compound interest, saving for retirement at a  young age is a one-time opportunity to optimize retirement savings  despite making what is typically a low salary relative to lifetime earnings.  An older worker has to save more to make the same gains over time,  because the returns on savings made later have fewer years over which  to compound. (See fig. 5.) (Also see Appendix II for detailed information  about the assumptions used in these hypothetical projections.)", "Minimum-age eligibility policies may have disproportionate effects  for some groups. Based on our analysis of data and estimates, we  found that certain groups can be disproportionately affected by a  minimum-age eligibility policy for 401(k) plans. For example, many young  people graduating from high school will not enroll in college but will enter  the workforce, only to be potentially excluded from an employer\u2019s 401(k)  plan by a minimum age policy. Data from BLS\u2019s Current Population  Survey (CPS) show that of 3 million workers who graduated from high  school in 2015, about 30 percent were not enrolled in college by October  of that year. Recent high school graduates not enrolled in college are  about twice as likely to be employed or looking for work as those who are  enrolled. Young workers who do not attend college can expect less  wage growth over their career, making early savings all the more  important. Policies that prevent potential savings by young workers may  also disproportionately affect women, who often earn lower wages and  may benefit most from maximizing early savings. We have previously  reported that women have less retirement income on average than men,  partly because women are more likely than men to spend time outside the  workforce when they are older. This is a time when income may be higher  than earlier in their career and when they might otherwise be able to take  advantage of \u201ccatch-up\u201d savings opportunities in their workplace plan. A  minimum-age policy may prevent some women from saving for retirement  when they are fully participating in the workforce, before they may reduce  work hours or leave the workforce to provide caregiving support to family  members. A minimum-age policy also has implications for low-wage  workers. Our projections suggest that the foregone savings of low-wage  workers from age 18 to 20 can be an even larger percentage of their  retirement savings than for higher earners because low-wage earners  may realize less growth in their salary over time, so later contributions do  less to make up for savings missed at a younger age. For example,  based on our analysis, compared to the loss of 5 percent of retirement  savings for a medium-level earner not saving from age 18 to 20, a lower- level earner with reduced wage growth over his or her career could lose  11.5 percent of retirement savings from not saving from age 18 to 20\u2014 more than twice the percentage lost by the medium-level earner with  average wage growth.", "Minimum-age eligibility policies may mean foregone contributions  from an employer. The amount of foregone retirement savings due to  minimum-age policies can be higher when matching employer  contributions are considered. For example, based on analysis of our  hypothetical scenario, the savings of an otherwise eligible 18-year-old  earning $15,822 per year could have been $134,456 at retirement, or  $36,422 in 2016 dollars, if that individual had also received an employer  match of their contribution up to 3 percent of salary from age 18 to 20.  An employer\u2019s match of employee contributions is typically, in effect, a 50  to 100 percent return on the employee\u2019s contributions; participants who  receive an employer match can double the value of their contribution\u2014a  100 percent return\u2014if the employer makes a dollar for dollar match.", "ERISA provides plan sponsors some flexibility to design plan policies that  can restrict workers\u2019 eligibility to enroll and save in plans. ERISA  specifically permits sponsors to limit enrollment in 401(k) plans to workers  age 21 and older. Over 8 million workers under the age of 21 are  potentially subject to this policy. In passing ERISA, Congress supported  the policy goal of increasing access to plans by allowing workers to save  for retirement as early as possible. Increasing access to plans was also  a policy goal supported by Congress more recently in passing the  Pension Protection Act of 2006. The current minimum-age policy does  not further that goal. Extending eligibility to workers at an age earlier than  21 would also give young workers an opportunity to build their private  sector savings at the same time they are earning credits toward future  Social Security retirement benefits. In addition, increasing workers\u2019  access to workplace retirement plans is a current federal policy goal,  reiterated by DOL guidance and recently in DOL\u2019s fiscal year 2017  Budget Justification.", "Employers may bear costs from enrolling additional workers in plans and  administering their accounts after they leave their employ, but our prior  work has shown that participants often bear the costs of administering  their accounts and plans can use forced-transfers to eliminate small  accounts left behind by separated employees. IRS officials told us that  the minimum-age policy is unnecessary because the minimum-service  eligibility policy permits plans to exclude short-term employees. By  extending eligibility to workers at an age earlier than 21, private  retirement plan coverage could expand for young workers who research  shows lack access to 401(k) plans. We recently reported that when  given the opportunity, young, low-income workers participate in workplace  plans at high rates.", "Allowing young people to contribute at the beginning of their careers  would also help to mitigate the risk that potential unexpected events   could reduce the length of their careers and the period to save for  retirement and, thus, their retirement savings. For example, research  shows that many workers retire sooner than they expect, due to physical  limitations or the need to care for family members. Such individuals will  not save for retirement for as long as they had planned or during years in  which their contributions may have been highest. Extending eligibility to  workers at an age earlier than 21 could help a significant number of  workers to save at an earlier age and those who experience unforeseen  absences from the workforce or premature retirement will be better  positioned to maximize their retirement savings during their working  years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "1-Year Minimum-Service Eligibility Policies Delay and May Prevent Plan Participation and Our Estimates Suggest they May Result in Lower Savings", "paragraphs": ["Minimum-service eligibility policies of up to 1 year delay access to  workplace 401(k) plans and can reduce potential retirement savings for  workers of any age, according to our projections of retirement savings.

That amounts to 3 percent of the worker\u2019s total  projected retirement savings from their own savings alone. Including the  employer match of 3 percent not received during the 1-year period of  ineligibility, the worker could have $81,055 less at retirement ($21,957 in  2016 dollars).

For example, long-term part-time workers can be  excluded from their employers\u2019 plans regardless of tenure if they work  fewer than 1,000 hours during the year, or about 19 hours per week.  According to March 2016 data from the CPS, 14.3 million workers said  that they usually worked 20 or fewer hours per week over the previous  month. Those data also show that more women than men worked 20 or  fewer hours per week (making women more likely than men to be  ineligible for their workplace plan as a result of the 1,000 hour rule).  Even employees working more than 19 hours per week could be subject  to ineligibility due to the 1,000-hour rule, if they work multiple part-time  jobs. Moreover, under the current definition of a year of service, workers  who remain employed on a part-time basis year after year may not be  eligible to participate in their workplace savings plans.", "In first establishing the rules for a minimum-service policy for plan  eligibility, ERISA capped such policies at 1 year of service, defined as  1,000 or more hours worked over 1 year.

However, millions of part-time workers may never  qualify for their employer\u2019s plan with a 1,000-hour requirement. Some  members of Congress and the current administration have proposed  amending the law to ensure that long-term part-time workers can become  eligible to save in their employer\u2019s workplace plan. As part of its fiscal  year 2017 budget submission, the current administration proposed  amending federal law to require plans to expand eligibility to workers who  have worked for their employer at least 500 hours per year for 3  consecutive years, allowing workers to contribute their own earnings, but  not necessarily to receive employer contributions to their account.

Some retirement professionals we interviewed said that  operating without a 1,000 hour rule could result in more small accounts  left behind by short-term workers, but as we previously noted, forced  transfers of small balances can help plans manage any associated  burden or cost, and often those costs are borne by participants  themselves."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Our Projections Suggest that Current Employer Contribution Policies Can Also Reduce Workers\u2019 Retirement Savings in 401(k) Plans", "paragraphs": ["Current law permits 401(k) plan sponsors to require participants to be  employed on the last day of the plan year to be eligible to receive  employer contributions to their account.

Given a relatively mobile  workforce, the requirement to be employed on the last day of the plan  year to receive an employer\u2019s contributions for that year puts workers who  separate from their job at risk of losing some of their potential retirement  savings. For example, our projections suggest that for a 30-year-old  earning $71,841 ($52,152 in 2016 dollars), the employer contribution not  received due to an unmet \u201clast day\u201d policy is $2,155 in that year ($1,443  in 2016 dollars).

For example,  a 67-year-old employee who has worked for the same employer during  his or her entire career and retires when eligible for full Social Security  benefits could lose the employer\u2019s $6,606 match for that last year ($1,837  in 2016 dollars) if it is before the end of the year. Moreover, the last day  policy can affect workers repeatedly throughout their careers. If our  hypothetical worker leaves three jobs without satisfying a last day  requirement, at ages 20, 30, and 40, the worker could lose a total of  $6,542, which could be worth $69,583 at retirement ($18,849 in 2016  dollars).", "ERISA caps at 2 years the length of service that a plan sponsor can  require before a participant is eligible to receive employer contributions.

However, because a last day policy requires  an additional year of service to receive any employer contributions, year  after year, a worker who has already satisfied a 2-year minimum-service  policy would have to wait up to another year to receive an employer  contribution.

According  to a retirement professional, errors in interpretation can occur, making the  clarity of plan documents more important.", "Example of Complex Language in a 401(k) Summary Plan Description   You will become a Participant eligible to make Elective Deferral Contributions and  receive Safe Harbor Non-Elective Contributions and Profit Sharing Contributions on the  a) first day of the first month of the Plan Year or b) first day of the seventh month of the  Plan Year, coincident with or next following the date you attain age 21 and you complete  one (1) Year of Eligibility Service, provided that you are an Eligible Employee on that  date.", "You have worked for your Employer four (4) years and have received Employer  Contributions of $1,000. You terminate employment and request a distribution of your  Employer\u2019s Contributions. Because you have four (4) years of vesting service, you will  receive 60% or $600.", "While this example illustrates what happens as contributions become  vested, it still cites what will be received rather than what could be lost.  Instead of informing a participant of what they will receive if they are not  fully vested when they leave their job, an employee may better  understand the financial consequences of the vesting policy if the  employer clearly informs them that they will lose a percentage of their  account balance if they leave before becoming fully vested. However,  according to a retirement professional we interviewed, employers seeking  to attract employees have an incentive to make the plan sound generous.", "Plans can also include information in their SPDs about provisions that are  not used by the plan, a practice which is not explicitly prohibited by  ERISA, making it difficult for participants to know which contribution is  currently being offered and which eligibility and vesting policies apply.  One plan sponsor explained that this is a common practice because plans  want to avoid the time and expense of revising the plan documents later if  they decide, for example, to change the type of employer contribution.  One SPD we reviewed contained information about six employer  contributions when only one contribution was offered (see fig. 10). This  practice leaves participants with extraneous information and no clear way  to tell what policies apply to them without additional information from their  employer. Treasury officials said that it may be necessary for employers  to describe contributions that they are not currently offering to employees,  should they need to make these contributions at a later date in order to  pass the Internal Revenue Code nondiscrimination tests. However, those  officials agreed that the description of multiple employer contributions in  SPDs can be confusing to participants as they may not be able to  determine which contribution currently applies to them.", "Employers can do more than the minimum required communication and  look for innovative and effective ways to improve participant  understanding of plan policies. Our survey of 80 plan sponsors found that  the highest number reported using new employee orientation and a  welcome packet (63 and 62, respectively) to communicate eligibility and  vesting policies to employees. One participant advocate we interviewed  suggested that discussing policies one-on-one is the best way to  communicate rules to employees, but said that approach is costly.  Another suggestion was to tailor plan information to participants. For  example, that participant advocate suggested that a plan notice  communicating eligibility policies could read: \u201cas of (specific date), you  are eligible to participate in the plan (or to get an employer match).\u201d The  advocate also suggested that communications could increase in  frequency ahead of the eligibility event, like a countdown, referring to  eligibility like a prize to build excitement. Specifically, messages such as,  \u201ccongratulations, you are now eligible\u2026\u201d can be effective in triggering  behavior, like enrollment in the plan. Several experts we interviewed  generally agreed that employers should simplify communications about  plan eligibility and vesting policies to increase employee understanding,  which could mean presenting information in a more concise, manageable  format. Figure 11 shows an example of a short summary of plan  highlights, which was provided by one plan service provider we  interviewed. The first page of the 2.5 page document summarizes the  plan\u2019s basic rules for eligibility and vesting, does so using short  sentences, and does not require the reader to refer to other sections of  the document to fully understand the rules.", "ERISA requires that summary plan descriptions (SPD) be written in a  manner that can be understood by the average plan participant and be  sufficiently comprehensive to inform participants of their rights and  obligations under the plan. In addition, SPDs must explain a plan\u2019s  provisions with respect to eligibility and vesting, but plans have discretion  in how they present these provisions. Under ERISA, DOL is responsible  for enforcing requirements pertaining to the disclosure of companies\u2019  retirement plan policies, including that plan policies should be  communicated clearly. To do this, DOL issues regulations, can make  judgments about the clarity of plan documents, and can issue guidance to  plans on how to best comply with the intent of the laws and regulations.  While its regulations restate the requirements in ERISA and list specific  policies that should be included in the plan description, the agency is not  more specific about what constitutes clear communication of policies and  what does not. Because ERISA and DOL\u2019s regulations pertaining to  SPDs are not prescriptive about how plan sponsors can explain their  plans\u2019 eligibility and vesting policies clearly, plan sponsors may provide  information in a way that meets the necessary requirements rather than in  a manner most likely to be clear and helpful to participants. DOL also has  a policy that it will not make determinations about the clarity of plan  documents. Agency officials told us that they have this policy because  determining whether specific wording is clear is highly subjective.  Currently, DOL has not issued guidance that identifies best practices for  communicating information on eligibility and vesting, which could assist  plan sponsors with improving the clarity of those policies in SPDs. By  providing guidance with best practices to help plan sponsors clearly and  accurately communicate eligibility and vesting requirements, DOL can  help ensure that workers better understand the information necessary to  make informed choices regarding their employment and savings  behavior. In addition, such guidance could include encouraging plans to  provide information only on contributions actually made by employers\u2014a  best practice which could help participants better understand the plan  policies that affect them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["401(k) plans were created four years after ERISA was passed in 1974.  Since that time, 401(k) plans have become the dominant employer- sponsored plan relied on by employees for retirement savings.  Understanding the eligibility and vesting policies used by these plans has  become increasingly important for workers, employers, and regulators.  However, some of these policies were created to address issues when  plans were more of a supplemental source of retirement income, in  addition to a traditional pension, and reliant only on non-matching  contributions from an employer rather than on a match of employee  contributions. As 401(k) plans become the primary, and often sole,  retirement savings vehicles for a large segment of the mobile workforce,  there is a growing need to consider the effects of eligibility and vesting  policies on workers, particularly those who are younger, less-educated,  and with lower incomes. Moreover, one of the reported advantages of  account-based plans like 401(k) plans is their enhanced portability over  traditional pensions. Yet current rules and plan sponsor practices suggest  some limitations on that portability, which can have potentially significant  effects on retirement security.", "Workers who must meet minimum-age eligibility policies to begin  participating in a workplace plan miss out not only on contributing to  401(k) accounts, but also on the opportunity to receive employer  matching contributions, which can significantly increase the amount  contributed to their accounts. Saving early is particularly important for  those who join the workforce out of high school and may never pursue  higher education, with its associated higher wages. Our projections show  that the inability to save in a 401(k) plan from ages 18 to 21 can result in  tens of thousands of foregone retirement savings. While turnover among  young workers can create administrative costs for an employer, these  costs often are borne by participants in the form of fees. Extending plan  eligibility to allow otherwise eligible workers to at least save their own  contributions in their employers\u2019 401(k) plans at an age earlier than 21  could help young workers improve their retirement security by saving  through their workplace plan at a time when those savings have the most  to gain.", "Minimum-service eligibility policies can also affect employees\u2019 ability to  save for retirement. Re-examining the legal definition of \u201cyear of service\u201d  used in minimum-service eligibility policies can help to ensure that the  rules are consistent with today\u2019s mobile workforce and use of 401(k)  plans. Opening 401(k) plans to more workers could result in additional  small accounts, which are sometimes abandoned by their owner. But that  challenge can be mitigated in ways that do not reduce savings. At the  same time, opening 401(k) plans to more workers could help many who  now lack coverage to access a workplace retirement plan and make tax- deferred contributions toward their retirement security.", "Last day policies can also affect employees\u2019 retirement savings. Given  the mobility of today\u2019s workforce, all workers are potentially affected by  these policies. Further, policies that allow employers to delay making  matching contributions to participants until the end of the year can also  result in foregone savings. This type of policy can affect not only  employees who separate from a job after a year or two, but also those  who spend their entire career with the same employer. The policy is a  remnant of the profit sharing plan era, when employers typically  calculated benefits at the end of the year. Few employers rely on profit  sharing contributions alone these days, so delayed employer  contributions may be unnecessary. Considering whether these provisions  should be adjusted could help ensure they reflect today\u2019s mobile  workforce and use of matching contributions in 401(k) plans.", "Vesting policies also present missed opportunities to improve savings for  workers who are mobile. Given that the median length of stay with a  private sector employer is currently about 4 years, the rule permitting a 6- year vesting policy may be outdated. Employees who forfeit employer  contributions to their account when they leave a job prior to the end of the  plan\u2019s vesting period lose the opportunity to have those funds grow in the  plan or to transfer those contributions into their new employer\u2019s plan,  reducing their retirement savings. A re-examination by Treasury of the  appropriateness of current maximum vesting policies could help  determine whether they unduly reduce the retirement savings of workers  who change jobs.", "Finally, having clear and concise information about their retirement plan\u2019s  eligibility and vesting policies helps employees make informed decisions  affecting their retirement savings.

The Department of  Labor could provide assistance with such an evaluation.", "To help participants better understand eligibility and vesting policies, DOL  should develop guidance for plan sponsors that identifies best practices  for communicating information about eligibility and vesting policies in a  clear manner in summary plan descriptions.

As we detail  in our report on pages 44-46, given the effect that vesting policies can  have on the retirement savings of mobile workers, we believe that it would  be beneficial for Treasury to evaluate current vesting policies. Treasury  may be able to incorporate an evaluation of these policies into the  analysis it conducts in preparing the annual \u201cGreenbook,\u201d highlighted in  our report on page 12, and which accompanies the President\u2019s annual  budget submission and outlines the President\u2019s tax-related legislative  proposals.

DOL also stated that under current law and  regulations, this information must be written in a manner that can be  understood by the average participant. DOL described planned actions  that GAO believes are consistent with the intent of our recommendation.  For example, DOL noted that an evaluation of best practices regarding  eligibility and vesting should consider other disclosures provided to plan  participants. DOL highlighted a long-term project on its current regulatory  agenda relating to individual benefit statements, another type of  disclosure provided to participants. DOL said that additional input from a  broader range of plan sponsors and plan fiduciaries, possibly obtained  through a Request for Information published in the Federal Register,  could supplement the information we highlight in our report on pages 52- 58 and contribute to an informed development of best practices guidance.", "DOL stated that it did not agree that implementing the recommendation  allows the best use of its limited resources. DOL stated it would not be  appropriate at this time to reallocate resources away from its existing  priority projects to a new best practices project focused on our  recommendation, especially given the regulatory requirements that  currently apply to summary plan discrimination disclosures on eligibility  and vesting. However, DOL stated it would review its existing outreach  materials on plan administration and compliance for opportunities to  highlight the issues we raised in our report, as well as consider our  recommendation in the ongoing development and prioritization of its  agenda for regulations and sub-regulatory guidance.

To identify what is known about the  prevalence of eligibility and vesting policies, we conducted a non- generalizable survey of plan sponsors and plan professionals with plans  ranging in size from less than 100 participants to more than 5,000. We  received 80 responses to this survey. We also reviewed nongeneralizable  data from Plan Sponsor Council of America\u2019s (PSCA) annual survey of  defined contribution plans, which covered 613 plans with 8 million  participants and $832 billion in plan assets. PSCA\u2019s dataset represents  plans of varying sizes and industries, but includes a greater proportion of  large plans based on participant numbers and assets and  disproportionately represents the financial, insurance, and real estate  industries when compared to the total population of plans, as measured  by 2013 Form 5500 filings. In addition, we reviewed non-generalizable  data from Vanguard\u2019s 2015 report on the 1,900 qualified plans for which it  serves as record keeper. These two were the only datasets we identified  with detailed information on eligibility and vesting policies. We evaluated  another large dataset and determined that it was not reliable enough for  our purposes. We also analyzed generalizable Census Bureau survey  data to identify which eligibility policies affect workers, as reported by the  workers themselves.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed staff from Vanguard  and the Census Bureau who are responsible for producing the data. We  also reviewed documentation related to these data sources, such as  descriptions of their methodology. We also performed various tests on the  data.

Specifically, we reviewed basic  survey respondent demographic data (respondents by plan type, amount  of plan assets, and industry) and key data on eligibility and vesting (the  percentage of plans with service restrictions for plan eligibility, the  percentage of plans with age restrictions for plan eligibility, and the  percentage of plans that have vesting policies that require a service  period for the vesting of matching employer contributions). We also  evaluated the makeup of the plans included in PSCA\u2019s survey by  comparing selected demographic data from PSCA\u2019s survey to  Department of Labor Form 5500 plan demographic data. For the  Vanguard data, we asked a Vanguard official who is responsible for the  data questions about the scope of the data, how the data are collected  and maintained, and whether they have any limitations. We also  compared the eligibility and vesting data to the data from PSCA\u2019s survey  and our own survey of plan sponsors. For the Census Bureau data, we  performed electronic testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious errors.  Based on these steps, we determined that the PSCA, Vanguard, and  Census Bureau data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also  interviewed government officials from the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Labor,  as well as retirement professionals, to determine whether they were  aware of any data sources regarding the prevalence of eligibility and  vesting policies and to obtain their perspectives on the policies\u2019  prevalence.

To identify participants to test, we  first invited every plan sponsor who had provided contact information to  us when completing a separate plan sponsor survey to distribute a  separate questionnaire to their plan participants.

We compared the  employee responses regarding the eligibility and vesting requirements  that applied to them when they began working to information in the  respective summary plan description (SPD), and obtained clarification  from plan officials, as needed. Plans may issue new plan documents and  change policies over time, so to test individuals\u2019 knowledge of the  eligibility policies that affected them when they were hired, we used the  policies in place at that time rather than the eligibility policies in place  most recently, when they differed. For example, to determine the  employee\u2019s eligibility to join the plan, we identified the employee\u2019s start  date and determined if there were any factors that would have prevented  them from immediately enrolling in the plan. In cases where we did not  have the plan document for the year the participant was hired, we  reviewed the plan document published before and after their hire date  and reviewed summaries of material modifications. If the information  about the plan policies in the two plan documents from before and after  their date of hire were the same, we used it to determine the accuracy of  the participant\u2019s answer. However, when we could not determine the plan  policy for the relevant time period, we excluded the participant response  from our analysis of that question. For policy questions regarding current  plan policies (like frequency of employer contributions, and if the  participant is required to work on a particular day to receive employer  contributions) we used the current plan policy to determine the accuracy  of responses. We reviewed the plan details to identify information about  the vesting schedule. Three of the four companies we surveyed currently  offer automatic enrollment to eligible workers.

We categorized interviewees as retirement professionals if they provide  retirement plan-related services (such as those who serve as consultants  to plans), represent the interests of retirement plans or plan participants,  or otherwise perform work in the retirement area.

We assume that the worker starts  working at age 18 in 2016, and is continuously employed through  retirement at age 67 in 2065. We modeled lifetime earnings using  medium scaled earnings factors developed by the Social Security  Administration\u2019s Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) (see table 8).  These factors express hypothetical earnings at each age as a percent of  the Social Security Administration\u2019s national average wage index. The  scaled factors are based on average work and earnings of actual insured  workers over their careers. This approach has the advantage of reflecting  actual earnings histories, with steeper wage growth earlier in early- and  mid-career work years, and flatter wage growth in late-career work years.  Nominal wage increases an average of 5.6 percent per year. However,  this approach does not reflect the possibility that less-skilled workers and  lower earners may have flatter wage growth over their lifetime than  higher-skilled workers. For this reason, we ran an alternative scenario for  low earners featuring a constant nominal wage growth of 4.6 percent (see  table 9). This alternative scenario demonstrates that the loss of early  savings has a bigger effect on total savings at retirement for workers with  flatter earnings growth than for workers with steeper earnings growth. We  assume a retirement in 2065 at age of 67 because that is the Social  Security full retirement age for workers starting their careers in 2016.", "Inflation. To report adjusted salaries and other figures we indexed to  2016 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners  and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) projected under intermediate assumptions  from the 2015 Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)  Trustee\u2019s report.", "Employee deferrals. We assume that the individual in our hypothetical  projections makes contributions continuously through their continuous  employment from age 18 to 66, except where contributions are  suspended to illustrate the effect of an eligibility policy. PSCA survey data  from the 2013 plan year show that the average pre-tax salary deferral by  participants was 5.3 percent for non-highly compensated employees. We  referred to data from the 2013 plan year in PSCA\u2019s report summarizing  results of its annual survey of 401(k) and profit sharing plans. Plans  reported on policies for the 2013 plan year. The survey includes 613  defined contribution plans with 8 million participants representing a wide  range of industries and plan sizes. The plans surveyed are 252 401(k)  plans, 13 profit sharing plans, and 348 combination 401(k)/profit sharing  plans. As noted in Appendix I, the PSCA population for 2013 includes a  greater proportion of large plans based on participant numbers and  assets and disproportionately represents the financial, insurance, and real  estate industries when compared to the total population of plans, as  measured by 2013 Form 5500 filings. The finance/insurance/real estate  industry was the predominant industry reflected in the PSCA data (36  percent of plans were in this industry), while over half of the plans  included in the Form 5500 filings (53 percent) represented the services  industry.", "Employer matching contributions. We assume that the individual in our  hypothetical projections receives employer contributions through their  continuous employment from age 18 to 66, except where employer  contributions are delayed or forfeited to illustrate the effect of an eligibility  or vesting policy. We again referred to the PSCA survey data from the  2013 plan year. The average employer contribution among 401(k) plans  is 2.90 percent, which we rounded to 3 percent for our hypothetical  calculations. Similarly, the most commonly used match formula is 50  percent of employee deferrals up to 6 percent of salary (a max of 3  percent) used by 26.2 percent of plans. The next most common levels of  employer contribution are a 100 percent match up to 4 percent of  employee pay and a 100 percent employer match up to 5 percent, used  by 10.9 percent and 9.9 percent of plans, respectively. The hypothetical  projected amounts of retirement savings from employer contributions that  is foregone from delayed eligibility and forfeited contributions from unmet  vesting policies could be even larger if one assumed a higher, though not  uncommon, level of employer matching contributions. We also assume  that employer contributions are made on a per-pay-period basis, unless  calculated otherwise for comparison.", "Returns. To set an annual return for each of the years of the worker\u2019s  career for our hypothetical scenarios we formulated a composite return  based on Social Security Trustee projections. For the fixed income  portion of the return, we used the Social Security Trustees\u2019 projected  annual trust fund real interest rate of 2.90 percent, and the projected  consumer-price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI- W) of 2.70 percent, both published in the 2015 OASDI Trustee\u2019s Report  intermediate long range economic assumptions, for a nominal interest  rate of 5.6 percent. For the equity portion of the return, we added an  estimated long-term equity risk premium of 3.5 percentage points to the  annual trust fund nominal interest rate, for a nominal rate of return on  stocks of 9.1 percent. We changed the ratio slightly each year to reduce  equities exposure and investment risk as the worker approaches  retirement. The ratio corresponds to a \u201c100 minus age\u201d rule, which means  that the percentage of assets invested in equities is set at 100 minus the  worker\u2019s current age. For example, when the worker is 50 years old, we  assume that just half of their assets are invested in equities and assign  the nominal return on stocks to just 50 percent of their retirement savings,  while the remaining portion is calculated to earn the nominal interest rate  on bonds. The \u201c100 minus age\u201d rule for portfolio diversification is relatively  conservative, thus the projected value at retirement that we report is less  than it would be if we had assumed a rule using a higher equities  allocation. For example, another rule used for portfolio diversification is  \u201c120 minus age,\u201d which would mean a higher equities allocation and  higher projected returns, because over time equities tend to produce a  higher average annual return than corporate bonds. A lower return  assumption would result in lower projected savings lost or forfeited from  the policies discussed in this report.", "Leakage and fees. We assumed no leakage from the worker\u2019s account  over time and did not apply any plan fees to the account balance.
