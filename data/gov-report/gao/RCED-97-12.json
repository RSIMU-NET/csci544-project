It is the key feature and major storage unit of the Colorado River Storage Project. The Colorado River Storage Project was authorized in 1956 to develop and use the water resources in the Upper Colorado River Basin. The operations of the Glen Canyon Dam and its reservoir, Lake Powell, enable the Colorado River Storage Project to fulfill the downstream water release requirements while the runoff from the Upper Basin is stored and used for irrigation, recreation, and municipal and industrial purposes.", "The powerplant at the Glen Canyon Dam has been used primarily for generating power during high-demand periods (peaking power). The fluctuating releases of water associated with peaking power operations have caused concern among federal, state, and tribal resource management agencies; river users who fish in Glen Canyon or take white-water raft trips in the Grand Canyon; and Native American and environmental groups, in connection with the detrimental effects that such water releases have on the cultural resources and the downstream plants, animals, and their habitats."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Operation of the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s Powerplant", "paragraphs": ["The Glen Canyon Dam powerplant has eight generators with a maximum combined capacity of 1,288,000 kilowatts at a 95-percent power factor. The maximum combined discharge capacity of the eight turbines is approximately 33,200 cubic feet per second (cfs) when Lake Powell is full; however, Reclamation has limited such releases to 31,500 cfs. Fluctuations within a day have typically ranged from 12,000 cfs in October to about 16,000 cfs in January and August. Although water can be released from the dam through the powerplant, the outlet works, or the spillways, discharging water through the powerplant\u2019s turbines is the preferred method because electricity and its associated revenue can be produced. The power generated by the Glen Canyon Dam is marketed principally in a six-state area\u2014Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Figure 1.1 shows the various release capacities for the Glen Canyon Dam.", "Historically, the Glen Canyon Dam, as part of the Colorado River Storage Project, was operated to produce the greatest amount of firm capacity and energy practicable while adhering to the releases required under the \u201cLaw of the River.\u201d The Law of the River\u2014a collection of federal and state statutes, compacts, court decisions and decrees, federal contracts, a treaty with Mexico, and formally determined long-range operating criteria\u2014defines the operation and management of the Colorado River. The operating criteria for the dam were established under the \u201cCriteria for Coordinated Long-Range Operation of Colorado River Reservoirs\u201d (Long-Range Operating Criteria), which include the criteria for annual operations. The Annual Operating Plan, which is prepared under the Long-Range Operating Criteria, addresses monthly operations while interagency agreements control the dam\u2019s hourly operations.", "The annual volume of releases from the dam is based on the water inflow to Lake Powell and the remaining space in Lake Powell and Lake Mead. The annual release volumes vary greatly, but all adhere to the Long-Range Operating Criteria\u2019s objectives of an 8.23-million-acre-feet minimum annual release and equalized storage between the two reservoirs. From 1968 to 1989, the annual releases ranged from 8.23 million acre-feet to 20.4 million acre-feet. Annual releases greater than the minimum were permitted to avoid anticipated spills (excess annual releases that cannot be used for project purposes) and to equalize storage. The minimum release occurred in about half the years.", "The volume of water released from Lake Powell each month depends on the forecasted inflow, existing storage level, monthly storage targets, and annual release requirements. Demands for electrical energy, fish and wildlife needs, and recreation needs are also considered and accommodated as long as the risk of spilling and storage equalization between Lakes Powell and Mead are not affected. Power demand is highest during the winter and summer months, and recreation needs are highest during the summer. Therefore, higher-volume releases are scheduled during these months whenever possible. Each month during the inflow forecast season (January to July), the volume of water to be released for the rest of the year is recomputed on the basis of updated streamflow forecast information. The Scheduled releases for the remaining months are adjusted to avoid anticipated spills and maintain conservation storage in accordance with the Long-Range Operating Criteria.", "Hourly releases from the dam are set to reach monthly release volumes, to maintain established minimum flow rates, and to follow energy demand. Hourly power operations are most flexible during those months with moderate release volumes. The need to maintain minimum flows in the months with low release volumes limits the flexibility to accommodate changing hourly power demands. If the reservoir is nearly full and the inflow is extremely high, the monthly releases are scheduled at or near the maximum capacity most of the time, again leaving little flexibility for the hourly releases to change in response to power demand.", "To the extent possible, the Glen Canyon Dam follows these guidelines in producing hydropower: \u2022 Maximize water releases during the peak energy demand periods, generally Monday through Saturday between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m., \u2022 Maximize water releases during peak energy demand months and minimize during low demand months, \u2022 Minimize and, to the extent possible, eliminate powerplant bypasses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Glen Canyon\u2019s Environmental Studies and Environmental Impact Statement", "paragraphs": ["Before the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam, the Colorado River\u2019s sediment-laden flows fluctuated dramatically during different seasons of the year. Flows of greater than 80,000 cfs were common during the spring runoff. In contrast, flows of less than 3,000 cfs were typical throughout the late summer, fall, and winter. Water temperatures ranged from near freezing in the winter to more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. The construction of the Glen Canyon Dam altered the natural dynamics of the Colorado River. The dam replaced seasonal flow variations with daily fluctuations, greatly reduced the amount of sediment in the river, and resulted in nearly constant water release temperatures of about 46 degrees Fahrenheit.", "In response to the concerns of federal, state, and tribal agencies and the public about the negative effects of the dam\u2019s operations, in December 1982 the Secretary of the Interior directed Reclamation to initiate a series of interagency scientific studies. These studies were to examine the short- and long-term effects of the dam\u2019s historic, current, and alternative operations on the environmental and recreational resources of the Glen and Grand canyons. The studies became known as phase I of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies. From 1982 through 1987, 39 technical reports were prepared evaluating terrestrial biology, aquatic biology, sediment and hydrology, recreation, and the dam\u2019s operations. However, no studies were conducted on the economic impact to hydropower from changes in the dam\u2019s operations. According to Reclamation, of primary importance in the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies was the research connected with endangered fish. The existence and operations of the dam were believed to be important factors involved in the extinction of two fish species (the Colorado squawfish and bonytails) from the river corridor. The dam and its operations were also considered to present survival problems for the existing populations of the humpback chub and razorback sucker as well as other native fish species. Therefore, according to Reclamation, the biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994 was an important factor in the ultimate formulation of the preferred alternative in the environmental impact statement (EIS).", "The Glen Canyon Environmental Studies technical reports were concurrently reviewed by the National Research Council and the Executive Review Committee. The Executive Review Committee was made up of policy-level representatives from Reclamation, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance, and the Western Area Power Administration. This Committee then prepared a report in January 1988 on the findings and conclusions of phase I of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and made recommendations and suggested options for revising the dam\u2019s operations.", "In June 1988, phase II of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies was initiated to gather additional data over a 4- to 5-year period on the dam\u2019s specific operational elements. Phase II was to further define the impacts on the natural environment, public uses associated with recreation, cultural resources, and power-generation economics. At the urging of the National Research Council, an entity of the National Academy of Sciences, non-use values were incorporated into the studies. \u201cNon-use value\u201d is the term used to describe the monetary value that non-users place on the status of the environment. For example, the values that people may receive from the knowledge that such things as rare plants, animals, and unspoiled natural environments exist are defined as non-use values. A number of federal and state resource agencies, Indian tribes, private consultants, universities, and river guides participated in phase II of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies. Funding for these studies was provided mainly from the revenue derived from the sale of electricity generated by the Glen Canyon Dam.", "In July 1989, the Secretary of the Interior decided that Reclamation should prepare an environmental impact statement to reevaluate the operations of the Glen Canyon Dam. The purpose of the EIS was to determine specific options for operating the dam that could minimize the adverse impacts on the downstream environmental and cultural resources, as well as on the Native American interests in the Glen and Grand canyons, while still producing hydropower. Reclamation was designated by the Secretary to be the lead agency responsible for preparing the EIS; other participants were the following cooperating agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Western Area Power Administration, and the Arizona Game and Fish Department. In 1989, after the EIS process started, Reclamation also made the following Native American tribes cooperating agencies: the Hopi Tribe, the Hualapai Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Pueblo of Zuni, the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, and the Southern Paiute Consortium. Officials from many of these same agencies and tribes participated in the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies, which formed the basis for the analyses of alternatives for the EIS.", "Calif.", "The requirement to prepare an EIS accelerated the scheduled completion of the research studies in phase II of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies to provide more timely data for the EIS. This acceleration was accomplished by designing special \u201cresearch flows,\u201d a series of carefully designed discharges of water and data collection programs conducted in June 1990 through July 1991. Each research flow lasted 14 days and included 3 days of steady 5,000 cfs flows and 11 days of either steady or fluctuating flows. The research flows provided a means to evaluate the short-term responses of certain resources to a variety of discharge parameters, including minimum and maximum flows, the rate of change in flow, and the range of daily fluctuations.", "To protect downstream resources until the completion of the EIS and the formal adoption of new operating criteria for the Glen Canyon Dam, Reclamation implemented the interim dam operations on November 1, 1991. The interim operating criteria were purposely designed to be conservative for the protection of natural and cultural resources. Specifically, the interim criteria reduced peak water releases from the approved maximum of 31,500 cfs to 20,000 cfs; restricted daily fluctuations in releases to between 5,000 cfs and 8,000 cfs; and restricted the rate of change in releases (ramp rates) to 2,500 cfs per hour when increasing and to 1,500 cfs per hour when decreasing. While these limitations were imposed, the interim criteria met the minimum annual release of 8.23 million acre-feet in accordance with the 1970 Long-Range Operating Criteria. Although the interim operating criteria could be modified on the basis of new information, they were to remain in effect until the EIS and the Secretary\u2019s Record of Decision for new operating criteria for the dam were completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to Reclamation\u2019s initiation of the EIS process, on October 30, 1992, the Congress enacted the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 (title XVIII of P.L. 102-575).

In February 1990, Reclamation published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the opening of the scoping phase of the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s EIS. This phase included environmental scoping meetings to obtain public comments and determine the appropriate scope of the EIS. The comment period, initially established for March 12 through April 16, 1990, was extended to May 4, 1990, in response to comments by the public. Reclamation provided opportunities for public participation in the scoping phase through news releases, mailings, legal notices, and contacts with media, organizations, and individuals. Throughout the process, the EIS team periodically reported the results of its analyses to the cooperating agencies and the public. The cooperating agencies acted as a steering committee and provided input to Reclamation on both the EIS process and the EIS document after a period of review and discussion.", "More than 17,000 comments were received during the scoping period. Numerous comments were received about suggested alternatives and factors to be considered in the development of alternatives. These comments ranged from general suggestions about the management of the dam to specific flow release recommendations. As a result of the analyses and the categorization of the oral and written scoping comments by a Reclamation contractor, the EIS team consolidated and refined the public\u2019s issues of concern. The following resources were identified to be analyzed in detail in the EIS: water, sediment, fish, vegetation, wildlife and their habitat, endangered and other special-status species, cultural resources, air quality, recreation, hydropower, and non-use value.", "In July 1990, representatives from the cooperating agencies and various interest groups participated in a \u201cbrainstorming\u201d workshop to fully consider all concepts and suggestions in formulating alternatives for the dam\u2019s operations. On the basis of the results of the workshop, scoping comments, and the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies phase I report, the interdisciplinary EIS team formulated 10 preliminary alternative flow scenarios. Some of these alternatives would provide for warmer water release temperatures in the summer, add sediment to the river below the dam, or reregulate releases to provide steady flows downstream. The EIS team presented these alternatives to the cooperating agencies and, following their approval, presented them to the public in March 1991.", "The public was asked to comment on the range of preliminary alternatives as part of the EIS scoping process. The predominant public comment was the need to separately consider alternatives that deal with the operations of the dam from those considering changes to the structure of the dam. Using the additional input received from the public, professional judgment, and analysis of interim flows, the EIS team reviewed and revised the preliminary alternatives. Seven alternatives were then identified for detailed analysis. Later, to present a full range of reasonable operations for study in the EIS, two more alternatives were formulated. These included the Maximum Powerplant Capacity alternative, which was developed to allow use of the powerplant\u2019s maximum discharge capacity of 33,200 cfs, and the eventual preferred alternative\u2014the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow alternative. The Modified Low Fluctuating Flow alternative was similar to the Interim Flow but included a habitat maintenance flow. Habitat maintenance flows are high, steady releases of water within the powerplant\u2019s capacity for 1 or 2 weeks in the spring. The purpose of these flows is to reform and rejuvenate backwaters and maintain sandbars, which are important for native fish habitat.

This withdrawal process is accomplished by a series of eight 15-foot-diameter intake pipes that provide the water directly to the dam\u2019s eight turbines. This water withdrawal process results in the river water temperature downstream of the dam being a nearly constant year-round average of about 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Many native fish species cannot reproduce and survive in these constant cold temperature conditions. Increasing mainstream water temperatures by means of selective withdrawal structures offers the greatest potential for creating new spawning populations of humpback chub and other native fish in the Grand Canyon. Multilevel intake structures (a means of selective withdrawal) could be built at Glen Canyon Dam to provide seasonal variation in the water temperature.

This alternative would have the same annual and essentially the same monthly operating plan as under the No-Action alternative but would restrict daily and hourly water releases. Specifically, minimum flows would be no less than 8,000 cfs between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. and 5,000 cfs at night. The maximum rate of release would be limited to 25,000 cfs during fluctuating hourly releases. Ramp rates would be limited to 4,000 cfs per hour for increasing flows and 1,500 cfs per hour for decreasing flows. Daily fluctuations would be limited to 5,000, 6,000, or 8,000 cfs depending on the monthly release volume.", "The preferred alternative also included periodic habitat maintenance flows, which are steady high releases within the powerplant\u2019s capacity for 1 to 2 weeks in the spring. The purpose of these flows is to rejuvenate backwater channels that are important to fish habitat and maintain sandbars that are important for camping. Habitat maintenance flows differ from beach/habitat-building flows in that they would be within the powerplant\u2019s capacity and would occur nearly every year when the reservoir\u2019s volume is low. According to Reclamation, when the reservoir is low, water flows normally would not exceed about 22,000 cfs, and the probability of an unscheduled spill is small. Therefore, the habitat maintenance flows would be scheduled in those years. Habitat maintenance flows would not occur in years when a beach/habitat-building flow is scheduled. Beach/habitat-building flows are controlled floods with scheduled high releases of water greater than the powerplant\u2019s capacity for a short duration, designed to rebuild high elevation sandbars, deposit nutrients, restore backwater channels, and provide some of the dynamics of a natural river system.", "According to Reclamation, instead of conducting the beach/habitat building flows in years in which Lake Powell storage is low on January 1, it has been agreed to modify the preferred alternative in the Record of Decision to accomplish the flows in high reservoir years when bypassing the powerplant would be necessary for safety purposes at the dam. In the spring of 1996, Reclamation conducted its first experiment of the controlled flood concept. The controlled experiment commenced with 4 days of constant flows at 8,000 cfs. Flows began to increase incrementally on March 26, 1996, until they reached a maximum of 45,000 cfs, where they remained for 7 days. After 7 days of high flows, the releases were reduced, gradually, to a constant flow of 8,000 cfs for 4 days of evaluation. According to Reclamation, the preliminary results indicate that the release increased sandbars in the Glen and the Grand canyons by as much as 30 percent and also created numerous backwaters for fish."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Subsection 1804(b) of the Grand Canyon Protection Act states that the Comptroller General shall (1) audit the costs and benefits to water and power users and to natural, recreational, and cultural resources resulting from the management policies and dam operations identified pursuant to the environmental impact statement and (2) report the results of the audit to the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress.", "While the act states that GAO should audit the \u201ccosts and benefits\u201d of various alternative dam operations identified in the EIS, the National Environmental Policy Act does not require, and Reclamation did not perform, a cost and benefit analysis.

In the absence of a cost and benefit analysis, we determined that the statute does not require us to conduct our own cost and benefit analysis.

To assess the total design method for conducting mail surveys used by Reclamation in the non-use study we used the most widely accepted written standards for mail questionnaires published by Don A.

Dr. Stevens is considered by many to be the leading authority on vegetation in the Grand Canyon region. He was a major contributor of research on both the vegetation and wildlife/habitat resources for the EIS. We also contacted Mr. David Marcus, whom Reclamation stated also provided substantive comments on the draft EIS. However, Mr. Marcus stated that he worked as a consultant for American Rivers and that he preferred to provide us with his comments through that organization, not as an individual.

For most resource assessments, Reclamation relied on multidisciplinary subteams consisting of experts representing federal and state governments, tribal interests, academic and scientific communities, the electric utility industry, environmental organizations, and the recreation industry. The exact makeup of each team depended on the resource and the area of concern. In addition, for each resource, the subteam assessed, either quantitatively, qualitatively or both, how alternative flows would affect the resource relative to a No-Action (base case) flow. The EIS teams generally used state-of-the-art modeling techniques and/or the latest scientific research to make the impact determinations. Furthermore, the methods used and results achieved were reviewed by peers and outside experts, including the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Review Team and the National Academy of Sciences.", "To conduct the impact analyses of various flows on hydropower, Reclamation established the Power Resources Committee\u2014a group of electricity and modeling experts from Reclamation, the Western Area Power Administration, the electric utility industry, private contractors, and the environmental community. Using a 50-year analysis period (1991-2040) and the No-Action Flow alternative (historic operations) as the base case, the Committee assessed how various flow alternatives would affect hydropower production and then projected the subsequent economic costs that would be incurred by regional utilities and end-users to replace the dam\u2019s forgone power production. The Committee considered the fixed costs associated with the existing generating capacity in the region to be \u201csunk\u201d costs and, hence, excluded them from the economic cost calculations. The Committee also used two state-of-the-art modeling techniques and detailed utility-specific data to quantify the economic impacts. In addition, the Committee used sensitivity analysis to test the impact of changes in key economic assumptions. The results of the power study were then incorporated into the draft EIS for public comment. The Committee solicited and received an independent review of the power study from three energy experts. On the basis of the comments received from the public and outside experts, the Committee partially revised its initial power study. For example, the Committee updated the projected costs of building gas-combustion powerplants, revised its retail rate analysis, and conducted additional sensitivity analyses. The results of both power studies were incorporated into the final EIS. (See app. V for details on the results of the power study.)", "For fish resources, numerous public comments were received by Reclamation expressing concern about the impact determinations presented in the draft EIS. To respond to these concerns, Reclamation formed an Aquatic Biology Team workgroup. This work group consisted of EIS team members representing Reclamation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and two Indian tribes.", "The workgroup was tasked to respond to comments and to reorganize and rewrite the fish section of the final EIS. Individual workgroup members were given specific assignments, interactive discussions were held, and decisions were made through consensus. As a result of this effort, several major changes were made to the final EIS, including more explicit recognition of the uncertainty and disagreement that exist among scientists about the response of fish to the steady flow alternatives. (See app. IV for details on the results of the fish impact determinations.)", "To assess the impact of various flow alternatives on water and sediment, Reclamation\u2019s EIS team used the Colorado River Simulation System (CRSS) to project the long-term (50 years) and short-term (20 years) impacts on annual and monthly streamflows, floodflows and other water spills, water storage, water allocation deliveries, and Upper Colorado River Basin yields. CRSS is a package of computer programs and databases designed to assist water resource managers in performing comprehensive long-range planning and operations studies that arise from proposed changes in the Colorado River\u2019s operations, proposed development of the Colorado River Basin, or changes in present water use throughout the basin. The development of CRSS took place over a 10-year period and stemmed from the need for a comprehensive model of the Colorado River Basin that would incorporate all areas of interest, including legislative requirements. According to Reclamation and other experts, CRSS is the most comprehensive and detailed simulation of the Colorado River system that exists. (See app. VIII and app. X for details on the results of the sediment and water analyses, respectively.)", "To quantify the economic impact of the dam\u2019s various flow alternatives on non-use values and recreation, Reclamation primarily relied on a methodology called contingent valuation. Social scientists and economists have long acknowledged the existence of non-use values\u2014the monetary value placed on the status of the environment by people who never visit or otherwise use these features. Contingent valuation relies on public surveys to elicit information from consumers and estimate how much they would be willing to pay for a non-use good. For valuing most goods and services, economists are able to rely on people\u2019s actual purchases of goods in markets. However, by definition people do not purchase non-use goods, and some prominent economists question whether the contingent valuation method can accurately elicit the values consumers place on non-use goods. For example, Peter A. Diamond and Jerry A. Hausman state, \u201cWe believe that contingent valuation is a deeply flawed methodology for measuring non-use values, one that does not estimate what its proponents claim to be estimating.\u201d Still many economists and survey researchers working in the natural resource and environmental areas have developed and used this methodology, and it is currently the only known approach for estimating non-use values. (See app. VI for details on the results of the non-use value study.) Economists generally have fewer questions about the application of the contingent valuation methodology in measuring the value of goods and services that consumers actually purchase. Therefore, there are fewer questions about the usefulness of this approach for measuring the values associated with recreational activities.

We did note, however, some shortcomings in the economic assumptions used in the hydropower analysis and in Reclamation\u2019s implementation of certain methodologies. Specifically, in the hydropower analysis, the assumptions used do not explicitly include the mitigating effect that higher electricity prices would have in reducing the demand for electricity (that is, price elasticity). For example, the Power Resources Committee assumed that both the demand for and price of electricity would continue to rise over the planning period. However, we believe the rise in the price of electricity would likely induce some electricity consumers (both wholesalers and end-users) to consume less electricity or switch to cheaper alternative suppliers, which is not taken into account in the analysis. Consequently, fewer resources would be needed to replace forgone power at the Glen Canyon Dam, and the subsequent economic impacts would be lower than estimated (all else being the same).", "In addition, the Committee\u2019s assumptions about future natural gas prices are relatively high. The Committee assumed that the average gas price would increase annually by 8 percent from 1991 through 2010. In 1994, industry forecasters projected that the price of natural gas would increase by about 6 percent for the same time period, and in 1995, forecasts assumed that prices will rise by only 5 percent. The higher escalation rates could affect the power analysis by overstating the economic cost of replacing the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s power.", "We also found that Reclamation\u2019s staff made two computational errors during the revision of the initial power analysis. The Power Resources Committee acknowledged these errors in its final report and stated that the errors affected the results in opposite directions, that is, one error may have overstated costs while the other error may have understated costs. The Committee was unable to correct the errors in the report because of time and funding constraints.", "These shortcomings, combined with the inherent uncertainty in making economic forecasts, reduce the precision of the estimated economic impacts. However, an association that represents the affected power utilities, while maintaining that the costs to the power system are understated, does not believe that Reclamation\u2019s analysis is inaccurate by a large magnitude. Furthermore, because these shortcomings affect the estimated economic impact of all alternatives equally, we believe that addressing these shortcomings would not alter the relative ranking of the fluctuating and steady flow alternatives.", "Although we believe the recreation impacts methodology is generally reasonable, we noted several limitations. For example, the survey data used as the basis of the analysis were gathered during an unusually high-water year; therefore, some respondents may not have actually experienced how various alternative flows would have affected their recreational experience, which is what they were being asked to value. In addition, the survey was designed well before the flow alternatives to be studied in the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s EIS were finalized. As a result, the survey scenarios do not systematically correspond to the flow alternatives presented in the EIS. Finally, although researchers tested proposed questions to determine which ones offered the highest response rate, they did not adequately pretest some survey instruments to detect wording, construction, and presentation defects or other inadequacies. Because the recreation economic model used the results of these survey instruments as a basis for the analysis, the estimated dollar value of the benefits may not be very precise. Reclamation and National Park Service officials involved in the process acknowledged that the recreation analysis has limitations but stated that these limitations would not affect the ranking of the alternatives. They also noted that the estimated recreation benefits identified by this research were not a key element in the selection of the preferred alternative.", "In addition to the shortcomings in the hydropower and recreation analyses, we also noted that there was no formal opportunity for affected parties as well as the general public to offer comments on the Glen Canyon non-use value study. Although the final EIS notes that the non-use value is positive and significant, the actual quantified results are not included in the final EIS. Reclamation did not include the non-use value study results because they were not available when the final EIS was published. The non-use study was completed as a separate Glen Canyon Environmental Studies report and, according to Reclamation, will be attached to the Record of Decision package sent to the Secretary of the Interior. In that way, it will become part of the final decision-making process. Reclamation noted that although the non-use study did not go through the public comment process, the study team solicited and received peer review at various key decision points and that the final results of the non-use value study received a positive review by the National Academy of Sciences and the Office of Management and Budget. Reclamation also noted that interests likely to be affected by any changes in the operations of the Glen Canyon Dam, such as power groups and environmental groups, were involved in the non-use value study process.

According to Reclamation and other experts who developed the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s environmental impact statement, the data used to make the impact determinations were the best available at the time. For example, for the impact of various flow alternatives on nonfish endangered species, one researcher said the terrestrial and bird-related research used as a basis for making impact determinations was \u201ctop notch.\u201d Another researcher who worked on endangered species stated that when they were clarifying information or needed data to fill gaps, the EIS team contacted researchers directly to get the latest available data. For information on cultural resources and properties, members of that resource team believe that Reclamation went beyond federal requirements for the development of an impact statement by performing assessments of all previously identified archeological sites within the Colorado River corridor in the Glen and Grand canyons. According to many experts, when completed, this effort generated the best and most current scientific information available.", "For some resources, we found that although the data were the best available, they had limitations. Some of the data used in making the impact determinations were dated, preliminary, or incomplete. For example, Reclamation used survey data collected in 1985 to assess the economic impact of alternative dam flows on recreational activities. Reclamation\u2019s contractor surveyed a sample of anglers, day-rafters, and white-water boaters about their recreational experiences on the Colorado River and what effect, if any, different streamflows would have on their recreational experiences. However, because the survey was undertaken in 1985, it may not represent more recent trends in recreational experiences. For example, the number of angling trips on the Colorado River more than doubled between 1985 and 1991 (the base year used by Reclamation in preparing the draft EIS), which may influence the value of each trip. Reclamation updated some of the data to 1991 but acknowledges that the survey data were generally dated. Reclamation stated, however, that the recreation analysis was adequate to present a good picture of the potential impact of alternative flows on various recreational experiences and that because of the limited impact of alternative flows on recreation, limited research funds could be better used to improve other analyses. The National Research Council generally found the recreation analysis to be adequate.", "In addition, the estimated non-use values for the steady flow alternatives could be overstated because of new information that was not available at the time the survey instruments were developed. The non-use value surveys described the environmental impacts based on information that was the best available at the time. This information indicated that improvements would be obtained for fish resources under fluctuating and steady flow alternatives. However, after the development of the survey instruments, the fish section of the EIS was revised to recognize the uncertainty that exists about the impact of steady flow alternatives. To the extent that the non-use value surveys did not capture this degree of uncertainty, the precision of the non-use value estimates could be reduced.", "Many of the results of the Glen Canyon sediment studies were preliminary, in draft form, and had not been published at the time that the draft impact statement or the final impact statement was written. In addition, in some cases definitive information on the impact of a specific flow alternative was not available. Therefore, the EIS team had to extrapolate from the existing data using their professional judgment to estimate the potential impact of a specific alternative. The EIS team told us that they always verified the reasonableness of their conclusions and extrapolations with the researchers. However, they believed that if finalized data had been available, the reasons for the selection of the preferred alternative would have been more clearly supported. These researchers added that no new or additional information on sediment impacts has been obtained that would alter the information or conclusions presented in the final impact statement.", "Finally, information on some resources is incomplete, as is the knowledge of how changes in the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s operations will affect those resources. For example, the experts\u2019 opinions vary, in part because of incomplete data, on how native and nonnative fish interact and how changes to the dam\u2019s operations would affect these interactions. Many researchers and EIS team members we interviewed expressed regret about the lack of coordinated time frames between the completion of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and the development of the Glen Canyon Dam EIS. The leader of the workgroup responsible for developing the EIS impact determinations for fish stated that this difference in time frames was especially problematic when the preferred alternative was selected. At that point, decisions had to be made, but data and analyses were not complete.", "Reclamation explicitly acknowledges the uncertainty that exists about the impact of the steady flow alternatives on fish resources in the final EIS. In its final biological opinion, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that Reclamation\u2019s preferred alternative is likely to jeopardize the existence of two native endangered fish species (the humpback chub and the razorback sucker). In general, the biological opinion\u2019s \u201creasonable and prudent alternative\u201d would modify the preferred alternative by including seasonally adjusted steady flows.

Although these individuals recognized that there were some shortcomings in the analyses, they generally agreed that the results of the impact determinations as presented in the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s final EIS were reasonable. For example, although some researchers described the model used (the sand-mass balance model) to determine the impact of various flows on sediment as \u201csimplistic\u201d compared with models that are currently being developed by U.S. Geological Survey researchers, none of the preliminary results from the new models contradict the conclusions reached by the sand-mass balance model. Another researcher who worked on the vegetation and wildlife resources told us that although the EIS may have been based on incomplete information, subsequent science supports it. The researcher further added that the results of the EIS were right on track with the best scientific evidence available at the time.", "The results of some impacts, however, such as how steady flows will affect fish, are still uncertain. The individual responsible for leading the fish impact determinations process stated that the lack of final results from the fish research studies was frustrating and that the limited data allowed differences of opinion and scientific interpretation to arise about the impacts on fish resources. However, he added that he believed that if final data had been available, they would have refined the EIS team\u2019s conclusions but would not have changed the impact determinations or the preferred alternative.", "Although there is general agreement that the results of the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s EIS are reasonable, there is also general agreement that additional research is needed to further refine or, in the case of fish resources, define the impact on resources of changes to the dam\u2019s operations. For example, impacts to some archeological and cultural properties are bound to occur regardless of the flow alternative chosen. To avoid or minimize the loss of historic properties and comply with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act, Reclamation developed a programmatic agreement between federal and state agencies as well as affected Native American tribes. Implemented in 1994, the agreement led to numerous monitoring trips and site-stabilization efforts, but all parties involved believe that more research is needed to understand how water flow affects cultural resources. Furthermore, several sediment researchers we interviewed stated that they supported the impact determinations and the preferred alternative.

To address these uncertainties, Reclamation plans to initiate an Adaptive Management Program. The concept of adaptive management is based on the recognized need for ongoing operational flexibility to respond to future monitoring and research findings and varying resource conditions. The objective of the Adaptive Management Program is to establish and implement long-term monitoring programs that will ensure that the Glen Canyon Dam is operated, consistent with existing law, in a manner that will protect, mitigate adverse impacts to, and improve the values for which the Glen Canyon National Recreational Area and the Grand Canyon National Park were established. According to Reclamation, long-term monitoring and research are essential to adaptive management. Reclamation believes that such an effort is needed to measure the performance of any selected EIS alternative. In this way, managers can determine whether the alternative is actually meeting resource management objectives and obtain an additional understanding of the resources\u2019 responses to the dam\u2019s operations.", "Under Reclamation\u2019s current proposal, the Adaptive Management Program, which would be under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, would be facilitated through an Adaptive Management Work Group.

According to Reclamation, during this 14-year period, over $75 million was spent initially on the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and then on the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s EIS. This research and analysis was aimed at providing sufficient information to recommend an operating plan for the dam that would permit the recovery of downstream resources while maintaining some level of hydropower flexibility. Still, after all this time and money, the process of selecting a preferred alternative involved not only scientific evidence but also trade-offs and compromise. This occurred because no one alternative could maximize benefits to all resources and because the impacts of some of the flow alternatives remain uncertain. Nevertheless, over 83 percent of the key interested parties who responded to our survey support Reclamation\u2019s preferred alternative as a good starting point for the future operations of the Glen Canyon Dam.

It is safe to say that the preferred alternative will not completely satisfy any one group, however it represents a balance of interests and a reasonable starting point for future dam operations.\u201d", "Another factor that the EIS team considered was that some affected resources were renewable, while others were viewed as nonrenewable. They avoided recommending an alternative dam-operating procedure that would result in significant loss of any existing nonrenewable resource and tried to minimize the adverse impacts to most renewable resources. They eliminated the No-Action, Maximum Powerplant Capacity, and High Fluctuating Flow alternatives from consideration as a preferred alternative because the data indicated that while these alternatives were beneficial to hydropower, they would either increase or maintain conditions that result in adverse impacts to nonrenewable downstream resources.", "The EIS team also eliminated the Year-Round Steady Flow alternative from consideration as the preferred alternative. This alternative exhibited the highest probability for net gain in riverbed sand, had the largest potential for expanding riparian vegetation, and received the highest ranking among all alternatives for white-water boating safety benefits. However, the EIS team believed that the alternative probably exceeded sediment protection requirements for long-term management and would result in the lowest-elevation sandbars. The team was also concerned that a completely stable flow alternative would permit vegetation to adversely affect camping beaches and over time reduce the value of wildlife habitat. In addition, a stable flow may increase the negative interaction between native fish and predator and competitor nonnative fish. Finally, the team eliminated this alternative because they believed that it did not provide benefits that could not be provided by other alternatives, yet it would cause large adverse effects to hydroelectric power generation.", "Of the remaining alternatives, the Existing Monthly Volume Steady Flow alternative was eliminated for reasons similar to those discussed for the Year-Round Steady Flow alternative. The Low Fluctuating Flow alternative was eliminated to reduce redundancy\u2014Reclamation considered the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow alternative an improved version of the Low Fluctuating Flow alternative.", "The EIS team considered the impacts associated with the three remaining alternatives (Moderate Fluctuating Flow, Modified Low Fluctuating Flow, and Seasonally Adjusted Steady Flow), although they were substantially different from the effect of the No-Action alternative, to be very similar in their assumed benefits to most downstream resources. Reclamation\u2019s former NEPA Manager for the Glen Canyon Dam\u2019s EIS advised us that from an ecosystem perspective, sediment was identified as the key resource in the selection of a preferred alternative. Riverbed sand and sandbars were the sediment resources of primary interest affected by riverflows below the dam. For sandbars to exist, sufficient amounts of sand must be stored on the riverbed. Because the dam traps 90 percent of the sediment, the sand supply is currently limited to whatever is contributed by downstream tributaries and hundreds of side canyons. Of equal concern is the river\u2019s capacity to transport sediment. Riverflows must be large enough to move and deposit sediment but not so large as to carry the sediment out of the canyon ecosystem. Frequent high flows, either from floods or large daily fluctuations, can transport greater amounts of sand than are contributed, causing a net decrease in both the amount of stored riverbed sand and the size of sandbars. Water release patterns modify the natural process of sandbar deposition and erosion. Rapid drops in the level of the river drain groundwater from sandbars, thus accelerating sandbar erosion. The EIS team concluded that any of these three alternatives were very similar in their assumed benefits to most downstream resources.", "The effects on native fish did, however, vary among the three remaining alternatives. The Moderate Fluctuating Flow alternative provides potential minor benefits to native fish over no-action conditions. The benefits from the Seasonally Adjusted Steady Flow alternative were uncertain given the improvement in habitat conditions that this alternative would provide for predator and competitor nonnative fish. The team also determined that seasonally adjusted steady flows would create conditions significantly different from those under which the current aquatic ecosystem had developed since the construction of the dam. Finally, for hydropower, the team determined that the Seasonally Adjusted Steady Flow alternative would have the highest economic cost of any alternative, estimated at about $124 million annually. Ultimately, the EIS team decided to recommend the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow for the preferred alternative in the draft EIS. The members believed that this alternative would create conditions that permit the recovery of downstream resources to acceptable management levels while maintaining a level of hydroelectric power flexibility. The EIS team presented this recommendation to the cooperating agencies. Most cooperating agencies concurred, and the group recommended that this alternative be adopted by Reclamation. The draft EIS was issued by Reclamation in January 1994 with the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow identified as the preferred alternative.", "After the draft EIS was provided for public comment but before the issuance of the final EIS, Reclamation changed two parameters of the preferred alternative. Specifically, the draft EIS\u2019 preferred alternative had a maximum release level of 20,000 cfs and a maximum upramp rate of 2,500 cfs per hour. In the final EIS, Reclamation modified the preferred alternative to provide a maximum release level of 25,000 cfs and a maximum upramp rate of 4,000 cfs per hour. The primary reason for these changes was to benefit hydropower. The preferred alternative presented in the draft EIS had the same maximum release rate and upramp rate as the interim operating criteria. Reclamation stated that the interim operating criteria were based on the results of phase I of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and professional judgment and were designed to be environmentally conservative over the interim period. With the benefit of the additional phase II results of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies and EIS impact analyses, Reclamation stated that the upramp rate and maximum flow criteria were found to be overly conservative for the long term and that the two changes would not cause adverse impacts to downstream resources. As a result, with the concurrence of the cooperating agencies, the preferred alternative was modified in the final EIS.", "In July 1995, Reclamation issued a document entitled Flow Modifications to the Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement Preferred Alternative. Those who commented on that document expressed concern that no studies on the specific upramp and maximum flow criteria had been conducted. In October 1995, Reclamation issued a new report entitled Assessment of Changes to the Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement Preferred Alternative from Draft to Final EIS. This report provided a more detailed and focused assessment of the impacts associated with the increased upramp rate and maximum flow criteria. While acknowledging that no new studies were conducted, Reclamation pointed out that the same was true for the parameters of the interim flows when they were selected and implemented. Furthermore, Reclamation stated it was possible to determine the effects of these changes by using the extensive amount of knowledge gained from both phase I and phase II of the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies.

FWS\u2019s biological opinion expressed concern that the preferred alternative recommended flows would likely jeopardize the continued existence of two endangered species, the humpback chub and the razorback sucker. The biological opinion\u2019s reasonable and prudent alternative would modify the preferred alternative with seasonally adjusted steady flows about 25 percent of the time. FWS and Reclamation agreed to categorize these flows as experimental, or research flows, so that studies could be conducted to verify an effective dam-operating plan and to include those flows with another element of the reasonable and prudent alternative, adaptive management. However, there are concerns on the part of the Colorado River Energy Distributors Association, which represents over 140 nonprofit utilities that purchase power from the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), that the implementation of endangered fish research flows will proceed regardless of the outcome of the Adaptive Management Program. The association strongly supports the EIS preferred alternative as a reasonable point to begin modified dam operations and adaptive management. However, the association also believes that an important part of the adaptive management process is that if an analysis of a research proposal indicates an inappropriate risk to the endangered fish or other resource, the Secretary could decide not to pursue this element of the preferred alternative. As such, the association objects to the language in the final EIS and the final biological opinion that indicates that the research flows will go forward regardless of the outcome of the adaptive management research design and risk assessment.", "The Colorado River Energy Distributors Association and the Salt River Project, an agricultural improvement district that provides electrical service to various counties in the state of Arizona, are concerned that the economic cost of reducing the hydroelectric power capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam is understated in the EIS. Both the association and the Salt River Project believe that the preferred alternative does not adequately address the economic cost to power users of research flows. In addition, the Salt River Project believes that the EIS does not analyze the full economic impact of the preferred alternative on Salt River and its customers and on WAPA and its customers, resulting from WAPA\u2019s being unable to fulfill its obligations under an exchange agreement. The exchange agreement obligated Salt River to build and operate power generation facilities near customers in Colorado and New Mexico and to deliver the power produced by those facilities to WAPA to serve those customers. In exchange, WAPA was obligated to deliver a like amount of power to the Salt River Project from the Glen Canyon Dam.", "WAPA stated that the EIS assumes that the dam\u2019s operations (water releases) are the only cause of the adverse impacts on the downstream resources and that, therefore, changing the dam\u2019s operations is the only technique or method available for managing and enhancing those resources. WAPA believes that other causes of downstream impacts include lack of sediment, cold water temperatures, nonnative fish species, and human usage. Accordingly, they believe that changing the operations at Glen Canyon Dam is not the only, or necessarily the best or lowest-cost, means of achieving positive resource changes. WAPA believes that a more holistic approach to the management of the downstream resources should be taken and supports the investigation of both operational and nonoperational management techniques, practices, and programs. Although WAPA supports the preferred alternative, it stated that the concepts of pumping sand, protecting beaches with native materials, augmenting sediment, managing vegetation, restricting human use, restricting raft moorings, reducing the competition for native fish, developing new tributary habitats for native fish, and using a reregulation dam (build another dam below the Glen Canyon Dam to regulate river flow) are all valid management techniques that merit detailed investigation and consideration.", "Several environmental and recreational organizations, although supporting the preferred alternative, were concerned that Reclamation changed certain parameters of the preferred alternative very late in the EIS process. Specifically, the draft EIS\u2019 preferred alternative had a maximum release level of 20,000 cfs and a maximum rate of increase (upramp rate) of 2,500 cfs per hour. In the final EIS, Reclamation modified the preferred alternative to allow for a maximum release level of 25,000 cfs and a maximum upramp rate of 4,000 cfs per hour. Two basic concerns exist about this change: (1) the higher parameters were substituted in the final EIS without adequate scientific evidence that such flows would not negatively affect the downstream resources of the Glen and Grand canyons and (2) two parameters were changed simultaneously, which could compromise the ability to scientifically monitor and assess the future impacts of these flow parameters in the proposed adaptive management framework. Reclamation believes that it has adequately addressed both of these concerns by conducting an assessment of the proposed changes. Some agencies, including the Wyoming State Engineer\u2019s Office, America Outdoors, American Rivers, and the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund still believe that adequate specific scientific testing was not done to fully evaluate the effect of changing these flow parameters. However, these groups still support the preferred alternative at this time because of Reclamation\u2019s proposed Adaptive Management Program.", "The New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission believes that the spillway gates on the Glen Canyon Dam must be increased in height by about 4.5 feet to add the flexibility to accomplish flood protection without reducing the water supply available to the Upper Colorado Basin. The Commission, which supports the preferred alternative, also believes that the selective withdrawal outlet proposal for Glen Canyon Dam has not been adequately justified; the estimated cost of $60 million needs to be arrayed against the resulting benefits; and an assessment needs to be made of the potential adverse impacts associated with increasing water temperature.", "Future monitoring and research efforts were a concern of several groups, including federal agencies, Native American tribes, and an environmental group. For example, American Rivers urged Reclamation to do everything in its power to ensure that an effective Adaptive Management Program be in place or sufficiently delineated in scope and substance and that a specific long-term monitoring program be identified that will quantify any impacts before the proposed flow changes are implemented."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
