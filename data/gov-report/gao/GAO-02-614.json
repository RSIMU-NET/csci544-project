A more thorough description of our scope and methodology is in appendix I.", "We summarized the findings of this review in testimony before the Committee on Government Reform on May 16, 2002."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) ranges and training areas are used primarily to test weapon systems and train military forces; some facilities are used for both testing and training purposes, while others are limited to one use or the other. This report focuses primarily on facilities used for training purposes. DOD needs ranges and training areas for all levels of training. Required facilities include air ranges for air-to-air, air-to-ground, drop zone, and electronic combat training; live-fire ranges for artillery, armor, small arms, and munitions training; ground maneuver ranges to conduct realistic force-on-force and live-fire training at various unit levels; and sea ranges to conduct ship maneuvers for training.", "According to a DOD official, today\u2019s concerns about encroachment reflect the cumulative result of a slow but steady increase in problems affecting the use of their facilities. Historically, specific encroachment problems have been addressed at individual ranges, most often on an ad hoc basis. Recently, DOD officials have reported increased limits on and problems with access to and the use of ranges. They believe that the gradual accumulation of these limits and problems increasingly threatens training readiness. DOD officials have identified eight encroachment issues of concern. These issues are:  The designation of critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. DOD believes that critical habitat designations reduce its flexibility to use designated lands for training and put its military mission in jeopardy because, under the act, an agency is required to ensure that its actions do not destroy or adversely modify designated habitat of any endangered species. Currently over 300 federally listed endangered plant and animal species are found on military installations, and more are anticipated. DOD officials maintain that their successful efforts in managing training ranges have resulted in the training ranges becoming havens for at-risk species. According to these officials, some of the finest remaining examples of rare wildlife habitats are now on military lands.", "The application of environmental statutes to military munitions, including unexploded ordnance and munitions constituents. DOD believes that the Environmental Protection Agency could apply environmental statutes to the intended use of military munitions, shutting down or disrupting military training on active ranges. For example, DOD officials note that in 1997 executive action was taken under the Safe Drinking Water Act that essentially terminated live-fire training on the Massachusetts Military Reservation because of unexploded ordnance and munitions constituents leaching into drinking water in the surrounding area. According to DOD officials, uncertainties about future application and enforcement of these statutes limit the department\u2019s ability to plan, program, and budget for compliance requirements.", "Competition for frequency spectrum. The growth of consumer communications devices has resulted in pressure from the telecommunications industry for the reallocation of some radio frequency spectrum from federal to non-federal control. According to DOD officials, since 1992 DOD has lost approximately 27 percent of the total frequency spectrum allocated for aircraft telemetry. DOD believes the possible reallocation of spectrum, coupled with an increase in DOD activities that use it, raises concerns about the availability of adequate spectrum to support operations and training. For example, we previously reported that DOD is concerned that an additional reallocation of spectrum in the 1755 to 1850 megahertz band could adversely affect space systems, tactical communications, and combat training.", "The requirement to balance ocean resource protection mandates with training needs. DOD officials believe DOD\u2019s ability to train can sometimes be limited by marine regulatory laws that require consultation with regulators when a proposed action may affect a protected resource. Defense officials have expressed concern that the process empowers regulators to impose potentially stringent measures to protect the environment from the effects of proposed DOD actions, which can affect DOD\u2019s ability to conduct operations and training in the marine environment.", "Competition for airspace. DOD officials have expressed concerns that increased airspace congestion, caused by airline industry demands and the military\u2019s need for effective testing and training, limits the ability of pilots to train as they will fight.", "The application of Clean Air Act regulations specifying requirements for air quality. DOD officials believe these regulations can sometimes limit DOD\u2019s ability to base equipment and for units to train as they will fight, particularly with smoke, because the act requires controls over emissions commonly generated on defense installations. According to DOD officials, opacity and conformity requirements are the most onerous for the department. DOD officials told us opacity measures the visibility of air emissions and can restrict or prohibit smoke training, mounted maneuvers, and intentional burns to manage vegetation cover. The conformity rules require federal agencies to analyze emissions from proposed projects or activities at federal installations. DOD officials believe that any new or significant change in range operations located in non-attainment areas requires an emissions analysis. If  emissions exceed specified thresholds, the increase must be offset by reductions elsewhere.", "The application of environmental laws and regulations mandating noise abatement. DOD officials state that weapon systems are exempt from the Noise Control Act of 1972, but that the department must still assess the impact of noise under the National Environmental Policy Act when considering the environmental impact of its activities. As community developments have expanded closer to military installations, concerns over noise from military operations have increased. Defense officials report that pressures from groups at the local, regional, and state levels can serve to restrict or reduce military training.", "Unplanned or incompatible commercial or residential development (urban growth) around training ranges and installations. DOD officials believe encroachment of incompatible civilian activities compromises the effectiveness of their training activities. Incompatible land uses can compromise the health, safety, and welfare of both the military and civilian sectors. DOD officials report that local residents have filed lawsuits because they believe that military operations have impacted their property\u2019s value or restricted its use.", "To the extent that encroachment adversely affects training readiness, opportunities exist for the problems to be reported in departmental and military service readiness reports. The Global Status of Resources and Training System is the primary means for units to report readiness against designed operational goals. The system\u2019s database indicates, at selected points in time, the extent to which units possess the required resources and training to undertake their wartime missions.", "In 1994, to improve its readiness assessment capabilities, DOD established two forums\u2014the Senior Readiness Oversight Council and the Joint Monthly Readiness Review\u2014to evaluate readiness from a joint and strategic perspective. DOD is also required under 10 U.S.C. 482 to prepare a quarterly readiness report to Congress that describes readiness problems. DOD bases its quarterly report on briefings to the Senior Readiness Oversight Council. The Senior Readiness Oversight Council is assisted by the Defense Test and Training Steering Group, which advises the council on training range issues. In June 2000, the council directed the steering group to investigate encroachment and develop and recommend a comprehensive plan of action.", "The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for training personnel and for maintaining their respective training ranges and facilities. Within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness develops policies, plans, and programs to ensure the readiness of the force and provides oversight on training. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment develops policies, plans, and programs for DOD\u2019s environmental, safety, and occupational health programs, including compliance with environmental laws, conservation of natural and cultural resources, pollution prevention, and explosive safety.

While the effect varies by service and individual installation, in general encroachment has limited the extent to which training ranges are available or the types of training that can be conducted. This limits units\u2019 ability to train as they would expect to fight and/or requires units to work around the problem. However, as discussed in the next section, the overall impact on readiness and training costs is not well documented.", "Many encroachment issues result from or are exacerbated by population growth and urbanization. DOD is particularly affected because urban growth near 80 percent of its installations exceeds the national average.

Air quality regulations have restricted the Army\u2019s ability to operate new smoke generators at Fort Lewis. Endangered species habitat considerations have limited off-road vehicle training at Fort Lewis and Yakima and river-crossing operations at Yakima. Maneuvers are restricted in prairie areas at Fort Lewis to preserve an endangered plant and at Yakima to protect western sage grouse habitat. This reduces the types of training that can be conducted by the Interim Brigade Combat Teams based at Fort Lewis. Also, communications equipment used by the teams overlaps with commercial communications networks, creating periodic interference in communications. Finally, although Fort Lewis is situated over an aquifer, and munitions constituents have been found in the water, training has not yet been curtailed at this location.", "Fort Lewis officials are trying to mitigate their encroachment problems by (1) developing and maintaining scientifically defensible information that can demonstrate the effectiveness of current environmental management; (2) integrating range management with endangered species protection initiatives to preserve critical habitat and training ranges; and (3) conducting an outreach campaign to inform the public of the military\u2019s training needs and environmental successes. At Yakima, additional land was purchased recently to increase maneuver space and reduce the environmental impacts of maneuver training on current rangelands.

They noted that most, if not all, encroachment issues such as noise, airspace, endangered species habitat, and air quality, result from population growth and urbanization, and that growth around DOD installations is increasing more than the national average. At the same time, according to a defense official, the increased speed and range of weapon systems are expected to increase training range requirements. For the following reasons, DOD and service officials believe they face increasing encroachment risks in several key areas:  Critical habitat designation. The Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate critical habitat for endangered species at the time of listing, or within 12 months if more data about habitat is needed. Defense officials told us that private environmental interest groups have repeatedly challenged the Wildlife Services\u2019 failure to designate critical habitat and generally have prevailed, resulting in more and more designations. To illustrate, they noted that the Fish and Wildlife Service recently declined to designate critical habitat for a species at Camp Pendleton, using its authority to exempt land from designation if it finds that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of designation. They also noted that the Natural Resource Defense Council, a public interest group involved in environmental protection, is currently challenging the decision in court. Marine Corps officials report that if the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s position is not upheld, approximately 57 percent of Camp Pendleton\u2019s training area could be designated as critical habitat and could face additional restrictions on training. Fish and Wildlife Service officials told us there could be significant increases in habitat designations in coming years.", "Unexploded ordnance and munitions constituents. The application of environmental laws to unexploded munitions and munitions constituents has, to date, affected only one training installation in the continental U.S., the Massachusetts Military Reservation, used primarily by National Guard forces. It remains uncertain whether and to what extent the Environmental Protection Agency will apply the laws to other installations. Environmental Protection Agency officials told us that they were not explicitly monitoring military ranges, but if it were brought to their attention that ordnance was jeopardizing public health and safety at another installation, they would take action to address the situation.", "Frequency spectrum. DOD officials told us that the commercial communications industry has been pressing for access to frequency spectrum currently allocated for federal use, but has stayed its request due to the current national security situation. However, reallocation of some of that spectrum is still under review. An interagency working group, with DOD participation, has been formed and is examining options, including sharing the spectrum and moving DOD operations to other bands. The outcome of these efforts could affect DOD missions, including combat training and satellite operations.", "Airspace congestion. Commercial air traffic growth is expected to result in an increase in passengers from 600 million to an estimated one billion by 2010, increasing the overall demand for airspace volume. Military use of airspace will also increase with the next generation of high-performance weapon systems, standoff munitions, and unmanned aerial vehicles. In many instances, the military\u2019s use of airspace is tied directly to its ground infrastructure, which cannot be changed easily. The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of redesigning the nation\u2019s airways to accommodate this growth. DOD is participating in the process to ensure that its requirements are known early. There is no schedule for completing the redesign, and until the redesign is completed, DOD cannot be certain how its training will be affected.", "Air quality. The Clean Air Act requires federal agencies to analyze the potential effect of proposed projects or activities on air quality. According to DOD officials, installations located in areas that have not met, or have only recently met, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards must work with state or local regulatory agencies to offset any potential emission increases from training activities. This ensures that the air quality of the entire area is not significantly degraded. This may create conflicts with commercial development and could constitute a major impact as competition for air emissions budgets and offsets increases.", "Noise. Noise problems are directly related to the degree that there are people, wildlife, and noise-sensitive land uses (national parks, wilderness, primitive areas, etc.) near military lands and low-level flying routes.

Similarly, the services have very limited data indicating the effect of encroachment on operating costs. Even though some service officials point to increasing costs because of training workarounds related to encroachment, the services\u2019 data systems do not capture these costs in any comprehensive manner.

The fact that DOD and service officials in congressional testimonies and other forums cite the adverse effects of encroachment on training, while commanders are not reporting any adverse effects, suggests that additional steps are needed to improve the reporting process. Our recent report on training limitations overseas recommended that DOD make improvements in reporting training shortfalls. At the same time, a full assessment of the impact of encroachment on training and readiness will be difficult without more complete data concerning training requirements and available resources. Factors making such assessments difficult include the lack of complete data on training range requirements, failure to consider the potential for alternative training technologies to augment live training, and inadequate inventories of facilities. While the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are at various stages in collecting this data, DOD needs to ensure that these efforts continue to receive appropriate management attention and are funded and staffed sufficiently to ensure success. The information would also allow DOD to better defend its resource requirements, focus and prioritize its efforts based on the relative importance of land to the services\u2019 missions, make better stationing and base closure decisions, and write more effective training plans. DOD has taken some initial steps toward developing a comprehensive plan for addressing encroachment issues. Of particular note are DOD\u2019s recently submitted legislative proposals.

The elements of these actions include approaching each specific issue from a position of knowledge, starting at the local level with sound positions and working up through major command and headquarters with federal and state regulators to seek resolution; employing modeling and simulation as necessary; and exploring science and technology initiatives to facilitate future equipment and processes that emit fewer pollutants than legacy equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airborne Noise Action Plan", "paragraphs": ["To respond to noise encroachment, the draft Airborne Noise Action Plan proposes a strategy that will engage other agencies and organizations when they propose restrictions or programs that could impact DOD missions. DOD believes that self-imposed restrictions and concessions by installations often jeopardize their ability to accomplish their training missions. Consequently, it identified actions that would result in two goals: (1) developing a comprehensive integrated noise program and (2) factoring noise into the development and acquisition process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Urban Growth Action Plan", "paragraphs": ["To address encroachment from urban growth, the draft Urban Growth Action Plan proposes a strategy that will try to influence state and local governments to adopt, implement, and enforce local encroachment prevention plans and programs so that future incompatibilities between civilian growth and military training needs might be avoided. The strategy relies on a series of actions related to public relations and coordinated land use programs to engage local communities. It includes (1) forming a coordinated effort within DOD to build and expand upon existing urban development encroachment partnerships; (2) ensuring installations have effective public outreach plans; (3) requiring each installation and range to implement a comprehensive planning process; (4) expanding the Joint Land Use Study program to address range encroachment; (5) working with local authorities to implement appropriate land use zoning near military installations; and (6) having regional environmental coordinators monitor and advocate for DOD on emerging land use issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
