Relatively few Mexican carriers are expected to operate beyond these commercial zones once the United States fully opens its highways to Mexican carriers. Specific regulatory and economic factors that may limit the number of Mexican carriers operating beyond the commercial zones include (1) the lack of established business relationships beyond the U.S. commercial zones that permit drivers to return to Mexico carrying cargo, (2) difficulties obtaining competitively priced insurance, (3) congestion and delays in crossing the U.S.-Mexico border that make long-haul operations less profitable, and (4) high registration fees.

DOT also has not completed agreements with border states on how 58 federal inspectors and 89 state inspectors will share inspection responsibilities along the border. States are responsible for ensuring that Mexican trucks adhere to U.S. emissions standards. California is the only southwest border state with a truck emissions inspection program in place at the border. Although the Mexican government has developed truck safety regulations and taken steps to enforce safety and air emissions standards, these efforts are relatively recent and it is too early to assess their effectiveness. With DOT's support, Mexico has developed five databases on the safety records of its commercial drivers and motor carriers. As of October 2001, however, the commercial driver's license database covered less than one-quarter of Mexico's commercial drivers. Mexico has also participated in NAFTA-related efforts to make motor carrier safety regulations compatible across the three member nations.

In February 2001, a NAFTA arbitration panel ruled that the United States\u2019 blanket refusal to process applications by Mexican trucking companies to provide cross- border services beyond the commercial zones violated its NAFTA obligations. The panel noted, however, that the United States could require Mexican motor carriers to meet U.S. safety requirements. In February 2001, the administration announced that it would give Mexican trucks access to all U.S. highways by January 2002. The Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002, enacted in December 2001, provided increased funding for safety activities related to Mexican motor carriers and set forth a series of requirements that the Department of Transportation (DOT) must meet before Mexican trucks can travel beyond the commercial zones.", "In response to your concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks, we examined (1) the extent to which Mexican-domiciled commercial trucks are likely to travel beyond the U.S. border commercial zones once the border is fully opened, (2) U.S. government agencies\u2019 efforts to ensure that Mexican commercial carriers meet U.S. safety and emissions standards, and (3) how Mexican government and private sector efforts contribute to ensuring that Mexican commercial vehicles entering the United States meet U.S. safety and emissions standards.

Enhanced trade has increased the number of northbound truck crossings from 2.7 million in fiscal year 1994 to more than 4.3 million in fiscal year 2001. According to DOT, about 80,000 trucks crossed the border in fiscal year 2000, 63,000 of which were estimated to be of Mexican origin. Trucks from Mexico enter the United States at border crossing points in four U.S. states (see fig. 1), but most of the crossings occurred at five ports of entry in fiscal year 2001: Laredo, El Paso, Hidalgo/Pharr in Texas, and Calexico and Otay Mesa in California.", "Commercial truck traffic at Texas and California ports of entry, which handle approximately 91 percent of truck crossings from Mexico, has grown just over 60 percent since NAFTA went into effect. Table 1 lists the principal commercial ports of entry and the number of truck crossings that occurred at each port in fiscal year 2001.", "Under NAFTA, barriers have gradually been reduced for trade in goods and services among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Among other things, NAFTA allows Mexican commercial vehicles greater access to U.S. highways to facilitate trade between the two countries. Under NAFTA\u2019s original timeline, Mexico and the United States agreed to permit commercial trucks to operate within both countries\u2019 border states no later than December 18, 1995, and beyond the border states by January 1, 2000.", "However, due to U.S. concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks and the adequacy of Mexico\u2019s truck safety regulatory system, the United States postponed implementation of NAFTA\u2019s cross-border trucking provisions and only permitted Mexican trucks to continue to operate in designated commercial zones within Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas.", "DOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General and GAO have reported that out-of- service rates for Mexican trucks operating in the commercial zones exceeded those of U.S. trucks in the nation as a whole. The Inspector General has also reported that the percentage of Mexican trucks placed out-of-service in the commercial zones declined from 44 percent in fiscal year 1997 to 36 percent in fiscal year 2000.", "In 1998, Mexico challenged the United States\u2019 delay in implementing NAFTA\u2019s schedule for cross-border trucking. In February 2001, a NAFTA arbitration panel ruled that the United States\u2019 blanket refusal to review and consider Mexican motor carrier applications for operating authority to provide cross-border trucking services beyond the commercial zones violated its NAFTA obligations. The panel indicated that under NAFTA, the United States is permitted to establish its own safety standards and ensure that Mexican trucking firms and drivers comply with U.S. safety and operating regulations. However, the panel also noted that due to differing regulatory regimes in each country, the United States need not treat Mexican carriers or drivers exactly the same as those from the United States or Canada, provided that such different treatment is imposed in good faith with respect to a legitimate safety concern and conforms with relevant NAFTA provisions.", "In February 2001, the administration announced that it would comply with its NAFTA obligations and allow Mexican commercial carriers to operate beyond the commercial zones by January 2002. In May 2001, DOT issued three proposed rules that would revise existing regulations and application forms and establish a two-tiered application process for Mexican carriers seeking authority to operate within and beyond the commercial zones.Under the proposed rules, a carrier\u2019s authority would be conditioned on satisfactory completion of a safety audit within 18 months of receiving conditional operating authority. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the agency primarily responsible for enforcing U.S. truck safety regulations, the final regulations would ensure that FMCSA receives adequate information to assess an applicant\u2019s safety program and its ability to comply with U.S. safety standards before it is authorized to operate in the United States. As of December 2001, DOT had not finalized these rules. DOT officials said these rules were not finalized because the Department was waiting for the outcome of the congressional appropriations process. Additional statutory requirements that must be met before Mexican commercial trucks can travel beyond the commercial zones are contained in the fiscal year 2002 DOT appropriations act. These include a range of inspection requirements and facility enhancements, such as adding weigh-in-motion scales at the 10 highest volume crossings. Additional requirements are discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relatively Few Mexican Carriers Initially Expected Beyond Border Commercial Zones", "paragraphs": ["U.S. border state and Mexican transportation officials and representatives of U.S. and Mexican trucking organizations we interviewed said they believe few Mexican carriers will initially apply for authority to travel beyond the commercial zones. Further, they suggested that any increase in truck traffic would be gradual. As of October 2001, fewer than 200 Mexican trucking companies had applied to DOT to operate in the United States beyond the border commercial zones. Regulatory and economic factors may affect Mexican trucking companies\u2019 interest and ability to operate vehicles beyond the commercial zones in the short run, but long- term trends in cross-border trade operations could increase interest in operating beyond the commercial zones."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulatory and Economic Factors May Limit Mexican Carriers\u2019 Willingness to Seek Access Beyond the Commercial Zones", "paragraphs": ["A number of regulatory and economic factors may limit the number of Mexican carriers operating beyond the commercial zones in the near term. For example, U.S. and Mexican officials identified the lack of established business relationships in the United States as a factor likely to reduce the number of Mexican trucking companies willing to operate beyond the commercial zones. According to U.S. and Mexican officials, many Mexican trucking companies lack distribution ties outside the commercial zones and thus do not have immediate access to \u201cbackhaul\u201d cargo from the United States to Mexico that would allow them to operate profitably. The officials noted that it would take time to develop these business relationships.", "The cost and availability of insurance may also affect the number of Mexican carriers operating beyond the commercial zones. According to the National Association of Independent Insurers, newly established trucking companies and Mexican trucking companies wanting to operate beyond the commercial zones face a competitive disadvantage in obtaining affordable insurance. According to companies currently providing insurance to Mexican trucking companies and an insurance industry representative, premiums for Mexican trucking companies will initially be set at the highest level and gradually decline as the market matures. These individuals stated that it would take time for the insurance industry to become familiar with the financial and safety records of Mexican companies and drivers and to develop effective means to access information for underwriting purposes. Further, large U.S.-based and multinational insurers are likely to gradually enter the Mexican market as demand for insurance in the Mexican trucking industry increases. The number of U.S.-based firms currently providing insurance coverage for Mexican trucks entering the United States is unknown. According to insurance company officials, fewer than 10 U.S. firms may be providing insurance for daily trips into the United States by Mexican trucking companies.", "Also, according to Mexican private industry representatives and U.S. researchers, congestion and delays in crossing the U.S.-Mexico border result in added operating costs for Mexican carriers. These costs make it less profitable to use newer, more expensive vehicles to wait in lines at the border. Mexican government and private sector officials stated that delays in crossing the border have increased since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. These delays could limit long-haul operations and encourage further reliance on the existing cross-border shuttle (drayage) system.", "Like other carriers, Mexican carriers must pay registration fees to each state in which they operate in the United States. The International Registration Plan was created to facilitate the payment and reduce the cost of these fees by allowing one member state to collect registration fees and distribute them to other jurisdictions as necessary. However, Mexico is not a member of the plan so Mexican companies must instead purchase individual trip permits for each state in which they travel. According to an International Registration Plan representative, since these individual trip permits cost more in the aggregate, Mexican carriers could be at a competitive disadvantage. For example, a Mexican truck traveling from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to Tulsa, Oklahoma, must purchase trip permits before traveling through Texas and Oklahoma. Table 2 depicts the costs for an International Registration Plan member and a non-member traveling through these states once a week for a year. As seen in table 2, a non- member truck would pay about $5,600 more annually than a member truck.", "According to an American Trucking Associations official, a medium-term solution for Mexican trucking companies to take advantage of the cost savings and convenience associated with the International Registration Plan would be to register in a state that is a plan member. A Mexican trucking company may participate in the International Registration Plan by selecting a member state and establishing a business presence such as a sales or service office in that state. However, establishing such a presence may entail additional costs such as federal and state taxes. When we discussed these registration fees and potential taxes with Mexican public and private officials in October 2001, they were unaware that they needed to pay them. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOT officials said they have discussed these registration fees with Mexican government officials.", "The small scale and size of Mexican trucking operations could also limit travel beyond the commercial zones. Mexico\u2019s truck fleet is relatively small compared with that of the United States, and Mexican trucking association representatives said that their members\u2019 fleets have fewer trucks than their U.S. counterparts. For example, there are nearly 600,000 trucking companies with approximately 6.3 million tractors and trailers in the United States, according to DOT. Mexico, in contrast, in 2000 had approximately 83,000 federally registered commercial cargo carriers with approximately 277,000 tractors and trailers (trucks may also be registered by Mexican states if they do not drive on federal highways). Further, the overall age of the Mexican commercial vehicle fleet may also limit the number of Mexican carriers able to operate beyond the commercial zones. According to Mexican registration data, in 2000 only 20 percent of the commercial cargo trucks registered for use on Mexican federal highways were manufactured after 1994. Mexican industry officials told us that trucks manufactured in Mexico prior to this date were not built to U.S. safety and emissions standards. Mexican carriers can apply to have older vehicles certified to be in compliance with U.S. safety standards. However, Mexican industry officials told us that these vehicles might have difficulties meeting U.S. emissions standards.", "Uncertainty about DOT\u2019s final rules for obtaining operating authority has reduced the number of Mexican carriers that will initially apply for authority to operate beyond the commercial zones, according to Mexican government and private sector representatives. According to these officials, this uncertainty makes it difficult to plan for the future since union contracts allowing travel beyond the commercial zones and distribution ties must be established in advance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Efficiency in Trucking and Border Operations Is Needed Before a Rise in Long-haul Commercial Vehicle Operations Will Occur", "paragraphs": ["Cross-border trucking beyond the commercial zones may increase as firms seek to eliminate inefficiencies associated with the current system of drayage operations. Restrictions on cross-border commercial vehicle traffic have led to a transport system that typically requires three tractors and/or trailers to carry goods from the interior of Mexico to the U.S. interior. For example, a long-haul vehicle is used to bring cargo to the Mexican border from an interior Mexican state, where it is transferred to a short-haul drayage truck that moves the goods across the U.S. border into the commercial zones. To carry a shipment beyond the commercial zones, it must be transferred to a third vehicle domiciled in the United States. This system is cumbersome and inefficient, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, trucking industry representatives, businesses, and academic researchers. For example, as we reported previously, nearly half of the containers crossing the border from Mexico into the United States in 1998 were empty because they left products or raw materials in Mexico\u2014yet still had to be processed by U.S. Customs. According to U.S. industry representatives and researchers, the time required to complete transfers within the border commercial zones hinders the \u201cjust-in-time\u201d nature of many assembly plants (maquiladoras) and agricultural industries, and can result in additional costs. They note that a single-truck transport system would be more efficient, practical, and less costly. In addition, government officials who monitor hazardous materials shipments contend that minimizing transfers and the handling of these loads would decrease the risk of dangerous accidents and spills.", "According to researchers and Mexican government officials, technological and other innovations, such as an automated clearance system requiring carriers to provide documentation electronically, would also encourage the development of cross-border trucking beyond the commercial zones by reducing the need for time-consuming paperwork reviews at the border. According to Mexican customs officials, new programs, such as the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s Business Anti-Smuggling Coalition, could encourage the growth of such cross-border trucking by reducing the time spent waiting in lines at the border."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The United States and Most U.S. Border States Are Not Prepared to Ensure That Mexican Commercial Carriers Meet U.S. Safety Standards", "paragraphs": ["DOT faces a number of challenges in implementing a coordinated truck safety system\u2014including acquiring adequate infrastructure and deploying personnel\u2014at the U.S.-Mexico border.

At the three states without permanent facilities\u2014Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico\u2014Customs typically allows state and federal truck safety inspections on the agency\u2019s property on a temporary basis; however, if capacity is reached for storing trucks placed out-of-service, inspectors are unable to conduct additional safety inspections (app. II describes the amount of space designated for truck inspection activities at southwest border ports of entry). For example, the Laredo, Texas, ports of entry handle the greatest number of northbound trucks, accounting for approximately 33 percent of all northbound commercial traffic. In Laredo, Customs has designated space for 33 trucks to be inspected or placed out-of-service, yet according to the U.S. Customs port director in Laredo, approximately 5,500 to 6,100 trucks cross at the two Laredo ports on an average day. As fig. 2 shows, spaces used by federal truck safety inspectors at the World Trade Bridge in Laredo are not covered, nor is there lighting available for inspectors to conduct safety inspections at night.", "In light of the limited amount of temporary space for truck inspection activities, FMCSA has recently begun to take steps to acquire its own space in anticipation of increasing border enforcement personnel. FMCSA submitted its space needs for border port of entry facilities to the General Services Administration (GSA) in August 2001 in an attempt to secure space at federal ports of entry. However, it is not clear when or if inspection space at these facilities can be acquired. According to a GSA official, GSA and Customs must first conduct site surveys to determine the amount of vacant space available at port of entry facilities for truck inspections. As a result of heightened security in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, Customs is reassessing its space needs at these facilities, with important implications for truck inspection activities. In discussions among FMCSA, GSA, and Customs held in October 2001, Customs said it will no longer allow trucks placed out-of-service for safety violations to remain on Customs compounds due to safety concerns related to allowing mechanics and tow truck operators on the compound.  Instead, federal and state inspectors must escort these vehicles off the facility. For example, in Texas a tow truck meets out-of-service vehicles at the Customs gate and tows them off the compound. A FMCSA official in Texas said these vehicles are rarely towed to Mexico unless they are empty. It is unclear what effect this development will have on the number and type of truck inspections that can be conducted in both the near and long term at federal ports of entry.", "As noted, only 2 of the 25 commercial ports of entry have permanent truck inspection facilities\u2014both state-operated facilities located in California.

To construct truck safety inspection facilities, DOT officials said they plan to make the following allocations based on the fiscal year 2002 DOT appropriations act: $12 million for Texas, $54 million to be divided among the four border states, and $2.3 million for federal facility improvements. Texas plans to build eight permanent truck safety inspection facilities that would be adjacent to the Customs ports of entry. The facilities would be similar in function to California\u2019s truck inspection facilities. City officials in Laredo and El Paso, however, object to the facilities being so close to the border, arguing that these facilities would interfere with the flow of commerce. Local opposition to placing truck inspection facilities at the border and constraints on state funding have impeded progress. State officials estimate that the permanent facilities will not be completed until 2004.", "In the interim, Texas has established one temporary truck inspection site in El Paso directly adjacent to a federal port of entry facility and began inspecting trucks there in July 2001. Texas also plans to establish four other temporary truck inspection sites directly adjacent to port of entry facilities in Laredo, Eagle Pass, Pharr, and Brownsville.

These databases include (1) carrier and vehicle authorizations, (2) commercial driver\u2019s licenses, (3) accidents by Mexican commercial carriers and drivers, (4) results of inspections and audits, and (5) infractions. According to TML, it began working with Mexico to construct these databases in 1995. The databases are an integral piece of Mexico\u2019s motor carrier safety information system. While important for Mexico\u2019s internal purposes, they also provide information needed by U.S. law enforcement to verify driver and carrier information. Two of the five databases were available to U.S. law enforcement in 2000 and the remaining databases were to be available in 2001.", "The first database, the Carrier and Vehicle Authorization Information System, was completed in 1998 to assist the Mexican government in issuing carrier operating authority permits, vehicle license plates, and vehicle highway permits. According to TML, as of June 2001, the database included all Mexican commercial cargo carriers registered with the federal government. According to Mexican government statistics from 2000, there are approximately 83,000 commercial cargo carriers comprising approximately 8,000 corporations and 75,000 sole-proprietorships. These carriers maintained about 372,000 vehicles of all types. U.S. federal inspectors have been able to access this database since October 2000. According to private sector officials, an estimated 75,000 other commercial trucks are registered in Mexican states and are not in this database. Mexican federal officials said that border drayage vehicles also would not be in the federal database since they do not travel on federal highways and thus are not subject to inspection by federal inspectors.", "The second database, the Licencia Federal Information System, contains Mexican federal commercial driver\u2019s licenses.  It was completed in 1999 to maintain records on commercial drivers and includes driver identification, license status, and medical certifications. According to TML, this database went on-line in January 2000, and as of December 2000, all 46 of Mexico\u2019s field offices issuing commercial driver\u2019s licenses had complete access to it. As of October 2001, 70,150, or 23 percent, of an estimated 300,000 federal commercial driver\u2019s licenses had been entered into the database. However, Mexican government officials say the database has information on 90 percent of the Mexican commercial drivers now crossing the border. Mexican government officials are entering records into this database as drivers renew their licenses and expect the database to contain all records by 2003. U.S. federal and state inspectors have been able to access this database since 2000. FMCSA policy requires that as of November 1, 2001, all Mexican commercial drivers entering the United States had to have a valid Mexican federal commercial driver\u2019s license in the database. If these drivers do not have a valid Mexican federal commercial driver\u2019s license in the database, FMCSA officials said they would be refused entry into the United States.", "The third database, the Accident Reporting Information System, was completed in 2000 and records all accidents on Mexico\u2019s federal highways. It includes an accident overview; vehicle, driver, and passenger identification; insurance information; information on damages; and other data. According to TML, phased implementation and interface with the United States were slated for completion by August 2001 but have been delayed because of the change of administrations in Mexico.", "The fourth database, the Inspections and Audits Information System, was completed in 2000 to record the results of inspections and audits of motor carriers and their facilities. It includes inspection reports, as well as information on violations, infractions, and complaints. Mexican officials told us that these compliance reviews are conducted over a 15-day period. As of June 2001, there were 222 carrier audit records and 7,273 vehicle inspection records. We were unable to obtain information on what these inspections uncovered.", "The fifth database, the Infraction Information System, was completed in 2000 to process and report infractions committed by Mexican vehicles and drivers on federal highways. Phased implementation of this database began in 2001.

However, despite a strong trading partnership and other ties, cross-border truck safety issues continue to be challenging. Mexico has taken important steps to enhance its regulatory capabilities, including developing key databases containing driver and carrier information and hiring and training inspection personnel. However, Mexico\u2019s efforts to increase regulation of its motor carrier industry are relatively new; therefore, it is too early to assess their effectiveness. The U.S. border states and DOT have been increasing the number of safety inspectors inspecting trucks entering the country from Mexico, but it is unclear where additional inspectors will work and how they will share inspection responsibilities. California has built permanent truck safety inspection facilities at two ports of entry and Arizona has work under way to construct another one. At other major crossings, however, only makeshift facilities, at best, are available, and it will be several years until permanent facilities can be built in Texas.", "Although some progress has been made, there is continued uncertainty about the extent to which Mexican commercial trucks meet U.S. safety standards. While evidence indicates that limited numbers of Mexican carriers will initially operate beyond the commercial zones, additional work is needed if DOT is to reach its goals of having commercial trucks from Mexico meet U.S. safety standards and achieve similar safety performance results. Further, there is still no coordinated operational plan for how truck safety inspection activities will be conducted or agreements with border states on how best to implement them. There is also no clear agreement on the type and size of facilities that are needed, where they will be located, when they will be finished, or whether state and/or federal inspectors will work there.

We disagree with DOT\u2019s comments that they are well advanced in their efforts to implement our recommendation as well as the many requirements contained in the appropriations act. Even prior to the act, DOT had not reached agreements with the states on how to allocate their inspectors or with other federal agencies on the space needed to conduct additional truck inspections. These are basic operational issues that have become more complex with new provisions in the appropriations act, such as the requirement for weigh in motion technologies at the 10 busiest border crossings. In addition, our concerns about DOT\u2019s readiness were seconded in comments we received from Customs officials. Customs officials noted that, as of December 2001, they and GSA were still surveying federal facilities along the border to determine where additional space for DOT truck inspections could be found. The additional space becomes more important as a result of the act\u2019s provisions for more inspectors, more inspections, and the heightened probability that more space would be needed for Mexican trucks placed out of service.
