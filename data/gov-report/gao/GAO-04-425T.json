For this review, we measured nursing home  workload as defined by average daily census, which reflects the average  number of veterans receiving nursing home care on any given day during  the course of the year. We also measured noninstitutional workload using  average daily census; however, the number of veterans receiving these  services may be less than workload because a veteran may receive more  than one service in a day. We analyzed data on nursing home workload  that VA provided to determine how workload had changed from fiscal  years 1998 through 2003. We also verified VA\u2019s nursing home workload  numbers based on contacts with officials from VA\u2019s 21 health care  networks and VA headquarters. To determine how noninstitutional long- term care workload has changed during this period, we analyzed data on  visits for six noninstitutional services which VA either provides directly or  pays for others to provide: home-based primary care, adult day health  care, homemaker/home health aide, skilled home health care, home  respite care, and home hospice care. We also interviewed VA officials at  headquarters and obtained information from the networks to better  understand the reasons for changes in nursing home workload during this  period. In doing our work, we tested the reliability of the data and  determined they were adequate for our purposes. We did our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards from  January 2003 through January 2004.", "In summary, recent trends in VA nursing home and noninstitutional  service delivery raise important questions, particularly whether access to  services is sufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing elderly veteran  population.

The workload was below the fiscal year 1998 level each year,  decreasing by as much as 8 percent below the fiscal year 1998 level in  fiscal year 2000. Fourteen of 21 networks experienced declines in nursing  home workload during this period. Moreover, VA\u2019s use of the three nursing  home settings changed over this 6-year period. First, the percentage of  workload met in state veterans\u2019 nursing homes increased from 43 to 50  percent as the number of state veterans\u2019 nursing homes receiving VA  payment increased. The percentage of workload met in state veterans\u2019  nursing homes increased in 19 of VA\u2019s 21 health care networks. Second,  the percentage of workload in VA\u2019s own nursing homes declined from 40  to 37 percent. Thirteen networks provided a smaller percentage of  workload in VA-operated homes during this period. The percentage of  workload provided in VA-operated homes declined, in part, because VA  decreased the number of long-stay patients and increased the number of  short-stay patients it treats in its own nursing homes. This is consistent  with VA\u2019s policy to give priority to post-acute patients and certain other  nursing home patients.  VA generally provides long-term nursing home  care as resources permit. Third, the percentage of workload in community  nursing homes declined from 17 to 13 percent.

(See fig. 1.)", "Over the past two decades the provision of long-term care has been  shifting away from institutions and nursing homes towards more  noninstitutional long-term care services in VA and in other programs. In  recognition of this change in approach to how long-term care is provided,  the Federal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care  recommended, in 1998, that VA update its long-term care policy by  meeting the growing demand for long-term care through significant  expansion of its capacity to provide home and community-based  services\u2014also known as noninstitutional long-term care services\u2014while  maintaining its nursing home capacity at the 1998 level.", "VA provides a continuum of noninstitutional long-term care services to  provide care to veterans needing assistance. Long-term care provided in  noninstitutional settings\u2014-including services provided in veterans\u2019 homes  and community-based services such as adult day health care centers\u2014-is  preferred by many veterans.

States design  and administer Medicaid programs that include coverage for nursing home  care and home and community-based services. Medicare primarily covers  acute care health costs and therefore limits its nursing home coverage to  short-term stays following hospitalization. Medicare also pays for home  health care. State Medicaid programs are the principal funders of nursing  home and home health care services, besides patients self-financing their  care.

Network 17 (Dallas) had the largest decrease in the percentage of  workload provided by VA-operated nursing homes, declining from 68  percent to 49 percent during this period. This resulted because the state  veterans\u2019 nursing home workload increased substantially. By contrast, the  percentage of care provided in VA-operated homes increased in 8  networks.

In Network  21 (San Francisco), the percentage of care in VA-operated nursing homes  increased by 7 percent and in the remaining 6 networks the percentage of  care in VA-operated nursing homes increased 3 percent or less.", "Our analysis of length-of stay trends in VA-operated nursing homes shows  that the decline in the number of veterans with long stays\u201490 days or  more\u2014largely explains the decline in nursing home workload during this  period. The number of long-stay veterans declined from about 14,200 in  fiscal year 1998 to about 12,700 in fiscal year 2002, the most recent year for  which data are available. At the same time the number of short-stay  veterans\u2014-those with stays of less than 90 days\u2014-increased from about  26,700 to about 32,200. However, the increase in short-stay patients was  not large enough to offset the decline in workload resulting from the  decrease in long-stay patients. This results because multiple short-stay  patients are required to generate the same workload as a single long-stay  patient. For example, a single long-stay patient in a nursing home for 12  months creates a workload of an average daily census of 1 over a year. By  contrast, 12 short-stay patients staying in a nursing home for one month  each creates the same average daily census.", "Among VA\u2019s networks, 16 had declines in the number of long-stay patients  in VA-operated homes during this period. Five networks, however, had  increases in the number of long-stay patients: Network 1 (Boston),  Network 5 (Baltimore), Network 7 (Atlanta), Network 12 (Chicago) and  Network 21 (San Francisco).", "VA officials attribute some of the changes in nursing home workload in  VA-operated facilities to an increased emphasis on short-term, post-acute  rehabilitation care. VA\u2019s policy is to provide nursing home care in its own  nursing homes as a priority to post-acute patients, patients who cannot be  adequately cared for in community nursing homes or in noninstitutional  settings, and those patients who can be cared for more efficiently in VA\u2019s  own nursing homes. In addition, VA may provide nursing home care, to the  extent resources are available, to other patients who need long-term care  for chronic disabilities. Consistent with VA\u2019s policy, the proportion of  discharged veterans whose length of stays were less than 90 days in VA- operated nursing homes increased from 74 to 81 percent from fiscal years  1998 through 2003. This is similar to lengths of stay provided in facilities  certified by Medicare\u2014-but not Medicaid\u2014-that provide post-acute skilled  nursing home care. About 81 percent of discharged patients in these  certified Medicare facilities had length of stays of less than 90 days in  fiscal year 1999.", "The percentage of workload in community nursing homes declined from  17 to 13 percent from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2003. This  decline occurred because VA reduced the number of patients served and  the number of days paid for under contract in this setting. The number of  patients in these settings declined from 28,893 to 14,032 during this  period. Some VA officials told us that in the past VA used community  nursing homes for more patients and for longer-term contracts than  currently.

Much of this growth came from  increases in skilled home health and homemaker/home health aide care\u2014 services that are most likely to help veterans prevent or delay the need for  nursing home care. One of the services that grew most rapidly was skilled  home health care which increased by 127 percent during this period.  Although noninstitutional long-term care workload increased, all veterans  may not have access to these services because there are limitations in the  availability of these services. We previously reported a number of  limitations in access to noninstitutional services that veterans experienced  in the fall of 2002. At that time some facilities did not offer some of these  noninstitutional services at all, or offered them only in certain parts of the  geographic area they served. For example, more than half of VA\u2019s 139  medical facilities did not provide home-based primary care or adult day  health care in the fall of 2002.", "The noninstitutional workload numbers for home-based primary care in  table 3 are different from those reported by VA in its appropriations  submissions to Congress and in recent VA testimony. In its reports on  noninstitutional workload, VA has measured home-based primary care  services using enrolled days\u2014-the number of days a veteran is enrolled to  receive a service\u2014-rather than the number of home-based primary care  visits a veteran receives. However, VA has measured use of the other  noninstitutional services in visits. Therefore, to ensure comparability  across services, we used visits as the workload measure for home-based  primary care. As a result, our workload total for home-based primary care  is smaller than the number VA reports because veterans do not typically  receive a home-based primary care visit for each day in which they are  enrolled in home-based primary care. Specifically, we report the 2002  home-based primary care workload as 903 while VA has reported it as  8,081.
