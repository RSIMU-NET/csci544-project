In GAO-09-455 , GAO made recommendations on FEMA's WYO compensation methodology and data quality. The Biggert-Waters Act built on these recommendations and required FEMA to develop a methodology for determining appropriate amounts WYO companies should be reimbursed. GAO was asked to review the status of FEMA efforts. This report examines, among other issues, (1) the extent to which FEMA revised compensation practices, and (2) trade-offs of potential alternatives to the WYO arrangement. GAO reviewed laws and regulations, analyzed FEMA data and data on expenses reported to NAIC for 2008\u20132014 (most recent available), and interviewed FEMA and NAIC officials, stakeholders (11 organizations with flood insurance expertise, three vendors), and 10 selected WYO companies with varying NFIP premium bases. To compare FEMA compensation with actual expenses, GAO examined information on accounting and reporting practices from a second selection of 10 WYO companies (in this case, insurers wiithin10 insurance groups) that received about 60 percent of compensation in 2008\u20132014."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has yet to revise its compensation practices for Write-Your-Own (WYO) companies to reflect actual expenses as required by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), and as GAO recommended in 2009. FEMA continues to rely on insurance industry expense information for other lines of property insurance to set compensation rates for WYO companies. Efforts by FEMA, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)\u2014which collects data by line of insurance from insurance companies\u2014and the WYO companies have resulted in some improvements to financial data on National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) expenses that WYO companies report to NAIC. But GAO found inconsistencies among how 10 selected WYO companies (which received about 60 percent of the compensation FEMA paid in 2008\u20132014) reported federal flood data to NAIC that limit the usefulness of these data for determining expenses and setting compensation rates. For example, GAO analysis showed that adjusting for inconsistencies due to unreported expenses significantly reduced WYO company profits. Consequently, without quality data on actual expenses, FEMA continues to lack the information it needs to incorporate actual flood expense data into its compensation methodology as well as determine how much profit WYO companies make and whether its compensation payments are appropriate. FEMA has not clarified what other analyses it will undertake to address GAO 2009 recommendations concerning data quality. GAO also found the ways in which WYO companies operate, including how companies compensate agents and third-party vendors (with which some companies contract to conduct some or all of the management of their NFIP policies) can affect a company's expenses and profits. Considering company characteristics would allow FEMA to more effectively develop its compensation methodology and determine the appropriate amounts to reimburse WYO companies as required by the Biggert-Waters Act.", "According to WYO companies and stakeholders, the current WYO arrangement and three potential alternatives GAO identified all involve trade-offs. Private insurers become WYO companies by signing a Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement with FEMA and FEMA annually publishes terms for participation in the WYO program, including amounts companies will be paid for expenses. The current arrangement includes benefits for consumers from competition among approximately 75 WYO companies, but poses oversight challenges for FEMA due to the large number of companies. The three potential alternatives involve FEMA contracting with (1) one or more insurance companies to sell and service flood policies; (2) one vendor that would sell policies through agents and insurance companies would not be involved; or (3) multiple vendors to service policies while maintaining the WYO network to market and sell flood policies. All three potential alternatives would involve FEMA contracting with either WYO companies or vendors as federal contractors, a status that most WYO company representatives cited as creating more regulatory burden because of federal contract requirements. Representatives of most WYO companies and several stakeholders GAO interviewed preferred the current arrangement because of its predictability and noted that this characteristic would continue to encourage WYO company participation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO maintains that its 2009 recommendations remain valid and will help FEMA meet Biggert-Waters Act requirements.

The act provided the federal  government with the authority to work with the private insurance industry,  and since its inception NFIP has largely relied on the private insurance  industry to sell and service flood policies.", "In 1983, FEMA established the WYO program with the goals of increasing  the NFIP policy base and geographic distribution, improving service to  policyholders, and providing the insurance industry with direct operating  experience with flood insurance. FEMA also sells and services flood  insurance through the DSA, which a contractor operates. Private insurers  become WYO companies by signing a Financial Assistance/Subsidy  Arrangement with FEMA under which the insurers agree to issue flood  policies in their own name, adjust flood claims, and settle and defend all  claims arising from the flood policies. Private insurers must meet  FEMA\u2019s established criteria for becoming a WYO company.  Requirements for a company to participate in the WYO program include,  among others, 5 years of experience in property and casualty insurance  lines, good standing with state insurance departments, and the ability to  meet NFIP reporting requirements to adequately sell and service flood  insurance policies.", "Each year, FEMA publishes in the Federal Register the terms for  participation in the WYO program, including amounts WYO companies  will be paid to sell and service flood policies and adjust and pay claims.  The compensation FEMA pays WYO companies is one factor it considers  in setting premium rates for flood policies. This Federal Register notice  also states that WYO companies are to comply with the provisions of  NFIP\u2019s WYO Financial Control Plan Requirements and Procedures  (Financial Control Plan).

Insurance  agents for one or more WYO companies are the main point of contact for  most policyholders seeking to purchase an NFIP policy, find information  on coverage, or file a claim. Based on information the insurance agents  submit, the WYO companies issue policies, collect premiums from  policyholders, deduct an allowance for expenses from the premium, and  remit the balance to the National Flood Insurance Fund\u2014into which  premiums are deposited and from which claims and expenses are paid.  WYO companies typically contract with flood insurance vendors to  conduct some or all of the day-to-day processing and management of  flood insurance policies.", "WYO companies work with certified flood adjusters to settle NFIP claims.  When flood losses occur, policyholders report them to their insurance  agent, who notifies the WYO company. To assess damages, the WYO  company assigns a flood adjuster, who may be independent or employed  by an insurance or adjusting company. The adjuster is responsible for  assessing damage; estimating losses; and submitting required reports,  work sheets, and photographs to the WYO company, where the claim is  reviewed and, if approved, processed for payment.

This  service-oriented compensation structure, with uniform rates generally  based on insurance industry average expense ratios (proxies) and fee  schedules, allows WYO companies to earn a profit to the degree that  compensation exceeds their actual expenses. Most of FEMA\u2019s payments  to WYO companies under the current compensation structure are not  reimbursements of actual expenses incurred, but allowances on which  the companies can either make a profit or incur a loss. Since the  inception of the WYO program, FEMA has generally used proxies to  determine the rates at which it pays WYO companies, and the payments  FEMA makes are determined by applying these proxy rates to either  premiums written or claim losses (see table 1).", "Commission and operating expenses are based on a proxy of a WYO  company\u2019s net written premiums. FEMA established a commission  expense allowance at 15 percent in 1983 after consulting with industry  representatives. This percentage has not changed since and is written  into the Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement. The percentage used  for calculating operating expenses is generally provided annually to WYO  companies as part of the compensation package (see table 1).

These are claim  expenses to adjust specific claims. FEMA determines payment for  ALAE based on information it periodically collects from independent  adjusting firms on the cost of adjusting losses in other lines of  insurance business, and presents the payment amount to WYO  companies through a fee schedule.", "Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE). These are claim  expenses that are incurred by the WYO company for routine  operations not associated with a specific claim such as salaries,  overhead, and maintenance. FEMA bases payment for ULAE on a  percentage of net written premiums and a percentage of claim losses.  Before May 2008, FEMA calculated the amount for ULAE as 3.3  percent of claim losses but changed its methodology to 1.5 percent of  claim losses plus 1 percent of net written premium, which was further  reduced to 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2013. According to FEMA\u2019s  statements in the Federal Register, the flat rate of 3.3 percent of claim  losses resulted in payments far greater than expenses during  catastrophic loss years and payments below actual expenses during  low-loss years.", "Special allocated loss adjustment expenses (SALAE). These are  claim expenses related to litigation, engineering, appraisals, other  experts, and additional claim adjustments. FEMA calculates SALAE  based on actual expenses. In March 2015, FEMA eliminated the  previous $2,500 approval threshold for SALAE expenses for experts  (Type 1) and required WYO companies to submit specific information  to FEMA, including information on the claim, policy limits, and an  explanation and justification for the reimbursement. FEMA staff must  review the information submitted and approve the expenditure before  the WYO is allowed to incur any Type 1 expenses. In July 2016,  FEMA removed the $5,000 threshold for Type 3 expenses (litigation- related) and required WYO companies to seek approval for  reimbursement of such expenses and pre-approval if they wished to  take more than three depositions in a case.", "In addition, FEMA pays WYO companies that meet certain policy growth  goals a percentage of net written premiums as a marketing bonus. In  2009, we found that FEMA\u2019s marketing goals were not aligned with  FEMA\u2019s NFIP goals. As a result, FEMA changed the formula for how  WYO companies earn bonuses in the fiscal year 2013 compensation  arrangement. A growth bonus is intended to provide an incentive for WYO  companies to continue to grow the NFIP program by adding new policies.  FEMA officials told us that the agency changed the program\u2019s growth  bonus to better link it to new business\u2014if a WYO company acquires  another company\u2019s business, the number of transferred policies is added  to the company\u2019s beginning number of policies and the total merged  number of policies is used when calculating aggregate growth for the  purposes of the bonus. Therefore, the WYO company is receiving a  growth bonus based only on new business since the number of  transferred policies is added to the existing policies in place before the  percentage of growth is calculated. This allows FEMA to recognize WYO  companies for actual growth and not for transferring policies from one  company to another. With the new formula, WYO companies can receive  a higher percentage of net written premiums as a growth bonus when the  policy growth is tied to three supporting goals for selling policies: (1) in  underserved areas, (2) for residential preferred risk policies, and (3) for  nonresidential policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Management and Oversight of WYO Companies", "paragraphs": ["Within FEMA, the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA)  manages NFIP.

According to FEMA,  this change was intended to address one issue we found during our 2009  engagement\u2013-specifically, that WYO companies were subtracting  (netting) WYO compensation from expenses. Reporting expenses net of  compensation instead of reporting expenses gross for the flood insurance  they wrote resulted in higher calculated profits.

WYO companies\u2019 financial  statements are submitted to both NAIC and state regulators.

FEMA has prepared a report showing underwriting  expenses and loss adjustment expenses grouped into various ranges,  such as negative expense ratios, \u201c0-5 percent\u201d, and \u201c5-10 percent\u201d to  assess the trend in WYO company expenses over time.", "In September 2016, FEMA officials estimated that WYO companies that  make up about 80 percent of the net written premiums reported had  adequately improved the quality of the underwriting expense data  reported to NAIC. FEMA officials also said that these companies usually  have underwriting expenses between 20 percent and 30 percent of their  net written premium or an average expense ratio of 25 percent. By using  that information as a model and excluding WYO companies with  expenses that fall outside that range, FEMA officials stated that they may  be able to use data from these companies to set future commission and  operating expense allowances for all WYO companies. However, FEMA  officials noted that the loss adjustment expense ratios varied much more  significantly from company to company than did underwriting expense  ratios. They also observed negative loss adjustment expense ratios for  some WYO companies, although they added that such ratios can occur  as a result of changes in loss reserve estimates. FEMA officials also said  that they generally found great inconsistency in how WYOs were  reporting expenses between two categories of loss adjustment expenses,  which affected their ability to assess the reasonableness of the expense  ratios of a single year, but had greater success in doing so when the  ratios were calculated based on total loss adjustment expenses for a 5- year period.", "According to an August 2016 WYO Bulletin, beginning with the fiscal year  2017 arrangement year, FEMA intends to require that WYO companies  provide to FEMA copies of all data submissions to NAIC related to their  flood insurance activities and to attest to the accuracy of those  submissions. FEMA stated in the bulletin that this requirement would be  aligned with the arrangement\u2019s specification that, upon request, WYO  companies supply FEMA with a true and correct copy of a WYO  company\u2019s property and casualty annual financial statement filed with  state insurance regulatory agencies and the arrangement\u2019s requirement  that provides access to all records of WYO companies pertinent to the  arrangement. FEMA also stated in the bulletin that this requirement will  support FEMA\u2019s efforts to pay WYO companies based on actual  expenses incurred by companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistencies in WYO Company Reporting Continue to Limit Its Usefulness in Setting Compensation Rates", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reporting Inconsistencies", "paragraphs": ["We found that WYO companies were not consistently reporting their  federal flood financial data to NAIC. The inconsistencies we found in the  data WYO companies reported to NAIC resulted in unreported  underwriting and loss adjustment expenses of varying amounts and  significance by 8 of the 10 companies we reviewed. Further, we found  that some WYO companies reported different loss and related reserves to  NAIC and FEMA.", "More than half of the companies we reviewed did not report to NAIC all of  their adjuster fees and other expenses incurred on the companies\u2019 flood  losses and provided a variety of explanations for their accounting  practices. Nearly all of the WYO companies we reviewed told us that they  reported adjuster fees as a direct expense of the flood insurance line, but  one WYO company told us that their interpretation of the NAIC rules was  that adjuster fees should be reported as an expense ceded to FEMA and,  thus, not reported as a direct expense to its flood line. Similarly, four  WYO companies told us that they did not record reimbursable legal,  engineering, appraisal, and other adjuster fees as direct expenses of their  flood lines because, among other reasons, some viewed these as  FEMA\u2019s expenses and not the company\u2019s, although this was not the  practice for the remaining companies we reviewed. Still another WYO  company told us that it reports policy or claim-specific expenses to the  flood line, but does not report indirect expenses, such as claim handling  fees paid to their vendor. Collectively, based on our analysis, these  unreported loss adjustment expenses amounted to about $14 million.  Also, some companies did not report certain related operating expenses  for their federal flood line. These expenses included fees paid to flood  vendors, premium taxes, and internal company overhead expenses that  would normally be classified as a type of underwriting expense. However,  due to the WYO companies\u2019 established practices at the time and their  interpretation of NAIC\u2019s rules, these expenses were either not allocated to  the federal flood line or were reported on the books of an affiliated  company. Collectively, based on our analysis, these unreported operating  expenses amounted to approximately $52 million. As discussed below,  these unreported expenses had a significant effect on the combined  profits of these companies.", "The inconsistencies we found in how premiums are reported to FEMA  and NAIC had little effect on individual company profit calculations. For  nearly all companies we reviewed, differences in premiums WYO  companies reported to FEMA and NAIC in 2014 were negligible (less  than plus or minus 1 percent) and had a negligible effect on reported  commission and underwriting expenses, and profit. Any differences that  existed were generally attributable to timing differences\u2014linked to a lag in  WYO companies receiving financial data from vendors that, in turn,  affected the companies\u2019 reporting to NAIC. Also, some of the differences  we identified in incurred losses reported to FEMA and NAIC were also  due to this reporting lag, but as the timing of floods and the payment of  claim losses are less predictable than premium payments, the lag in  reporting had a more significant effect on reported losses and loss  adjustment expenses. For example, we determined the effect of the lag  for one company was about 5 percent of incurred losses reported to  FEMA, whereas for another company the effect was greater than 25  percent of incurred losses.", "However, the inconsistency with the greatest effect on individual  company-reported losses was related to how certain companies  estimated incurred but not reported losses and related adjustment  expenses. Three of the WYO companies told us that the actuarial  methodology they used to develop incurred but not reported loss  estimates for NAIC reporting purposes was different than the  methodology their vendor used to develop the estimates submitted to  FEMA. Another company told us it accounted for its federal flood activity  entirely on a cash basis and did not, therefore, report any unpaid loss and  loss adjustment expense reserves to NAIC. In order to compare loss  adjustment compensation with actual expenses, we adjusted these  companies\u2019 reported expenses to remove the effect of these differences  and substituted expense estimates we developed based on the loss and  loss adjustment expense reserves the companies\u2019 vendors reported to  FEMA. Collectively, the net effect of our adjusting for these differences in  reported losses and loss reserves (some companies reported significantly  higher losses and loss reserves to FEMA than to NAIC while others  reported significantly lower estimates) was a net increase in reported loss  adjustment expenses of more than $5 million.

However, after we adjusted the reported expenses for the  effects of inconsistent reporting described previously, we estimated that  the companies earned a profit of approximately 15 percent on the flood  insurance line (see table 3).", "While an aggregate measurement of profitability for all selected WYO  companies can be calculated, this calculation is significantly influenced by  a few WYO companies that dominate the flood insurance market and  whose business model and cost structure may be different from that of  the majority of insurers that participate in the WYO program. The 2014  flood insurance profits of the companies we reviewed, after our  adjustments, ranged from approximately 2 percent to 38 percent.  Removal of the two WYO companies that represent the outliers of this  range would result in total profit of approximately 18 percent and a profit  range that still varies significantly between 7 percent and 28 percent for  the remaining eight companies. Importantly, our analysis and ability to  estimate WYO company expenses and profit were subject to certain  limitations (see app. I for details on these limitations and their potential  effects), which included limiting our analysis to 1 year (2014). In addition,  our 2014 estimates of company expenses and profit are an outcome of  our effort to understand the issues surrounding the inconsistent financial  reporting by the selected WYO companies and the various factors that  can affect company expenses and profit.

One way to understand the amount of WYO  company expenses and profits is in relation to the premiums paid by  policyholders. As noted in table 2, total compensation paid to the WYO  companies we reviewed represented approximately 35 percent of net  written premiums. That is, 35 cents of every premium dollar paid by  policyholders went toward compensation for the selected companies. As  shown in table 4, by breaking down compensation into expense and profit  components, slightly more than 5 percent of every dollar of premium  written by the 10 WYO companies went to their profit.", "As demonstrated previously, WYO company expenses and profit vary  significantly and those variances can be explained in part by the  companies\u2019 operating characteristics. For example, some WYO  companies we interviewed told us that they used independent agents and  generally paid these agents a commission higher than the 15 percent  allowance FEMA provides. Further, the companies we selected for review  had commission expenses of 17.7 percent of net written premiums on  average (see table 4). Some WYO companies attributed the higher  commission to stiff competition in writing new business or keeping current  policies in place in certain markets. Agent commissions can vary not only  from company to company, but also by volume of sales, across lines of  property and casualty insurance, and between new business and renewal  of existing policies. However, we did not determine whether agents\u2019  commissions for selling NFIP policies were affected by how insurers  compensated agents for selling other lines of property and casualty  business. Also, nearly all of the WYO companies we reviewed told us that  they pay adjusters the same amount that FEMA provides as an adjuster  fee allowance and, thus, do not earn a profit on this category of  compensation.", "The operating expense allowance, including policy growth incentive  bonuses, and the ULAE allowance are the remaining categories of  compensation on which WYO companies can earn a profit and, thus,  offset losses on agent compensation. The operating and ULAE  allowances compensate WYO companies for the expenses incurred to  operate and administer their flood lines and fulfill the companies\u2019  obligations under their agreements with FEMA, but are not directly  associated with selling specific policies or adjusting specific claims. It is in  these areas that the companies\u2019 operating characteristics and their  compensation of vendors can more directly affect the expenses they incur  and the profits they earn on the federal flood line. In addition to premium  taxes and fees, these allowances cover such insurer expenses as  salaries and benefits of company personnel, printing and postage,  advertising, equipment, training and travel, audit and legal services, and  other expenses. The expenses are incurred to fulfill company obligations,  such as to underwrite and issue policies; collect, remit, and account for  funds; submit financial and statistical reports; conduct audits and reviews;  and manage all aspects of the claims process.", "All of the WYO companies we reviewed use vendors to some extent to  operate their flood lines. Most of the WYO companies used third-party  vendors, while the others used an affiliated company to provide various  services. Many of the companies that used third-party vendors told us  that they generally outsource policy, claims, reporting, and other functions  to their vendor, although some use a vendor\u2019s systems software and  retain responsibility for underwriting policies and adjusting claims.  Vendors we interviewed said that they offer a variety of service levels that  WYO companies can choose from depending on the degree of control  they want over the underwriting and claims processes and, thus, the  customer service experience of their policyholders and agents.", "WYO companies and vendors told us vendors are paid a percentage of  gross or net written premiums and ULAE allowances and may be paid for  additional expenses incurred in providing services above what is provided  for in the base contract. Third-party vendors with whom we spoke said  that the amount WYO companies pay depends on the nature and extent  of the services provided and the volume of premiums and losses. We  were not able to obtain information from all WYO companies about how  much they pay their vendor, but from the information we were able to  obtain from some WYO companies we were able to estimate the amount  paid. We noted that the difference between what the WYO companies  paid third-party vendors varied by 2 percent or more of net written  premium. In addition, we observed that some companies paid up to twice  the amount of incurred loss ULAE compensation to their vendors as  others. Such differences in vendor compensation can affect WYO  company flood line profits. And because vendor compensation is based in  large part on FEMA\u2019s allowances or the written premiums and losses on  which those allowances are based, changes in those allowances will,  absent changes to the vendor contracts, carry through to the vendors.", "We identified expenses of approximately $80 million in aggregate that  three WYO companies paid to their affiliated vendors in 2014; this amount  represents approximately 12 percent of total adjusted expenses (see  table 3 above). Company representatives told us that the affiliated  vendors provided policy administration, claims processing, cash  management, reporting, and other services that third-party vendors  typically offer and may include additional management, financial, and  legal and regulatory services commonly performed by an insurer\u2019s  employees. Some companies told us that the fee charged was either  intended to cover only the affiliate\u2019s expenses or was equivalent to what  they would expect to pay a third-party vendor for the same services. We  did not determine the amount of intercompany profits or losses reflected  in the expenses these WYO companies reported and one company told  us that this information is not made public. Without more specific  information on the affiliated vendors\u2019 activities and intercompany profits  and losses, it would not be possible to determine how the fees charged  by these affiliated vendors compare to what a third-party vendor  otherwise would charge in an arms-length transaction. Excluding  intercompany profits and losses (or a portion thereof) from expenses  would increase or decrease, respectively, the profit shown in tables 3 and  4.", "In addition to vendor fees, some of the WYO companies whose data we  analyzed allocate internal company overhead expenses for corporate- wide support functions to their flood lines. Companies told us that they  allocate overhead expenses in accordance with the methods prescribed  by NAIC. In some cases companies told us that expenses were allocated  based on the results of cost studies for those functions that support the  federal flood line or were allocated to each line of property and casualty  business in proportion to factors such as head count, salaries, and  premiums written or earned. In the cases in which we were able to obtain  sufficient information to determine how much of the WYO companies\u2019  expenses were allocated to overhead, we observed that overhead as a  percentage of net written premium ranged from less than 1 percent to  almost 3 percent. The amount of overhead allocated to the flood line can  affect the company\u2019s profit on this line and the variances we observed  may reflect the relative significance of the federal flood line to the WYO  companies\u2019 total property business and the extent that certain activities  are performed by internal WYO company personnel versus their vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WYO Company Perspectives on Factors That Can Affect Their Expenses and Profit", "paragraphs": ["Aggregate industry average expense ratios and WYO company flood line  expenses and profit are both historical in nature and, as such, may not  fully account for current conditions and the effects that changes to the  flood program\u2019s design and requirements may have on WYO companies\u2019  expenses and profits in the future.

Some companies specifically cited as a concern the mandates imposed  by Congress and FEMA as part of recently enacted legislation (Biggert- Waters Act and the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of  2014) that the companies said imposed significant unreimbursed costs on  them. Some WYO companies also stated that additional fees,  assessments, and surcharges imposed by this legislation added to  customers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs.

The Biggert-Waters Act built on our 2009 recommendations  and required that FEMA take into account actual expenses and determine  in advance the amount of profit built into its compensation rates when  determining compensation. FEMA officials told us that the agency  began the rulemaking process in late 2014 in response to the Biggert- Waters Act requirements, but that its progress had slowed as litigation  over Hurricane Sandy claims escalated and more resources were  assigned to that issue. As of September 2016, FEMA was unable to  provide a timeline for completing its rulemaking required under section  224. One FEMA official explained that it is difficult to determine a timeline  for rulemaking since some elements of the process, such as economic  analysis and the concurrence process through FEMA and DHS, are  beyond the agency\u2019s control.

They included that the agency should determine whether data  reported to NAIC could be used to set WYO compensation rates and that  FEMA develop comprehensive analysis strategies to annually test the  quality of the data. Although FEMA has reported improvements to data  that WYO companies submit, FEMA stated that although it has compared  underwriting expense ratios to the related allowances it pays insurers, it  has not yet compared WYO companies\u2019 reported expenses to the  payments it makes to the WYO companies and determined the  companies\u2019 profits due to resource limitations. As a result, and as we  noted in 2009, FEMA does not have the information it needs to determine  whether its payments are appropriate and how much profit is included in  its compensation of the WYO companies. In addition to being helpful in  identifying potential inconsistencies in expense reporting, such a  comparison of compensation payments and actual expenses would help  FEMA to identify differences in how individual companies operate and the  related effects on company expenses and profit.

We asked stakeholders about their perspectives on any  over- or underpayment of NFIP claims and none who responded on this  issue described NFIP over- or underpayments as widespread. Some  WYO company representatives said companies do not typically consider  claim over- and underpayments a significant issue because companies or  their vendors have procedural safeguards to help ensure they pay claims  appropriately. Some WYO company representatives said over- and  underpayments of NFIP claims were caused by similar factors as over-  and underpayments in other property and casualty lines.", "According to FEMA officials, lack of documentation was the main cause  of overpayments. For example, they said overpayments could happen  when the contents of a policyholder\u2019s home were not adequately  documented or an adjuster did not correctly calculate losses (use of  actual cash value and incorrect depreciation figures). According to FEMA  officials, WYO companies generally have reimbursed FEMA for any  overpayments they identified, and the companies would request  reimbursement from the insured in cases of large or potentially fraudulent  overpayments. For example, FEMA recovered the $61,439 overpayment  from fiscal year 2014 identified in the IPIA review. The officials said that  when the DSA has identified overpayments, it also has sought to recoup  the money from the recipient insureds.", "Representatives of several WYO companies and two stakeholders said  that companies lacked incentives for underpayments and FEMA officials  said underpayments were generally small and typically resulted from  mathematical errors. Representatives from most WYO companies with  whom we spoke said that companies typically did not track  underpayments. According to FEMA officials, representatives of two WYO  companies, and two stakeholders including a vendor, some policyholders  lack an understanding of the terms of NFIP coverage. They said  policyholders sometimes expect to be made whole after a flood event, but  the NFIP standard flood insurance policy coverage is limited to direct  physical losses by or from flood, depending on the type of insured  property and the amount of coverage obtained. In a 2014 report, we  found that homeowners may not understand their insurance coverage  well enough to know what is covered, what is excluded, and what loss  events and circumstances might result in paid, partially paid, or denied  claims, and disaster events could highlight differences between  consumers\u2019 expectations for insurance and their actual coverage,  resulting in added frustrations.", "Representatives of some WYO companies and a few stakeholders said  factors related to the nature of the claims process and large loss events  contributed to over- and underpayment issues, including the following:", "Nature of the claims adjustment process. The claims adjustment  process can lead to differences across claims. Representatives of one  WYO company said that claim adjusters must make judgment calls  with respect to calculating depreciation. For example, three  experienced adjusters might calculate three slightly different estimates  for the same claim, according to representatives of another WYO  company.", "Large claims volume.

Lack of qualified adjusters after large  storms can lead to claims processing errors. Representatives of a  WYO company said public adjusters often lacked NFIP experience.  To meet immediate needs for assessing damage caused by recent  large storm events, FEMA provided a limited waiver of claim adjuster  certification. According to a stakeholder, this practice led to hiring  claim adjusters who otherwise would not have met FEMA\u2019s  qualifications. Representatives of the WYO company said  inexperienced adjusters might give claimants false hope for the  amount of claims they might receive, leading to perceptions of  underpayments. A representative from another WYO company said  adjusters learn on the job, and having a few errors was not unusual  for a complex line of business like NFIP.

In the 4 years following Hurricane Sandy, FEMA issued  several bulletins outlining processing changes for claims associated  with the loss event, which may have further complicated what some  described as already a complex process. Among these changes,  FEMA allowed WYO companies to pay claims after receiving an  adjuster\u2019s estimate but before a policyholder provided all necessary  paperwork, with the expectation that additional payouts would be  required once the losses were fully documented. FEMA issued three  extensions to the 60-day filing window for policyholders to submit  proof of loss information to their WYO insurer, extending the filing  window to 1 year, then 18 months, and finally, 24 months after the  event.", "Market fluctuations.

Among other findings, OIG found that FEMA was  unable to ensure that WYO companies were properly implementing NFIP  and unable to identify systemic problems in the program. FEMA  management acknowledged that NFIP lacked a consistent or reliable  method to identify systemic problems or recognize patterns or warning  signs. The OIG report recommended that FEMA develop and implement  procedures to evaluate the results of the oversight under the Financial  Control Plan and determine the overall effectiveness of established NFIP  internal controls.

Representatives of most WYO companies and several stakeholders with  whom we spoke preferred the current arrangement over adopting an  alternative structure for the program. Representatives of some WYO  companies said the current approach is predictable. This stability could  continue to encourage WYO participation.", "However, a few stakeholders and representatives of a few WYO  companies said costs for WYO companies had increased with recent  legislation, which could discourage WYO participation in the future. Under  the DSA contract, FEMA may direct changes within the general scope of  the contract regarding the description of services to be performed, time of  performance, and the place of performance of the services, but it must  compensate the contractor for these changes. For example, if there is a  change in law or regulation after the execution date of the contract that  affects the contractor\u2019s performance of the services, FEMA must  compensate the contractor, through an equitable adjustment, for the  changes. We discuss federal contract requirements and differences  between the DSA contract and the WYO arrangement in more detail in  appendix II. While FEMA uses proxies to compensate WYO companies, it  compensates the DSA based on a predominantly fixed-price contract (tied  to a fixed-price per policy, based on policy type). Our review of contract  modifications showed an example in which the DSA sought equitable  adjustments from FEMA for changed work caused by implementation of  the Biggert-Waters Act and the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability  Act of 2014 (HFIAA). In the modifications we reviewed, the DSA generally  was compensated for its estimated additional costs imposed by the  change if it could prove the changes affected the work under the terms of  the original contract. For example, in December 2014 FEMA equitably  adjusted the DSA contract to pay an additional $830,070 to implement the  Biggert-Waters Act and $125,531 to implement HFIAA, which repealed  and modified certain provisions of the Biggert-Waters Act. WYO  companies also were affected by these changes but representatives of  two WYO companies and a stakeholder said WYO companies were not  able to request additional compensation to recoup additional costs.", "In other comments about the current arrangement, FEMA officials and  representatives of one WYO company said FEMA oversight of vendors  that administer policies was needed.

The WYO companies would sell flood  policies, while one or more vendors would service the policies. FEMA  would solicit offers for contracts from multiple flood insurance vendors  to service flood policies. Insurance companies that wanted to sell  flood insurance would contract with one or more of the vendors to  service flood policies sold by insurance company agents. Because  FEMA would pay vendors to administer the flood policies, participating  insurance companies would not incur any operational expenses for  their flood line; rather, FEMA would pay the insurance companies a  sales bonus for performance.", "We previously reported that the three alternatives had advantages and  disadvantages in terms of the potential impact on the basic operations of  administering flood insurance policies and adjusting claims, as well as on  FEMA\u2019s oversight of the program and its contractors.

However, representatives of one WYO  company said that by not participating, these companies would lose a  competitive advantage. That is, offering flood insurance in addition to  home, life, and automobile insurance allows participating multiline  insurers to address multiple insurance needs of their customers.  Representatives of another WYO company said that WYO companies  with in-house servicing capabilities would have a competitive  advantage over other companies that use third-party vendors.", "Fewer WYO companies could or could not represent an advantage for  FEMA. Oversight might be easier than that required for the  approximately 75 WYO companies in the current arrangement as of  September 2016. Representatives of one WYO company said FEMA  could collaborate more closely with WYO companies if fewer were  involved in the program. However, one stakeholder said overseeing  federal contracts could require expanded oversight processes and  additional resources from the agency.", "Responding to large loss events could be more challenging with fewer  WYO companies. Furthermore, a change in the composition of WYO  companies could affect market penetration.

In addition, representatives of another  WYO company pointed out that no single insurer or vendor had the  infrastructure needed to deliver NFIP coverage on such a large scale.", "Similar to Alternative 1, in which FEMA would contract with one or  more insurance companies, representatives of a few WYO companies  and a stakeholder said handling a large storm event could be even  more challenging for a single entity and could have a negative effect  on the customer experience generally, and after large-loss events.", "Furthermore, according to representatives of another WYO company  and a few stakeholders, selling policies through independent agents  only, rather than through independent agents and the network of  agents affiliated with WYO companies currently in the program, could  adversely affect market penetration.", "Lastly, representatives of some WYO companies said competition  could be an issue under this option. For example, if one vendor won a  long-term contract, the companies not selected might not maintain the  ability to service the flood business, which could create a cycle in  which the same vendor has a competitive advantage and is  repeatedly selected.", "Many stakeholders generally said that Alternative 3, in which FEMA  would contract with multiple vendors (to service NFIP policies) and  maintain the WYO network (to sell NFIP policies), was the most appealing  option of the three alternatives we identified because it would involve  multiple vendors and maintain the existing WYO network (see table 12).

As discussed previously, based on  our data analysis and interviews with WYO companies, some WYO  companies pay more to agents than the 15 percent of net written  premiums that FEMA provides in compensation. Some WYO  company representatives and two stakeholders said increases in  agent commissions led to higher costs for WYO companies. Among  these stakeholders, one vendor said that FEMA should develop better  incentives for insurance agents to address this issue and increase  market penetration. For example, representatives said that FEMA  could establish agent compensation based on the percentage of  homeowners insurance policyholders that have flood insurance or  other metrics. In addition, they said FEMA could standardize agent  commissions so independent agents would focus more on selling new  policies rather than transferring NFIP policies from one WYO to  another that pays higher commission. As previously discussed, FEMA  is currently in the process of developing a new compensation  methodology through rulemaking but could not provide a timeline on  when this rulemaking would be complete.", "Provide vendor oversight. FEMA officials said it was widely  acknowledged that FEMA must address its lack of vendor oversight,  and said the agency was taking steps to determine how to address  this issue in any changes to its WYO program oversight. In July 2015,  the agency began requesting WYO companies to submit, through  their vendors when applicable, sample files demonstrating the  implementation of NFIP program changes 30 days before a program  change became effective.  While not direct oversight of vendors,  FEMA officials stated that this change was part of its efforts to better  ensure that system updates for implementing NFIP program changes  were properly implemented. As of July 2016, FEMA officials did not  identify any other plans for addressing vendor oversight.", "Other suggestions. In addition to suggestions on ways to improve  the WYO program, two WYO companies and some stakeholders  suggested other ways to improve NFIP. For example, representatives  of two WYO companies and some stakeholders suggested  encouraging private-sector participation in flood insurance (including  eliminating a noncompete clause for WYO companies from the  current arrangement, discussed later). In addition, one stakeholder  suggested making flood coverage a mandatory component of  homeowners insurance, establishing a different scale for quantifying  flood risk, expanding policy choices through NFIP or private-sector  coverage, and more closely coordinating NFIP and disaster  assistance.", "FEMA officials told us they plan to reexamine and improve the WYO  arrangement to allow for greater flexibility in the relationship between  FEMA and WYO companies.

FEMA  officials told us that the agency does not plan to make changes to the  arrangement for fiscal year 2017.", "Additionally, several stakeholders and WYO company representatives  with whom we spoke suggested other possible alternative structures for  the WYO program. These included increasing requirements for WYO  companies, removing a noncompete clause in the WYO arrangement,  and adopting the federal crop insurance program model, which shares  some similarities with NFIP but has some notable differences.", "Limiting WYO participation or increasing WYO company  requirements. Representatives of several WYO companies  suggested that maintaining the current WYO arrangement but limiting  the number of WYO companies allowed to participate was another  option. Under this option, according to WYO representatives, WYO  companies would not necessarily become federal contractors, but  would compete, in a sense, for available spots in the program. FEMA  officials said adding other requirements for WYO companies\u2014rather  than determining the number of WYO companies allowed to  participate\u2014would be another way to achieve fewer participating  companies.", "Removing noncompete clause. Three stakeholders, including two  industry groups representing insurance companies and a vendor, said  removing a noncompete clause from the arrangement (which  generally prevents WYO companies from selling private flood policies)  would encourage continued participation in the program and also  encourage greater private-sector involvement in insuring flood risk.  The noncompete clause was also cited as a potential barrier to  increased use of private flood insurance by various industry  stakeholders with whom we spoke as part of work we completed in  July 2016 on private sector involvement in flood insurance.", "Adopting crop insurance model. One stakeholder suggested the  federal crop insurance model as a possible alternative structure for  the WYO program. Similar to the agreements between FEMA and  WYO companies, companies participating in the crop insurance  program\u201417 as of September 2016\u2014have a 1-year agreement with  the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to sell and service policies.  The crop insurance agreement is not considered a contract for the  purposes of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. But unlike in the WYO  program, these companies share a percentage of the risk of loss (and  opportunity for gain), and the Department of Agriculture reinsures their  losses, a significant structural difference between the two programs.  The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation accounted for about 1.1  million policies and $9.26 billion in premiums written as of October  2016, whereas according to the most recent data available, NFIP  accounted for 5.1 million policies and about $3.4 billion in federal flood  earned premiums. Similar to the WYO arrangement, companies in  the crop insurance program receive a percentage of the premium on  policies sold to cover the administrative costs of selling and servicing  these policies. In turn, insurance companies use this money to pay  commissions to their agents who sell the policies and fees to  adjusters when claims are filed. Unlike NFIP, the Federal Crop  Insurance Corporation requires that companies submit expense  amounts on a standard form, but these amounts are not audited.

Additionally, FEMA  currently does not systematically consider actual flood expenses and  profit when establishing WYO compensation, and has yet to compare  WYO companies\u2019 actual expenses and compensation. As recommended  in 2009, FEMA should (1) determine in advance the amounts built into the  payment rates for estimated expenses and profit; (2) annually analyze  actual expenses and profit in relation to the estimated amounts used in  setting payment rates; and (3) consider the results of the analysis of  payments, actual expenses, and profit in evaluating methods for paying  WYO companies. Additionally, FEMA should (4) take actions to obtain  reasonable assurance that flood insurance expense data reported to  NAIC can be considered in setting payment rates and (5) develop data  analysis strategies to annually test the quality of flood insurance data the  companies report to NAIC. Fully addressing these recommendations will  help FEMA meet the Biggert-Waters Act requirement to develop a  methodology for determining appropriate compensation for WYO  companies that uses the companies\u2019 actual flood expenses.", "FEMA is still in the process of revising its compensation methodology.  Based on our analysis, how a WYO company operates has an effect on  its expenses and profits.

Gaining such an  understanding of the WYO companies\u2019 operations, which can contribute  to year-to-year fluctuations in expenses and profit, would allow FEMA to  more effectively revise its compensation methodology. Moreover, this  understanding, coupled with improved data on WYO company expenses,  also would facilitate any future consideration that FEMA might make of  alternative structures for the WYO program. Finally, considering that the  compensation of WYO companies is a significant part of the total  premiums policyholders pay, FEMA may seek to achieve the program\u2019s  objective of making flood insurance available at affordable rates in part by  establishing reasonable compensation rates that appropriately consider  WYO company expenses, profits, and operating characteristics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the transparency and accountability over the compensation  paid to WYO companies and set appropriate compensation rates, the  FEMA administrator should take into account WYO company  characteristics that may impact companies\u2019 expenses and profits when  developing the new compensation methodology and rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FEMA within the Department of  Homeland Security, NAIC, and FIO within the Department of the Treasury  for review and comment.", "DHS and NAIC provided technical comments, which we incorporated, as  appropriate.

We also obtained and reviewed FEMA\u2019s compensation  packages for WYO companies for fiscal years 2010\u20132016. To understand  the status of FEMA\u2019s implementation of recommendations from our 2009  report and section 224 of the Biggert-Waters Act, which built on our  recommendations, we interviewed FEMA officials on any steps the  agency had taken to improve the quality of WYO company expense data  and on its progress in implementing related Biggert-Waters Act  requirements. We also interviewed National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) officials about expense data WYO companies  report to NAIC. In addition, we interviewed the first group of 10 WYO  companies (discussed at the start of this appendix) on compensation  issues, including how expenses were incurred and reported.", "To compare FEMA compensation paid to WYO companies to actual  expense data WYO companies reported to NAIC, we obtained and  analyzed premium, loss, and compensation data for all WYO companies  for fiscal years 2008\u20132014 from FEMA and premium, loss and expense  data for all WYO companies from SNL Financial and NAIC for calendar  years 2008\u20132014.  For purposes of our analysis, we retrieved federal  flood line data reported to NAIC from SNL Financial. To make the FEMA  and NAIC data comparable, we converted FEMA\u2019s fiscal year data to a  calendar-year basis to match the period for reporting to NAIC. We also  converted FEMA reported paid losses and loss adjusted expenses to an  accrual basis to be able to appropriately compare loss adjustment  compensation and actual expenses. We then calculated estimated profit  for each WYO company as the difference between the calendar year  compensation reported to FEMA and calendar year expenses reported to  NAIC. The estimated profits, calculated using the data provided by FEMA  and NAIC data obtained from SNL Financial, did not correspond to our  expectations of profits from our 2009 work.", "To better understand WYO companies\u2019 accounting and reporting of  federal flood data, we made another (second) selection of 10 WYO  companies that comprised the majority of net written premiums (about 60  percent), paid losses (about 52 percent), and total compensation (about  60 percent) during 2008\u20132014. Specifically, we selected a  nongeneralizable, purposive sample of 10 WYO companies, selected  based on net premiums written during 2008\u20132014. We overselected WYO  companies with a larger share of the market because of their relevance in  the flood insurance market. We interviewed these WYO companies and  requested and examined additional information and data they provided.", "We used this additional information and data to evaluate the causes of  differences in reported premiums and losses and estimate the effect  those differences had on the companies\u2019 compensation and expenses.  We also used this information and data to estimate various underwriting  and loss adjustment expenses to corroborate statements the companies  made to us regarding the amount they pay their vendors and adjusters.  We analyzed the companies\u2019 commission, underwriting, and loss expense  ratios, profits as a percentage of total compensation, and reported loss  and loss adjustment expense reserves to corroborate statements the  companies made regarding changes in their accounting and reporting  practices between 2008 and 2014. Based on the additional information  and data provided and our analyses, we made adjustments to the  expenses reported to NAIC for unreported expenses, reclassifications of  expenses, and the effects of different loss adjustment expense estimates  and recalculated estimated profit (on a pre-tax basis) for these 10 WYO  companies for calendar year 2014.", "Our analysis and ability to estimate WYO company expenses and profit  were subject to a number of limitations.", "First, the adjustments we made to the companies\u2019 reported expenses  were based on information provided by the WYO companies. WYO  company representatives provided supplemental financial data and  made various representations to us, and while we reviewed the data  and representations for reasonableness in relation to other  information we had, we did not obtain all evidence necessary to fully  validate this additional information.", "Second, we initially sought information from the 10 selected WYO  companies that would allow us to compare compensation and actual  expenses and estimate profit for each company for the years 2008-\u2013 2014. However, due to challenges in obtaining sufficient information  and documentation from all companies to support their accounting  and reporting practices for each of those years and assess the  consistency of such reporting from company to company and year to  year, we limited our calculation of profit to a single year\u20142014.  Further, as our 2014 estimates of company expenses and profits are  an outcome of our effort to understand the issues surrounding the  inconsistent financial reporting by selected WYO companies and the  various factors that can affect company expenses and profit, these  estimates should not be taken to be a static or predictable indicator of  WYO company profits.", "Third, two WYO companies stated that only expenses that could be  specifically identified as flood-related, including vendor fees, were  reported to NAIC on their Insurance Expense Exhibits. One WYO  company said that overhead expenses were not allocated to the  federal flood line because this line of business was not considered as  significant relative to the company\u2019s other property insurance lines.  We did not obtain information from the companies that would allow us  to assess the significance of these unallocated overhead expenses to  our estimates of flood line profits.", "Fourth, some of the companies we reviewed use affiliated companies  as vendors to service flood policies. As information on the affiliated  companies\u2019 activities and profits was not available to us, we could not  determine the extent to which intercompany profits were reflected in  the expenses reported by these WYO companies and the extent to  which fees charged by these affiliated vendors might have exceeded  what otherwise would be charged by a third-party vendor.", "We assessed the reliability of the FEMA data by reviewing audit  documentation from prior GAO engagements; and audit documentation  from and related reports issued by the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s external auditor supporting its work on WYO program financial  data included in the department\u2019s fiscal year 2014 financial statements. In  addition, we performed electronic and manual data testing for missing  data, outliers, and other obvious errors, recalculated various types of  WYO compensation paid to WYO companies, and spoke with  knowledgeable agency officials about the data. For the NAIC data, we  reviewed related documentation and interviewed knowledgeable officials.  We assessed the reliability of the SNL Financial data by comparing it to  NAIC data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. We confirmed the  accuracy of the FEMA and NAIC data for the 10 selected companies by  requesting additional information from the companies. However, we did  not audit whether the FEMA and NAIC data were in accordance with  financial reporting standards and requirements. We determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of assessing the alignment  of compensation amounts with actual expenses and for estimating the  profits of a selection of WYO companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on Over- and Underpayments", "paragraphs": ["For our second objective, we reviewed data from FEMA documenting its  WYO company oversight processes. The data we reviewed pertain to the  triennial claims operation reviews, improper payment reviews (which the  agency conducts as required by the Improper Payments Information Act  of 2002, as amended), reinspection of claims, and biennial audits. We  assessed the reliability of the data by reviewing related FEMA  documentation on the data and interviewing knowledgeable agency  officials. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of reporting on FEMA\u2019s oversight of claims and the results of  these reviews. We also reviewed other FEMA documentation on its  oversight of the claims process (such as FEMA\u2019s Financial Control Plan  and Financial Control Plan Monitoring Procedures) to understand FEMA\u2019s  oversight processes; a recent Senate Banking Committee investigation  report; and an OIG report that discussed issues associated with over- and  underpayment of claims. We interviewed FEMA officials about the  agency\u2019s oversight of the claims process, potential causes for over- and  underpayments, and how they are resolved. We also interviewed the first  group of 10 selected WYO companies as well as stakeholders on their  views about the over- and underpayment of claims. Specifically, we  selected and interviewed 14 stakeholders representing a variety of  organization types with knowledge of flood insurance and the WYO  program. These stakeholders included three vendors with whom WYO  companies contract, and officials from 11 organizations comprised of  industry groups representing insurance companies and agents, and  academics. We interviewed officials from these entities to obtain diverse  perspectives on the possible extent and potential causes of over- and  underpayments of claims.

We  targeted our literature review to identify academic research and published  studies on flood insurance, broadly, and those that discussed alternatives  to the WYO arrangement. Our query identified around 60 document  summaries, from which we identified 19 for further analysis. Of the 19, all  provided background information on flood insurance and the NFIP  program, but none presented clear alternatives to the WYO arrangement.  From our prior work, we identified three potential alternative approaches  to the current WYO arrangement: (1) FEMA contracts with one or more  insurance companies; (2) FEMA contracts with one vendor; or (3) FEMA  contracts with multiple vendors and maintains the WYO network.", "After initial interviews with WYO company representatives and  stakeholders indicated that alternatives to the current arrangement could  decrease the number of participating WYO companies, we analyzed  FEMA NFIP policy data to understand the geographic concentration of  NFIP policies written for homeowners by WYO companies. Our analysis  looked at policy data for residential policies under the current WYO  arrangement and the geographic concentration of market share for large  and small writers of NFIP coverage and the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA)  in different states and counties. As part of the analysis, we reviewed the  proportion of residential policies written by WYO companies and the DSA  in counties by population, based on county population categories used by  the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service. For  purposes of this analysis, we considered large companies as those  among the 10 insurance groups whose members wrote the greatest  amount of NFIP coverage in 2014, the most recent year of available data  (our third group of 10 WYO companies selected). The methodology for  selecting these 10 WYO companies differed from the methodologies for  the previous two selections discussed. This third group of 10 insurers we  identified as large WYO companies accounted for an 80 percent  cumulative share of the federal flood market in 2014 (not including DSA  policies), with individual market shares ranging from approximately 2  percent to 20 percent. We considered all other insurers as small WYO  companies, with market shares ranging from 0 to 1.5 percent and a  cumulative market share of 20 percent. We tested the reliability of the  NFIP policy data by reviewing related documentation, conducting  electronic and manual data testing, and reviewing prior GAO  assessments of the data. We included only residential NFIP policies in  our analysis to focus our analysis on the market penetration related to  homeowners. In addition, we excluded from our analysis 1,506 policies  the geographic location of which could not be determined from FEMA\u2019s  data. These policies accounted for 0.03 percent of the total number of  policies in the data set. We found these data reliable for the purpose of  identifying the geographic location of policies written by WYO companies  and the DSA.", "In addition, we analyzed the proportion of NFIP residential policies written  by WYO companies and the DSA on a statewide basis for five states with  the highest total NFIP payments since 1978. Based on FEMA data as of  June 30, 2016, the five states with the highest total loss payments were  (in order of magnitude) Louisiana, Texas, New Jersey, New York, and  Florida. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing FEMA  data definitions and previous GAO assessments of the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  identifying states with the highest total NFIP loss payments.", "We also compared requirements of NFIP\u2019s WYO arrangement and  FEMA\u2019s DSA with some federal contract requirements. As previously  noted, we included several vendors among the 14 stakeholders with flood  insurance expertise we selected and interviewed to understand the trade- offs for the program being run by one vendor (the second alternative  approach we previously identified). Furthermore, we compared the  general structure of the insurance arrangement under the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Federal Crop Insurance Corporation with the WYO  arrangement, based on our prior work reviewing the crop insurance  program. We obtained perspectives from FEMA officials, representatives  of WYO companies (those selected based on net premiums written),  stakeholders with flood insurance expertise, and the Federal Insurance  Office of the Department of the Treasury on potential alternative  structures for the WYO program. We analyzed the tradeoffs of the  alternatives based on four primary factors: potential costs to participating  insurers, FEMA oversight, market penetration, and WYO company  participation. We identified these four factors based on our prior work  evaluating these arrangements and initial interviews with industry  participants. We also obtained their perspectives on other possible  improvements to NFIP.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to December 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

In the WYO  program, private insurers sell and service flood insurance policies and  adjust claims for NFIP under an arrangement with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA). In general, executive agencies must award  contracts using full and open competition. In addition, contracts generally  must include certain clauses related to contract administration, such as  those that provide the government the ability to terminate contracts, as  well as those required by statute and executive orders that implement  U.S. policy.", "The following analysis discusses requirements that generally apply to  contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and how they  compare to the WYO arrangement and FEMA\u2019s contract with the Direct  Servicing Agent (DSA). The DSA is a FEMA contractor that writes NFIP  policies and provides an alternative when a WYO company is unable or  unwilling to write a flood insurance policy. The analysis also includes the  views of WYO companies about changing the WYO program  arrangement to a contract subject to the FAR.", "Open competition. Executive agencies generally must seek to obtain  \u201cfull and open competition\u201d in the contract award process (subject to  exception). This means that all responsible sources are permitted to  compete. The DSA selection process includes full and open  competition, but insurance companies do not compete to participate in  the WYO program. Instead, companies must apply to participate, and  FEMA approves the participation of companies that meet certain  criteria, rather than selecting companies based on their bids for a  contract. Requirements for a company to participate in the WYO  program include their experience in property and casualty insurance  lines, good standing with state insurance departments, and ability to  meet NFIP reporting requirements to adequately sell and service flood  insurance policies. FEMA officials told us that the agency does not  track how many companies failed to gain approval to participate in the  program, but noted that many companies failed to obtain approval  because they did not meet the requirement for having 5 years of  experience as a property and casualty insurer.", "Bid protests and dispute processes. Federal acquisition regulations  and statutes provide for bid protests\u2014where interested parties can,  for example, protest the award of a contract (e.g., if company A wins  the contract, company B can challenge the award). In addition, federal  acquisition statutes and regulations provide procedures and  requirements for resolving claims and disputes that arise during  contract performance. DSA contract awards can be thus protested.  The current WYO arrangement does not include a process to protest  FEMA\u2019s selection of WYO companies, but if any misunderstanding or  dispute arises between a WYO and FEMA about any factual issue  under the arrangement or in relation to FEMA\u2019s nonrenewal of a WYO  company\u2019s participation in the program, the company can submit the  dispute to arbitration.", "Government as a party to a contract. Federal contracts generally  provide an agency the right to unilaterally terminate the contract\u2014 either for the convenience of the government or for the default of the  contractor. Under a termination for convenience, the government can  completely or partially terminate the work under a contract when it is  in the government\u2019s interest. Agencies generally can make certain  unilateral modifications to a contract during performance as long as  those changes fall within the contract\u2019s scope. The DSA contract  allows the Department of Homeland Security to terminate the contract  if it would be in the best interest of the government in the event that a  contractor discovers a conflict of interest, or in the event a contractor  intentionally did not disclose a conflict of interest. In contrast, the  WYO arrangement does not explicitly provide agency control over  termination, but in the event that a company is unable or otherwise  fails to carry out its obligations under the arrangement, the company  must transfer the NFIP policies it issued to FEMA or propose that  another WYO company assume responsibility for those policies.", "Contract type and contractor costs. Depending on the contract  type, the government may or may not have insight into contractor  costs. For example, a cost reimbursement type contract\u2014where the  government pays for allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed  in the contract\u2014can only be used if the contractor\u2019s accounting  system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.  For fixed-price-type contracts, where full responsibility for all costs is  placed on the contractor, the government would not have visibility into  contract costs. For example, the DSA has a hybrid firm-fixed-price  and time-and-materials contract with FEMA with a 1-year base period  and 4 one-year option terms. FEMA pays a fixed price per policy on a  monthly basis based on the type and number of policies the company  services (standard, group flood, and severe repetitive loss), as long as  the company meets the performance requirements included in the  contract. FEMA also pays the DSA for line items based on the  amount of time and materials the company spends on certification and  accreditation activities. The contract allows the contractor to recoup  cost increases stemming from changes to the contract. For example,  the DSA sought and obtained a series of payments from FEMA for  extra work the contractor conducted as part of implementing the  Biggert-Waters Act and the Homeowner Flood Insurance and  Affordability Act. As discussed in more detail in the report, the WYO  arrangement does not prescribe detailed cost and pricing guidance to  companies but generally compensates WYO companies using proxies  to determine rates at which it pays them. For example, the  arrangement provides that WYO companies may retain 15 percent of  net written premiums as the allowance for insurance agent  commissions.", "Ethical practices and statutory compliance. Depending on the type  of contract, there are also a variety of requirements imposed under  statutes and executive orders that can have major effects on business  practices. These include provisions related to bribery, false claims,  false statements, conflicts of interest, and kickbacks; lobbying  restrictions; equal opportunity and affirmative action requirements;  subcontracting and sourcing; small business and veteran  participation; and compliance with labor standards and drug-free  workplace requirements. For example, the DSA contract requires the  company to use Department of Labor wage determinations and  outlines the types of benefits employees must receive, including  health and welfare benefits, paid vacation, and paid holidays. The  current WYO arrangement does not speak to all of the factors outlined  above, but provides that a WYO shall not discriminate against any  applicant for insurance because of race, color, religion, sex, age,  handicap, marital status, or national origin.", "Representatives of seven of 10 WYO companies we interviewed (for all  three objectives, as described in app. I) opposed WYO companies  becoming federal contractors, citing burdensome requirements. Of the  other three, one said the costs of becoming a federal contractor would  depend on the structure of the contract, and the other two did not  comment. Representatives of one WYO company said a positive aspect  of having a contract is that it could provide a mechanism for establishing  an annual maximum to FEMA\u2019s possible changes to the contract for NFIP  regulatory changes. This could allow WYO companies or vendors to  recoup some costs of implementing unexpected changes to the program.  The DSA contractor has the ability to recoup the expenses it incurs in  response to changes, for example to law or regulation, which affect its  performance of the services under the contract.", "FEMA officials said WYO companies historically had opposed structuring  the WYO program as a federal contractual relationship between FEMA  and WYO companies since the WYO program was established and said a  federal contract might not be compatible with the structure of the  insurance industry and how WYO companies deliver coverage. In  addition, they said that as a federal contractor, a WYO company or  vendor would need to convert its information technology systems to  accommodate new federal security requirements, which would be time  consuming and costly.", "Stakeholders who commented about the use of a federal contract for the  WYO program had mixed perspectives. We selected and interviewed 14  stakeholders with flood insurance expertise, based on their knowledge of  flood insurance and the WYO program. One stakeholder said FEMA\u2019s  oversight might improve because the agency would have more authority  to direct how WYO companies administered claims. One stakeholder\u2014a  vendor\u2014said that although the current arrangement is not a federal  contract, it can feel like a contractual agreement for WYO companies  because the financial control plan outlines requirements for participating  companies. Another stakeholder said that use of a federal contract for the  WYO program could create more stringent requirements for WYO  companies and could lead to declines in their participation and NFIP  market penetration, and result in the DSA having to administer more  policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Geographic Concentration of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Residential Policies Written by Write-Your- Own (WYO) Companies", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of three potential alternatives to the current WYO  arrangement found that each alternative could decrease the number of  participating WYO companies.
