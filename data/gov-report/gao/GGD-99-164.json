Congress also authorized the sharing of taxpayer information with child support programs to assist with enforcement, such as locating individuals owing child support. In 1984, Congress authorized IRS to share data to support federal and state administration of other programs, such as Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Medicaid, to assist in verifying eligibility and benefits.", "Disclosures of federal taxpayer information to an agency are restricted to the agency\u2019s justified need for and use of such information.

To meet our objective, we met with officials in IRS\u2019 Office of Governmental Liaison and Disclosure, Office of Safeguards, and select IRS District Disclosure Offices. We also reviewed IRS documentation of reports submitted by federal, state, and local agencies on the safeguard procedures used to protect taxpayer information. In addition, we reviewed IRS reports of its monitoring efforts at these agencies.", "IRS provided us with lists of federal, state, and local agencies that had received taxpayer information during 1997 or 1998. We surveyed the agencies, asking them under what authority they received taxpayer information, how they received it, what they used the information for, and whether there were alternate sources of data they could use in lieu of taxpayer information. We also asked them about IRS\u2019 monitoring efforts and to identify any safeguard deficiencies that have been noted during recent internal or external reviews. Copies of our questionnaires are reproduced in appendix IX.", "We surveyed all of the federal agencies in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area that IRS identified as having received taxpayer information. The response rate was 100 percent from these agencies. In some cases, we sent a questionnaire to more than one contact for a particular agency. For example, for the Department of Labor, IRS identified four separate components as receiving taxpayer information. Thus, IRS gave us the names of four separate contact persons at Labor. We mailed our questionnaire to 50 agency contact persons. In our cover letter, we encouraged them to distribute copies of the questionnaire to all other entities within the agency that received taxpayer information from IRS and asked that an appropriate representative from those units return a completed questionnaire.", "Several agencies that had only one contact person listed by IRS returned multiple questionnaires from different units within their agencies that use taxpayer information. For example, the Department of Transportation had only one contact person to whom we mailed our questionnaire, but staff in the Department completed and returned 10 questionnaires. In total, we received 98 questionnaires from the 50 agency contacts from whom we requested information.", "From the list IRS provided of 215 state and local entities that had received taxpayer information, we drew a simple random probability sample of 35 entities. Each entity on the IRS list had an equal, nonzero probability of being included in the sample. Our sample, then, is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn because we followed a probability procedure based on random selection. Each sample could have provided different estimates; thus, we can express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95-percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95- percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true values in the study population.", "We mailed questionnaires to the contact persons at each of the selected entities.

Agencies may also receive taxpayer data for use during a criminal investigation, to apprise appropriate officials of criminal activities or emergency circumstances, or to assist in locating fugitives from justice.", "One of the most common reasons why agencies said they received taxpayer information was their participation in the tax refund offset program.  Pursuant to the IRC, agencies submitted qualifying debts, such as student loans or child support payments, for collection by offsetting the debt against the taxpayer\u2019s refund.  Seventy-five percent of the federal agencies and 15 percent of the state and local agencies in our sample indicated that they received taxpayer information for this purpose.", "Effective January 1, 1999, tax refund offset procedures for collecting qualifying debts were modified. The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service was given the responsibility for the Federal Refund Offset Program, which was merged into the centralized administrative offset program known as the Treasury Offset Program. This program commingles tax refund information with other federal financial information (e.g., benefit payments, pensions). If a match is found when an individual has an outstanding debt and is receiving federal money in any form (e.g., tax refund, pension, or vendor payments), the individual is notified that his federal money can be withheld to pay off the debt. The source or sources of any money withheld is not revealed to the agencies, but simply the fact that an offset has been made. This information, then, is no longer identifiable as tax refund information; thus, it is no longer considered taxpayer information.", "Because of this change to the offset program, several agencies we surveyed indicated that they no longer needed taxpayer information. Thirty-four percent of the federal and 3 percent of the state and local agencies in our sample indicated that they are participating in the Treasury Offset Program and that they will no longer need to receive taxpayer information from IRS.", "We asked the agencies we surveyed to indicate how they use taxpayer information. We grouped their responses into the following categories: administering debt collection or offset program; administering tax laws; determining eligibility for welfare and public assistance programs; enforcing child support programs; conducting criminal investigations; and other purposes, such as statistical and economic research, auditing government programs, or storage of tax returns.", "Table 5 shows how the agencies we surveyed responded to our query about how they used the taxpayer information they received in 1997 or 1998.

Agencies are expected to submit a new SPR every 6 years or whenever significant changes occur to their safeguard program.", "IRS has taken steps to withhold taxpayer information from agencies if their SPRs did not fulfill the requirements set forth in IRC section 6103. Shown below are some recent examples of IRS notifying agencies that they would not be able to get taxpayer information because their SPRs were incomplete.", "In April 1999, IRS\u2019 Office of Safeguards notified the Arizona Department of Economic Security that, since IRS had not received an acceptable SPR, it was recommending to IRS\u2019 Office of FedState Relations that federal taxpayer information be withheld until the agency complied with the safeguarding requirements outlined in IRC section 6103.

Moreover, the SAR is to summarize the agency\u2019s current efforts to ensure confidentiality and certify that the agency is protecting taxpayer information pursuant to IRC section 6103(p)(4) and the agency\u2019s own security requirements.", "In addition to the SPRs and annual SARs that are sent to IRS, agencies\u2019 OIGs may also review agency programs for safeguarding taxpayer information.

The OIG found that a large percentage of sampled cases did not have certain required documentation on file and, consequently, should not have been referred for income matching and verification.", "Before we notified IRS about the VA OIG report, neither Treasury nor IRS was aware of the report or its findings. After meeting with IRS to discuss the OIG findings, VA agreed to work with IRS on corrective actions.

Discrepancies found by IRS during the safeguard reviews generally were procedural deficiencies and did not result in known unauthorized disclosures of taxpayer information. In their responses to the discrepancies found and recommendations made by IRS, agencies indicated that they would institute corrective actions.

In its Report on Procedures and Safeguards Established and Utilized by Agencies for the Period January 1 through December 31, 1998, IRS highlighted this problem to Congress. IRS found agencies using contractor personnel in setting up agency computer systems in a manner that permitted the contractors to see taxpayer information. IRS also found agencies using contractor personnel in the disposal of taxpayer information, without having agency personnel observe the process to ensure that contractor personnel did not \u201caccess\u201d the information.

Under IRC section 6103(p)(2), in conjunction with section 6l03(l)(6), IRS has authorized SSA to make disclosures to the Office of Child Support Enforcement, a federal agency that oversees child support enforcement at the federal level and acts as a coordinator for most programs involved with child support enforcement. 6103(l)(7)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made to federal, state, and local agencies administering certain benefits programs for the purposes of determining eligibility for, or correct amount of, benefits under such programs. Section 6103(l)(7) states that SSA will provide its return information  to other agencies to assist them with specific welfare programs. The states (and other authorized agencies) provide the names and Social Security numbers of welfare applicants or recipients, and SSA provides the authorized information, such as wages and self-employment (net earnings) and retirement income. This disclosure between SSA and the other agencies is called the Beneficiary and Earnings Data Exchange Program. A similar program, the 1099 Program, involves the disclosure of unearned income information between IRS and federal, state, and local agencies administering these programs. 6103(l)(8)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made by SSA to other state and local child support enforcement agencies for the same purposes as 6103(l)(6).6103(l)(9)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made to state administrators of state alcohol laws for use in the administration of such laws. The disclosure is limited to information on alcohol fuel producers only. 6103(l)(10)\u2013Disclosures of specific taxpayer information relating to tax refund offsets can be made to the agency requesting such offsets in order to collect specified debts, such as student loans or child support payments. This disclosure between IRS and other agencies was known as the Tax Refund Offset Program. This program is currently undergoing a \u201ctransition.\u201d In the past, agencies received pre-offset debtor addresses, debtor identity information, the filing status (if joint), and any payment amount to the spouse of a joint return from IRS. Effective January 1, 1999, Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service assumed complete responsibility for the Treasury Offset Program. Except in the case of tax refund offsets to collect child support debts, agencies are now receiving offset information under the Treasury Offset Program procedures. Tax refund offset will, in general, be blended, or amalgamated, with other Treasury \u201coffsets,\u201d such as salary offsets. FMS is to perform the blending and tax information is not to be identified beyond FMS, except for agencies involved in collecting child support debts. When tax refund offset information is blended and unidentifiable under the Treasury Offset Program procedures, it is no longer considered return information and section 6103(p)(4) safeguarding procedures are not required. 6103(l)(11)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made by SSA to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for the purpose of administering the federal employees\u2019 retirement system (chs. 83 and 84 of title 5, U.S.C.). The common name for this disclosure between SSA and OPM is the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Program. It involves a computer match where OPM provides the names and Social Security numbers of federal employees participating in the federal retirement system and SSA provides the wages, self-employment earnings, and retirement income information obtained under IRC sections 6103(l)(1) and (l)(5). 6103(l)(12)\u2013Taxpayer information can be disclosed by IRS to SSA and by SSA to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to administer the Medicare program. The common name for this type of disclosure is the Medicare Secondary Payer Project. The purpose of this disclosure is to identify the employment status of Medicare beneficiaries to determine if medical care is covered by group health plans. It permits IRS to provide SSA with identity information, filing and marital status, and spouse\u2019s name and Social Security number for specific years for any Medicare beneficiary identified by SSA. It also permits SSA to disclose to HCFA the names and Social Security numbers of Medicare beneficiaries receiving wages above a specified amount. Additionally, it permits HCFA to disclose certain return information to qualified employers and group health plans. 6103(1)(13)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made to the Department of Education to administer the \u201cDirect Student Loans\u201d program.6103(l)(14)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made to U.S. Customs to audit evaluations of imports and exports, and to take other actions to recover any loss of revenue or collection of duties, taxes, and fees determined to be due and owed as a result of such audits. 6103(1)(16)\u2013Disclosures of taxpayer information can be made by SSA to officers or employees of the Department of the Treasury, a trustee or any designated officer, employee, or actuary of a trustee (as defined in the D.C.
