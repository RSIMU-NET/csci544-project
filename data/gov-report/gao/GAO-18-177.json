However, they have not approved any solutions to address these risks. Compared with other tracking technology, ADS-B Out provides more information, such as an aircraft's precise location, velocity, and airframe dimensions, and better enables real-time and historical flight tracking. Individuals\u2014including adversaries\u2014could track military aircraft equipped with ADS-B Out technology, presenting risks to physical security and operations. This readily available public information allowed GAO to track various kinds of military aircraft. ADS-B Out is also vulnerable to electronic warfare and cyber-attacks. Since FAA is planning to divest radars as part of ADS-B implementation, homeland defense could also be at risk, since the North American Aerospace Defense Command relies on information from FAA radars to monitor air traffic. DOD and FAA have drafted a memorandum of agreement that focuses on equipping aircraft with ADS-B Out but does not address specific security risks. Unless DOD and FAA focus on these risks and approve one or more solutions in a timely manner, they may not have time to plan and execute actions that may be needed before January 1, 2020\u2014when all aircraft are required to be equipped with ADS-B Out technology.", "Of the eight tasks associated with the implementation of ADS-B Out technology in the 2007 DOD NextGen memorandum\u2014issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to ensure that the NextGen vision for the future national airspace system met DOD's requirements and the appropriate management of DOD's resources\u2014DOD has implemented two, has partially implemented four, and has not implemented two.

The North American Aerospace Defense  Command (NORAD) and DOD have also expressed concerns about the  FAA\u2019s plan to decommission FAA legacy radar systems on which NORAD  relies to conduct aerospace warning and aerospace control missions, and  on which DOD relies to conduct its air traffic missions. In addition, a  number of assessments conducted by DOD, FAA, and others have  identified security concerns inherent in ADS-B Out technology that could  leave aircraft, tactical air traffic control systems, and FAA radars  vulnerable to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks by individuals, groups,  or nation-state actors (hereinafter referred to as \u201cadversaries\u201d) and other  types of interference.

These documents address ADS-B implementation, acquisition,  operations, cybersecurity, risk management and mitigation, and any other  issues that may be pertinent to identifying and addressing operations and  security risks resulting from ADS-B. We also reviewed publicly available  literature discussing potential ADS-B cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We  interviewed officials from NORAD, DOD, and FAA about potential risks,  vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. We also reviewed classified  intelligence reports that assessed the vulnerabilities of ADS-B technology.  While military aircraft and existing radar systems may be equipped with  other devices (such as Mode S transponders) that could also pose  security risks, this report focused primarily on risks and potential solutions  associated with ADS-B Out technology that FAA mandated DOD to install  on its aircraft by January 1, 2020. To understand DOD and FAA  coordination, we reviewed laws, guidance, and directives related to  agency cooperation for the NextGen system and implementation of ADS- B technology.

This effort is a multi-year, incrementally  iterative transformation that will introduce new technologies and leverage  existing technologies to affect every part of the national airspace system.  These new technologies will use an Internet Protocol-based network to  communicate. NextGen consists of components that provide digital  communications between controllers and pilots, and that also use  satellite-based surveillance to aid in airspace navigation. Because of  these new communication methods, NextGen increases reliance on  integrated information systems and distribution of information, digital  communication methods, and global positioning system (GPS) technology  that may put the air traffic control system at greater risk for intentional or  unintentional information-system failures and breaches. We have  previously reported on progress that FAA has made in implementing  NextGen. For example, in 2015 we found that FAA faces cybersecurity  challenges in at least three areas: (1) protecting air-traffic control  information systems, (2) protecting aircraft avionics used to operate and  guide aircraft, and (3) clarifying cybersecurity roles and responsibilities  among multiple FAA offices.

For example, FAA maintains two layers of radar\u2014primary  surveillance radar and secondary surveillance radar\u2014to track and identify  aircraft flying in the national airspace system. Primary surveillance radar  identifies the location of aircraft flying in the national airspace by  transmitting a signal and calculating the amount of time that passes until  that signal bounces off the aircraft and returns to the radar. FAA also  uses secondary surveillance radar that transmits an interrogation signal to  aircraft flying in the national airspace. A receiver on the aircraft receives  the interrogation signal and then transmits a broadcast back to this radar  with flight information. Table 1 shows the evolution and capabilities of  different transponders that broadcast aircraft information to receivers.  The fields identified in the table are critical for identifying and tracking  aircraft. Of the different transponder modes and technology, ADS-B Out  provides the most precise and comprehensive data. ADS-B Out makes it  easier for third parties to identify and track aircraft, as ADS-B Out  broadcasts include registration number, precise location, aircraft  dimensions, and other information. This additional information reduces  the need to identify aircraft using private databases and to determine  aircraft location by comparing time difference of arrival among receivers.", "The content of these aircraft broadcasts varies depending on the type of  transmitter providing the information from the aircraft. For example, earlier  broadcast systems, including the Mode 3/A and Mode C systems,  transmit a temporary four-digit transmit code (commonly referred to as a  squawk code) assigned by air traffic control that facilitates aircraft tracking  during a single flight. Since FAA was the sole source of flight data for  systems preceding Mode S, the agency could filter out military aircraft  flight information for security reasons before providing information to the  public about other aircraft flying in the national airspace."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mode S Transponder", "paragraphs": ["Mode S transponders provide more information than do the Mode 3/A and  Mode C transponders. For example, the Mode S transponder broadcast  identifies an aircraft-specific, 24-bit fixed address (commonly known as  the ICAO address) assigned under International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) standards. An aircraft retains this fixed address  based on its registration, and thereby facilitates aircraft identification until  the aircraft is reregistered and receives a new ICAO address.", "FAA and aviation groups have reported that with the proliferation of  commercial and amateur receivers, the public can now track individual  aircraft by receiving the aircraft\u2019s ICAO address, squawk code, and  altitude. In addition, these entities have reported that since aviation  groups and hobbyists have connected the receivers, the networked  receivers can calculate and identify the latitude and longitude of the  aircraft they are tracking. In addition, according to these reports, some  groups maintain aircraft information databases and receiver networks that  can identify aircraft by ICAO address and can locate aircraft by comparing  the time difference of arrival of Mode S signals between three or more  receivers. Using data derived from this work, interested parties\u2014 including adversaries (for example, foreign intelligence entities, terrorists,  and criminals)\u2014can identify military aircraft by type and registration  number, and can track the aircraft while in flight through Mode S fixed  address broadcasts.

These precise data provide air traffic  controllers and pilots with more accurate information to keep aircraft  safely separated in the national airspace. This technology combines  aircraft avionics, a positioning capability, and ground infrastructure to  enable accurate transmission of information from aircraft to the air traffic  control system. This technology periodically transmits information without  a pilot or operator involved (that is, Automatic); collects information from  GPS or other suitable navigation systems (that is, Dependent); provides a  method of determining 3-dimensional position and identification of aircraft,  vehicles, or other assets (that is, Surveillance); and transmits the  information available to anyone with the appropriate receiving equipment  (that is, Broadcast).

Such sensitive missions could  include low-observable surveillance, combat air patrol, counter-drug,  counter-terrorism, and key personnel transport. While some military  aircraft are currently equipped with Mode S transponders that provide  individuals who have tracking technology the altitude of the aircraft, ADS- B poses an increased risk.

The additional information provided through  ADS-B technology\u2014 including the aircraft\u2019s precise location, velocity,  and airframe dimensions\u2014increases both direct physical risks to DOD  aircraft, personnel, and equipment, and long-term risks to DOD air  operations.", "Accessibility of information. ADS-B technology also introduces  risks to aircraft, personnel, equipment, and operations, because it  provides information to the public that was not previously accessible.  FAA filters information about DOD\u2019s flights so that the information is  not available to the public via any FAA data feed. According to FAA  officials, this filtering was effective for protecting such information for  Mode-S equipped DOD aircraft until the 2012 timeframe, when the  capability of third-party networked receivers started to allow position  determination for such aircraft. With ADS-B, aircraft location and other  information is broadcast from the aircraft, where FAA cannot filter it.  While individuals and groups could obtain additional information about  DOD flights operating with Mode S, such as an aircraft\u2019s fixed  address, information such as geographic location and velocity was not  included in broadcasts. Individuals could estimate location and  velocity of DOD flights by locating the signal through privately owned  receiver networks.

As a stand-alone method, jamming could create  problems within the national airspace. Jamming can also be used to  initiate a cyber-attack on aircraft or ADS-B systems. According to the  article in the 2015 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  publication, adversaries could use a cyber-attack to inject false ADS-B  messages (that is, create \u201cghost\u201d aircraft on the ground or air); delete  ADS-B messages (that is, make an aircraft disappear from the air traffic  controller screens); and modify messages (that is, change the reported  path of the aircraft).

Both FAA and  DOD have identified a potential solution to address this vulnerability.  However, this solution has not been tested and as of November 2017, no  testing has been scheduled.", "In addition to electronic warfare- and cyber-attacks, both NORAD and  DOD officials expressed concerns that the air defense and military air  traffic control missions would be affected if FAA were to divest secondary- surveillance radars following ADS-B implementation. According to DOD  and FAA documents and officials, FAA has identified ADS-B  implementation as an opportunity to save costs by divesting a number of  secondary-surveillance radars.

According to  NORAD officials, the command would incur a significant burden to  finalize memorandums of agreement with more than 600 air traffic  control facilities and ensure commonality with all facilities in the  continental United States and Alaska. Furthermore, NORAD officials  stated that these missions should not be limited by local restrictions  created by the ADS-B Out rule.

In April 2017 officials  from DOD Lead Service Office told us that they expected DOD and FAA  to finalize the memorandum of agreement by June 2017; however, in May  2017 DOD officials informed us that the estimated completion date had  slipped to February 2018.", "A significant amount of work will likely need to be accomplished between  the eventual approval of the memorandum and implementation in a timely  manner. For example, FAA officials acknowledged that the agency would  need to issue, update, or both issue and update internal guidance once  the memorandum is signed prior to local FAA officials being able to  negotiate and agree to arrangements with local military commanders.  Similarly, the draft memorandum, if approved, would place a significant  burden on local DOD entities to negotiate agreements. For example, the  Army expressed concerns that local negotiations\u2014at 76 locations,  according to Army estimates\u2014would take from 1 to 2 years to complete  after FAA and DOD have signed the memorandum of agreement. Army  officials also highlight concerns that local FAA air traffic controllers may  not enter into agreements with Army units, or that local agreements will  be contingent upon the density of local air traffic or the personalities of  those negotiating the agreements. Additionally, assuming that actions are  agreed upon among the key stakeholders\u2014DOD, FAA, and NORAD\u2014to  resolve or mitigate the identified security risks, DOD, FAA and NORAD  will need sufficient time to implement these actions.

These include physical, cyber- attack, and electronic warfare security risks, as well as risks associated  with divesting secondary-surveillance radars. Furthermore, unless FAA  and DOD focus on the security risks of ADS-B and approve one or more  solutions in a timely fashion, they may not have time to plan for and  execute any technical, programmatic, or policy actions that may be  necessary before all of DOD\u2019s aircraft are required to be equipped with  ADS-B technology on January 1, 2020."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Achieved Mixed Implementation of Key ADS-B Tasks Directed in 2007", "paragraphs": ["Of the eight tasks associated with the implementation of ADS-B Out  technology in the 2007 DOD NextGen memorandum\u2014issued by the  Deputy Secretary of Defense to ensure that the NextGen vision for the  future national airspace system met DOD\u2019s requirements and the  appropriate management of DOD\u2019s resources\u2014DOD has implemented  two, has partially implemented four, and has not implemented two.
