The disaster raised questions about the threats that natural hazards, such as earthquakes and floods, may pose to U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors. NRC licenses and regulates U.S. nuclear power reactors. NRC criteria for licensees to assess natural hazards were developed using an approach that required reactors to be designed according to a set of potential accidents using deterministic analysis. Since the 1990s, NRC has been encouraging the use of PRA as part of a risk-informed, performance-based approach.", "GAO was asked to (1) determine the extent to which PRA is applied to natural hazards at operating U.S. reactors and (2) describe expert views on and suggested changes, if any, to NRC processes for assessing natural hazards at such reactors.

Subsequent to most of these initial licenses being issued, NRC, through policy statements and other documents, has endorsed PRA\u2014a systematic method for assessing what can go wrong, its likelihood, and its consequences, resulting in quantitative estimates of risk\u2014as a means to enhance and extend traditional deterministic analysis. In 1991, NRC requested that licensees voluntarily examine their reactors\u2019 vulnerability to natural hazards and suggested PRA as one of several possible methods for licensees to use in their examinations. However, most licensees opted to use other methods. According to NRC officials and nuclear power industry representatives\u2014and reflected in data GAO obtained from five licensees that together operate 25 reactors\u2014few licensees are likely to have developed or updated since the 1990s PRAs that address natural hazards. NRC would have to conduct an analysis to determine whether or not to require licensees to develop PRAs that address natural hazards.

Several experts said they believe NRC processes are generally adequate for assessing the threats that natural hazards pose to operating reactors. However, more than half of the experts GAO interviewed suggested expanding the use of PRA for assessing natural hazards as a complement to traditional deterministic analyses to provide a more robust approach. Those experts cited a number of advantages to doing so, including that PRA can help identify vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked by relying on traditional deterministic analyses alone. Several experts also identified challenges to expanding the use of PRA for assessing natural hazards, including the limited number of experts qualified to develop PRAs and the costs of doing so."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NRC analyze whether licensees of operating reactors should be required to develop PRAs that address natural hazards.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered  extensive damage when a tsunami wave that exceeded the plant\u2019s  seawall flooded the site and caused a prolonged loss of electrical power  at several of its reactors. As a result of the loss of power, plant operators  were unable to keep three of the reactors cool, which led to fuel melting,  hydrogen explosions, and the release of radioactive material into the  environment. The disaster displaced tens of thousands of residents and  contaminated the surrounding area. The Japanese government expects  recovery to take years and cost billions of dollars. In light of the disaster,  Japan and other countries have decided to reduce their reliance on  nuclear power, which could affect their electricity costs and output of  carbon emissions.", "In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), an  independent federal agency headed by five commissioners, licenses  commercial nuclear power reactors and regulates and oversees their safe  operation and security. An NRC task force has reviewed the Fukushima  Daiichi disaster and determined that the continued operation of existing  U.S. nuclear power reactors and the licensing of new reactors do not  pose an imminent risk to public health and safety. Nevertheless, the  disaster and its origins in a natural hazard\u2014a tsunami\u2014that was more  severe than the plant was designed to withstand has raised questions  about whether a similar event could happen here. These questions were  further highlighted by natural hazards that affected the sites of several  U.S. commercial nuclear power plants and their reactors in 2011,  including flooding near two power plants in Nebraska, severe storms at a  plant in Alabama, and an earthquake at a plant in Virginia.", "NRC\u2019s design criteria for nuclear power reactors require that systems,  structures, and components important to safety be designed to withstand  the effects of natural hazards, such as earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes,  floods, and tsunamis, without losing the ability to perform their safety  functions. The companies licensed to operate nuclear power reactors, or  licensees, are responsible for protecting their reactors against natural  hazards by assessing the hazards their reactors may face according to  these criteria and designing their reactors to withstand such hazards.  NRC is responsible for reviewing assessments and the resulting reactor  designs as part of its process for issuing licenses for the construction and  operation of nuclear power reactors, as well as for providing continuing  oversight of operating reactors.", "Most of NRC\u2019s regulatory framework\u2014including its criteria for assessing  natural hazards for currently-operating reactors\u2014was developed  according to a deterministic approach. The deterministic approach  establishes a specific set of potential accidents, the consequences of  which a nuclear power reactor must be designed to prevent or mitigate to  protect public health and safety. It also establishes requirements for  engineering safety margins and quality assurance standards for the  design, manufacture, and construction of nuclear power reactors. Using  this approach, NRC developed regulatory requirements primarily based  on historical experience, test results, and expert judgment without  considering quantitative estimates of risk. According to NRC documents,  in developing those requirements, NRC considered the concept of  \u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d\u2014a way of designing and operating nuclear power  reactors that focuses on creating multiple independent and redundant  layers of defense to compensate for potential human and mechanical  failures so that no single layer, no matter how robust, is exclusively relied  upon. The agency has been moving since the 1990s toward a risk- informed, performance-based approach to regulatory decision making  that is being implemented in phases according to NRC documents. This  approach extends the traditional deterministic approach in part by  incorporating probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). PRA is a systematic  method for assessing what can go wrong, its likelihood, and its potential  consequences to determine quantitative estimates of risk in order to  provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the design and  operation of a nuclear power reactor. We have previously reported on  NRC\u2019s use of PRA, its adoption of a risk-informed, performance-based  approach, and the challenges involved in implementing that approach.", "According to several experts in assessing nuclear reactor risks, risk  analysts face challenges in assessing the threats posed by natural  hazards, particularly for extreme natural hazards with a low likelihood of  occurring but potentially high consequences. These challenges include  uncertain knowledge about particular natural hazards due to the limited  historical record and the rarity of extreme natural hazards, the developing  state of knowledge about natural hazards that varies by hazard, and  changes to natural hazards over time potentially due to climate change  and other causes.", "Natural hazard assessments are only one component of NRC\u2019s  processes for ensuring that nuclear power reactors are protected against  such hazards. In addition to requiring licensees to design their reactors  using information from such assessments, NRC also requires licensees to  have the ability to mitigate the consequence of accidents if they occur to  prevent core damage and the uncontrolled release of radioactive material  into the environment and, if that fails, to have emergency preparedness  procedures in place to mitigate the effects of a radiological release on the  public and the environment. Operating a nuclear power reactor is never  entirely free of risk; assessments do not eliminate all risk no matter how  well the hazards have been assessed but are an important source of  information for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to events that can  occur as a result of natural hazards.", "In this context, you asked us to review how NRC assesses the threats  that natural hazards pose to operating U.S. commercial nuclear power  reactors. This report examines (1) the extent to which PRA is applied to  natural hazards at operating U.S. nuclear power reactors and (2) expert  views on and suggested changes, if any, to NRC processes for assessing  natural hazards at operating U.S. nuclear power reactors.", "To describe the extent to which PRA is applied to natural hazards at  operating U.S. nuclear power reactors, we reviewed relevant documents  and data obtained from NRC and selected licensees. We interviewed  knowledgeable officials about the data and found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We reviewed NRC  policies and procedures, as well as NRC initiatives related to the  assessment of natural hazards. We also reviewed the NRC task force  report on lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster and  documented actions NRC has taken on recommendations related to the  assessment of natural hazards. In addition, we visited a nonprobability  sample of five nuclear power plants to interview licensees about the  actions they have taken to assess natural hazards. The five nuclear  power plants we visited were the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Alabama,  the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, the North Anna Power  Station in Virginia, the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in  California, and the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant in Florida. We selected  these sites to capture a variety of characteristics, including reactor and  containment vessel type, operating license issuance date, license  renewal status, and natural hazard activity level. We also interviewed  NRC officials and representatives from the nuclear power industry,public interest groups, and the insurance industry to discuss NRC  processes for assessing natural hazards. Further, we interviewed officials  and reviewed documents from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S.  Geological Survey on the current state of knowledge on natural hazards,  how that knowledge has changed over time, and the related uncertainty.", "To obtain expert views on and suggested changes, if any, to NRC  processes for assessing natural hazards at operating U.S. nuclear power  reactors, we held semistructured interviews with 15 experts in assessing  natural hazards, risks to nuclear power reactors, or both.

As a result, the licensing bases, design, and level of protection  from natural hazards differ among operating reactors depending on when  the reactors were built and when they were licensed for operation. Based  on these findings, the task force recommended, among other things, that  NRC order licensees to reevaluate the seismic and flooding hazards at  their sites against current NRC requirements and guidance and, if  necessary, update their reactor design bases. The task force further  recommended that NRC initiate rulemaking to require licensees to  confirm seismic and flooding hazards every 10 years, address any new  and significant information and, if necessary, update their reactor design  bases. In addition, the task force recommended that, while these longer  term actions are being completed, NRC order licensees to check their  seismic and flood protection features to identify and address any plant- specific vulnerabilities and verify the adequacy of monitoring and  maintenance for protection features such as watertight barriers and seals.", "In response to the task force report, in August 2011, NRC directed  agency staff to identify the task force recommendations that could and, in  the staff\u2019s view, should be implemented without unnecessary delay. The  staff submitted a report to NRC in October 2011 with their proposed  prioritization of the recommendations. In this report, the staff  recommended that NRC move forward with requiring licensees to  reevaluate the seismic and flooding hazards at their sites and to check  their seismic and flood protection features. However, the staff  recommended that NRC wait to initiate rulemaking requiring licensees to  confirm their sites\u2019 seismic and flooding hazards every 10 years in order  to gain experience from the implementation of the initial reevaluation. In  December 2011, NRC approved the staff\u2019s proposals and supported  actions on several recommendations. That same month, Congress  passed, and the President signed, the 2012 Consolidated Appropriations  Act, which included a provision directing NRC to require that licensees  reevaluate external hazards at their sites, including seismic and flooding  hazards, as expeditiously as possible. In February 2012, NRC staff  proposed issuing a request for information that, among other things,  would ask licensees to reevaluate the seismic and flooding hazards at  their sites. The staff suggested PRA as one of two acceptable methods  for licensees to use in reevaluating seismic hazards. The staff did not  exclude, but also did not suggest, PRA as a method for assessing  flooding hazards because, according to NRC officials, NRC currently uses  a deterministic approach for assessing flooding hazards. NRC staff also  proposed addressing other natural hazards, such as wind and missile  loads from tornados and hurricanes, at a later date once sufficient  resources are available for the reevaluations. According to NRC officials,  it is not clear yet whether agency staff will suggest licensees use PRA or  other methods to reevaluate those other natural hazards.

Prior to  its response to the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, the last time NRC  requested licensees to assess natural hazards was in 1991 when the  agency initiated the IPEEE program. For the IPEEE, NRC requested each  licensee to voluntarily identify and report plant-specific vulnerabilities to  severe accidents caused by external events, including natural hazards.  Although PRA was suggested by NRC as one of several possible  methods for licensees to use in their examinations, most licensees opted  to use methods other than PRA. Specifically, NRC received 70 IPEEE  submissions from licensees covering all operating reactors. According to  NRC\u2019s summary of the 70 submissions, about 40 percent applied PRA to  seismic hazards, and about 15 percent applied PRA to high winds, floods,  and other external events. NRC reported that almost no licensees  identified vulnerabilities with respect to seismic hazards, and none  identified vulnerabilities related to high winds, flooding, or other external  events. Nonetheless, according to NRC\u2019s summary, 70 percent of the  IPEEE submissions identified plant improvements related to seismic  hazards, and about 50 percent identified plant improvements related to  high winds and flooding. NRC performed a review of all IPEEE  submissions to assess the technical adequacy of the methods and data  used and noted that the quality of licensees\u2019 submissions varied. NRC did  not attempt to verify or validate licensees\u2019 results. NRC staff proposed in  2011 that licensees reevaluate seismic hazards under the agency\u2019s  Generic Issue-199 program. Similar to the IPEEE, the proposal cited PRA  as one\u2014but not the only\u2014possible method for assessing seismic  hazards. The NRC staff has now proposed to pursue the reevaluation of  seismic hazards as part of the implementation of the Fukushima Daiichi  task force recommendations and has identified PRA as one of the  methods that licensees can choose to use.", "Nuclear Energy Institute representatives told us that, if data were to be  collected on licensees\u2019 current application of PRA to natural hazards, they  believe the data would likely show little difference since the IPEEE in the  1990s. They also stated that they believe few of those PRAs developed  for the IPEEE would have been updated since then. Likewise, senior  NRC officials told us that were NRC to obtain current data on licensees\u2019  application of PRA to natural hazards, the results would likely show  limited application, substantial variability, and few new or updated  assessments since the IPEEE. According to several experts in assessing  nuclear reactor risks we spoke with, few of the nation\u2019s operating reactors  currently have PRAs in place that address natural hazards. For example,  one expert stated that some reactors have PRAs that address seismic  hazards, and a few have PRAs that address external floods, but the rest  do not have PRAs that address natural hazards at all.", "NRC does not collect comprehensive data on the extent of licensees\u2019  voluntary application of PRA to natural hazards at operating reactors.  NRC officials stated that, because PRAs are not required for operating  reactors, NRC does not have comprehensive data on their use. NRC  officials told us that where licensees voluntarily undertake risk-informed  applications or license amendments, the information licensees submit to  NRC may include results on natural hazards. For example, when a  licensee chooses to use a risk-informed approach to request a change to  its licensing basis, the licensee must determine whether natural hazards  are a significant contributor to risk and provide that information to NRC.  To make this determination, the licensee may use a PRA. Apart from  these circumstances, however, NRC does not have data on operating  reactor licensees\u2019 PRA use. NRC officials could not tell us, therefore,  which licensees of operating reactors have voluntarily undertaken PRAs  that address natural hazards, what natural hazards are addressed, when  existing PRAs were first developed and last updated, or the extent to  which they meet NRC-endorsed quality standards. Nuclear Energy  Institute representatives similarly told us that they do not collect data on  PRA use and do not have a plant-by-plant listing of which reactors have  PRAs in place that address natural hazards. NRC officials said that they  do not collect comprehensive PRA information because licensees of  operating reactors are not required to have a PRA. Further, they told us  that, if NRC decided to collect this information, the agency would likely  issue a \u201cgeneric communication\u201d\u2013\u2013NRC\u2019s primary method of  communicating information to licensees and interested stakeholders or  requesting information from them. NRC officials told us that a generic  communication to obtain comprehensive PRA information would take  NRC a significant amount of time to develop and issue.", "According to representatives of five licensees we interviewed, 12 of the  25 reactors those licensees operate have PRAs in place that address  seismic hazards, and none have PRAs in place that address high winds  or external floods (see table 1). The representatives told us that, in some instances, a reactor does not have a PRA in place for a given  natural hazard because a screening analysis indicated that the hazard\u2019s  contribution to risk was sufficiently low that it could be eliminated from  further consideration; in other instances, licensees have performed  margin studies instead or rely on traditional deterministic assessments of  the hazard. Of the seismic PRAs in place at 12 of the 25 reactors for  which we obtained information, 10 have not been updated since they  were first developed. The seismic PRAs at 6 of the 12 reactors were  developed in the 1990s under NRC\u2019s IPEEE program. The seismic PRAs  at the other reactors were developed between 1983 and 2010 for a  variety of reasons. For example, two were developed as part of voluntary  licensee efforts to better understand seismic risk. Another was developed  as part of a plant\u2019s long-term seismic monitoring program created as a  condition of its operating license due to discovery during construction of a  new fault line.", "NRC has also applied PRA to natural hazards to a limited extent. For  example, NRC officials told us that the agency has developed 16 external  event risk analysis models of limited detail that address some natural  hazards at 19 operating reactors.staff for internal use in providing risk insights to various agency initiatives  such as NRC\u2019s inspection and incident investigation programs.

NRC officials told us they have plans to validate   These models are available to NRC  the models in the future to improve confidence among agency staff in  their use. According to the officials, there has also recently been renewed  interest in the agency in resuming development of these models for the  remaining operating reactors. The officials told us NRC is finalizing the  first in a series of such models that include more recent plant information  and improved validation. In a separate initiative, according to NRC  documents and officials, NRC has plans to perform a new full-scope PRA  for a single operating power plant that will calculate off-site risk and its  contributors, including natural hazards. NRC staff identified several  reasons for doing so, including technical advances that had taken place  since the last similar NRC effort in the late 1980s, scope considerations  that had not previously been addressed such as multiunit site effects, and  potential future uses for these models such as verifying or revisiting  regulatory requirements and guidance and developing NRC\u2019s in-house  PRA technical capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Has Not Analyzed Whether It Should Require PRAs That Address Natural Hazards", "paragraphs": ["While NRC has endorsed PRA as a means to enhance and extend  traditional deterministic assessments, the agency has not conducted the  analyses to determine whether or not it should require licensees of  operating reactors to develop and maintain PRAs that address natural  hazards.

Several other experts expressed mixed  views on the adequacy of NRC processes. Some of these experts stated  that they had more confidence in NRC\u2019s approach for assessing the  threats that natural hazards pose to proposed new reactors than its  approach for operating nuclear power reactors because the former  requires licensees to use PRA in addition to traditional deterministic  assessments when assessing natural hazards.

Second, several experts identified as a strength what they said was  NRC\u2019s conservative approach to licensee assessments and reactor  designs for natural hazards, including NRC\u2019s emphasis on (1) defense-in- depth principles, (2) engineering safety margins, and (3) reactor designs  based on the worst credible natural hazards a site is expected to face.  Some of these experts said that, because NRC\u2019s approach to assessing  natural hazards is conservative, they believe that U.S. nuclear power  reactors are well-designed and well-protected from natural hazards.  Third, a few experts pointed to the expertise of NRC\u2019s staff in assessing  natural hazards as another strength of the agency\u2019s processes. These  experts said that NRC staff are diligent in trying to understand natural  hazards and are proactive in identifying new information for assessing  natural hazards.

Three limitations were identified by  more than two experts. First, about half of the experts identified as a  limitation that NRC has not required licensees of operating reactors to  assess natural hazards using PRA and that licensees generally have not  done so. One of these experts noted that while NRC generally has good  information on natural hazards, the use of PRA would allow NRC to better  quantify the adequacy and uncertainty of that information. Another of  these experts stated that deterministic assessments of natural hazards  alone can provide a false sense of security with regard to the certainty of  the information that has been assessed. Second, several experts  identified as an additional limitation of NRC processes for assessing  natural hazards that some existing assessments are not as robust or up- to-date as they could be. One of these experts noted that NRC generally  does not require licensees of operating reactors to systematically  reevaluate their natural hazard assessments, and some experts  highlighted external flooding and high-wind hazards in particular as  warranting further review. Third, a few experts identified as a limitation  that NRC\u2019s processes for assessing natural hazard threats are overly  bureaucratic and slow and can lead to overly conservative results. One of  those experts noted that NRC\u2019s conservatism can potentially lead to the  costly overdesign of nuclear power reactors.

Some  experts noted the difficulty of identifying the frequency of large natural  hazards for use in a PRA given the limited data resulting from the brief  historical record and rarity of the hazards. One of these experts said  he believes the uncertainties associated with low-probability, high- consequence natural hazards are too large for a PRA to produce an  accurate risk estimate, and two other experts said the information  generated by a PRA would be useful to inform but not determine  decisions.", "About half of the experts said another key challenge is the limited  number of experts qualified to develop PRAs for natural hazards. One  expert noted the number of practitioners that can do this type of risk  assessment is small and that it is important that more people be  trained to conduct them. Another expert said that finding people to do  these analyses, more so than the cost involved in conducting them,  represents the primary challenge to expanding the use of PRA. He  further noted that this is even more the case now given the actions  NRC and industry are taking in response to the Fukushima Daiichi  disaster. In June 2008, we noted a similar challenge to NRC\u2019s efforts  to transition to a risk-informed approach to fire protection. At that  time, numerous NRC, industry, and academic officials we spoke with  expressed concern regarding the limited number of personnel with the  necessary skills and training to design, review, and inspect against  PRAs.
