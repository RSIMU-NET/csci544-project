The objectives of this requested report are to assess (1) the circumstances under which the Service can outsource postal functions, how it decides to outsource, and the extent to which it has outsourced; (2) how the Service's management processes compare for contractors and postal employees; and (3) the results, including any savings, and key challenges related to the Service's outsourcing activities. GAO reviewed applicable statutes, collective bargaining agreements, postal processes and outsourcing data, and interviewed postal union and management officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Service has no statutory restrictions on the type of work it may outsource, but collective bargaining agreements with its unions impose some process requirements and limitations. When evaluating outsourcing proposals, the Service must consider five factors--public interest, cost, efficiency, availability of equipment, and qualification of employees--and determine whether outsourcing will have a \"significant impact\" on work performed by postal employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. If so, it must compare the costs of performing proposed work with postal employees and with a contractor, notify the affected union that it is considering outsourcing, and consider union input before making a decision. We could not determine the Service's total outsourcing contracts related to bargaining unit work, because the Service does not separately track these contracts. It did provide data on some outsourcing that has impacted work by employees of its four major unions in the areas of retail, processing, transportation, and delivery. The Service evaluates contractors and postal employees using similar suitability and performance standards, but uses different management processes. The Service recently revised its drug screening procedures so they are now similar for both groups. The Service manages contractors through specific performance requirements, as compared to Service policies and collective bargaining agreements for postal employees. Finally, the Service has mechanisms to evaluate performance and take actions related to performance problems for both, but does not compile performance data to permit comparisons between contractors and postal employees. The Service does not have a comprehensive mechanism for measuring results, including any actual savings; therefore, it could not provide information on the effectiveness of its outsourcing. Without cost-savings data, postal managers, stakeholders and Congress cannot assess the risk and value of outsourcing. Also, accountability for results is limited. The Service has stated that it will explore outsourcing opportunities, and postal unions are concerned that the Service's use of contractors for delivery service is growing as shown below. Proposed legislation to limit the Service's outsourcing is pending in Congress, which the Service says could limit its ability to contain costs. Key challenges include whether the Service and its unions can reach agreement on outsourcing issues through collective bargaining and whether the Service can provide analysis to substantiate the benefits of outsourcing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States Postal Service (Service) continues to face the challenge  of generating sufficient revenue from a changing, less profitable mix of  mail while operating under a cap that limits price increases for certain  classes of mail to the rate of inflation. Obligations stemming from the  Service\u2019s universal service mandate, to provide postal services to all parts  of the country, continue to increase the number of deliveries by about   1.7 million new addresses per year. Meanwhile, since fiscal year 2000, the  number of mail pieces delivered to each address and the average revenue  per delivery have decreased. To address these challenges, the Service  stated in its 2002 Transformation Plan that it planned to achieve cost  savings of $5 billion over 5 years, partly by improving operational  efficiency. Since then, the Service has reported achieving billions in cost- savings, improving productivity, and reducing its workforce by more than  100,000 employees. The Service set a goal to cut another $5 billion in costs  during fiscal years 2006 through 2010 by continuing to increase  productivity and improve operations. To achieve this goal, it has initiatives  under way to further reduce manual mail handling, increase the number of  deliveries for each mail route, and optimize its transportation and mail  processing networks.", "Some of the Service\u2019s efforts to control costs involve outsourcing. Service  officials have stated that through outsourcing, the Service seeks to  improve its operations and customer service as well as save money. In this  report, we use the term \u201coutsourcing\u201d to refer to services that are  purchased from external entities and that are also, or may be, performed  by postal employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, which,  as of the end of fiscal year 2007, included about 85 percent of the Service\u2019s  685,000 career postal employees. The Service has a long history of  outsourcing postal functions, such as mail transportation services, mail  delivery in rural areas, contract stations for retail services, and vehicle and  equipment maintenance. However, postal employees also perform many of  these same functions and unions representing these employees have had  long-standing concerns about the impact of outsourcing on job security.  Current collective bargaining agreements, and accompanying memoranda  of understanding, between the Service and unions contain clauses that  specifically address outsourcing. At congressional hearings in 2007, the  unions representing city and rural carriers raised concerns about the  Service\u2019s expanded use of outsourcing to provide delivery services,  including concerns about the Service\u2019s oversight of these services and the  quality of services provided. Subsequently, the Service and its carrier  unions agreed to discuss the scope of the Service\u2019s outsourcing. Currently,  the parties plan to complete these discussions by the end of September  2008. In 2007, bills were introduced in the House and the Senate that could  limit the Service\u2019s ability to outsource. Service officials have said that  these bills, if enacted, could significantly impede their efforts to reduce  costs.", "To assist Congress in understanding the Service\u2019s outsourcing activities,  this report assesses (1) the circumstances under which the Service can  outsource postal functions, how it decides to outsource, and the extent to  which it has outsourced; (2) how the Service\u2019s management processes,  including suitability (hiring and screening procedures) and performance  evaluation, for contractors compare to those for postal employees; and (3)  the results\u2014including any costs, savings, or other outcomes\u2014of the  Service\u2019s outsourcing efforts and the challenges facing the Service related  to outsourcing.", "To address the circumstances under which the Service can outsource  postal functions, we reviewed statutory and regulatory requirements and  the Service\u2019s most recent collective bargaining agreements with its four  major unions. We focused our review on the Service\u2019s outsourcing  activities related to major postal functional areas and the bargaining unit  work of its four major unions, including transportation, delivery, mail  processing, and retail functions. To determine how the Service decides to  outsource, we interviewed postal officials at Service headquarters and the  Southwest Area, employee union representatives, management  association representatives, and representatives of the National Star Route  Mail Contractors Association and reviewed relevant postal documents. To  evaluate the extent to which the Service has outsourced, we interviewed  Service officials at headquarters and in the Southwest Area and obtained  and reviewed documents related to the Service\u2019s outsourcing efforts,  including 46 national-level outsourcing initiatives since 1996, as well as  proposed initiatives. In addition, we obtained, reviewed, and analyzed  information on outsourced transportation and delivery, including data  pertaining to routes and delivery points for the three types of carriers\u2014 city, rural, and contract delivery service. To compare the Service\u2019s  management processes for suitability and performance evaluation of  contractors and postal employees, we reviewed the Service\u2019s policies and  procedures related to hiring qualifications, screening requirements, and  performance evaluation for contractors and postal employees. To evaluate  the results, including any costs, savings, and other outcomes of its  outsourcing activities, we also reviewed the Service\u2019s cost estimates,  relevant budget information, and available performance data for the  outsourcing projects initiated from 1996 through 2007. We requested  comments on a draft of this report from the Service and we discuss its  comments, which appear in appendix III, later in the report. We conducted  this performance audit from August 2007 through July 2008 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Service has a long history of contracting for mail transportation dating  back to the beginning of the Post Office in 1775. Since then, the Service  has contracted for mail to be carried by steamship, stagecoach, horse, rail,  airplane, motor vehicle, boat, snowmobile, and even mule train into the  Grand Canyon. In 1845, Congress passed legislation to reduce mail  transportation costs by moving from contracts with stagecoach companies  to contracts with individuals to transport mail by horseback. The routes  these individuals took became known as star routes. Most star route  carriers had 4-year contracts and traveled by horse or horse-drawn vehicle  until the early 20th century. In 1948, Congress allowed the Postmaster  General to renew 4-year contracts to star route carriers with satisfactory  service rather than requiring the contracts to be competitively bid.  Between 1960 and 1970, star route miles more than doubled. In the 1970s,  star routes officially became known as highway contract routes.", "There are three different types of highway contract routes:    Transportation routes: Contractors transport mail between postal  facilities.", "Contract delivery service (CDS) (commonly referred to as box routes):  Contractors deliver mail and provide services similar to those provided by  postal rural carriers.", "Combination routes: Contractors provide a combination of mail  transportation between postal facilities and mail delivery services to  individual addresses along their routes.", "In 2007, the Service had nearly 17,000 highway contract routes, including  8,968 transportation routes, 6,708 CDS delivery routes, and 1,218  combination routes. The Service also contracts for air mail transportation  services with private contractors, including FedEx and seven commercial  airlines. In addition, it contracts for mail to be transported by rail and  boat.", "The Service\u2019s outsourcing of mail transportation and some delivery  services predates the ability of postal employee unions to collectively  bargain. The Service established city delivery services provided by postal  letter carriers on designated city routes in 1863, but did not initially extend  delivery services to rural areas. Eventually, the Service set up permanent  rural routes with postal rural letter carriers in 1902. The 1970 Postal  Reorganization Act authorized postal unions to collectively bargain with  the Service on employee wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of  employment. Subsequently, the unions negotiated for protection from  layoffs. The act provided for binding arbitration if an impasse persists 180  days after the start of bargaining, unless parties agree to an alternate  process. Four postal unions represent most non-management postal  employees and negotiate for them during collective bargaining:    The American Postal Workers Union represents various employees  including clerks, building and equipment maintenance employees, motor  vehicle operators, motor vehicle maintenance employees, and nurses;   The National Association of Letter Carriers represents carriers who deliver  mail on city routes;   The National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association represents carriers who  deliver mail on rural routes; and    The National Postal Mail Handlers Union represents mail handlers who  work in postal processing facilities.", "The Service has separate bargaining agreements with each union and in  2006 or 2007 signed agreements with all four unions that expire in either  2010 or 2011.", "The total number of career postal employees, as well as the number of  bargaining unit employees, declined 14 percent from 1998 through 2007  through attrition, as shown in table 1.", "The Service achieved these reductions without layoffs but improved its  operational efficiency and productivity through increased automation and  other initiatives. These efficiency gains allowed the Service to operate  with fewer employees. According to the Service, there are significant cost  advantages to contracting for transportation services. For example,  although the service provided by the three different types of delivery\u2014 city, rural and contract\u2014is generally similar, the Service states that there  are significant cost differences between them, primarily due to differences  in each of the carriers\u2019 compensation systems. The systems for city and  rural carriers are collectively bargained between the Service and its  associated unions. Generally speaking, city carriers are compensated on  an hourly basis, which can include overtime; rural carriers are  compensated on a salary basis; and contract carriers are compensated via  a contract. Similarly, there are significant cost differences between  transportation provided by Service employees and highway contract  routes. According to the Service, its fiscal year 2007 costs for delivery and  transportation services provided by postal employees and contractors are  shown in table 2.", "Furthermore, in the retail area, the Service establishes contract postal  units because they can provide the same service as a post office but at less  cost, since the Service does not incur building and operating expenses  associated with maintaining post offices. In 2007, 4,026 of the Service\u2019s  36,721 post offices, stations, and branches\u2014or 11 percent\u2014were contract  postal units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Key Requirements Related to Postal Outsourcing, the Service\u2019s Process for Making Outsourcing Decisions, and the Extent of Its Outsourcing", "paragraphs": ["The Service has no statutory restrictions on the type of work it may  outsource, but union collective bargaining agreements impose some  limitations.

Through the collective bargaining process, employee  unions have reached agreement with the Service that resulted in changes  to its outsourcing decision-making process.  However, the unions have  also grieved a number of the Service\u2019s decisions to outsource.  Overall, we  could not determine the extent of the Service\u2019s outsourcing that has  impacted bargaining unit work because the Service does not separately  track the subset of transportation contracts that impact bargaining unit  work.  The Service did provide data related to some of its outsourcing,  including in its retail, processing, and delivery functions. Since 1996, the  Service evaluated 46 national-level outsourcing proposals under the  requirements of Article 32 and determined that 5 had a significant impact  on bargaining unit work.

Additionally, the Service may negotiate or enter into certain contracts  without competition. For example, the Service negotiated and awarded a  contract without competition to FedEx for air transportation services and  can renew highway transportation contracts without competition. In  addition, Congress has applied certain purchasing-related requirements to  the Service that apply to other federal government agencies but are not  applicable to private entities. For example, the Service Contract Act of  1965 requires some Service contractors to pay minimum prevailing wages  and benefits to employees.", "Collective bargaining agreements with the postal employee unions may  impose limitations on outsourcing in certain areas. For example, the most  recent City Carrier\u2019s collective bargaining agreement restricts the Service  from outsourcing delivery services in areas where only city carriers  provide mail delivery. Similarly, APWU\u2019s collective bargaining agreement  restricts some contracts for custodial services based on the size of the  area to be maintained.", "The Service\u2019s collective bargaining agreements also each contain a  provision, Article 32, which establishes certain procedural requirements to  be conducted when making an outsourcing decision, but does not,  according to the Service and the unions, restrict the type of work that can  be outsourced.

The Service recently changed its purchasing  regulations and procedures to streamline its purchasing process and  create a more flexible, efficient, businesslike approach to purchasing.  The revised process covers all purchasing, including outsourcing, and is  divided into six general steps:  Identify needs.", "Evaluate sources. This step includes developing a request for proposals  and soliciting bids.", "Select suppliers. This step includes awarding a contract.", "Deliver and receive requirements.", "Measure and manage supply. This step includes managing contract  performance.", "End of life.", "GAO reviewed these changes in a report issued in December 2005 and  found them generally consistent with the principles and practices of  leading organizations. Accordingly, in this review, we limit our  discussions to portions of the purchasing process that are relevant to  outsourcing.", "In addition to these purchasing steps, to comply with the Article 32  provisions, the Service must conduct two evaluations of outsourcing  initiatives under consideration. First, it must address five factors\u2014public  interest, cost, efficiency, availability of equipment, and qualification of  employees\u2014when evaluating the need to outsource. Second, it must  determine whether the outsourcing will have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on  work performed by bargaining unit employees. Service officials told us  that when making these evaluations, they do not use formal criteria and  none of the five factors carries more weight than the others. Further,  officials said that the five factor evaluation is similar to the type of analysis  performed to make other business decisions and that the collective  bargaining agreements do not contain specific guidance for performing the  evaluations and do not define the term \u201csignificant impact.\u201d However, the  Service said that when determining whether a proposal has a significant  impact, at a minimum, the initiative must be national in scope. In addition,  the Service considers the material aspects of the initiative, including, but  not limited to, the number of employees, work hours and facilities  affected, the geographic distribution of the employees and sites affected,  and any other factor that provides insight to the particular determination.  Further, the Service said that no one factor will necessarily be  determinative and not all factors will necessarily shed light on every  project. If the Service determines that outsourcing will have a significant  impact, Article 32 contains additional requirements. Although the specific  requirements vary by agreement, the Service must always notify the  affected union of its intent to consider outsourcing and must consider  union input before making a decision. Conversely, if the Service  determines the outsourcing will not have a significant impact, the Service  may still have further actions it must take. Under its agreement with  APWU, the Service has certain notification requirements for highway  contract routes. In addition, if requested by the City or Rural Carriers, the  Service must provide information on contracted delivery routes in certain  circumstances.", "We identified two different categories of outsourcing initiatives: (1)  outsourcing that was approved at the national level, was unique and  infrequent\u2014occurring only 5 times since 1996, and had a significant  impact on bargaining unit work; and (2) outsourcing that was approved at  the field level, was purchased frequently and repeatedly, and, according to  the Service, did not have a significant impact on bargaining unit work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National-Level Decision-Making Process", "paragraphs": ["The Service has established guidelines for evaluating proposed  outsourcing initiatives and ensuring that certain factors are considered,  such as whether an initiative is consistent with organizational goals,  security, and integrity; offers a cost or service advantage; and will maintain  quality levels. Additionally, the guidelines provide a framework for  complying with Article 32 requirements. Overall responsibility for  outsourcing proposals lies with a sponsor, typically a Service  Headquarters Vice President. The sponsor\u2019s responsibilities include  developing and presenting the outsourcing concept, conducting financial  and cost analyses, securing the necessary approvals, and ensuring  compliance with all labor agreements.", "The sponsor presents the proposed outsourcing initiative to a Strategic  Initiatives Action Group (SIAG), an internal cross-functional group formed  to facilitate concept review and approval and ensure conformance with  Article 32 requirements. The SIAG includes representatives from Service  departments, including Labor Relations, Legal, Finance, Operations,  Supply Management and Communications, who assist sponsors of  proposed outsourcing initiatives with the various procedural steps  required for outsourcing at the national level. SIAG evaluates the level of  impact expected from the proposed outsourcing initiative by scrutinizing  the functions to be performed in the initiative. If the SIAG determines that  an outsourcing initiative will have a significant impact on work performed  by bargaining unit employees, the affected unions must be notified and  allowed to provide input into the analysis considered when comparing the  performance of proposed work by postal employees and by a contractor.  The final approval for an outsourcing initiative with a significant impact on  bargaining unit work, supported by an evaluation of the five factors, must  come from an approval board consisting of the Deputy Postmaster  General/Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Human  Resources Officer. If SIAG determines that national-level outsourcing will  not have a significant impact, the Service will still perform the cost  analysis that is part of the normal purchasing process; however, union  notification and input are not required. The final decision to outsource a  national outsourcing initiative that will not have a significant impact on  the bargaining units is based on an evaluation of the five factors  mentioned above and is made by management within the group that  proposed the initiative.", "One example of a national-level outsourcing proposal that the Service  approved is a proposal to outsource certain functions previously  performed by postal employees at AMCs across the country. Under the  proposal, the AMC facilities would be closed and outsourcing would occur  in contractor facilities. In the process of making the outsourcing decisions,  the Service:    determined that the proposal would have a significant impact on    prepared a comparative analysis to document its consideration of the five    notified the affected unions at major milestones,    solicited and incorporated union input or responded in writing as to why  specific concerns were not incorporated, and   decided to proceed with the outsourcing proposal.", "In providing input to this AMC proposal, the union disagreed with  assumptions underlying the Service\u2019s estimates of several factors that  could affect the outcome of the analysis, including wage rates and  experience levels for both contractors and postal employees, and the level  of overtime required to perform the job."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field-Level Decision-Making Process", "paragraphs": ["Most outsourcing is performed at the field level using established  processes that include steps to comply with Article 32 requirements.  Service officials told us that field-level outsourcing typically is for contract  delivery, highway transportation, custodial and vehicle maintenance  services, and involves thousands of contracts. Generally, outsourcing at  the field level does not have a significant impact on bargaining unit work,  according to the Service, and consequently does not require  consideration of union input. For example, the Service has an established  process for contracting out delivery service that includes consideration of  the five factors but does not require union notification or input. However,  the City and Rural Carrier\u2019s collective bargaining agreements require the  Service to provide cost information on contracted delivery routes in  certain circumstances if requested by the union. Further, APWU\u2019s  collective bargaining agreement with the Service has additional  requirements the Service must meet when contracting out for highway  transportation services. In this case, the Service has an established  process set forth in a Service handbook, which incorporates steps required  under Article 32 for transportation routes that meet certain criteria. When  contracting initially or renewing a contract for a transportation route that  meets the criteria, the Service must perform a five factor evaluation,  including a cost comparison, notify the union, and allow the union to have  input into the outsourcing decision. The final decision to outsource is  made at the field level.", "Table 3 summarizes the national and field-level outsourcing processes,  compares the requirements, and includes examples of outsourcing.", "With the overall number of deliveries growing each year, on average, by  about 1.7 million deliveries, the Service has taken steps to minimize the  impact of these additional deliveries. For example, area and district  managers are expected to have a growth planning process in place,  conduct cost analyses on the type of delivery to provide, and examine the  feasibility of offering CDS service in lieu of rural or city delivery service,  consistent with the Service\u2019s contractual obligations. However, the Service  must consider a variety of factors before assigning new deliveries to a  particular type of delivery, including the type of carrier historically used in  the area, Article 32 requirements, including cost, and projected population  growth. To ensure that these policies are consistently applied and the  appropriate factors are considered, the Service introduced a computerized  growth management tool. This tool standardizes the process that field  officials use to determine whether new deliveries should be assigned to  city, rural or contract carriers. For example, if a new delivery is in an area  served by city carriers, the address will likely be assigned to a city carrier  route. Conversely, if a new delivery is in an area that does not have  existing delivery service, the Service must compare the costs of each  different delivery type to comply with Article 32. The Postmaster General  has testified that the Service has been exploring the expanded use of CDS,  because it is one of the most cost-effective delivery modes available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Postal Unions Have Disagreed with Some Postal Service Outsourcing Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Postal employee unions have disagreed with the Service\u2019s outsourcing  decisions including those related to the impact of proposed outsourcing  on bargaining unit work. To address disagreements with the Service,  unions have two options: formally grieving decisions using the process  defined in collective bargaining agreements or addressing concerns in  subsequent rounds of collective bargaining. For example, according to a  union official, the Mail Handlers grieved the Service\u2019s determination that  outsourcing the processing of some military parcels did not have a  significant impact on bargaining unit work. In this case, the Service  notified the affected union at the local level, but not at the national level.  The grievance was eventually settled by an arbitrator, who, according to  the Service, decided that the initiative did have a significant impact but did  not reverse the Service\u2019s outsourcing decision. In another example, APWU  grieved the Service\u2019s 1991 decision to outsource certain jobs in remote  encoding centers, where employees manually read and enter address  information for addresses on letters that cannot be read by automated  mail processing equipment. A 1993 arbitration decision determined that  the Service did not violate Article 32 because the Service had considered  the five factors but also required the Service to offer jobs at these centers  to postal employees before contracting out such work.", "The unions have also addressed concerns about outsourcing through  collective bargaining. The City Carriers\u2019 current collective bargaining  agreement restricts the Service from outsourcing delivery services in areas  where only city carriers deliver mail. Previously, APWU and the Mail  Handlers agreed in a memorandum of understanding, applicable from 1998  through 2000, to a moratorium on most new, national-level outsourcing  that would affect their bargaining unit. In addition, the collective  bargaining process has resulted in modifications to Article 32 procedures.  For example, arbitration proceedings that followed collective bargaining  negotiations in 2000 changed Article 32 in each union\u2019s collective  bargaining agreement to include a provision that the Service would meet  with the unions while developing its initial comparative analysis for  outsourcing proposals and include a statement of the unions\u2019 views and  proposals in this analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent of the Postal Service\u2019s Outsourcing Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the Service could not provide information on the total extent of its  outsourcing activities that have impacted bargaining unit work because  the contracts related to bargaining unit work are not separately tracked.  Since 1996, the Service reviewed 46 outsourcing initiatives using its  national-level decision-making process and determined that 5 impacted  bargaining unit work, primarily related to retail and processing functions.  The Service approved and implemented all five initiatives but terminated  one in 2001. The Service did provide fiscal year 2007 expenditure data  related to the remaining four outsourcing initiatives, as indicated in table  4. In addition, the Service provided information related to its total contract  costs for transportation, but could not separately report on the subset of  transportation contracts that have an impact on bargaining unit work. The  Service\u2019s expenditures for transportation contracts totaled about $6.5  billion in fiscal year 2007, which was about 8 percent of its total operating  expenses, while expenditures for outsourced delivery services totaled  about $220 million. Finally, the Service also provided information related  to the number of deliveries made by contractors. The Service said that,  through outsourcing, it seeks to improve its operations and customer  service, as well as save money, though not every initiative is expected to  achieve every goal. For example, it may be sufficient for a contract to  improve service, but not save money. Further, it said that contractors may  operate more efficiently than the Service in a number of ways including by  compensating its employees at lower rates than the Service and by  employing more part-time workers. The Service cited these reasons for  outsourcing in each of the five national outsourcing initiatives, as follows.", "The Service implemented two of the five initiatives that impacted retail  and processing functions, Mail Transport Equipment Service Centers and  Corporate Call Management, about 10 years ago. The Mail Transport  Equipment Service Centers initiative was intended to establish a national  network of service centers for processing, repairing, and storing  equipment and supplies used to move mail, such as mailbags, trays, and  carts. The Service anticipated improving the availability and management  of the mail equipment, saving money, and improving efficiency at mail  processing facilities by reducing mail equipment administrative  responsibility. The Corporate Call Management initiative was intended to  establish national call centers to provide a single toll-free number that  would give customers access to postal services and information. The  Service anticipated improving customer satisfaction, saving money, and  improving efficiency by contracting with companies with demonstrated  success in call center operations. According to the Service, these functions  were previously decentralized and inefficient when they were performed  by postal employees at mail processing plants or at post offices.", "Two other initiatives, Terminal Handling Services and AMCs, were  implemented more recently and impacted work in the processing function.  Mail that is transported by air needs to be delivered for a departing flight  operated under a contract with either a commercial airline or FedEx, or  picked up from an arriving flight. These activities are generally known as  terminal handling services. The Service outsourced these services to  various suppliers at about 60 airports where FedEx was providing air mail  transportation services under a contract with the Service. The Service  anticipated saving money, deferring large capital expenditures for facilities  and equipment, and improving efficiency by contracting with companies  that had demonstrated success in terminal handling operations. Similarly,  for the AMC initiatives, the Service outsourced, or plans to outsource, for  terminal handling services for mail transported by commercial carrier  flights at 20 airports. In 2004, the Service had about 70 AMCs located  across the country that processed mail arriving at and departing from  airports and performed terminal handling operations. However, the need  for these functions has decreased over time because of reductions in mail  volumes, excess processing capacity at other processing facilities, and a  reduction in the number of commercial air carrier contracts. The Service  scrutinized the functions performed at each of its AMCs and, as of June  2008, decided to close 20 and outsource the required terminal handling  services, retain 6 and continue operations with postal employees, and  close the remaining AMCs. The Service anticipated saving money, closing  facilities and improving efficiency by outsourcing with companies that had  demonstrated success in terminal handling services.", "The final initiative listed in table 4, Priority Mail Processing Network, was  intended to be a pilot project to test whether the Service could improve  Priority Mail delivery performance by using a dedicated processing and  transportation network.

Support for the Service to operate more like a business dates  back at least to 1970, when Congress passed legislation that gave the  Service unique status as an independent establishment of the federal  government and authorized it to finance its operations through sales of its  products and services instead of appropriations. Congress also stated in  the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that the Postal  Service should implement commercial best practices in its purchasing  policies to achieve greater efficiency and cost savings by taking full  advantage of private-sector partnerships, as recommended in the July 2003  report by the President\u2019s Commission on the United States Postal  Service.", "Similarly, the current and previous administrations have advanced  proposals to promote more efficient and effective government operations,  including outsourcing government operations. In particular, in 2001, the  Bush Administration launched the President\u2019s Management Agenda to  focus attention on ensuring that the resources entrusted to the federal  government are well-managed and wisely used. The President\u2019s  Management Agenda encourages opening federal commercial activities to  competition among public and private sector sources to achieve increased  savings and improve performance.

Bills introduced in 2007, and pending with  the appropriate oversight subcommittees, address the Service\u2019s use of  outsourced mail delivery contractors.  S. 1457 seeks to limit the extent that  the Service could use outsourced delivery service, and H.R. 4236 would  require the Service to bargain with postal employee unions before entering  into certain contracts. Additionally, House Resolution 282, co-sponsored  by 255 members as of July 2008, expressed \u201cthe sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States Postal Service should discontinue  the practice of contracting out mail delivery services.\u201d", "Postal employee unions have questioned whether outsourcing actually  achieves its intended results. For example, the president of the Mail  Handlers described as false the Service\u2019s assumption that it will save  money by allowing private contractors to perform work currently done by  postal employees. He further maintained that actual experience, such as  with Emery, has shown that outsourcing has the opposite effect, costing  the Service more than anticipated. In addition, he said that evaluations by  the Service that compare the costs of performing work with contractors  and with postal employees are incomplete and do not reflect the actual  costs borne by the Service. APWU officials told us the Postal Service  primarily uses wage factors as a basis for comparison. Since postal  employees are relatively well paid, according to these officials,  comparisons tend to find outsourcing to be less costly. Also, the officials  noted such comparisons exclude the value of other factors, such as the  higher levels of efficiency provided by a well-trained, dedicated career  workforce. In addition, unions have expressed skepticism over the value  of outsourcing, raising concerns about public policy issues related to the  Service\u2019s mission or intended obligations as a government entity. For  example, the Service has not clearly defined the functions it considers  \u201cinherently postal\u201d\u2013functions that should only be performed by the  Service\u2013and whether these functions should be outsourced. All four  unions have questioned the wisdom of the Service outsourcing in what  they consider its core functional areas, such as delivery or mail  processing. Similarly, two unions expressed concerns that there are no  limits to the extent the Service could outsource: if it outsources one  delivery route, why not outsource all? They also noted that one impact of  expanding outsourcing would be to replace long-term career employees  with low-paid, no-benefit, non-career, and often transient workers. Finally,  the unions have also raised the question of whether the Service, by hiring  contractors, violates the public\u2019s trust and expectation of safe, efficient  mail delivery or violates its responsibilities as an employer. For example,  the president of the Mail Handlers stated in recent testimony that another  impact of outsourcing is that the Service, which is currently one of the  largest employers of veterans and disabled veterans, would reduce the  number of job opportunities for veterans returning from combat and non- combat situations.", "The current uncertain economic environment serves to exacerbate the  challenges facing the Service and contributed to lower than expected mail  volumes and revenues in the first half of fiscal year 2008. The Service faces  challenges such as generating mail volumes despite rate increases in May  2008; managing its costs in difficult economic conditions, and improving  operational efficiencies through accelerated cost reduction strategies;  maintaining, measuring, and reporting service; and managing its  workforce. In its Transformation Plans and congressional testimony, the  Service has acknowledged the value it places on outsourcing as a means to  reduce costs and increase efficiency and its intent to continue to pursue  outsourcing opportunities. The Service has a long history of outsourcing  mail transportation, delivery services and other functions, much of which  has been carried out within the framework of the Service\u2019s collective  bargaining agreements with its employee unions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Outsourcing Could Impact the Service\u2019s Relations with Its Employee Unions", "paragraphs": ["Continued or expanded outsourcing by the Service could lead to problems  with postal employee unions as evidenced by public statements by union  officials. For example, the president of the Mail Handlers testified that  continued outsourcing by the Service would drive a wedge between it and  hundreds of thousands of postal employees. Postal employees are critical  to providing vital postal services to the American people and achieving a  successful postal transformation. The President\u2019s Commission on the  Postal Service concluded that as valuable as the Postal Service is to the  nation, its ability to deliver that value is only as great as the capability,  motivation, and satisfaction of the people who make possible the daily  delivery of mail to American homes and businesses. However, we and  others have reported that adversarial labor-management relations have  been a challenge for the Service and its major labor unions.", "In the past, we reported that autocratic management, persistent  confrontation and conflict, and ineffective performance systems often  characterized the Service\u2019s organizational culture on the workroom floor.  These problems resulted in an underperforming organization with major  deficiencies in morale and quality of work life; huge numbers of  grievances with high costs for the Service and its employees; and  protracted, acrimonious contract negotiations. In our past reports, we  found that these conditions have existed over many years because labor  and management leadership, at both the national and local levels, have  often had difficulty working together to find solutions to their problems.  Under these circumstances, it was difficult for the parties to develop and  sustain the level of trust necessary for maintaining a constructive working  relationship and agreeing on major changes to maximize the Service\u2019s  efficiency and the quality of work life. We are encouraged by recent  progress in this area, such as reports by union officials of better  communications, sharp reductions in the number of outstanding  grievances, and three of four major labor contracts that were successfully  negotiated between the parties without the need for binding arbitration. In  addition, the Service has improved its productivity, which the Service  reported has increased in each of the last 8 years.", "However, continued or expanded outsourcing could be an impediment to  improved relationships. Recent actions by the unions continue to indicate  significant concerns about outsourcing. For example, in 2007, the Rural  Carriers filed a grievance alleging that the Service\u2019s expanded use of  contract delivery service violated the terms of its collective bargaining  agreement. Similarly, collective bargaining agreement negotiations in 2007  between the Service and the City Carriers initially came to an impasse,  primarily because of union concerns over increased outsourcing of  delivery services. The parties reached an agreement, which was ratified by  the union membership, after the Service agreed to limitations on its ability  to outsource in certain areas served by city carriers over the life of the 5- year contract. In addition, the Service and union agreed to establish a joint  committee, including the Rural Carriers, to discuss a mutually agreeable  approach to the issue of outsourcing by March 2008. Because the  committee extended its reporting deadline to the end of September 2008,  the results of this effort are not yet known.", "The Service and employee unions have indicated that the appropriate  means for resolving outsourcing issues is through the collective bargaining  process. For example, the Postmaster General testified that, \u201cbeyond the  specific subject of contract delivery, there is a bigger issue at stake. That is  the ability of the parties, the Postal Service and its unions, to resolve their  differences through the collective bargaining process. One of the most  important accomplishments of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 was  the extension of full collective bargaining rights to the postal unions. Over  the course of more than 3 decades, these have served our employees, our  unions and the Postal Service well. And, as we have seen, the process can\u2013 and does\u2013work.\u201d While most unions agree, they also stated that the  Service has not always been willing to discuss outsourcing in collective  bargaining negotiations. Some unions have already asked Congress to pass  proposed legislation that would require the Service to collectively bargain  with the unions on outsourcing proposals before they can be approved or  that would limit the extent that the Service could use outsourced delivery  service."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although the Service has outsourced activities related to many of its key  functions, its employee unions are now challenging its ability to expand  outsourcing in areas where postal employees have performed or could  perform these activities. The Service views outsourcing as an important  strategy for achieving the cost savings it needs to operate successfully  under a regulatory price cap. But because the Service does not track, and  therefore cannot quantify, the actual results of its outsourcing activities, it  cannot document the effectiveness of its outsourcing results for Service  managers, stakeholders, and Congress. As a result, information to assess  the risk and value of outsourcing and accountability for results is limited.  Information on the effectiveness of outsourcing, including actual results,  costs, and any savings achieved, could be useful as the Service considers  additional outsourcing initiatives. Both the Service and its unions agree  that the appropriate way to resolve outsourcing issues is through the  collective bargaining process. A key challenge for both the Service and its  unions will be to reach agreement on outsourcing issues through  collective bargaining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve management decision-making and accountability in this area,  the Postmaster General should, first, establish a process to measure the  results and effectiveness of Service outsourcing activities that are subject  to collective bargaining. This process should include tracking actual costs  and any savings, and comparing them with estimated costs and savings.  Second, to support congressional oversight, the Postmaster General  should include information on the results and effectiveness of these  ongoing outsourcing activities in its annual operations report  (Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations) to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service provided written comments on a draft of this  report in a letter from the Chief Human Resources Officer and Executive  Vice President dated July 7, 2008. These comments are summarized below  and are included, in their entirety, as appendix III to this report. In  separate correspondence, the Service also provided minor technical  comments, which we incorporated, as appropriate.", "The Service generally agreed with our finding that it does not separately  track the results of its outsourcing activities and with our first  recommendation that a process should be established to measure the  results and effectiveness of Service outsourcing initiatives that are subject  to collective bargaining agreements, including tracking actual costs and  any savings. However, the Service did not agree to implement our second  recommendation to provide information on the results and effectiveness  of these ongoing outsourcing initiatives in its annual operations report to  Congress.", "The Service agreed to establish a process, for future national-level  outsourcing initiatives approved after July 2008, to compare the final  financial comparative analysis assumptions with actual contract award  data 1 year after project implementation. This step is commendable to  begin assessing the impact and effectiveness of outsourcing efforts,  specifically the cost savings achieved after 1 year. Our recommendation  was not limited to costs and savings associated with outsourcing, but the  Service did not commit to measuring other impacts, such as on service,  customers, or employees. We continue to believe these are also important  in a comprehensive assessment of the outsourcing efforts.", "The Service did not agree to implement our second recommendation and  proposed instead to retain information it collects on its outsourcing efforts  internally. However, in order for the Service to effectively make its case to  use outsourcing as a mechanism to contain costs, we believe that the  Service must keep its stakeholders, including Members of Congress,  customers, employees, and the public-at-large, fully informed of the  merits, potential impacts, and the results of outsourcing. Several bills are  pending before Congress that would affect the Service\u2019s ability to  outsource. In conducting oversight and making its decisions, Congress  would benefit from more data about the results and effectiveness of the  Service\u2019s outsourcing activities that are subject to collective bargaining.  Without transparency regarding its outsourcing initiatives, postal  management, stakeholders and Congress are not able to assess the risk  and value of outsourcing and accountability for results is limited. Thus, we  believe that the Service should annually provide Congress with  information about the results of outsourcing activities as discussed  previously.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Member  of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; the  Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs; the Postmaster General; and other  interested parties.

Specifically, we reviewed  applicable statutes and regulations pertaining to the Service, and the  Service\u2019s most recent collective bargaining agreements, and accompanying  memoranda of understanding, with its four major employee unions\u2014the  American Postal Workers Union (APWU), the National Association of  Letter Carriers (City Carriers), the National Postal Mail Handlers Union  (Mail Handlers), and the National Rural Letter Carriers\u2019 Association (Rural  Carriers). In addition, we reviewed information on federal laws and  regulations applicable to most federal purchasing, though not required of  the Service, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Competition in  Contracting Act, and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Circular No.  A-76. We focused the scope of our review on the major postal functional  areas\u2014transportation, delivery, mail processing, and retail\u2014that involve  outsourcing activities related to the bargaining unit work of the Service\u2019s  four major unions. To determine how the Service decides to outsource, we  interviewed postal officials at Service headquarters and in the Southwest  Area, and representatives of employee unions, management associations,  and the National Star Route Mail Contractors Association. We reviewed  the purchasing procedures the Service uses to guide its purchasing of  specific services, including contracted services. We also interviewed the  Strategic Initiatives Action Group (SIAG), an internal cross-functional  group at headquarters that guides outsourcing through the decision- making process at the national level, and reviewed the group\u2019s policies and  procedures. Finally, we discussed with Service officials, and obtained  information on, the Growth Management Tool, a new software tool the  Service can use in assigning delivery routes, including outsourced routes.  To determine the extent of the Service\u2019s outsourcing, we interviewed  Service officials at headquarters and in the Southwest Area and obtained  and reviewed documents related to the Service\u2019s outsourcing efforts,  including 46 national-level outsourcing initiatives since 1996, as well as  proposed initiatives. In addition, we obtained, reviewed, and analyzed  information on outsourced transportation and delivery, including data  pertaining to routes and delivery points for the three types of carriers\u2014 city, rural, and contract delivery service. We assessed the reliability of  Service data for inconsistencies and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report.", "To compare the Service\u2019s suitability, performance evaluation, and  management processes for postal employees and contractors, we  reviewed the Service\u2019s policies and procedures on qualifications, screening  requirements, and performance evaluation for contractors and postal  employees. We reviewed various Service contracts on Air Mail Centers,  highway contract routes, and contract delivery service and compared  contractual stipulations with applicable postal employee guidelines and  collective bargaining agreements by respective occupation. Finally, we  spoke with various Service national- and field-level officials about the  Service\u2019s suitability, performance evaluation and management processes  for postal employees and contractors.", "To evaluate the results, including costs, savings, and other outcomes  related to outsourcing, we discussed with Service officials the processes  and procedures currently in place for evaluating outsourcing activities. We  also obtained and reviewed available cost estimates, relevant budget  information, and available performance data for the outsourcing projects  initiated between 1996 and 2007.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 to July 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.
