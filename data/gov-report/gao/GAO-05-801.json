Furthermore, the requirement to review all visa applications in Saudi Arabia limits the VSOs' ability to provide additional training and other services to consular officers, such as assisting with interviews. Moreover, security concerns in Saudi Arabia limit staffing levels at these posts. DHS has not developed a strategic plan outlining the Visa Security Program's mission, activities, program goals, and intended results for operations in Saudi Arabia or the planned expansion posts. Chiefs of mission at the five posts chosen for expansion in fiscal year 2005 delayed approving DHS's requests for the assignment of VSOs until DHS answered specific questions regarding the program's goals and objectives, staffing requirements, and plans to coordinate with existing staff and law enforcement and border security programs at post.

Section  428 of the act also authorized DHS to immediately assign personnel to  Saudi Arabia to review all visa applications prior to final adjudication, as  well as the future assignment of officers to other locations overseas to  review visa applications. In August 2003, DHS created the Office of  International Enforcement within the Border and Transportation Security  Directorate, to implement these requirements. In the same month, four  temporary DHS officers were deployed to Saudi Arabia to begin reviewing  all visa applications. In September 2003, DHS and State signed a  Memorandum of Understanding to govern the implementation of section  428. This agreement broadly defines the DHS officers\u2019 responsibilities in  reviewing visa applications, indicating, in particular, that they will   provide expert advice to consular officers regarding specific security  threats relating to visa adjudication, specifically by gathering and  reviewing intelligence relevant to visa adjudication and providing  training to consular officers on terrorist threats and detecting applicant  fraud;  review applications on their own initiative or at the request of consular  officers, and provide input on or recommend security advisory opinion  requests; and  conduct investigations on consular matters under the jurisdiction of the  Secretary of Homeland Security.", "Several other agencies stationed overseas have roles in the visa  adjudication process. For example, the State Department Diplomatic  Security Bureau\u2019s regional security officers assist the consular section by  investigating passport and visa fraud detected through the consular  officers\u2019 reviews of visa applications and supporting documents. In  addition, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation overseas can  assist consular officers when questions about an applicant\u2019s potential  criminal history arise during adjudication. DHS\u2019s Bureaus of Citizenship  and Immigration Services and Customs and Border Protection have  responsibility for some immigration and border security programs  overseas. For example, consular officers may seek advice from these  officials on issues such as DHS procedures at U.S. ports of entry.", "In October 2003, DHS designated its Bureau of Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) to handle the operational and policy-making  responsibilities outlined in section 428 (e) and (i). Subsequently, ICE  created an office to oversee the Visa Security Program. Since the  assignment of VSOs to Saudi Arabia in 2003 until May 2005, DHS has spent  about $4 million for Visa Security Program operations at headquarters and  overseas, of which approximately $2 million was spent on operations in  Saudi Arabia. Figure 1 provides a timeline for the establishment and  implementation of the visa security program.", "In August 2004, the DHS Office of Inspector General reported on the  planning and implementation of the VSOs\u2019 activities in Saudi Arabia. The  report was based on observations beginning in July 2003, at which time  DHS was in the early stages of designing the Visa Security Program. (DHS  officers did not arrive in Saudi Arabia until August 31, 2003.) According to  the Inspector General, DHS operations at the time of the review were not  as efficient or effective as they could be due to the use of temporary  officers in Saudi Arabia, a lack of specialized training and foreign language  proficiency, and the lack of a clear plan for the VSOs. The Inspector  General recommended that DHS hire permanent officers, develop a visa  security training program, and establish criteria for selecting VSOs.

In particular, the  consular sections in Riyadh and Jeddah have incorporated the VSOs\u2019  review of all visa applications into the adjudication process (see fig. 2).  After consular officers interview an applicant and review the relevant  supporting documentation, they make a preliminary determination about  whether to issue or refuse the visa or refer the case to Washington for  additional security clearances. Consular officers may consult with VSOs  during this initial determination. According to the VSOs, within 24 hours of  this initial determination by consular officers, they review the application  and inspect the applicant\u2019s documentation for evidence of fraud or  misrepresentation, indicators of potential national security risks, criminal  activity, and potential illegal immigration risks. VSOs may also query the  applicant\u2019s information against a number of law enforcement, immigration,  and other databases, which may contain more detail than the consular  officers\u2019 name check results. Based on these reviews, the VSOs will either  affirm or oppose the consular officer\u2019s original decision, and the consular  officer then decides to issue or deny the visa. If the consular section chief  and the VSOs disagree on a case, it is sent to DHS, where the Secretary of  Homeland Security, in consultation with State officials, will render a final  determination. According to a consular official in Saudi Arabia at the time  of our visit in February 2005, no case has ever been sent back to  Washington for such a decision.", "In addition to reviewing applications, the VSOs may conduct secondary  interviews with some visa applicants based either on findings from their  application reviews or a consular officer\u2019s request. For example, DHS  officials in Riyadh reported that the VSOs, in cooperation with intelligence  officials at post, interviewed an applicant who had ties to an organization  of national security concern to the U.S. government. This individual was  denied a visa after the interview based upon the VSO\u2019s determination of the  potential threat the individual posed to the United States.

Consular  officers rely on information contained in the Consular Lookout and  Support System (CLASS) to adjudicate a visa. As law enforcement agents,  the VSOs can access detailed criminal history records and immigration  information not included in CLASS. For example, the VSOs have access to  criminal history records contained in the National Crime Information  Center\u2019s Interstate Identification Index, which cannot be directly accessed  by consular officers. The VSOs also use databases containing information  on employers and businesses, hotel reservation information, and sponsors  of applicants seeking temporary work visas. They can use these databases  to verify, for instance, an applicant\u2019s claim to be working for a particular  business. Consular officials at headquarters and in the field believe this  data would be useful to them in the adjudication process, particularly at the  other posts worldwide that do not have VSOs.

In addition, the  VSOs in Riyadh conduct searches on applicants\u2019 names prior to their  interviews with consular officers and provide more detailed information on  potential matches obtained from these searches of law enforcement  databases. Consular officers indicated that this practice helps them tailor  their questioning of applicants.", "Furthermore, the VSOs in Saudi Arabia interact with consular officers on a  real-time basis.

In addition, VSOs have experience and  training in detecting fraudulent documents. The Memorandum of  Understanding between State and DHS states that VSOs at consular posts  will provide antifraud training to consular officers, among other things.  This training is particularly useful given that State does not have full-time  fraud prevention officers at all of its consular posts overseas, with  antifraud duties often performed by junior officers on a part-time basis.  Indeed, at all but one of the posts that have or plan to have VSOs, consular  officers served as part-time fraud prevention officers in addition to their  other duties in the consular section.

According to  the deputy chief of mission in Saudi Arabia, the use of temporary VSOs  led to a lack of continuity in visa security operations, and, as a result,  the VSOs initially were not able to significantly impact the visa process  at post. The constant turnover of officers can hinder the development of  institutional knowledge and overall visa security efforts. However, the  deputy chief of mission indicated that each subsequent temporary  officer improved operations in Saudi Arabia and enhanced security of  the visa adjudication process. DHS acknowledged that the reliance on  temporary detailed staff is not ideal for the continuity of operations and  the ongoing development of the Visa Security Program. DHS officials  believe that they have addressed the situation as DHS has hired and  trained four permanent employees who were deployed to Saudi Arabia  in June 2005, and will be assigned for a 12-month tour.", "Most of the VSOs stationed in Saudi Arabia since 2003 have not been  proficient Arabic speakers and, according to DHS, two of the four new  permanent staff assigned to Saudi Arabia speak Arabic. Additionally,  consuls general at three of the locations chosen for expansion told us  language proficiency would be beneficial at their posts, particularly for  interviewing applicants and reviewing applications and documents. The  ability to speak the host country language is a qualification for VSOs, as  agreed to in the Memorandum of Understanding with State. DHS  acknowledged the utility of language capability, but noted that law  enforcement skills and expertise outweigh the limitations of a lack of  language proficiency. According to DHS, if language training is deemed  necessary, such courses would be offered in addition to the standard  VSO training, which includes courses on interviewing, detection of  deception, and national security law, as well as regional and country  briefings.", "The Memorandum of Understanding between State and DHS states that  VSOs would provide training to consular officers on detecting  applicants who pose a threat to homeland security and fraudulent  documents; however, the requirement that VSOs review all visa  applications in Saudi Arabia limits the amount of time that they can  spend on training and other valuable services. We observed that VSOs in  Riyadh and Jeddah must spend a significant amount of time reviewing  all visa applications, including those of low-risk applicants or  individuals who do not pose a threat to national security, as well as  those that have preliminarily been refused by consular officers. For  example, according to DHS officials, lower priority applications may  include those from elderly applicants and very young children.  Furthermore, the requirement has resulted in extremely long work  hours for the VSOs. For example, to return applications to consular  officers within 24 hours of the initial decision, the three VSOs in Riyadh  and one VSO in Jeddah were each working 7 days per week at the time  of our visit. Moreover, the VSOs spend considerable time\u2014as much as 2  hours each day, according to one officer in Jeddah\u2014reviewing  applications that are preliminarily refused by consular officers or from  low-risk applicants. A Visa Security Program official noted that this  mandate is only for visa security operations in Saudi Arabia and not  other posts to which DHS plans to assign VSOs. At posts outside of  Saudi Arabia, DHS proposed the use of site-specific criteria to focus the  review of applications based on several factors, including the number of  applications at the post and post-specific threat assessments. VSOs,  DHS and State officials, and the deputy chief of mission all agreed that  the mandate to review all applications was forcing the VSOs to spend  time on lower priority tasks, limiting their ability to perform other  activities, such as providing training or conducting additional secondary  interviews of applicants. Consular officers also agreed that they would  benefit from additional training and other interaction with the VSOs.  According to DHS, if its VSOs were granted more flexibility to determine  the extent of their review and were not required to review all  applications, they could prioritize visa application reviews\u2014a process  which they plan to implement at other posts. DHS acknowledged that  adding additional officers to the posts in Saudi Arabia could allow VSOs  time to perform other tasks, but DHS would still need to prioritize these  resources to address training and other activities in Saudi Arabia.  However, security concerns at the U.S. embassy and consulate have  limited the number of personnel DHS, as well as other U.S. agencies, can  assign to these posts.", "DHS has not maintained measurable data to fully demonstrate the  impact of VSOs on the visa process. The VSOs that were stationed in  Riyadh during our visit estimated that, based on their review of visa  applications, they had recommended that visas be refused after the  preliminary decision to issue a visa by consular officers in about 15  cases between October 2004 and February 2005. In addition, the DHS  officials in Saudi Arabia and in Washington, D.C., were able to provide  anecdotal examples of assistance provided to the consular officers.

In June 2004, DHS originally requested the assignment of 21 VSO positions  to 5 posts. According to DHS, the request for the number of VSOs at each  post was based on the assessment of several factors including the  workload at post. However, chiefs of mission and consular officials also  told us that they were unclear about the number of VSOs required for visa  security operations and requested for assignment. DHS officials stated that  they had explained their rationale fully. As of June 2005, four posts had  approved the assignment of 13 VSO positions. Table 1 shows the number of  VSO positions requested compared to the number of VSO positions  approved by chiefs of mission.", "DHS received approval for 8 fewer VSO positions than it requested, and  received the full complement of staff requested at one expansion post.

For example, DHS  and embassy officials at one post agreed to reduce the number of positions  requested from 5 to 3; subsequently, the NSDD-38 request was approved in  March 2005. The deputy chief of mission and consul general at another  embassy noted that DHS\u2019s request for four VSOs appeared excessive,  considering the low volume of visas that are processed at that post, which  conducts about 30 to 40 applicant interviews daily, and that there are only  four consular officers stationed at the post. Therefore, the embassy  approved two VSOs in June 2005. The post that has not approved DHS\u2019s  request as of June 2005 proposed that DHS assign not four but one VSO for  a 6-month assignment. According to the chief of mission, during this time,  the VSO could demonstrate how the program would benefit the post, as  well as the need for the additional positions DHS requested.

This plan should incorporate the key elements  of strategic planning, including a mission statement, program goals and  objectives, approaches to achieving those goals, a connection between  the long-term and short-term goals, and a description of how the  effectiveness of the program will be evaluated. In addition, DHS should  include or develop supporting documents that provide more specific  information on the criteria used to select the locations for expansion,  justification for the number of VSOs at each post, the roles and  responsibilities of the VSOs in relation to other agencies located at post,  and the resources needed to establish the Visa Security Program  overseas.   develop performance data that can be used to assess the results of the  Visa Security Program at each post."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress may wish to consider amending current legislation, which  requires that VSOs in Saudi Arabia review all visa applications prior to  adjudication, to provide DHS the flexibility to determine the extent to  which VSOs review applications, based upon the development of a risk- assessment tool.

II and III).", "DHS stated it was taking actions to implement performance measurements  and a strategic plan for the Visa Security Program, as described in our  recommendations. DHS indicated that it is expanding the tracking and  measurement of performance data to better reflect program results. In  addition, DHS stated it is developing a strategic plan that will integrate the  key elements described in our recommendation; however, DHS stated that  it was unlikely that such a plan would have aided in the approval of the  NSDD-38 requests at the five expansion posts. We believe that a strategic  plan would allow DHS to better address questions about the program and  would be useful in guiding visa security operations in Saudi Arabia and  other consular posts. Regarding the matter for congressional consideration  to provide DHS with the flexibility to determine the review of visa  applications in Saudi Arabia, DHS agreed that it needed to expand some of  the VSOs\u2019 activities in Saudi Arabia, such as providing additional training,  which we found were not being provided because of the volume of work  that resulted from fulfilling the legislative requirement. DHS noted that a  legislative change should maintain DHS\u2019s authority and discretion in  determining the scope of the VSOs\u2019 review. DHS also provided additional  details on the Visa Security Program, its plans to improve operations, and  its interaction with State regarding program expansion. These comments  are reprinted in appendix II, along with our analysis. DHS also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated into the report, as  appropriate.", "State agreed with our conclusions, stating that the report is an accurate  description of the implementation of the Visa Security Program. In  addition, State agreed with our matter for congressional consideration.  State noted that the ability of the VSOs in Saudi Arabia to access law  enforcement and other databases not available to consular officers  highlights the importance of shared, interoperable databases worldwide.  With regard to the program\u2019s expansion outside Saudi Arabia, State also  noted that chiefs of mission and its Rightsizing Office are obligated to  ensure that staffing overseas for all agencies is at the proper level and  consistent with available space and resources. State\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of State and  Homeland Security, and to other interested Members of Congress.

In addition, we reviewed the subsequent September  2003 Memorandum of Understanding between State and DHS regarding the  implementation of the requirements set forth in section 428 of the  Homeland Security Act. We also reviewed a prior report from August 2004  on DHS\u2019s implementation of section 428 requirements, conducted by the  DHS Office of Inspector General, and spoke with the Inspector General  officials who conducted that review. We interviewed officials from DHS  who manage the Visa Security Program in Washington, D.C., as well as  officials from State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs and the Office of  Rightsizing the U.S. Overseas Presence. Moreover, we observed the VSOs\u2019  activities in Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and interviewed the VSOs, as  well as consular officials and the chief of mission, regarding the impact of  the Visa Security Program at these posts.", "To assess DHS\u2019s plans to expand the Visa Security Program to consular  posts outside Saudi Arabia, we reviewed documentation on the  department\u2019s requests to establish new positions at 5 additional posts and  spoke with DHS officials regarding the planned expansion. In addition, we  reviewed DHS\u2019s criteria for selecting VSOs and the criteria and  methodology for selecting expansion posts. We also compared DHS\u2019s  management strategy for the Visa Security Program and its expansion with  criteria from the Government Performance and Results Act and associated  GAO reports on performance-based, strategic planning. In addition, we  visited two of the five posts to which DHS plans to expand the Visa Security  Program and interviewed consular and embassy officials, including the  chiefs and deputy chiefs of mission, at these locations to discuss these  posts\u2019 plans for the VSOs. We also spoke with officials from other law  enforcement agencies at post who work with the consular section. Further,  we spoke with the consuls general from the other three posts initially  chosen for expansion in fiscal year 2005 to discuss the status of DHS plans  to expand to these locations.

We revised the highlights page to reflect that no comprehensive data  exists to demonstrate the impact of the VSOs in Saudi Arabia. 2. We requested documentation from DHS on the visa application reviews  conducted by VSOs in Saudi Arabia. DHS provided weekly operational  reports that contained descriptive examples of the reviews of visa  applications and the outcomes of those reviews. DHS did not provide  systematic data on the operations of the VSOs, and VSOs in Saudi  Arabia stated that they did not have a system in place to track the  activities of the program. The steps DHS describes appear to be  positive steps to incorporate performance measurement into the Visa  Security Program, and to implement a workload tracking database. We  believe these actions should allow DHS to better demonstrate program  results and are consistent with our recommendation. 3. We revise the report to clarify that VSOs may recommend a refusal after  a preliminary determination to issue the visa by a consular officer. We  agree that there might be additional cases where VSOs may influence  the decision of consular officers. We believe it is important to measure  other outcomes that demonstrate the impact of the Visa Security  Program. Furthermore, we believe that it is not difficult to track  additional data, and such performance measures should be  incorporated into the tracking system for VSO activities. 4. We do not agree that the statement was an error in syntax. We believe  that performance measurement is an integral part of effective program  management, and the lack of comprehensive data on program impact  has hindered the Visa Security Program. Performance data could be  used to demonstrate the effectiveness of operations in Saudi Arabia, as  well as to illustrate the benefits of the program when presenting the  benefits of the program to interested parties, including chiefs of  mission at future expansion posts and the Congress.", "5.", "In August 2004, the DHS Office of Inspector General found that the  continued use of temporary officers to fill VSO positions was not  conducive to developing an effective or efficient long-term visa security  operation. In addition, in February 2005, the deputy chief of mission in  Saudi Arabia told us that the use of temporary VSOs led to a lack of  continuity in operations, and that the VSOs initially were not able to  significantly impact the visa process at post. Our report recognized that  DHS assigned permanent officers to Saudi Arabia in June 2005. 6. We revised the figure to reflect that VSOs also conduct investigative  research on visa applicants in addition to conducting name checks. 7. Our report noted that, in addition to the quantitative data used as  preliminary selection criteria, DHS stated it used qualitative data and  other practical considerations in choosing the posts. DHS did not  provide this qualitative data nor the additional considerations used to  select expansion posts to GAO, and thus we were unable to assess the  additional criteria. We made an assessment based on the information  and data provided by DHS. 8. We believe that the development of a strategic plan would assist DHS  by providing stakeholders, such as State and chiefs of mission, with  information regarding the mission, goals and operations of the Visa  Security Program. A strategic plan may have helped to address the  questions raised by State and embassy officials that led to the delays in  the approvals of the NSDD-38 requests. In addition, we believe that a  strategic plan would expedite the approval of future NSDD-38 requests  for assignment of VSOs to consular posts. State officials support this  view.
