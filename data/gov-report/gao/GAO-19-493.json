These include the federal rulemaking process, meetings of the Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Committee, and ad-hoc communications with local pilotage stakeholders. Since 2016, when the Coast Guard implemented several programmatic changes, shipping industry stakeholders and pilots have identified a number of issues that they would like to have considered for the program. The issues cited by shipping industry stakeholders relate, in large part, to the financial impacts associated with the Coast Guard's methodology for calculating pilotage rates. The issues raised by Great Lakes pilots and their representatives are varied and include changes that may be needed to respond to the increasing volume and variety of vessels needing Great Lakes pilotage services, such as cruise ships.", "U.S. Pilot Associations in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway", "Shipping industry stakeholders and others have suggested potential alternatives to the structure and governance of Great Lakes pilotage. The proposed alternatives include consolidating the three U.S. pilot associations and districts, revising the existing governance structure and entities responsible for pilotage rate-setting, and introducing some level of competition for providing pilotage services. Each of these options presents various tradeoffs. For example, it is unclear if consolidating the three associations and districts would result in cost savings because there are relatively few administrative positions that could be reduced. According to the Coast Guard and pilot representatives, the specialized training and local experience needed to become registered pilots also presents a challenge to implementing competition because there is generally a limited supply of pilots available to compete in the same geographic area. Further, many of the governance structures and procedures of the existing Great Lakes pilotage system were established by statute and revisions would require legislative changes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway (Great Lakes-Seaway) maritime  transportation system, located in North America, is the longest inland  navigation system in the world. It includes the St. Lawrence River, the five  Great Lakes (Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior), and their  connecting system of channels and locks. The Great Lakes-Seaway  system extends 2,300 miles from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to Duluth,  Minnesota at the western end of Lake Superior. It serves more than 100  ports across eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The region\u2019s  maritime sector is a critical economic driver and provides an important  transportation route to the manufacturing and agricultural heartland of  North America. The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959  provided an accessible route to the Great Lakes for oceangoing  commercial vessels and resulted in a significant increase in shipping  traffic. As a result, congressional committees soon became concerned  that marine pilots on these oceangoing commercial vessels were not  operating with the same level of specialized local knowledge or skills as  Great Lakes pilots and presented a potential threat to maritime safety.", "The economic and environmental costs of a vessel collision or disaster on  the Great Lakes-Seaway, which also serves as the source of drinking  water for millions of people, could be catastrophic to the region. Since  1960, federal law has required that any oceangoing or foreign commercial  vessel that enters the Great Lakes-Seaway use a registered Great Lakes  marine pilot to board and safely navigate the vessel throughout the  system. United States and Canadian vessels that generally operate  within the Great Lakes-Seaway (commonly referred to as \u201clakers\u201d)  account for most of the commercial shipping on the Great Lakes-Seaway  and are not affected by this law. Registered Great Lakes marine pilots  provide a vital safety service by using their local knowledge, navigational  abilities, and ship handling expertise to guide vessels through the ports  and waterways of the Great Lakes-Seaway.", "Pilotage in the U.S. waters of the Great Lakes-Seaway falls under the  authority of the U.S. Coast Guard (part of the Department of Homeland  Security) through its Great Lakes Pilotage Program. This program is  unique in that the federal government has no role in managing pilotage  programs in any other U.S. waterways. Through this program, the Coast  Guard determines the total number of U.S. pilots needed and establishes  the rates for pilotage services to be paid by shippers, among other  regulatory activities. In 2016, the Coast Guard implemented a number of  programmatic changes, including a change to its methodology for setting  pilotage rates, which resulted in significantly increased pilotage rates in  some areas. Since that time, shipping industry stakeholders have raised  questions about the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to effectively manage the Great  Lakes Pilotage Program and the process it uses to address industry  stakeholders\u2019 input.

The key issues cited by shipping industry  stakeholders in recent years generally fall into four categories: (1)  financial oversight and cost accounting, (2) vessel traffic estimates, (3)  pilot compensation and staffing, and (4) billing and dispute resolution.  Some of these issues remain the subject of ongoing litigation initiated by  a coalition of shipping industry stakeholders against the U.S. Coast  Guard. (See appendix II for additional details on selected issues identified  by shipping industry stakeholders, including a summary of the specific  claims that are in litigation).", "Financial oversight and cost accounting. Since 2016, shipping  industry stakeholders have cited several issues regarding the timeliness  and transparency of financial information provided by the U.S. pilot  associations that is used during the rulemaking process. These issues  include a request for disclosure of individual pilot compensation levels,  and additional clarification and transparency regarding the use of the pilot  districts\u2019 working capital funds. For example, shipping industry  representatives claim that disclosure of individual pilot compensation  levels would help ensure that compensation practices remain fair and are  not a disincentive to attracting and retaining Great Lakes pilots. At the  September 2018 GLPAC meeting, a pilots\u2019 representative noted that this  information was previously provided for District 1, but was eliminated due  to concerns that the data could be used out of context. For example, this  individual stated that although all pilots in his association generally  receive the same rate of pay, some may obtain higher annual  compensation because of additional days worked. According to Coast  Guard officials, they do not collect or retain individual compensation data  on pilots; however, they do review such data during visits to the pilot  associations\u2019 offices to help ensure fair compensation practices.", "Vessel traffic estimates. In 2016, the Coast Guard began using a 10- year rolling average of Great Lakes-Seaway vessel traffic volumes to  estimate projected vessel traffic for each district in the coming year as  part of its annual pilotage rate-setting calculations. According to the  Coast Guard, this change was implemented to help reduce rate volatility  and remedy traffic overestimates that occurred in the past, largely based  on shipping industry projections. However, given the increasing volume of  vessel traffic on the Great Lakes-Seaway since the 2008-2009 recession,  shipping industry stakeholders contend that the 10-year rolling average  represents a significant underestimate of vessel traffic volume. For  example, in the 2017 shipping season, vessel traffic in 5 of the 6 pilotage  areas of the Great Lakes-Seaway exceeded the estimates (calculated  using a 10-year rolling average) by over 25 percent. According to its 2018  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Coast Guard noted that use of the  rolling average will result in pilots taking in more revenue than projected  in some years, and in other years will result in less revenue. Coast  Guard officials believe that, over the long term, this methodology will help  ensure infrastructure is maintained and that pilots receive adequate  compensation and rest between assignments to enhance pilot retention.  Shipping industry organizations challenged the Coast Guard\u2019s use of 10  years of traffic data in the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for  the District of Columbia in November 2018, and that case is ongoing.", "Pilot compensation and staffing needs. The data sources and  methodology used by the Coast Guard to develop a target compensation  benchmark for U.S. Great Lakes pilots have been subject to ongoing  disagreement among pilots and shipping industry stakeholders for several  years. Since 2016, the Coast Guard has used two primary data sources  as a basis for comparison\u2014the average compensation of Canadian Great  Lakes-Seaway pilots, and compensation data for first mates on domestic  Great Lakes vessels (lakers). Shipping industry stakeholders identified  concerns with some of the specific adjustments made by the Coast Guard  related to both of these data sources and filed complaints in 2016 and  2018 in federal court contesting the Coast Guard\u2019s methodology. A  related issue identified by shipping industry stakeholders concerns the  number of average pilot working days the Coast Guard uses to determine  the number of pilots needed each season. For example, the Coast Guard  uses 270 working days as a baseline to calculate pilot compensation  figures, but uses 200 working days to calculate staffing requirements so  as to account for a 10-day per month rest standard for pilots. The Coast  Guard states that this 10-day rest standard is not a requirement and  generally does not apply during the busiest times of the season. During  the busiest time, pilots generally remain available to work additional days  to service the increased vessel traffic on the Great Lakes-Seaway. The  2018 complaint filed by shipping industry stakeholders includes a claim  challenging the Coast Guard\u2019s use of a 270-working day assumption, and  that case is ongoing.", "Billing and dispute resolution. Other issues cited by shipping industry  stakeholders pertain to billings from pilot associations and the Coast  Guard\u2019s dispute resolution process. The primary billing issues cited by  shipping industry stakeholders since 2016 include an increase in the  number of tug boats requested, as well as cases where double pilotage  was employed that shipping industry officials did not believe were  necessary. In the case of tug boat usage, pilot representatives  acknowledged that there may have been an increase in tug boat usage,  but they noted that they do not have any financial incentive to call for the  use of tug boats and they only request them, in coordination with the  shippers\u2019 agents, when they deem them necessary. According to Great  Lakes Pilotage Program officials, the Coast Guard routinely reviews  inquiries from shippers on this issue, but noted that decisions to use tug  boats remain safety decisions that are made between the vessel  operators and the Great Lakes pilots. In contrast, authorizations for  double pilotage are provided on a case-by-case basis by the Director of  the Great Lakes Pilotage Program. According to the Coast Guard, there  were instances in which pilot associations charged for double pilotage  without obtaining authorization from the Director and, in such instances,  the Coast Guard has ruled in favor of vessel operators with regard to  billing disputes. Both of these issues were topics addressed at the  September 2018 GLPAC meeting, as well as discussion regarding  reasonable time frames for filing billing disputes. According to Great  Lakes Pilotage Program officials, some disputes were filed after an  extended period of time had elapsed, making it more difficult to adjudicate  the issues. For this reason, the Coast Guard reported that it is  considering introducing a maximum amount of time allowable for vessel  operators to initiate a billing dispute, and corresponding time frames for  pilot associations and the Coast Guard to respond and adjudicate,  respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Identified by Great Lakes Pilots and Their Representatives", "paragraphs": ["Issues raised by Great Lakes pilots and their representatives generally  include the following categories: (1) recognition of the pilots\u2019 unique  qualifications and role, (2) review of \u201cdesignated waters,\u201d and (3) review  of protocols for vessel priorities.", "Recognition of pilots\u2019 unique qualifications and role: Representatives  of the U.S. Great Lakes pilots state that the shipping industry remains  overly focused on pilotage costs and may fail to recognize the unique  qualifications that registered Great Lakes pilots possess and the  fundamental public interest the pilots serve by ensuring the safety of  vessel navigation and environmental protection on the Great Lakes- Seaway. The pilots noted that, in addition to the often challenging  weather conditions they face, they also serve a security role in that they  may be the only U.S. citizen on board to provide situational awareness to  U.S. authorities in the event of any suspicious activities given that foreign  vessels in the Great Lakes-Seaway can travel close to major  infrastructure and U.S. cities. The pilots also stated that it can be easy for  the shipping industry to select individual routes and billings to make a  case that U.S. pilots charge significantly more than their Canadian  counterparts, but they contend that is not an accurate picture of actual  system-wide costs.", "Review of designated waters: Great Lakes pilots commented that  \u201cdesignated water\u201d determinations have not been reviewed for over 50  years and they should be reassessed. In particular, pilots note that  increases in the volume and variety of vessels; as well as expanded port  infrastructure on the Great Lakes-Seaway since establishment of the  Great Lakes Pilotage Program in 1960, warrant the consideration of  additional areas as \u201cdesignated waters,\u201d which are generally more  challenging to navigate and require registered pilots to be in full  navigational control of the vessels at all times as they transit these  designated areas. For example, pilots contend that the Straits of  Mackinac and all ports on the Great Lakes-Seaway should be considered  designated waters. Coast Guard officials reported that it is their  understanding that masters are already relying on pilots to direct  navigation in waters such as the Straits of Mackinac. Additionally, the  officials stated that the Coast Guard does not have the authority to make  these designation changes through regulation; rather, such revisions  require a presidential declaration.", "Review of protocols for vessel priorities: Great Lakes pilots also  commented that increases in the volume and variety of vessel traffic on  the Great Lakes-Seaway in recent years may necessitate a review of the  first-come, first-served standard for assigning pilots to vessels. For  example, the pilots note that plans for increasing the volume of cruise  ships on the Great Lakes-Seaway may require adjustments to the priority  process for assigning pilots given that cruise ships are generally on fixed  itineraries and tight timelines.

Assuming that existing pilot boat operations would generally  remain consistent following district consolidation, administrative and  dispatch services represent the principal source of potential cost savings.", "Based on our review of the Canadian Great Lakes Pilotage Association  (GLPA) model, which operates a single, consolidated administrative  office, it is not clear that the number of administrative staff, including  dispatchers, would be reduced after consolidation of the three U.S.  pilotage districts and associations. For example, during the 2018 shipping  season, the Canadian Great Lakes Pilotage Association included 21  administrative positions, of which 10 were designated as dispatchers\u2014 which is similar in proportion to the existing U.S. Great Lakes Pilotage  dispatcher distribution.", "It is also important to note that even with a potential consolidation of  administrative functions within one U.S. pilotage district; pilots would still  be limited to operating within the geographic area where they are  licensed. According to pilots and Coast Guard program officials, cross- licensing is generally not feasible for multiple waterways between districts  given the extent of local specialized training and knowledge required and  is not practiced anywhere else in the United States or the Great Lakes- Seaway."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Some Pilotage Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Some shipping industry stakeholders state that a broader review of Great  Lakes pilotage requirements may be necessary, particularly the  compulsory use of pilots in \u201cundesignated\u201d or open areas of the Great  Lakes. According to these stakeholders, such a review is warranted  given the significant technology improvements that have occurred since  initial passage of the Great Lakes Pilotage Act in 1960. Any proposed  changes to the existing pilotage requirements could not be implemented  through Coast Guard regulatory changes and would require legislative  changes or a presidential declaration.", "Although a significant portion of a Great Lakes-Seaway vessel transit may  occur in \u201cundesignated\u201d open waters, the Coast Guard and pilots\u2019  representatives cited several logistical challenges that would likely occur  if pilotage requirements in these areas were revised or eliminated. For  example, if a pilot was not on board a vessel in open waters, there likely  would be no way to get one on board in the event of severe weather,  equipment failure, or other emergency. In addition, the officials noted that  if a pilot did not remain on board the vessel for the entire transit, one  would still be required to navigate the vessel in and out of each port  destination. This would entail additional costs for picking up the  disembarking pilot and transporting the pilot to a designated shore  location and then later to transport another pilot to the vessel to navigate  into port. These additional pilot transfers may require the acquisition of  additional pilot boats, which are generally customized and can cost in  excess of $1 million. Alternately, each individual port could employ its  own registered pilot and make the necessary infrastructure investments,  including pilot boats and related dispatch equipment, but the result could  be an overall increase in the number of pilots operating in the system,  which could also increase pilotage costs.", "Finally, an increasing number of vessels that otherwise are not compelled  to use pilots (e.g., domestic oil tankers) are requesting pilotage services  due, in part, to requirements by insurance providers. Because of this  increase in the requests for pilotage services, a change in open water  pilotage requirements may not result in a reduction in the number of pilots  required in some areas of the Great Lakes-Seaway."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transfer of the Pilotage Rate-Setting Function from the Coast Guard to a Different Entity", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establish a Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Board to Assist with Rate-Setting", "paragraphs": ["The report commissioned by the Conference of Great Lakes and St.  Lawrence Governors and Premiers cites an opportunity for enhanced  input into the governance process through the establishment of an  advisory board or other oversight mechanism, such as those used  commonly in state pilotage commissions nationwide. According to the  report, such a mechanism would provide for increased industry  participation in the governance process beyond the consultative inputs  currently available through the GLPAC and rulemaking processes, and  could include responsibility for the pilotage rate-setting function. The  principal advantage cited for this increased level of participation would be  to better align pilotage services with user needs.", "Under this proposal, an advisory board would be formed and the board  members would be involved in the full range of pilotage governance  functions as generally provided by state pilotage commissions. These  responsibilities commonly include safety oversight and related functions,  such as selecting individuals for admission into the training program,  overseeing the training process, issuing licenses, investigating accidents  or pilot complaints, taking disciplinary actions, and establishing pilotage  rates. All of these activities are current regulatory functions performed by  the Coast Guard and statutory changes would be required to designate a  new pilotage regulatory body and delineate these responsibilities. Given  that stakeholders we met with generally do not advocate for transferring  any of the safety oversight and related regulatory functions from the  Coast Guard, for the purposes of this report we will focus on the potential  tradeoffs associated with having an advisory board formed that would  only take responsibility for the Great Lakes pilotage rate-setting function  from the Coast Guard.", "With regard to the rate-setting function, the introduction of an advisory  board to determine pilotage rates may not improve one of the core issues  cited by both shipping industry and pilot stakeholders at the most recent  GLPAC meeting that was held in September 2018. That is, no matter  what entity has responsibility for pilotage rate-setting\u2014a new advisory  board or the Coast Guard\u2014such an entity would face similar rate-setting  challenges posed by the competing interests of pilots and shipping  industry representatives. Further, according to a recent report reviewing  the pilotage system in the state of Washington, proposed changes to  pilotage rates are often evenly split between shipping industry  representatives and pilot representatives and final determinations  routinely come down to committee chairpersons or independent board  members, sometimes without full transparency regarding how decisions  were reached. In contrast, the current GLPAC process provides for  considerable input by committee members, stakeholder and public  participation, and is documented through publicly available transcripts.

In fact, one of the principal  recommendations in the Washington report was to transfer the rate- setting function from the state pilotage commission to an independent  utility and transportation commission in an effort to establish a more  clearly defined, rigorous, and transparent process with enforceable  timelines. In many respects, we found that the Coast Guard is currently  performing this independent function as its rate-setting process includes  many of the characteristics identified as a best practice, such as a defined  methodology, clear data submission and review process, and the  absence of any direct material interest in the outcome of the rate  determinations.

Under this scenario, the  Coast Guard would retain its jurisdiction over safety and related  regulatory functions, but responsibility for pilotage rate-setting would be  transferred to another federal entity. One specific entity that has been  identified as a potential replacement for the Coast Guard is the Saint  Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC). According to  some stakeholders we spoke with, the SLSDC would have more of a  vested interest in ensuring that pilotage rate changes consider the  potential impact of such changes on the viability of commercial shipping in the Great Lakes-Seaway. SLSDC representatives declined to comment  specifically on this proposal, but they cited historical precedent to indicate  that if SLSDC were statutorily required to assume pilotage rate-setting  responsibilities, additional staffing resources would likely be needed.", "It should be recognized that shipping industry and pilotage stakeholders  will continue to have vested interests in each of the rate-setting inputs  and assumptions that are used to determine pilotage rates and some  degree of contention is likely to remain no matter the entity responsible. In  addition, pilots\u2019 representatives previously filed a complaint regarding the  transfer of pilotage rate-setting authority from the Coast Guard to the  SLSDC in the 1990s, and they told us that they continue to oppose such  a move. According to pilot representatives, they are concerned with a  potential transfer of the pilotage rate-setting function to SLSDC given its  role in trade promotion, which could potentially affect SLSDC\u2019s ability to  remain fully independent in this role.", "Whether the Coast Guard maintains responsibility for pilotage rate-setting  or that function is transferred to another federal entity like SLSDC, the  continued role of a federal entity in performing the pilotage rate-setting  process would ensure that Administrative Procedure Act requirements still  apply, thereby retaining transparency and providing stakeholders and the  public an opportunity for review and comment. While there may be some  potential for redundancy or increased administrative burden on the pilot  associations if the safety oversight and pilotage rate-setting functions  were split between the Coast Guard and another federal entity, similar  division of responsibilities currently exist in the handful of states that use  an independent rate-setting entity, such as a public utility commission. It  is the Coast Guard\u2019s position that authorizing two federal agencies to  oversee different aspects of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program could be  challenging. For example, Coast Guard officials noted that a transfer of  the rate-setting function may not consider potential impacts to other  authorities associated with rate setting, such as limiting the number of  pilot pools; prescribing a uniform system of accounts; performing audits;  determining the number of pilots to be registered; and establishing  conditions for services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to a Regulated Monopoly of Great Lakes Pilotage", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Government Employee Model", "paragraphs": ["The existing model of Great Lakes pilotage consisting of federal oversight  and economic regulation of independent pilot associations is referred to  as a regulated monopoly. This model of regulating pilotage is employed  almost exclusively within U.S. coastal states and is also a common  method for delivering marine pilotage services worldwide. However, there  is also some precedent for pilots serving as government employees.  One reason why this government employee model has been identified as  one potential alternative for U.S.-registered pilots in the Great Lakes- Seaway is because a majority of the Canadian pilots that operate in the  Great Lakes-Seaway are federal employees.", "Although making U.S. Great Lakes pilots federal employees could  eliminate the need for the Coast Guard to provide administrative and  financial oversight of independent pilots, we found that U.S. Great Lakes  pilot associations provide many administrative and logistical functions,  such as dispatching and pilot transfers, which would need to be assumed  by the federal government under this type of alternative model. According  to pilots\u2019 representatives, one of the principal impacts of the government  employee model would likely be the provision of some financial benefit to  the shipping industry, given that taxpayers would potentially be assuming  the cost of pilotage salaries, benefits, and retirement-related benefits.  Additional costs to the U.S. government would also likely be required to  fund initial procurement of existing pilot association infrastructure and  assets, such as offices and pilot boats.", "Another factor to consider in evaluating the pilots as federal employees  model involves how the Coast Guard budget process may also affect the  future funding and operation of pilotage operations. A significant  expansion of the pilotage program staffing and associated resource  requirements would likely pose an additional challenge to ensure  sufficient annual appropriations are obtained, given the ongoing need to  balance funding and resources across the Coast Guard\u2019s 11 statutory  missions.", "According to representatives of the Canadian Great Lakes Pilotage  Association, pilotage operations in their jurisdiction are to be financially  self-supporting through pilotage tariffs, and the Canadian government  does not provide an annual appropriation for this purpose. They noted  that government pension benefits are also incorporated into the pilotage  rates to help achieve these offsets. Similar mechanisms could also  potentially be used to fund the additional costs borne to the U.S.  government within a federal employee pilot model. Additional  considerations associated with a government employee model include the  different compensation and overtime structures, and the potential for  reduced flexibility afforded to the government if fewer numbers of pilots  are needed due to reduced pilotage demand. For example, according to  representatives of the U.S. pilot associations, each pilot presently  receives the same compensation for each working day they are available,  regardless of seniority. However, the U.S. federal government routinely  employs a system of graduated compensation based on years employed  and may face difficulties in hiring or terminating pilot employees if  necessary due to shifting pilotage demand.", "Another approach identified within the government employee model is the  use of harbor pilots. This option would generally entail pilots working  directly for an individual or group of ports as municipal or port employees.  According to one pilot representative, the key challenge identified with  such an approach is that individual ports would each require its own  infrastructure and pilot boats to service incoming vessels, which could  represent a substantial investment. In addition, the geography of the  Great Lakes and the long transits many times involved present additional  hurdles associated with pilot transfers and related logistical support  services make the harbor pilot approach less feasible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competition for Pilotage Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["Shipping industry stakeholders have also proposed that the Coast Guard  consider the introduction of some level of competition for pilotage service  delivery, which would represent the most significant change to the  existing model of pilotage regulation. According to shipping industry  stakeholders, the introduction of competition would be intended to provide  an additional incentive for pilot associations to contain costs. Some  specific mechanisms identified include introducing a competitive bidding  process to provide pilotage services under multi-year contracts, or  allowing individual pilots or groups of pilots to compete for business from  vessel operators. The concept of using some form of competitive bidding  to grant multi-year contracts for pilotage service delivery is generally  consistent with government cost-containment efforts. However,  stakeholders we spoke with were unable to identify any pertinent  examples where market competition for pilotage services was currently  used within U.S. coastal states to provide a basis for further evaluation of  this model.", "According to the Coast Guard and pilot representatives, several features  of the Great Lakes-Seaway pilotage system present challenges for  potentially implementing competitive pilotage services in the Great Lakes- Seaway. Most notably, the nature of marine pilotage requires several  years of specialized training and local experience that entail significant  time and investment to acquire. These requirements generally result in a  limited supply of available pilots that could compete for a competitive  contract in the same geographical area. This represents a potential  barrier to market entry and could lead to a single, entrenched service  provider, which may reduce the competitive pressure toward cost  containment. Further, if registered pilots did not have the assurance of  steady employment in the Great Lakes, there may be increased  incentives for them to seek opportunities outside of the region, thereby  reducing the overall pool of available pilots.", "Other mechanisms of pilotage competition, such as allowing individual  pilots or pilot associations to compete for business, would represent a  fundamental shift from the norms of compulsory pilotage services  worldwide. As a representative of the American Pilots Association stated  at the September 2018 GLPAC meeting, one of the foundations of the  existing regulated monopoly system is that pilots provide services using  their independent judgement to ensure marine safety and the public  interest and should not be subject to any potential financial incentive or  business pressure from a vessel operator. Similar statements can be  seen in Florida state statutes, which specify the need for economic  regulation of marine pilotage at the state level, rather than competition in  the marketplace, to better serve and protect the public health, safety, and  welfare. In contrast, shipping industry stakeholders suggest that there  are likely comparisons to the deregulation implemented in other industries  where public safety is also of paramount concern, such as commercial  aviation. However, an evaluation of models of competition used in other  industries was outside the scope of our review. An additional challenge  noted by pilot representatives is that, in a competitive model, pilots may  prefer to pursue customers offering more regular or profitable work rather  than operate in a non-discriminate manner as is currently the case under  the existing numbered rotation system of pilotage assignment.", "Along these lines, research conducted by KPMG on international models  of marine pilotage, found that although a model \u201ccomprised of  independent contractor pilots could result in theoretically more  competitive rates, the combination of what appears to be relatively the  same demand for pilotage services in the market, and the uniqueness of  pilot skillsets have resulted in a scenario where competition is limited in  reality.\u201d The authors\u2019 findings also suggest that, in the few cases where  competitive pilotage was introduced, it was generally unsuccessful; and  that absent sufficient oversight, direct competition among pilots could  potentially lead to incentives to cut costs through reduced focus on safety  and quality of service."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In May 2019, we provided a draft of this report to the Department of  Homeland Security and the Coast Guard for review and comment.

For the 2018 shipping season, these base pilotage rates ranged  from $271 to $653 per pilot hour depending on the specific areas where  pilotage service is provided. According to the Coast Guard, the three  U.S. pilot associations use this revenue to cover operating expenses,  compensate working pilots, maintain infrastructure, such as pilot boats,  dispatch equipment, and personal pilotage units; and train new pilots.  The Coast Guard uses the following 10-step methodology to calculate  revenues needed for each Great Lakes pilotage association based on the  estimated volume of foreign vessel traffic for the upcoming shipping  season.", "Step 1 \u2013 Recognize previous operating expenses. The Director of the  Great Lakes Pilotage Program reviews audited operating expenses from  each of the three U.S. Great Lakes pilot associations. This number forms  the baseline amount that each association is budgeted. There is a 3-year  delay between the year the expenses were incurred and when they are  included in the rate-setting calculation. For example, the 2019 pilotage  rates are calculated using 2016 operating expenses.", "Step 2 \u2013 Project operating expenses, adjusting for inflation or  deflation. The Coast Guard applies 3 years of inflation adjustors to the  baseline of operating expenses identified in Step 1. The inflation adjustors  routinely used are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price  Index.", "Step 3 \u2013 Estimate the number of working pilots. The Coast Guard  determines the number of working pilots that need to be compensated via  collection of pilotage fees. As part of this step, the Coast Guard also uses  a \u201cstaffing model\u201d to determine how many pilots may be needed for each  district to handle expected shipping traffic at the beginning and close of  the season. According to the Coast Guard, this number helps inform the  Director of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program regarding how many total  pilot credentials may be authorized for each district to help meet future  demand.", "Step 4 \u2013 Determine target pilot compensation. This step contains two  phases to determine the revenue needed for pilot compensation. In the  first phase, the Coast Guard determines a target \u201ccompensation  benchmark\u201d for each of the working pilots. For the 2018 shipping season,  this number was derived from 2015 data provided by the American  Maritime Officers Union regarding labor contracts, along with annual  inflation adjustments deemed applicable by the Director. The second  phase entails multiplying this compensation figure by the number of  working pilots in each pilotage district and area.", "Step 5 \u2013 Project working capital fund.

The Director of the Great Lakes  Pilotage Program adds the total values produced for operating expenses,  total pilot compensation, and the working capital fund.

The Coast Guard modifies the  base rate to account for the extra revenue generated by the weighting  factors. This is done by dividing the initial base rate by the average  weighting factor to produce a revised rate.", "Step 10 \u2013 Review and finalize rates.

Shipping  industry stakeholders suggest that the Coast Guard make an effort to  reduce the 3-year time lag to incorporate pilotage expenses into the  rate-setting calculations. For example, audited financial information for  the 2016 shipping season is used in the development of the 2019  rulemaking. At the most recent GLPAC meeting in September 2018,  Coast Guard representatives identified several reasons for this time  lag, including about 6 months required for an auditor to conduct an  independent review of pilotage expenses and multiple stages of  federal review that can take an additional 6 months for the Coast  Guard to develop and publish the proposed rate in the Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking each year. Pilot representatives and Coast  Guard officials generally agree that shortening this lag would be  preferable, but are unable to identify a method by which this could be  achieved given the existing time frames required for the financial  auditing and rulemaking processes.", "Uniform format for financial reporting. Shipping industry  stakeholders have requested that audited financial statements for the  pilot associations be presented in a uniform format. According to an  industry representative, the audited financial statements (prepared  individually by each pilotage association each year after the shipping  season) differ primarily due to the standard accounting practices of  the different organizational structures. Specifically, two pilot  associations are partnerships and one is a corporation. Our review  indicates that a consistent format is used by the Coast Guard and its  designated independent reviewer to present summary information of  applicable expenses for all three pilot associations as part of the  rulemaking process.", "Public reporting of individual pilot compensation. Shipping  industry stakeholders contend that individual pilotage compensation  levels should be disclosed to help ensure revenues are being shared  equally among the associations\u2019 workforce. According to one pilot  representative, individual compensation data were previously  provided for District 1 as part of audited financial statements, but was  eliminated because the information was being used out of context.  The pilot representative noted that although all pilots in his association  generally receive the same rate of pay, some may obtain higher  annual compensation due to additional days worked. According to  Coast Guard officials, they do not collect or retain individual  compensation data on the pilots, but they do review such data during  visits to the pilot association offices to help ensure fair compensation  practices.", "Enhanced transparency of the working capital fund. Members of  the shipping industry also identified an issue related to the \u201cworking  capital\u201d component of the rate-setting process. According to these  stakeholders, this fund could potentially be used to augment general  revenue and compensation levels and there is a lack of transparency  regarding how these funds are being applied to fund capital  improvements. This position was the basis of one of the claims  included in the complaint filed by a coalition of industry stakeholders  in November 2018. In that complaint, the plaintiffs claim that the  Coast Guard\u2019s failure to eliminate the working capital element as a  basis for additional revenue requirements or to bound revenue raised  as working capital to particular uses is arbitrary and capricious,  among other things. That case is ongoing. According to pilots\u2019  representatives, this fund is important to help fund capital  improvements, particularly through the winter months, but they also  recognize that additional clarity could be provided about its intended  uses and potential limitations. In November 2018, the Coast Guard  issued guidance to each of the pilotage association\u2019s presidents  regarding the reporting and uses of the working capital fund.  Specifically, the Coast Guard directed the associations to segregate  revenues generated by this fund and place them into a separate  account at least once per quarter, and further clarified that funds from  this account could be applied only toward capital projects,  infrastructure improvements/maintenance, and non-recurring  technology purchases necessary for providing pilotage services.", "In 2016, the Coast Guard initiated changes to its rate-setting methodology  regarding how it estimates projected vessel traffic for each district and the  corresponding hours worked for related pilotage services. Citing a  recommendation issued by the Great Lakes Pilotage Advisory Committee  in 2014, the Coast Guard initially proposed using a rolling average of 5  years of historical shipping data to estimate traffic volume as part of its  ratemaking calculations for the 2016 shipping season. However, based  on public comments received on the 2016 Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, the Coast Guard increased this number to 10 years of  historical data. According to the Coast Guard, this change was  implemented to further reduce rate volatility and help remedy traffic  overestimates that occurred in the past, largely based on industry  projections.", "Given the increasing volume of actual Great Lakes-Seaway vessel traffic  in recent years, shipping industry stakeholders contend that the 10-year  rolling average used for rate-setting calculations represents an  underestimate of traffic volume. Responding to the 2018 Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking, industry commenters asserted that the 10-year  average included a period of substantially depressed traffic volume  caused by the recession in 2008-2009, which if used to estimate future  traffic volume could result in increased pilotage rates. See Table 1 for a  summary of the variance between actual traffic volumes during the 2017  Great Lakes-Seaway shipping season compared with the estimates  calculated using a 10-year rolling average.", "In the November 2018 complaint, shipping industry organizations argued  that the Coast Guard\u2019s use of 10 years of traffic data, in contrast with the  shorter periods used to determine expenses and manning levels, was  arbitrary and capricious, among other things, and that case is ongoing.", "The process and sources used by the Coast Guard to develop a target  compensation benchmark for Great Lakes pilots have been subject to  ongoing disagreement among stakeholders. Prior to 2016, the Coast  Guard used compensation data for first mates on domestic Great Lakes  vessels as the basis for comparison. This data was based on labor  contracts of the American Maritime Officers Union (AMOU). However, in  2016, when the AMOU determined it would no longer provide this data to  the Coast Guard, program officials revised the rate-setting methodology  to begin using the average compensation of Canadian vessel pilots as the  primary source, along with a 10 percent adjustment that program officials  believed was appropriate to reflect the different level of benefits provided  to Canadian pilots as government employees. After the court found that  the 10 percent adjustment to the Canadian compensation level  benchmark was not supported by reasoned decision-making and  remanded the matter to the Coast Guard, for the 2018 rulemaking, the  Coast Guard reverted to using the pre-2016 compensation data of  domestic \u201claker\u201d first mates. However, the November 2018 complaint  included a claim that the Coast Guard improperly applied an adjustment  of \u201cguaranteed overtime\u201d to the compensation benchmarks based on  additional input provided by the AMOU during the notice and comment  period. This case is ongoing. Regardless of the basis used, the  benchmark pilot compensation levels have not varied greatly in recent  years after accounting for annual inflation adjustments. That is, target  compensation in 2016 was $326,114 and has increased to $359,887 in  2019, an average annual increase of approximately 3.3 percent.", "One related change implemented by the Coast Guard in 2016 that can  also affect pilot compensation figures includes the determination to  calculate pilotage rates based on the actual number of working Great  Lakes pilots rather than the total number authorized. For example, in  2019 there were 54 total authorized U.S.-registered Great Lakes pilots,  but only 51 were actually employed and available to provide pilotage  services. According to the Coast Guard, this change serves, in part, to  remove any financial incentive of pilot associations to operate with fewer  pilots than allowable to increase individual compensation levels.", "The shipping industry has also identified issues regarding the number of  working days the Coast Guard uses to calculate compensation figures  and its application of a 10-day per month rest standard for pilots. For  example, in 2016, the Coast Guard began using 200 working days per  season as the basis for staffing calculations\u2014down from 270\u2014to allow  for up to 10-days of rest per month. According to the Coast Guard, this  change was made, in part, to address recommendations from the  National Transportation Safety Board regarding reducing possible \u201cpilot  fatigue.\u201d However, shipping industry stakeholders have suggested that if  200 days is the benchmark for working days, it should also be used to  determine pilot compensation levels. Instead, the Coast Guard multiplies  the weighted daily rate derived from AMOU compensation data by 270 to  calculate the target annual compensation. This issue is also the subject of  a claim included in the 2018 complaint, which alleges that the Coast  Guard\u2019s use of the 270-day multiplier value is arbitrary and capricious,  among other things. The shipping industry stakeholders further contend  that the 10-day rest standard may need to be revisited to ensure  adequate pilot availability and avoid any unnecessary increases in total  pilot numbers. The Coast Guard states that this 10-day rest standard is  not a requirement and generally does not apply during the busiest times  of the season, when pilots would remain available to work additional days  to service increased vessel traffic on the Great Lakes-Seaway.", "Billing Concerns and Dispute Resolution  There is ongoing concern among shipping industry stakeholders about  certain billings from pilot associations they view as unnecessary and the  Coast Guard\u2019s dispute resolution process. The primary billing issues cited  by shipping industry stakeholders since 2016 include an increase in the  number of tug boats requested, as well as cases where double pilotage  was employed that vessel operators did not believe were necessary. In  the case of tug usage, pilot representatives generally recognize an  increase in tug usage but respond that they do not have any financial  incentive to call for the use of tug boats and that pilots only request them,  in coordination with the shippers\u2019 agents, when they are deemed  necessary. Pilot representatives at the 2018 GLPAC meeting also stated  that tug boats represent additional insurance to avoid any potential  collisions in an increasingly risk-averse environment. Further, they noted  that the newer pilots that have come onboard in recent years may also be  a contributing factor for an increase in tug usage. According to the Coast  Guard, the program routinely reviews inquiries from shippers and masters  on this issue, but decisions to use tug boats remain safety decisions  between the master and pilot.", "In contrast, authorizations for double pilotage are provided on a case-by- case basis by the Director of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program as  specified in regulation. In general, the Director may authorize double  pilotage when aids-to-navigation have been removed due to ice and  weather conditions, dead ship tows, adverse weather and sea conditions,  or any abnormal condition that will likely result in extended transits in  designated waters. According to the Coast Guard, there were instances in  which pilot associations charged for double pilotage without obtaining  authorization from the Director of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program. In  such cases, the Coast Guard has ruled in favor of vessel operators with  regard to billing disputes.", "According to Great Lakes Pilotage Program officials, if vessel operators  believe a billing error was made, they should first engage directly with the  respective pilot association to review the charges and rectify any  mistakes. If no agreement is reached with the pilot association, then the  vessel operator can make an appeal to the Coast Guard to conduct a  further review. If the Coast Guard review determines that a chargeback is  justified, they can issue an advisory opinion that the pilot association  refund any amount not approved by the Coast Guard or reissue the bill.  At the September 2018 GLPAC meeting, Coast Guard representatives  noted that some billing concerns were presented after more than 2 years  and did not include sufficient details to effectively review and make an  informed decision. The Coast Guard is currently working on a proposal to  establish reporting timelines for presenting and making determinations on  billing disputes.", "Another billing concern cited by industry stakeholders at the 2018 GLPAC  meeting includes objections to an absence of limits to charges when  pilots are onboard a vessel but it cannot get underway due to inclement  weather or for other reasons. Pilot representatives point out that such  delays consume pilotage resources and the charges are needed to  provide an incentive for shippers and agents to remain efficient when  ordering and releasing a pilot. Shipping industry stakeholders note that  there are a range of factors that can cause a pilot to be detained onboard  and the charges, which can exceed $20,000 per day, are unreasonable  and represent a large, unforeseen cost. According to Coast Guard  officials, they plan to continue engagement with GLPAC members on this  issue, recognizing that pilot resources should be employed efficiently, but  also that weather/ice conditions may require pilots to remain onboard a  vessel for an extended period of time at significant additional cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christopher Conrad (Assistant  Director), Ryan Lambert (Analyst-in-Charge), Chuck Bausell, Dominick  Dale, Michele Fejfar, Eric Hauswirth, and Tracey King made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway serves more than 100 ports and supplies drinking water for millions of people.

This report discusses these options. Industry, for example, has urged opening pilot services to market competition. Coast Guard officials and pilots told us competition would be difficult because of the specialized training and local experience pilots need."]}
