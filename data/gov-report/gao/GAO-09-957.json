As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the Medicaid program will receive about $87 billion in federal assistance based on a greater federal share of Medicaid spending. GAO was asked to determine (1) whether there are indications of fraud and abuse related to controlled substances paid for by Medicaid; (2) if so, examples of fraudulent, improper, and abusive activity; and (3) the effectiveness of internal controls that the federal government and selected states have in place to prevent fraud and abuse related to controlled substances. To meet these objectives, GAO analyzed Medicaid controlled substance claims for fraud and abuse indications for FY 2006 and 2007 from five selected states. GAO also interviewed federal and state officials and performed investigations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found tens of thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries and providers involved in potential fraudulent purchases of controlled substances, abusive purchases of controlled substances, or both through the Medicaid program in California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas. About 65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in the five selected states acquired the same type of controlled substances from six or more different medical practitioners during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 with the majority of beneficiaries visiting from 6 to 10 medical practitioners. Such activities, known as doctor shopping, resulted in about $63 million in Medicaid payments and do not include medical costs (e.g., office visits) related to getting the prescriptions. In some cases, beneficiaries may have justifiable reasons for receiving prescriptions from multiple medical practitioners, such as visiting specialists or several doctors in the same medical group. However, GAO found that other beneficiaries obtained these drugs to support their addictions or to sell on the street. In addition, GAO found that Medicaid paid over $2 million in controlled substance prescriptions during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that were written or filled by 65 medical practitioners and pharmacies barred, excluded, or both from federal health care programs, including Medicaid, for such offenses as illegally selling controlled substances. Finally, GAO found that according to Social Security Administration data, pharmacies filled controlled substance prescriptions of over 1,800 beneficiaries who were dead at that time. GAO performed in-depth investigations on 25 Medicaid cases and found fraudulent, improper, or abusive actions related to the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances. These investigations uncovered other issues, such as doctors overprescribing medication and writing controlled substance prescriptions without having required DEA authorization. States are primarily responsible for the fight against Medicaid fraud; however, the selected states did not have a comprehensive fraud prevention framework to prevent fraud and abuse of controlled substances. CMS is responsible for overseeing state fraud and abuse control activities but has provided limited guidance to the states to prevent fraud and abuse of controlled substances."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health care for  certain categories of low-income individuals, including children, families,  persons with disabilities, and persons who are elderly. The federal  government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national  average per capita income. The amount of federal assistance states receive  for Medicaid service expenditures is known as the Federal Medical  Assistance Percentage (FMAP).", "As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,  Congress recently increased the federal share of the FMAP for eligible  states through December 2010. Generally, for fiscal year 2009 through the  first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased FMAP, which is calculated  on a quarterly basis, provides for (1) the maintenance of states\u2019 prior year  FMAPs; (2) a general across-the-board increase of 6.2 percentage points in  states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further increase to the FMAPs for those states  that have a qualifying increase in unemployment rates. The estimated total  increase in the federal share of Medicaid spending is about $87 billion. One  significant cost to the Medicaid program is prescription drugs. During  fiscal year 2008, prescription drugs accounted for over $23 billion of the  costs in the Medicaid program, or about 7 percent of total federal and state  Medicaid outlays.", "Prescription drug abuse is a serious and growing public health problem.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention drug  overdoses, including those from prescription drugs, are the second leading  cause of deaths from unintentional injuries in the United States, exceeded  only by motor vehicle fatalities. Unlike addiction to heroin and other drugs  that have no accepted medical use, addiction to some controlled  substances can be financed by insurance and public programs such as  Medicaid. There are reports and allegations that criminals and drug  abusers are able to illegitimately acquire controlled substances by filing  fraudulent Medicaid claims, seeking treatment from medical practitioners  for feigned injuries and illnesses, and perpetrating other fraudulent  activities. The cost associated with controlled substance fraud and abuse  is more than the cost of drug purchases since there are related medical  services, such as doctor and emergency room visits, that precede the  dispensing of these medications. Several criminal cases highlight Medicaid  fraud and abuse related to controlled substances.", "An Ohio physician was convicted in 2006 for filing $60 million in  fraudulent Medicaid, Medicare, and other insurance claims. The  physician, a pain management specialist, prescribed multiple injections  of controlled substances for his patients. He then billed Medicaid and  the other insurance plans for those treatments. The physician was  found to have fostered an addiction to controlled substances in his  patients so that he could profit from their habit and increase the  income he received from their medical claims. Two patients who  regularly saw him died under his care, one from a multiple-drug  overdose in the physician\u2019s office and one from an overdose of  OxyContin taken on the same day that the prescription was written.  The physician was sentenced to life in prison.", "In 2006, a Florida physician was sentenced to life in prison following  his conviction on multiple charges, including wire fraud, illegal  distribution of controlled substances, and Medicaid fraud. The  physician, a general practitioner, wrote excessive prescriptions to  patients for controlled substances without giving them physical  examinations or additional follow-up treatments. The physician  directed patients to have their prescriptions filled at specific  pharmacies and warned them against filling their prescriptions at  pharmacies that would ask too many questions about the quantity and  combination of controlled substances prescribed. In fact, the physician  was found to have known some of his patients were addicts feeding  their drug habits. Five of his patients died from taking drugs he  prescribed.", "During 2004 to 2005, a pharmacist created false telephone  prescriptions for Vicodin, an addictive narcotic pain reliever that  combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen, and provided thousands  of the pills to at least two purported customers. The pharmacist also  submitted false claims for the drugs to Medicaid and other insurance  companies, stating that they were prescribed for legitimate patients.  The customers were actually friends of the pharmacist who sold the  drugs and split the profits with him. In 2009, the pharmacist was  convicted of health care fraud, Medicaid fraud, and distribution of  dangerous controlled substances.", "You asked us to determine whether there is fraud and abuse related to  controlled substances in the Medicaid program. Specifically, this report  discusses (1) continuing indications of fraud and abuse related to  controlled substances paid for by Medicaid; (2) specific case study  examples of fraudulent, improper, and abusive controlled substance  activity; and (3) the effectiveness of internal controls that the federal  government and selected states have in place to prevent and detect fraud  and abuse related to controlled substances.", "To identify whether there are continuing indications of fraud and abuse  related to controlled substances paid for by Medicaid, we obtained and  analyzed Medicaid claims paid in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 from five  states: California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, and Texas.  Prescription drug payments to these states constituted over 40 percent of  all Medicaid prescription drug payments made during fiscal years 2006 and  2007. These states were primarily selected based on the magnitude of  Medicaid payments for prescription drugs. To identify indications of fraud  and abuse related to controlled substances paid for by Medicaid, we  obtained Medicaid prescription claims data for these five states from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). For indications of  doctor shopping, we selected 10 types of controlled substances and the  criteria of using at least six different medical practitioners based on our  review of drug diversion literature and discussions with a criminal  investigator whose recognized expertise is drug diversion. To determine  the total number of different prescribers a beneficiary visited, we  identified and totaled the number of different prescribers shown on each  beneficiary\u2019s claims data. Because the Medicaid prescription claims  databases did not track doctors who practiced in groups, we could not  determine the amount of duplication caused by this factor. To identify  other potential fraud and improper payments, we compared the  beneficiary and prescriber shown in the Medicaid claims data to the death  master files from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify  deceased beneficiaries and prescribers. To identify claims that were  improperly processed and paid by the Medicaid program because the  federal government had banned these prescribers and pharmacies from  prescribing or dispensing to Medicaid beneficiaries, we compared the  Medicaid prescription claims to the exclusion and debarment files from  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector  General (OIG) and the General Services Administration (GSA).", "To develop specific case study examples in selected states, we identified  25 cases that illustrate the types of fraudulent, improper, and abusive  controlled substance activity we found in the Medicaid program. To  develop these cases, we interviewed pharmacy employees, prescribers,  law enforcement officials, and beneficiaries, as appropriate. We also  obtained and reviewed registration and enforcement action reports from  the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and HHS.", "To identify the effectiveness of internal controls that the federal  government and selected states have in place to prevent and detect fraud  and abuse related to controlled substances, we interviewed Medicaid  officials from the selected state offices and CMS. In addition, we obtained  and reviewed the appropriate policies and procedures related to  controlled substances at the selected states.

Schedule II drugs\u2014 including methylphenidate (Ritalin) and opiates such as morphine and  oxycodone\u2014have high potential for abuse and abuse may lead to severe  psychological or physical dependence, but have currently accepted  medical uses. Drugs on Schedules III through V have medical uses and  successively lower potentials for abuse and dependence. Schedule III  drugs include anabolic steroids, codeine, hydrocodone in combination  with aspirin or acetaminophen, and some barbiturates. Schedule IV  contains such drugs as the anti-anxiety medications diazepam (Valium)  and alprazolam (Xanax). Schedule V includes preparations such as cough  syrups with codeine.

Any  person who manufactures, dispenses, imports, exports, or conducts  research with controlled substances must register with DEA (unless  exempt), keep track of all stocks of controlled substances, and maintain  records to account for all controlled substances received, distributed, or  otherwise disposed of. Although all registrants, including pharmacies, are  required to maintain records of controlled substance transactions, only  manufacturers and distributors are required to report their Schedule I and  II drugs and Schedule III narcotics drug transactions,  including sales to  the retail level, to DEA.

Thus, for the five state  programs we reviewed, we found different levels of fraud prevention  controls. For example, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990  encourages states to establish a Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Program.  The main emphasis of the program is to promote patient safety through an  increased review and awareness of prescribed drugs. States receive  increased federal funding if they design and install a point-of-sale  electronic prescription claims management system to interact with their  Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS), each state\u2019s Medicaid  computer system. Each state was given considerable flexibility in how to  identify prescription problems, such as therapeutic duplication and  overprescribing by providers, and how to use MMIS to prevent such  problems. The level of screening, if any, states perform varies because  CMS does not set minimum requirements for the types of reviews or edits  that are to be conducted on controlled substances.

Officials from the  other states generally use the prospective screening as  more of an advisory tool for pharmacies, which pharmacies  can override by entering a reason code. As such, the  effectiveness of the tool for preventing fraud and abuse in  these states is more limited.", "The types of drugs that require prior authorization vary  greatly between the selected states. In states where it is  used, health care providers may be required to obtain prior  authorization if a specific brand name is prescribed (e.g.,  OxyContin) or if a dosage exceeds a predetermined amount  for a therapeutic class of controlled substances (e.g.,  hypnotics, narcotics).", "Detection and monitoring: Even with effective preventive controls,  there is risk that fraud and abuse will occur in Medicaid regarding  controlled substances. States must continue their efforts to monitor the  execution of the prescription program, including periodically matching  their beneficiary files to third-party databases to determine continued  eligibility, monitor controlled substance prescriptions to identify abuse,  and make necessary corrective actions. Such actions include the  following.", "Checking death files: After enrolling beneficiaries, Medicaid offices  in the selected states generally did not periodically compare their  information against death records. Specifically, two of the five selected  states said that they did not obtain death records from SSA or the state  vital statistics office to determine if a Medicaid beneficiary was still  alive. Officials from two states said that Medicaid offices primarily rely  on obituaries, providers, family members, or others to report the status  change of the beneficiary.", "Increasing the use of the restricted recipient program: In the  course of DURs or audits, the state Medicaid offices may identify  beneficiaries who have abused, the Medicaid prescription drug  program, defrauded the program, or both. In those cases, the selected  states may place the beneficiaries into a restricted recipient program.  Under this program, the state Medicaid office restricts the  beneficiaries to one health care provider, one pharmacy, or both for  receiving prescriptions. This program only applies to those  beneficiaries in a fee-for-service arrangement since managed care  organizations are responsible for determining the quality of care  treatments for their enrollees. Thus, a significant portion of the  Medicaid recipients for some of the selected states are not subject to  this program.", "Fully utilizing the prescription drug monitoring program:  Beginning in fiscal year 2002, Congress appropriated funding to the  Department of Justice to support prescription drug monitoring  programs (PDMP). These programs help prevent and detect the  diversion and abuse of pharmaceutical controlled substances,  particularly at the retail level where no other automated information  collection system exists. States that have implemented PDMPs have  the capability to collect and analyze data on filled and paid  prescriptions more efficiently than those without such programs,  where the collection of prescription information can require a time- consuming manual review of pharmacy files. If used properly, PDMPs  are an effective way to identify and prevent diversion of the drugs by  health care providers, pharmacies, and patients. The PDMPs at the  selected states have the following limitations:", "For PDMPs to be useful, health care providers and  pharmacies must use the data. Officials from the five  selected states said that physician participation in the  PDMP is not widespread and not required. In fact, one state  did not have a Web-based PDMP; a health care provider has  to put in a manual request to the agency to have a  controlled substance report generated.", "Program officials at the selected states said that their  systems were primarily used to respond to requests for  controlled substance information on specific patients from  medical practitioners. None of the selected states  compared all the prescribers of controlled substances to  the DEA authorization list to identify medical practitioners  who are illegally prescribing drugs that they are not  authorized to prescribe.", "Although the PDMPs generally capture the name and  address of the patient, the controlled substance prescribed,  the date of the prescription, and the identity of the  prescriber, they generally do not capture the method of  payment that the patient used. Thus, the system will not  differentiate between prescriptions paid in cash and those  paid using health insurance.", "One state restricts law enforcement access to the PDMP to  only the state bureau of investigation. As such, local police  and sheriff\u2019s departments cannot access the data, which  impedes their ability to conduct prescription drug diversion  investigations. According to state officials, the limitation  was enacted because of privacy concerns.", "No nationwide PDMP exists, and only 33 states had  operational PDMPs as of June 2009. According to an official  in one of the selected states, people would sometimes cross  state borders to obtain prescription drugs in a state without  a program.", "Investigations and prosecutions: Another element of a fraud  prevention program is the aggressive investigation and prosecution of  individuals who defraud the federal government. Prosecuting perpetrators  serves as a preventive measure; it sends the message that the government  will not tolerate individuals stealing money. Schemes identified through  investigations and prosecution also can be used to improve the fraud  prevention program. The MFCU serves as the single identifiable entity  within a state government that investigates and prosecutes health care  providers who defraud the Medicaid program. In the course of our  investigation, however, we found several factors that may limit its  effectiveness.", "Federal regulations generally limit MFCUs from pursuing beneficiary  fraud. According to MFCU officials at one selected state, this limitation  impedes investigations because agents cannot use the threat of  prosecution as leverage to persuade beneficiaries to cooperate in  criminal probes of Medicaid providers. In addition, the MFCU officials  in this selected state said that this limitation restricts the agency\u2019s  ability to investigate organized crime related to controlled substances  when the fraud is perpetrated by the beneficiaries.", "Federal regulations do not permit federal funding for MFCUs to engage  in routine computer screening activities that are the usual monitoring  function of the Medicaid agency. According to MFCU officials in one  selected state, this issue has caused a strained working relationship  with the state\u2019s Medicaid OIG, on whom the MFCU relies for claims  information. The MFCU official stated that based on fraud trends in  other states, the state MFCU wanted the Medicaid OIG to provide  claims information on providers who had similar trends in that state.  The Medicaid OIG cited this prohibition on routine computer screening  activities when refusing to provide these data. In addition, this MFCU  official also stated that the state Medicaid office and its OIG did not  promptly incorporate improvements that the MFCU suggested  regarding preventing the abuse of controlled substances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DEA Monitoring of Pharmacy and Physician Prescription Practices Related to Controlled Substances", "paragraphs": ["DEA officials stated that although DEA monitors purchases of certain  Schedule II and III controlled substances by pharmacies, it does not  routinely receive information regarding written or dispensed controlled  substance prescriptions.

Third, CMS stated that information on  deceased providers and beneficiaries could be provided by a feed from  SSA.

As stated  in the report, both of these databases are required to be used by the states  before they pay prescription claims. We did not recommend that states use  the DEA registration database in the processing of Medicaid controlled  substance claims, and thus we do not make any recommendations to DEA  at this time. In response to CMS\u2019s comment about screening for deceased  providers and beneficiaries, we agree with CMS that SSA data can be used  in determining the eligibility of Medicaid beneficiaries and providers. In  developing its guidance to the states, we believe that CMS should consider  SSA death records and other sources to identify deceased Medicaid  providers and beneficiaries.
