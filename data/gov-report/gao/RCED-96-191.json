The program\u2019s total federal costs for this period were over $5 billion\u2014about $4.5 billion in cash reimbursements and over $600 million in commodity foods, such as beef patties, flour, and canned vegetables. The schools participating in the program had to offer lunches that included one serving each of milk, meat or a meat alternate (such as peanut butter), and bread or a bread alternate (such as pasta) and at least two servings of vegetables and/or fruits. Some concerns have been raised about the amount of food provided in the school lunch program that students throw away. This discarded food is commonly referred to as plate waste.", "To help address these concerns, you asked us to study plate waste in the NSLP. Specifically, we agreed to survey a random sample of cafeteria managers in the public schools nationwide that participate in the program to obtain the managers\u2019 perceptions on the (1) extent to which plate waste is a problem, (2) amount of plate waste by type of food, and (3) reasons for and ways to reduce plate waste. We also agreed to determine whether the perceptions of managers differed by their school\u2019s level (elementary, middle, or high school), their school\u2019s location (urban, suburban, or rural), and the proportion of their school\u2019s lunches served free and at a reduced price. In addition, we agreed to ask cafeteria managers about their level of satisfaction with the federal commodities used in the NSLP.", "Our survey results represent the views of cafeteria managers in about 80 percent of the 81,911 public schools nationwide that participated in the NSLP in the 1993-94 school year, the latest year for which a comprehensive list of public schools was available.

The program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Consumer Service, is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.", "The schools participating in the NSLP receive a cash reimbursement for each lunch served. In turn, the schools must serve lunches that meet federal nutritional requirements and offer lunches free or at a reduced price to children from families whose income falls at or below certain levels. For school year 1995-96, the schools were reimbursed $1.795 for each free lunch, $1.395 for each reduced-price lunch, and $0.1725 for each full-price lunch.", "Furthermore, for each lunch served, the schools receive commodity foods\u201414.25 cents\u2019 worth in school year 1995-96. The Department provides a billion pounds of commodity foods annually to states for use in the NSLP. States select commodity foods from a list of more than 60 different kinds of food, including fresh, canned, and frozen fruits and vegetables; meats; fruit juices; vegetable shortening and oil; and flour and other grain products. The variety of commodities depends on the quantities available and market prices. According to the Department, federal commodities account for about 20 percent of the food in the school lunch program.", "Through school year 1995-96, the schools were required to offer lunches that met a \u201cmeal pattern\u201d established by the Department. The meal pattern specified that a lunch must include five items\u2014a serving of meat or meat alternate; two or more servings of vegetables and/or fruits; a serving of bread or bread alternate; and a serving of milk. The meal pattern was designed to provide nutrients sufficient to approximate one-third of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Recommended Dietary Allowances.", "Effective school year 1996-97, the schools participating in the program will be required to offer lunches that meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Among other things, these guidelines, which represent the official nutritional policy of the U.S. government, recommend diets that are low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. In meeting these guidelines, the schools may use any reasonable approach, within guidelines established by the Secretary of Agriculture, including using the school meal pattern that was in effect for the 1994-95 school year.", "All students attending the schools that participate in the NSLP are eligible to receive an NSLP lunch. In fiscal year 1995, about 58 percent of the eligible students participated in the program. About 49 percent of the participating students received free lunches, 7 percent received reduced-price lunches, and 44 percent received full-price lunches. The students who do not participate in the program include those who bring lunch from home, eat off-campus, buy lunch a la carte at school or from a school canteen or vending machine, or do not eat at all.", "Concerns about plate waste prompted the introduction into the NSLP of the offer versus serve (OVS) option more than a decade ago. Under this option, a school must offer all five food items in the NSLP meal pattern, but a student may decline one or two of them. In a school that does not use this option, a student must take all five items. All high schools must use the OVS option, and middle and elementary schools may offer it at the discretion of local officials. According to a 1993 Department report, 71 percent of the elementary schools and 90 percent of the middle schools use the OVS option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent to Which Cafeteria Managers Perceived Plate Waste as a Problem", "paragraphs": ["Cafeteria managers varied in the extent to which they perceived plate waste as a problem in their school during the 1995-96 school year.

On the basis of the managers\u2019 responses, we estimate that the average amount wasted ranged from a high of 42 percent for cooked vegetables to a low of 11 percent for milk. Figure 4 shows our estimate of the average percent of waste for each of the eight food types.", "By school level, the amount of waste varied for all food types except canned or processed fruits. In general, the waste reported for each food type was highest in the elementary schools and lowest in the high schools. (See fig. 5.)", "By school location, the amount of waste varied for three food types\u2014cooked vegetables, raw vegetables/salads, and milk. For example, for each of these food types, the urban schools reported more waste than the rural schools. (See fig. 6.)", "By schools serving different proportions of free and reduced-price lunches, the average amount of waste varied for four food types\u2014raw vegetables/salads, fresh fruits, canned or processed fruits, and milk.

(See fig. 11.)", "In addition to asking cafeteria managers to respond to a list of possible reasons for plate waste, we asked them to identify the effect on plate waste of the NSLP\u2019s requirements for types of food and serving sizes that were in effect at the time of our survey. The managers believed that, overall, the minimum federal serving sizes provided about the right amount of food for the students at their school. (See fig. 12.)", "Furthermore, for each of four minimum serving size requirements that were in effect at the time of our survey, most cafeteria managers reported that each requirement did not result in more plate waste at their school. However, two requirements\u2014serving at least three-fourths of a cup of fruits/vegetables daily and serving at least eight servings of breads/grains weekly\u2014were viewed as resulting in more plate waste by about one-third and one-quarter of the managers, respectively. Figure 13 shows the percent of cafeteria managers who reported that the minimum serving sizes for the four requirements resulted in more waste.", "In addition, we asked cafeteria managers about the potential effect on plate waste of increasing the minimum serving sizes for fruits/vegetables and breads/grains. For fruits/vegetables, 62 percent of the middle and high school managers said that increasing the amount from three-fourths of a cup to one cup daily would cause more waste. For breads/grains, 53 percent of the middle and high school managers said that increasing the number of weekly servings from 8 to 15 would increase plate waste; and 69 percent of the elementary school managers reported that increasing the number of servings of breads/grains from 8 to 12 weekly would cause more plate waste."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ways to Reduce Plate Waste", "paragraphs": ["Of 11 possible actions listed in the survey to reduce plate waste, cafeteria managers viewed actions involving students in the choice of food, such as letting students select only what they want and seeking students\u2019 opinions regularly about menus, as more likely to reduce plate waste than other actions.

Relatedly, agency officials asked if we had analyzed the characteristics of nonrespondents. We generalized our results to 80 percent of the public schools because we used a conservative statistical approach that required us to generalize our results only to the overall level reflected by our response rate, in this case 80 percent. We did not analyze the characteristics of nonrespondents because we believe that such an analysis alone would not allow us to generalize our survey results to 100 percent of the public schools that participated in the NSLP in the 1993-94 school year. To generalize to 100 percent of the public schools, we believe it would also be necessary to analyze information about perceptions of plate waste from a subsample of cafeteria managers who did not respond to our survey. This analysis would allow us to assess whether the opinions of these managers differed significantly from those of the managers who completed and returned a survey.", "Further, the Department commented that our survey\u2019s list of possible reasons for plate waste did not permit cafeteria managers to select other possible reasons, including meal quality and palatability. We agree that these reasons may affect plate waste. However, we included two related reasons for plate waste\u2014\u201cthey  do not like that food\u201d and \u201cthey  do not like the way the food looks or tastes.\u201d We believe these two reasons address, in part, meal quality and palatability. In addition, respondents had the opportunity to identify other reasons contributing to plate waste. Less than 5 percent of the respondents specified other reasons that they considered to be at least a minor reason for plate waste.", "The Department also commented that we did not solicit the views of children or their parents/caretakers. We agree that the views of cafeteria managers present only one perspective on the extent of, and reasons for, plate waste and that valuable information could be obtained from a comprehensive, nationwide study of the views of children and their parents/caretakers. The time and resources associated with such a study could be substantial.", "In addition, the Department commented that our study did not address whether there was more or less plate waste in the NSLP than in other lunch settings\u2014such as at home or in restaurants. While identifying the amount of waste in different lunch settings was not an objective of our study, our survey asked cafeteria managers if they perceived the amount of waste from school lunches as more, less, or about the same as the amount of waste from lunches brought from home. Our survey results found that, of those cafeteria managers who were able to assess differences in the amount of plate waste, 79 percent believed that the amount from school lunches was less than or the same as the amount from lunches brought from home.", "Finally, agency officials provided some technical and clarifying comments that we incorporated into the report as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To develop the questions used in our survey of cafeteria managers, we reviewed the NSLP\u2019s regulations and research addressing the issue of waste in the program.
