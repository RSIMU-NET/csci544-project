While FHA's process for reviewing mortgage insurance applications includes more steps and generally takes longer, the agency monitors active loans with many of the same techniques that private bond insurers use. Under a Memorandum of Agreement, FHA and HHS work together in a variety of ways to review mortgage insurance applications and monitor active loans. However, FHA does not collect data to assess program performance against most performance measures specified in the memorandum, some of which are not objective. Further, FHA has not kept its program handbook of policies and procedures for applicants, lenders, and others up-to-date. The hospital program is small compared with other programs in the GI/SRI fund, and the losses from claims have been relatively low. Despite the program's relatively small size, some program and market trends may pose risks. For example, 61 percent of the program's total insured, outstanding loan amount is concentrated in New York, which makes the program vulnerable to state policies and regional economic conditions. While FHA has goals to diversify the hospital insurance portfolio and has made efforts to do so, it does not have a formal strategy to achieve these goals. To estimate the credit subsidy cost, or program costs, over the life of the outstanding loans insured, HUD uses a model that incorporates factors and assumptions about how loans will perform, including estimated claim and recovery rates, which are consistent with federal guidance. However, HUD's model does not explicitly consider some factors, such as the potential impacts of prepayment penalties or restrictions, which according to some economic studies, are important in modeling default risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the  Federal Housing Administration\u2019s (FHA) Hospital Mortgage Insurance  Program, insures loans to finance the renovation or construction of  hospitals.

Through this program, FHA insures the loans lenders make for  the construction and renovation of hospitals.  Since the inception of the  program, FHA has insured 341 hospital mortgages for $11.9 billion in 42  states and Puerto Rico. As of the end of calendar year 2005, FHA was  insuring 74 hospital mortgages totaling nearly $5 billion.  The number of  loans insured annually has increased in recent years, from 2 in fiscal year  2001 to 11 in fiscal year 2005 (see table 1). According to the House report  accompanying the Hospital Mortgage Insurance Act of 2003, which revised  the standards for determining the need and feasibility for hospitals, as well  as eligibility requirements for small, rural hospitals, hospitals face  significant financial challenges when providing care to patients who are  covered by Medicare and Medicaid, as well as those that are uninsured. At  the same time, improvements in technology and health care knowledge  necessitate capital improvements such as additions and renovations to  existing buildings.", "FHA\u2019s Office of Insured Health Care Facilities and HHS\u2019 Division of  Facilities and Loans coordinate to implement the hospital program. HUD  has statutory responsibility for the program based on the FHA\u2019s experience  with promoting housing construction through  housing mortgage insurance  programs. As such, HUD is fully responsible for management of the  program, including developing and proposing legislation, policy  development, strategic planning, and approval of applications and loan  documents. The House Committee on Banking and Currency, in  recommending that HUD be given this responsibility, expected HUD to  draw upon HHS\u2019s hospital expertise to devise standards for insuring  hospitals\u2019 mortgages. Through an interagency agreement, HUD formally  delegates authority to HHS to assist in the review of applications for  mortgage insurance and the monitoring of insured loans. HHS is also given  full responsibility for construction monitoring. See appendix II for  additional information about FHA and HHS\u2019s loan processing  responsibilities.", "FHA\u2019s Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program generally serves the segment  of the market consisting of hospitals that are too risky to obtain private  bond insurance but are strong enough to pass FHA\u2019s underwriting tests.  Mortgage insurance, like private bond insurance, guarantees that lenders  will be paid if the hospital stops making payments on its loan. In addition,  both mortgage insurance and private bond insurance are forms of credit  enhancement and improve the credit rating of the underlying debt for the  insured entity, resulting in a lower interest rate for the loan. Hospitals with  FHA-insured mortgages automatically receive investment-grade ratings  (AA or AAA) because the reliability of the cash flows from the mortgage  note are rated on the insurer\u2019s, not the hospital\u2019s, ability to repay the debt.  Both FHA and HHS officials and private insurers agree that FHA\u2019s Hospital  Mortgage Insurance Program serves a different market than private  insurers. According to FHA and HHS officials, FHA insures loans that are  too risky, too small, or too large for private insurers, or are located in a  market not served by private insurers.", "For the Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program, if a hospital fails to make  any payment due under the mortgage, the mortgage is in default. If a default  continues for 30 days, the lender is entitled to receive benefits from FHA.  FHA may pay claims in either cash or debentures.", "Federal agencies that provide direct loans or loan guarantees are required  by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 to estimate the expected cost of  programs by estimating or predicting their future performance and  reporting the costs to the government in their annual budgets.  Such  estimates are important in that they more accurately measure the  government\u2019s costs of federal loan programs and permit better cost  comparisons among different programs. Under credit reform procedures,  the cost of loan guarantees, such as mortgage insurance, is the net present  value of all expected future cash flows, excluding administrative costs.   For guarantees, cash inflows consist primarily of fees and premiums  charged to insured borrowers and recoveries on assets, and cash outflows  consist mostly of payments to lenders to cover the cost of claims. Agencies  discount projected future cash flows to the year in which the guaranteed  loan was disbursed. The discounted cash flows are the estimated budgetary  cost or gain of the cohort of loans obligated in a given fiscalyear. The net  present value of each cohort\u2019s estimated cash flows is expressed as a  percentage of the volume of guaranteed loans in the cohort\u2014that is, a  subsidy rate. Agency managers are responsible for accumulating relevant,  sufficient, and reliable data on which to base their credit subsidy estimates.", "OMB has final responsibility for determining subsidy estimates, in  consultation with agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA\u2019s Selection Process Includes Additional Steps Compared with Private Insurers, but Monitoring Techniques Are Similar", "paragraphs": ["FHA requires hospitals to take certain steps, both before they apply for  mortgage insurance and as a part of the application process, that private  insurers do not mandate. These additional steps are used because FHA  insures mortgages that are generally riskier than those using private bond  insurance. For example, before they apply for mortgage insurance, FHA  advises hospitals to compare their financial status with the program\u2019s  minimum requirements. If they meet these requirements, FHA requires  hospitals to submit market and financial information so that FHA can make  a preliminary assessment about the project and determine whether to  conduct a preapplication meeting with the applicant to discuss the project.  None of the private insurers that we met with have similar preapplication  processes.", "After these preapplication steps are met, FHA\u2019s application process  includes additional steps compared with those of private bond insurers.  FHA requires hospitals to submit a financial feasibility study containing  historic and forecasted financial statements and ratios, a financing plan,  and information about market demand, among other things. In addition,  FHA hires consultants to evaluate the feasibility of each proposed project  as an additional, independent check on the viability of the project. While  the private bond insurers that we met with review the types of information  included in feasibility studies, they do not require hospitals to submit such  studies and do not hire consultants to assess the feasibility of proposed  projects.", "FHA\u2019s application process also includes a final level of review that is absent  from private bond insurer processes. After an application for mortgage  insurance has gone through underwriting and been reviewed by an  independent consultant, it is considered by the program management  group, a group of senior-level FHA and HHS staff. FHA also refers to this  group as its \u201ccredit committee.\u201d Similarly, private bond insurers also  consider applications within a credit committee structure. However, while  private bond insurers make final insurance decisions through their credit  committees, FHA has an additional layer of review. Based upon input from  the program management group, the Director of FHA\u2019s Office of Insured  Health Care Facilities makes a recommendation to the FHA Commissioner,  who then makes the final decision.", "It generally takes FHA longer to process applications than it takes private  bond insurers. According to program data, it took FHA an average of 265  days to process the 11 applications for hospital mortgage insurance that it  endorsed in fiscal year 2005. According to the FHA, processing times vary  with the complexity of the project and may be affected by issues requiring a  hospital to rethink or resubmit its application, including issues that are  beyond HUD\u2019s control. In contrast, according to the private bond insurers  and investment bankers that we interviewed, it generally takes private  insurers up to 60 days to process an insurance application, sometimes less.  While FHA\u2019s average processing time is higher than private bond insurers, it  has decreased from an average of 399 days in fiscal year 1999.  According to  FHA, processing times have improved as a result of implementing the  preliminary review process, which disqualifies hospitals that don\u2019t meet the  program\u2019s minimum requirements.", "FHA uses many of the same techniques that private insurers use to monitor  insured hospitals. Both FHA and private bond insurers identify the riskiest  hospitals in their portfolio for closer monitoring. Since November 1999,  FHA has placed on a priority watch list hospitals it determines are at risk of  having a claim filed within the next 12 months. FHA considers a hospital  for inclusion on the priority watch list if certain financial criteria are not  met. For example, if the ratio measuring a hospital\u2019s ability to pay its  mortgage payments with cash generated from current operations (the debt  service coverage ratio) falls below an acceptable level, the hospital may be  placed on the watch list. A hospital can also be placed on the list if FHA  becomes aware of other conditions at the hospital, such as management or  personnel problems. As of December 2005, FHA data showed that 11 of the  59 insured hospitals are on this list, representing an unpaid (insured)  principal balance of approximately $762 million. Private insurers also  assess the risk of the hospitals that they insure in order to identify those  that should be monitored more closely. For example, one private bond  insurer explained that they monitor compliance with loan agreements by  reviewing financial statements, documentation of payer mix (i.e.,  proportion of  reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance,  etc.), and notices of litigation, among other things.", "As a part of their monitoring efforts, both FHA and private bond insurers  monitor agreements that exist between themselves and the insured  hospital. These agreements specify the requirements that the insured  hospital must comply with in order to maintain the insurance. Agreements  may cover issues such as the debt-service coverage ratio; liquidity, or the  ability to convert assets to cash; and activities that a hospital cannot do  without approval by the insurer. Both FHA and private insurers require  hospitals to request waivers from agreement requirements if they are not  going to meet them. FHA and private insurers monitor hospitals\u2019  compliance with these agreements through various means, such as by  evaluating changes in indicators of financial performance, as reported in  hospitals\u2019 financial statements. For example, one private bond insurer  reported that it monitors hospitals\u2019 cash on hand, and FHA monitors  hospitals\u2019 debt-service coverage ratios. FHA and private insurers monitor  financial statements and other documentation quarterly and annually,  respectively, and more frequently for hospitals that are experiencing  financial difficulty. Both FHA and private insurers require hospitals that are  not in compliance to correct violations within specific time frames.", "Both FHA and private insurers can require hospitals experiencing financial  difficulties to hire consultants. In some cases, FHA will pay for consultants  to identify and suggest solutions to hospitals\u2019 financial difficulties.  According to FHA, since fiscal year 2000, it has paid $1.3 million for  consultant\u2019s studies of 27 hospitals. However, FHA can also require  hospitals to hire and pay for consulting services on their own. Similarly,  private insurers can require hospitals to hire consultants to assist them  with identifying and addressing problems. The requirement for a hospital to  hire a consultant can be triggered if a hospital is not in compliance with its  loan agreements, according to both FHA and private bond insurers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Coordinate Key Activities, but FHA Does Not Track Most Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["FHA and HHS coordinate key activities, including screening applicants,  underwriting loans, and monitoring insured hospitals.

For example,  according to one performance measure, hospitals with a weakening  financial position should be identified early enough to allow time for the  account executive to provide technical assistance and undertake default  prevention measures. Since such hospitals are identified through the FHA\u2019s  priority watch list system, these data are readily available for  measurement. Similarly, another performance measure is designed to  capture the soundness of analysis performed by client service teams, which  can include both FHA and HHS staff, in assessing insurance applications.  FHA has also not tracked this measure.", "FHA also does not track performance measures of activities that it  delegates to HHS. For example, one measure is designed to capture the  number of complaints and compliments about HHS\u2019s timeliness,  helpfulness, courtesy, and understanding. According to FHA, the agency  has not tracked this or other measures because it has not had enough  problems with HHS to warrant establishing a tracking system and that  establishment of such a system would be both an administrative burden  and a poor use of their resources. However, without collecting appropriate  information, FHA cannot quantify the input it receives about HHS. In  addition, FHA has not tracked performance measures related to  construction design and monitoring, which HHS is responsible for.  According to FHA, performance measures exist to indicate FHA\u2019s  expectations of HHS\u2019s performance, even though HHS\u2019s performance is not  tracked.", "Several of the performance measures contained in the agreement between  FHA and HHS lack the necessary characteristics of performance measures;  that is, they are not measurable or objective.

According to HUD, 70 percent of claims  have historically occurred prior to a loan\u2019s tenth year.

Specifically, our analysis of program data for calendar years  2000 to 2004 shows that some insured hospitals increased their ability to  meet their monthly and future mortgage payments. For example, the  median debt-service coverage ratio, a measure of a hospital\u2019s ability to pay  its mortgage with cash generated from current operations, increased from  1.54 to 2.18. While a value of 2.18 for this ratio indicates a low level of risk,  according to FHA criteria, other financial indicators indicate medium levels  of risk. For example, the median number of days of cash on hand and the  median current ratio (which compares a hospital\u2019s current assets to its  current liabilities) both improved, yet still indicate a medium level of risk to  the program. Finally, the median operating margin, which is indicative of a  hospital\u2019s ability to control costs and expenses, improved between 2000  and 2004, yet indicates a medium level of risk based on FHA\u2019s criteria.", "Median financial indicators for the 11 hospitals that FHA has placed on its  priority watch list show much greater levels of risk when compared with  FHA\u2019s underwriting guidelines (see fig. 5). For these hospitals, performance  as measured by all four selected indicators declined from 2000 to 2004.  Further, in 2004, three indicators showed a high level of risk, based on  FHA\u2019s criteria. For example, according to FHA\u2019s criteria, an applicant with  an operating margin of less than zero is considered high risk. The hospitals  on FHA\u2019s priority watch list had median operating margin of -2.65 in 2004.  Similarly, according to FHA\u2019s criteria, an applicant with less than 15 days of  cash on hand is also high risk, and hospitals on the priority watch list had a  median of 3.3 days of cash on hand in 2004. FHA recognizes that the high  risk levels of these selected financial indicators are among the reasons that  these hospitals are on its priority watch list and are, therefore, subject to  closer monitoring to reduce the risk of a claim.", "Analysis of program data further shows that, while loans are increasingly  being insured outside of the Northeast, the program is still concentrated in  New York (see fig. 6). Though the percentage of the unpaid principal  balance concentrated in New York has decreased from 89 percent in 2000,  61 percent of the unpaid principal balance in the program remains  concentrated in New York in 2005. Of the 30 hospital loans that FHA has  insured since 2000, 21 are outside of New York, and 19 are outside of the  Northeast region. Since 2003, 5 of the loans insured were for CAHs.", "Further, 24 out of 25 mortgage insurance applications in development at  the time of our study are located outside of the Northeast (see fig. 7).", "Despite these strides, the high concentration of the program\u2019s unpaid  principal balance in New York, as well as concentrations with single  borrowers with multiple loans, creates risks. New York hospitals insured  through FHA, like hospitals nationwide, rely heavily upon reimbursement  through Medicare and Medicaid.Since a portion of Medicaid funding  comes from states, any cuts made by the state of New York could have an  especially negative impact on the hospital program. Insured hospitals in  New York are also vulnerable to other state policies. For example, a task  force appointed by the Governor is in the process of identifying New York  hospitals for closure or restructuring. The Governor and state legislature  have committed state funds to assist in restructuring efforts, and the state  has had a history of helping its hospitals avoid defaults. Nevertheless, any  recommendations for the closure or restructuring of FHA-insured hospitals  may present the risk of an insurance claim. Further, some New York  hospitals have multiple loans insured through the program, one with  unpaid principal balances totaling approximately $828 million as of  December 2005. According to HUD\u2019s comments on the draft of this report,  this hospital is a financially sound, well-endowed institution that poses a  low risk of default."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Trends Pose Risks to Hospitals, Including Those with FHA Insured Mortgages", "paragraphs": ["The hospital program may also face risks from changes in the health care  industry at large. According to industry literature, decreasing revenue  streams, increases in the number of uninsured patients, increased  competition from specialized facilities, and heightened capital needs are  some of the trends that affect all hospitals, including FHA-insured  hospitals.", "We and others have reported that Medicare and Medicaid spending may not  be sustainable at current levels. If program cuts occur in Medicaid, for  example, states may take cost containment measures to reduce spending.  Such measures may include frozen, or reduced, reimbursement rates to  providers and restrictions on eligibility for these programs.In addition,  the number of Medicare enrollees is projected to increase as baby-boomers  age and become Medicare-eligible.These trends will affect all hospitals,  including FHA-insured hospitals, which generally have Medicare and  Medicaid patients in their payer mix. On average, Medicare discharges for  FHA-insured hospitals represented 29 percent of total discharges per  hospital, and Medicaid discharges represented 19 percent of total  discharges per FHA-insured hospital. (See fig. 8 for Medicare and  Medicaid discharges by state.) Stated another way, nearly 50 percent of the  reimbursement that program hospitals receive is through Medicare and  Medicaid.", "Hospitals, including FHA-insured hospitals, must also contend with the  rising number of underinsured and uninsured patients, which place  demands on hospitals to provide care with little to no reimbursement.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of uninsured persons  rose from under 40 million people in 2000 to approximately 45 million  people in 2003. This trend may pose a risk to the program. In addition,  hospitals in New York, where the hospital mortgage insurance is  concentrated, serve a high proportion of uninsured patients.", "Credit rating agencies state that competition is increasing in the health care  market as the type of care provided shifts to outpatient and specialty  hospitals, which provide profitable services, such as cardiology, surgery,  orthopedics, and diagnostic imaging. Specialty facilities providing these  services can take patients and revenue from general acute-care hospitals,  which supplement revenue shortfalls with profitable services after  providing needed, but unprofitable, services to the community. The growth  of specialty hospitals, such as ambulatory surgery centers, is strong. The  average number of specialty hospital openings has increased from 5  hospital openings in the 1960s to 27 hospital openings in the 2000-present  time period.", "Hospitals throughout the health care sector face increasing capital  demands, yet many have limited access to capital according to hospital  industry literature.For example, hospitals face demand for outpatient  services, emergency room upgrades, and technological advancements,  which have significant up-front and maintenance costs. A reputable credit  rating agency estimates that information technology expenditures now  range between 20 to 30 percent of a hospital\u2019s capital budget. Financially  weaker hospitals have less access to capital, yet often have pent-up capital  needs. According to a recent rating agency report, New York hospitals have  unmet capital needs as a result of their older infrastructure and because  they are generally financially weaker than the average hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA Uses Tools to Mitigate Risk", "paragraphs": ["FHA uses a variety of tools to mitigate risk in the hospital program. For  example, during its preliminary assessment of a hospital, FHA reviews the  hospital\u2019s ability to pay its mortgage by analyzing its debt service coverage  ratio and determines if this ratio meets FHA\u2019s minimum requirement. FHA  takes other steps when reviewing applications (as discussed previously)  designed to keep out excessively risky projects and also imposes  requirements on insured hospitals to control risks. These include    assessing the viability of projects at preapplication meetings with key   using a comprehensive underwriting process that assesses, among other  factors, past and projected financial performance and the demand for  the hospital\u2019s services;   hiring an independent consultant to evaluate the feasibility of the  proposed project and its potential risk to the FHA;  requiring insured hospitals to establish a cash reserve fund sufficient to  cover 2 years of mortgage payments;   requiring insured hospitals to maintain compliance with key agreements  between the hospital and FHA and monitoring these agreements; and  considering insured hospitals that fail to meet certain financial criteria  for placement on the priority watch list.", "FHA has also made some efforts to address the risks associated with the  geographic concentration of the program in New York. Since 1999, FHA has  had goals for geographically diversifying the hospital portfolio. Currently,  FHA\u2019s goals for diversifying the portfolio include reviewing and processing  applications for projects in states other than New York. While the agency  does not have a formal strategy for marketing the program outside of New  York, it has made some efforts to diversify the hospital portfolio by  simplifying its application process for CAHs and providing rural hospital  associations with information about the program;    hiring an expert in rural hospitals;  visiting hospital association conferences to educate members about the   educating HUD field attorneys, mortgage bankers, and consultants  about the program.", "HUD has also cooperated with requests for program information from the  trade media and assisted other researchers, which resulted in the  publication of articles and reports that provided information about the  advantages of the hospital program in financing capital projects. A formal  strategy, however, would provide the agency with a tool for  comprehensively planning for and executing activities that would lead to  the geographic diversification of the hospital portfolio. OMB guidance, for  example, requires that agencies include a description of the means and  strategies that will be used to achieve goals in their strategic plans. Such  strategies could include, for example, the processes, skills, technologies,  and various resources that will be used to achieve goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Model for Estimating Credit Subsidy Costs Excludes Potentially Relevant Factors", "paragraphs": ["HUD uses a model for estimating annual credit subsidies that does not  explicitly consider the impacts of some potentially important factors.  HUD\u2019s model incorporates factors and assumptions about how loans will  perform, including estimated claim and recovery rates, which are  consistent with OMB guidance. HUD has generally calculated a negative  subsidy rate for the hospital program, meaning that estimated cash inflows  have been greater than estimated cash outflows. However, HUD\u2019s model  does not explicitly consider the potential impacts of prepayment penalties  or restrictions when estimating prepayments, or the debt-service coverage  ratios of hospitals at the time of loan origination.", "For budgeting purposes, agencies that make loans and provide loan  guarantees must estimate the costs to the government over the life of the  loans that will be insured, commonly referred to as the subsidy cost. In  order to estimate the subsidy cost of the Hospital Mortgage Insurance  Program, HUD uses a cash-flow model to project expected net cash flows  for all these loans over their entire life. HUD\u2019s model is a computer-based  spreadsheet that uses assumptions based upon historical and projected  data to estimate the amount and timing of claims, subsequent recoveries  from these claims, as well as premiums and fees paid by the borrower.  In  addition, HUD does not consider prepayment penalties and restrictions  when it estimates the level and timing of prepayments, which affect  estimates of future claims and premiums.", "HUD inputs its estimated cash flows into the OMB\u2019s credit subsidy  calculator, which produces the official credit subsidy rate. A positive credit  subsidy rate means that the present value of cash outflows is greater than  inflows, and a negative credit subsidy rate means that the cash inflows are  estimated to exceed cash outflows. For the hospital program, cash inflows  include premiums and fees, servicing and repayment income from notes  held in inventory, rental income from properties held in inventory, and sale  income from notes and properties sold from inventory. Cash outflows  include claim payments and expenses related to properties and notes held  in inventory.", "Since the hospital program\u2019s inception, FHA has paid a total of 22 hospital  mortgage insurance claims. The last claim was filed in 1999. Because of the  small number of claims, HUD determined that claim rates based solely  upon the program\u2019s historical claims experience would not be reliable. As  a result, HUD uses a methodology initially developed by OMB to increase  its estimated claim rate by assuming that the lenders for some active  hospitals would file claims for insurance. HUD refers to this methodology  as an artificial default. In determining which loans to artificially default,  HUD focuses on hospitals that generally have a higher risk of default, and  are therefore on FHA\u2019s priority watch list. According to OMB officials, the  use of this artificial default accounts for the risk that exists due to the low  number of large size loans insured, potential changes in Medicare or  Medicaid reimbursement rates, and the geographic concentration of the  program in New York, which make the program vulnerable to regional  economic conditions.", "In 10 of the 14 years that HUD has been estimating the cost of the Hospital  Mortgage Insurance Program under credit reform, HUD has estimated that  the present value of cash inflows from fees, premiums, and recoveries from  loans and properties sold would exceed the outflows from claim payments  and other expenses related to properties and notes held in inventory. As a  result, HUD calculated a negative credit subsidy rate for the hospital  program for these 10 years. In the other 4 years, HUD estimated positive or  no credit subsidy costs for the program. Figure 9 shows changes in the  credit subsidy rate from 1992 to 2005.", "While HUD\u2019s model includes assumptions that are consistent with OMB  guidance, such as assumptions on estimated claim and recovery rates and  an artificial default methodology to supplement the claim experience,  HUD\u2019s model does not explicitly consider the potential impact of  prepayment penalties or restrictions, even though they can influence the  timing of prepayments and claims and collection of premiums. Inclusion of  initial debt-service coverage ratios, as a factor predictive of defaults and  claim rates into HUD\u2019s cash-flow model for the hospital program, could  potentially enhance HUD\u2019s estimate of the subsidy cost of the program.  According to some economic studies, prepayment penalties, or penalties  associated with the payment of a loan before its maturity date, can significantly affect borrowers\u2019 prepayment patterns. In turn, prepayments  affect claims because if a loan is prepaid it can no longer go to claim.  According to FHA officials, FHA does not place prepayment penalties on  FHA-insured hospital loans. However, according to the hospital program\u2019s  regulations, a mortgage loan made by a lender that has obtained the funds  for the loan through bonds can impose a prepayment penalty charge and  place a prepayment restriction on the mortgage\u2019s term, amount, and  conditions.", "According to FHA officials and mortgage bankers, prepayment restrictions  on hospital loans are generally in the form of 10-year restrictions on the  prepayment of bonds. While FHA does not maintain data specifically on  insured hospitals\u2019 bond-financing terms, prepayment restrictions are  specified on the mortgage note, which is available to FHA. Moreover,  according to the Mortgage Insurance for Hospitals Handbook, FHA has  access to bond-financing terms because, upon completion of bond issues,  applicants are required to submit bond-related documents to FHA so that  FHA can verify that the fees, charges, and other costs previously approved  with respect to debt restructuring. Incorporation of such data into the  hospital program\u2019s credit subsidy rate model could refine HUD\u2019s credit  subsidy estimate by enhancing the model\u2019s ability to account for estimated  changes in cash flows as a result of prepayment restrictions.", "According to HUD officials responsible for HUD\u2019s cash-flow model,  prepayment penalties and restrictions are not incorporated into the model  because HUD does not collect such data. HUD officials added that, even  though the cash-flow model does not explicitly account for prepayment  penalties and restrictions, its use of historic data implicitly captures trends  that may occur as a result of prepayment penalties and restrictions.  However, by not explicitly incorporating prepayment penalties or  restrictions into the cash-flow model, HUD\u2019s model is less able to estimate  the impact of changes in prepayment patterns of current and future  cohorts.", "HUD\u2019s cash-flow model also does not consider the initial debt-service  coverage ratio of hospital loans at the point of loan origination. By initial  debt-service coverage ratio, we are referring to the projected debt-service  coverage ratio that is considered during loan underwriting. (HUD\u2019s cash- flow model does consider the current debt-service coverage ratio of  insured hospitals through its artificial default methodology, which, as  previously explained, includes hospitals that are on FHA\u2019s priority watch  list. This list may include insured hospitals if, based upon the last available  full year of data, their debt-service coverage ratio is below 1.10.)", "According to the HUD official responsible for HUD\u2019s cash-flow model, the  initial debt-service coverage ratio of a hospital at the point of loan  origination is not included as a part of the cash-flow model for the hospital  program because it (1) is not a cash flow, (2) does not vary, and (3) has no  predictive value. We agree that a debt-service coverage ratio is not a cash  flow. However, initial debt-service coverage ratios potentially affect  relevant cash flows, as do other factors that are included in HUD\u2019s model  but are also not cash flows, such as prepayments. For example, the model  considers estimated prepayments because they potentially affect future  cash inflows from fees and future cash outflows from claim payments.  Initial debt-service coverage ratios are another important factor that may  affect cash flows, as loans with lower initial debt-service coverage ratios  may be more likely to default and result in a claim payment. They can also  be used to assess the financial health of either an applicant or a hospital in  the existing portfolio.", "According to officials from FHA\u2019s Office of Insured Health Care Facilities,  the projected debt-service coverage ratio is most meaningful for the third  or fourth year projected, when construction is most likely to be complete.  Our analysis of projected debt-service coverage ratios, which include the  amount of new debt being insured, shows that these ratios varied from 1.48  to 3.11 during the fourth year projected. All other factors being equal,  loans with a debt-service coverage ratio of 3.11 are generally considered to  have less risk than a loan with only a 1.48 debt-service coverage ratio.", "Finally, we also found that economic studies show mixed results regarding  the significance of the impact of debt-service coverage ratios upon  commercial mortgage defaults. Some studies find initial debt-service  coverage ratios to be statistically insignificant in modeling commercial  mortgage defaults. Other studies indicate that initial debt-service  coverage ratios are meaningful factors in modeling default risk and are  helpful in predicting commercial mortgage terminations. Analysis of  initial debt-service coverage ratio information, which is available in  underwriting documents, may be used to identify trends or shifts in the  overall risk of the portfolios that should be considered when making credit  subsidy estimates.

Further, the agency\u2019s techniques for  monitoring insured hospitals are quite similar to those used by private  insurers, and the program has operated for several years without  experiencing an insurance claim.", "FHA and HHS appear to work together reasonably well in carrying out their  respective roles in administering the program. However, it is difficult for  us, FHA\u2019s managers, or the Congress to assess how well the agencies  perform in implementing the program because FHA has not established a  set of meaningful program performance measures or collected the  information needed to assess performance.  We have previously reported  on the importance of agencies\u2019 collecting useful performance information.", "If FHA collected useful performance information, such as information  based on measurable and objective performance measures, the agency\u2019s  managers could use it to identify problems, try to identify the causes of  problems, and/or to develop corrective actions. Many program activities,  including those delegated to HHS, are recorded in FHA\u2019s Hospital Mortgage  Insurance Management Information System, and data from this system  could be used to establish and monitor useful performance measures. In  addition, because FHA has not updated the program handbook since 1984,  hospitals, lenders, investment bankers, health care financing agencies, and  other interested parties do not have ready access to a consolidated source  of current program eligibility requirements, policies, and procedures. The  lack of a consolidated source of current information may cause confusion  and delay hospitals\u2019 ability to prepare applications that meet FHA\u2019s criteria.   Further, outdated guidance in federal programs is an internal control  weakness.", "Although it represents a relatively small part of HUD\u2019s GI/SRI fund, the  hospital program insures multimillion dollar loans that currently total  nearly $5 billion. The continued geographic concentration of insured  hospitals in the state of New York poses a source of financial risk to the  program. While this concentration has decreased from its high of 89  percent of outstanding insured principal balance in 2000, the current 61  percent represents a continuing concentration of credit risk. As a result,  the program is vulnerable to New York State policies, such as the  governor\u2019s call to restructure hospitals, as well as regional economic  trends. While FHA has taken steps in the right direction, it does not have a  formal strategy or plan for geographically diversifying the hospital  portfolio, which could enhance current efforts to reach this goal.", "HUD\u2019s cash-flow model used to estimate annual credit subsidy rates  appears to be consistent with applicable OMB guidance; however, it does  not explicitly take into account potentially useful factors such as  prepayment penalties and restrictions or the initial debt-service coverage  ratio of new loan cohorts. Although the program has not experienced a  claim for insurance since 1999, the increasing size of loans insured,  geographic concentration in New York and the Northeast, and other factors  pose risks to the program.

We recognize that potential cuts in reimbursement  from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are a risk factor for hospitals in  all states; however, New York is unique among states in accounting for over  half of the hospital program\u2019s insurance portfolio. We revised the report to  clarify that, due to this concentration, any cuts that the state of New York  makes to its Medicaid program could have an especially negative impact.  Regarding the New York Governor\u2019s commission, we are aware that state  funds are available to assist in restructuring efforts, and that the Dormitory  Authority of the State of New York is committed helping its hospitals avoid  defaults. However, since there is no guarantee that FHA-insured hospitals  will be protected, we continue to believe that a recommendation for their  closure or restructuring may present the risk of an insurance claim.

Because HUD\u2019s system for tracking application processing times does not  capture such periods of time, it is not possible for GAO to quantify their  impact.

While our report  acknowledges that the program has had a good performance history, the  creation and use of performance measures can be used by agency  managers to improve a program\u2019s results. As we note in the report, analysis  of performance information helps managers identify problems, identify the  causes of problems, and develop corrective actions.

While we  obtained extracts from HUD\u2019s F-47 database in April 2005, October 2005,  and December 2005, all analyses from F-47 data in the report utilize the  December 2005 extract only.", "We also compared data on four financial ratios including debt service  coverage, days cash on hand, current, and operating margin ratios provided  from HMIMIS, current as of December 2005, with applicant criteria stated  in the Manual of the Hospital Insurance Program.", "To determine how FHA manages program risks, we interviewed FHA and  HHS program officials and reviewed the Mortgage Insurance for Hospitals  Handbook and manual to determine steps taken by the agency during the  application and monitoring phases of the insurance process. We analyzed  cash inflows to the program from income from notes held in inventory,  rental income from properties held in inventory, sales income from notes,  and properties sold from inventory. We also reviewed documentation of  cash outflows, such as claim payments and expenses related to properties  and notes held in inventory. To assess risk based on geographic  concentration, we identified the state with the highest unpaid principal  balance insured by the program. Finally, to assess risk posed by the  geographic concentration of the program\u2019s unpaid principal balance, we  extracted 2003 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) database on Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program hospitals active  in 2005. We used CMS data to identify the number of discharged patients  whose services were paid for through the Medicare/Medicaid programs  from hospitals that have loans insured through the program. More than 90  percent of these data have undergone basic edit checks; however, CMS has  not yet determined whether these data require an audit. These data may  change as they undergo further review by CMS. In addition, CMS does not  enforce dates by which hospitals must report data. Thus, at the time of this  report, only 49 of the 59 active FHA hospitals had provided data for 2003.", "We conducted a literature review and interviewed numerous officials of  rating agencies and hospital associations to obtain information on risks due  to health care market trends.

We also compared the assumptions used in HUD\u2019s cash-flow model with  relevant OMB guidance and reviewed economic literature on modeling  defaults to identify factors that are important for estimation. Additionally,  we analyzed data provided by FHA on program hospitals\u2019 projected debt- service coverage ratios (at the time of their loan application). HUD\u2019s  Budget Office provided the program\u2019s annual credit subsidy rates for 1992  and 1993, and we obtained this rate for years 1994-2005 from the Federal  Credit Supplement of the United States Budget.", "Our review did not include an evaluation of underwriting criteria,  construction monitoring, or the need for the program.
