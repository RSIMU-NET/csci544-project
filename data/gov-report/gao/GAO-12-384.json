According to a DOD procurement policy official, the Air Force competition advocate is assessing the reasons for lower competition rates. When non-DOD agencies procured non-R&D services on behalf of DOD in fiscal year 2011, their average competition rate was 81 percent, slightly higher than the average rate of 78 percent for DOD\u0092s own contracting offices.", "The majority of DOD noncompetitive obligations for non-R&D services in fiscal year 2011 were due to the contractor being the only responsible source for the procurement. The second most cited exception was \u0093authorized by statute,\u0094 for example, awards under the Small Business Administration\u0092s 8(a) business development program. Based on prior GAO work, a variety of factors can affect competition, including reliance on contractor expertise and data rights, the influence of program offices, and unanticipated events such as bid protests.

Using full  and open competition to award contracts means that all responsible  sources\u2014or prospective contractors that meet certain criteria\u2014are  permitted to submit proposals. Agencies are generally required to perform  acquisition planning and conduct market research to promote and provide  for, among other things, full and open competition. However, Congress,  by enacting CICA, also recognized that there are situations that require or  allow for contracts to be awarded noncompetitively\u2014that is, without full  and open competition. Generally, noncompetitive contracts must be  supported by written J&As that contain sufficient facts and rationale to  justify the use of the specific exception to full and open competition that is  being applied to the procurement. Examples of allowable exceptions  include circumstances where the contractor is the only source capable of  performing the requirement or where an urgent need precludes adequate  time for competition. Justifications generally are required to be published  on the FedBizOpps.gov website and must be approved at levels that vary  according to the dollar value of the procurement. J&As may be made for  an individual procurement or on a class basis for a group of related  acquisitions. Noncompetitive contracts are not permitted in situations in  which the requiring agency has failed to adequately plan for the  procurement or in which there are concerns related to availability of  funding for the agency, such as funds expiring at the end of the year.", "Although full and open competition is generally required, agencies can  also competitively award contracts after limiting the pool of available  contractors\u2014a process called \u201cfull and open competition after exclusion  of sources.\u201d For example, agencies set aside procurements for small  businesses.

Agencies are  generally required to compete orders on multiple award contracts among  all contract holders. However, agencies can award noncompetitive  orders\u2014through a process called an exception to a fair opportunity to be  considered\u2014for reasons similar to those used for awarding contracts  without full and open competition, such as only one contractor being  capable of providing the supplies or services needed, or for an urgent  requirement.

Ordering procedures under  the schedules program vary according to the dollar value of the  procurement. For example, to meet competition requirements for orders  exceeding the micro-purchase threshold ($3,000) but not exceeding the  simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000), agencies must survey or  request quotes from at least three schedule contractors. However, to  meet competition requirements for proposed orders exceeding the  simplified acquisition threshold, agencies must post a request for  quotation on GSA\u2019s posting website or provide it to as many schedule  contractors as practicable to reasonably ensure that agencies receive at  least three quotes from contractors that can fulfill the requirement.

Unanticipated events such as bid protests or unforeseen  requirements with time frames that preclude competition can also impact  competition.", "We have previously reported that DOD needs access to technical data  related to its weapon systems in order to help control costs and maintain  flexibility in the acquisition and sustainment of those weapon systems.  Technical data can enable the government to complete maintenance  work in-house, as well as to competitively award acquisition and  sustainment contracts. For contracts pertaining to DOD weapons  programs, which can involve products as well as support services, the  lack of access to proprietary technical data and a heavy reliance on  specific contractors for expertise limit, or even preclude the possibility of,  competition. Even when technical data are not an issue, the government  may have little choice other than to rely on the contractors that were the  original equipment manufacturers, and that, in some cases, designed and  developed the weapon system.", "In our review of selected fiscal year 2011 J&As, we identified many  instances where DOD lacked either the expertise or the technical data  necessary to conduct a full and open competition. Two examples, which  were justified under the \u201conly one responsible source\u201d competition  exception, are:", "The Navy approved a class J&A for noncompetitive contract actions  valued at $2.3 billion to acquire the next generation of aircraft along  with supporting supplies and services. Officials noted that the  contractor had been the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer  of the system since 1964 and would not sell the government the  technical data required to compete the acquisition.", "The Army justified a noncompetitive $455.3 million contract to  remanufacture helicopters because the Army lacked the technical  data and expertise necessary to compete the requirement. According  to the J&A, although a related contract from the late 1980s allowed  the government to have technical data packages suitable for  competition, the data was never obtained. According to the J&A, the  contractor\u2019s estimated cost for this data was nearly $4 billion. In  approving the J&A, the senior procurement official noted, \u201cI hope that  all contracting activities can persistently monitor how to be more  competitive, despite the noncompetitive positions we have gotten  ourselves into over the years.\u201d", "In 2010, we reported that program officials play a significant role in the  contracting process, particularly in developing requirements and  interfacing with contractors. Program officials may put pressure on the  contracting process to award contracts to a specific vendor without  competition. Contracting officials have said that a program office may be  comfortable with the incumbent contractor because a relationship had  developed between the program office and the contractor, who  understands the program requirements. Program officials pressure the  contracting office to remain with that contractor, thus inhibiting  competition. In one J&A we reviewed, the Office of Military Commissions  expressed a strong preference for the incumbent contractor. Specifically,  the office justified noncompetitively awarding a contract extension valued  at up to $15 million for courtroom services at Guantanamo Bay, under the  competition exception for expert services. According to the J&A, since  2007, the contractor representatives had become fully integrated  members of the litigation teams. These services included handling and  securing sensitive documents and protecting sensitive information in the  courtroom. Given that the government did not expect to need these  services for longer than a year, the government did not want to risk  delays and inefficiencies in the trial process by bringing on a new  contractor.", "In 2010, we also reported that, according to contracting officials, program  officials are often insufficiently aware of the amount of time needed to  complete acquisition planning, including performing market research,  properly defining requirements, and allowing contractors time to respond  to requests for proposals, which may hinder opportunities to increase  competition. In 2011, we reported that program officials at civilian  agencies may not know how long these key steps can take, and we have  recommended that agencies establish time frames for when program  officials should begin acquisition planning. Similarly, in one DOD J&A we reviewed, the Army justified awarding an $11.2 million noncompetitive  bridge contract for mission support services at Ft. Bliss, Texas under the  \u201conly one responsible source\u201d competition exception. Bridge contracts are  typically short-term to avoid a lapse in service while the award of a follow- on contract is being planned or an awarded contract is being  implemented. According to the J&A, this bridge contract was necessary  after unexpected delays in the acquisition planning process for a planned  competitive follow-on task order. The delays were due to, among other  things, the program office changing managers multiple times and  difficulties writing requirements that met the contracting officer\u2019s  standards, conflicting end-of-year responsibilities for contracting office  staff, and the senior procurement officials taking 6 months to approve the  acquisition strategy.", "We have also previously reported that the government\u2019s requirements  can influence the number of offers received under competitive  solicitations if these requirements are written too restrictively. Contracting  officials explained that it is challenging to identify program office  requirements that are written so restrictively that they are geared toward  the incumbent. These officials said that their technical backgrounds and  having the assistance of technical staff in evaluating the requirements can  help them determine whether the requirements can be broadened. They  noted that if they lack technical expertise in the specific area, it is more  difficult to question whether a statement of work is written too restrictively.", "Finally, we identified instances when unanticipated events stalled planned  competition, leading to bridge contracts. Unforeseen events that can lead  to bridge contracts include unexpected expansion of requirements and  competitors filing bid protests of competitive follow-on contract awards. Of  111 J&As we reviewed, 18 were bridge contracts valued at a total of over  $9 billion. Five of these bridge contracts were due to bid protests.  Examples of bridge contracts due to unanticipated events include:", "DOD\u2019s TRICARE program justified negotiating noncompetitive options  that extended the performance on each of the two existing TRICARE  contracts for 1 year valued at $6.6 billion under the \u201conly one  responsible source\u201d competition exception to provide managed care  support services. According to the J&A, these options were  necessary after unexpected delays in the acquisition process were  triggered by protests at the agency level and to GAO of the prior  competitive awards for these services. The extensions allowed  TRICARE to compete a large follow-on contract while implementing  recommendations stemming from the sustained GAO protest without  disrupting the delivery of health care services to TRICARE  beneficiaries.", "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers justified a $22 million  noncompetitive modification of an existing contract under the \u201conly  one responsible source\u201d competition exception after learning of a  major construction requirement in Afghanistan with little notice. As a  result, current plans for prison construction already under way were  unexpectedly expanded and had to be completed within a short time  frame. According to the J&A, the only way to meet this time frame was  to not compete a new contract.

Specifically, in November 2010 DOD issued a memorandum  that requires contracting officers to provide additional time for  contractors to respond to solicitations when only one offer is received,  if less than 30 days was provided for the receipt of proposals under  the original solicitation. In addition, if a solicitation allowed at least 30  days for receipt of offers and only one offer was received, the  contracting officer must determine prices to be fair and reasonable  through price or cost analysis or enter negotiations with the offeror.", "In addition, in July 2010, in response to our recommendations and  as part of the Better Buying Power initiative, the Chairman of  DOD\u2019s Panel on Contracting Integrity established a new  subcommittee tasked with examining improvements for  competitive opportunities and ways to be more effective at  reducing single source buys. According to a DOD procurement  policy official, the subcommittee is in the process of reviewing and  responding to comments on the proposed rule on competitive  procurements with only one offer, which is expected to be finalized  in late spring 2012.", "DOD has also taken actions to enhance the competition advocate  role, such as requiring each component or agency competition  advocate to develop a plan to improve the overall rate of competition  by at least two percent per year, and the rate of \u201ceffective competition\u201d  by at least 10 percent per year. DOD also holds quarterly meetings  where competition advocates from the military services and other  DOD agencies review the progress toward meeting competition  procurement goals and discuss challenges and best practices. In  December 2011, DOD issued a department-wide memorandum  stating that DOD did not meet its fiscal year 2011 competition goals  under the Better Buying Power initiative. DOD\u2019s competition advocate  stated that the department is paying too much for products and  services and that competition is the key to driving down prices. He  urged the component competition advocates to continue to identify  shortcomings in competitive procedures and to communicate new  ideas with each other on how to implement and improve competition.  The memorandum also outlines fiscal year 2012 competition goals for  DOD overall as well as for individual departments and components.  DOD does not establish separate goals for products and services.  The fiscal year 2012 goal for DOD overall (60 percent) is lower than  the fiscal year 2011 goal (62.8 percent). According to a DOD  procurement policy official, competition goals for fiscal year 2012 were  established based on actual competition rates over the past few  years.", "During our previous work, DOD officials reported they have taken  additional steps at the component level to enhance competition\u2014such as  efforts to educate and hold program officials accountable and additional  review of individual contract actions under class J&As.", "In July 2010, we reported that the Navy has made competition training  mandatory for personnel engaged in the acquisition process, including  program managers, program executive officers and logistics  personnel. In addition, in 2009 a senior Navy official told us that the  Navy is following up with program managers who previously  submitted J&As but stated that the requirement would be competed  the next year to see if program managers are actually competing  these requirements in the future.", "In January 2012, we reported that the Air Force revised its process for  a recently approved national security class justification for an  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance program office,  requiring individual contract actions over $85.5 million to be submitted  to the Air Force senior procurement executive for expedited review.  According to an Air Force General Counsel official, the Air Force has  not yet determined what type of documentation will be required as  part of that review, but it believes the increased review may identify  additional opportunities for competition. We recommended that DOD  evaluate the Air Force\u2019s new review process for national security  exception actions under class justifications and implement a similar  process across the department if it is found beneficial; DOD agreed  with this recommendation.", "In addition to the recent actions DOD has taken, in July 2010, we  identified other opportunities to increase competition across the federal  government. These include emphasizing the role of program officials in  influencing competition, better understanding the circumstances leading  to only one offer on competitive contracts, and examining how  competition advocates are appointed.

For competitive contract actions, we included contracts and  orders coded as \u201cfull and open competition,\u201d \u201cfull and open after exclusion  of sources,\u201d \u201ccompetitive delivery order,\u201d and \u201ccompeted under simplified  acquisition procedures\u201d as well as orders coded as subject to fair  opportunity and as \u201cfair opportunity given.\u201d For noncompetitive contract  actions, we included contracts and orders coded as \u201cnot competed,\u201d \u201cnot  available for competition,\u201d \u201cnot competed under simplified acquisition  procedures,\u201d \u201cfollow-on to competed action,\u201d and \u201cnon-competitive  delivery order\u201d as well as orders coded as subject to fair opportunity and  under an exception to fair opportunity, including \u201curgency,\u201d \u201conly one  source,\u201d \u201cminimum guarantee,\u201d \u201cfollow-on action following competitive  initial action,\u201d and \u201cother statutory authority.\u201d In addition, we identified  fiscal year 2011 obligations under contracts where more than one offer  had been received. We calculated competition rates as the percentage of  obligations on competitive contracts and orders over all obligations on  contracts and orders. We focused our review on non-research and  development (R&D) services to concentrate our analysis on contracts not  related to development of weapons systems, but conducted limited  analysis to understand competition rates for R&D services as compared  to non-R&D services and to products, in fiscal year 2011. We also  identified trends in competition rates for non-R&D services at DOD  components from fiscal years 2007 through 2011. We assessed  competition rates across the 23 non-R&D service categories in FPDS-NG  as well as across DOD and non-DOD contracting organizations (those  organizations that obligated funds for services on DOD\u2019s behalf in fiscal  year 2011).", "We also examined the reasons cited in FPDS-NG for not competing DOD  contracts and orders for services in fiscal year 2011. To do so, we  selected and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 111 justification  and approval (J&A) and exception to fair opportunity documents to  identify what circumstances led to the award of noncompetitive contracts  and orders. While agencies are generally required to post J&As to the  FedBizOpps.gov website, we did not assess whether the available data  represented the full universe. We used a non-generalizable sample to  provide illustrative examples of J&As, which was an appropriate approach  to meet our reporting objective.

We also reviewed recent GAO interviews with DOD  officials to identify barriers to competition as well as actions underway or  planned for the future to improve competition. Interviews were conducted  as part of previous work related to government-wide competition, national  security competition exception, and acquisition planning.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2011 to March  2012, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
