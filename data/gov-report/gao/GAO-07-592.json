In response to concerns about animal disease outbreaks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced in December 2003 that it would implement a nationwide program--later named the National Animal Identification System (NAIS)--to help producers and animal health officials respond quickly and effectively to animal disease events in the United States. In this context, GAO determined (1) how effectively USDA is implementing NAIS and, specifically, the key issues identified by livestock industry groups, market operators, state officials, and others; (2) how USDA has distributed cooperative agreement funds to help states and industry prepare for NAIS and evaluated the agreements' results; and (3) what USDA and others estimate are the costs for USDA, states, and industry to implement NAIS. In conducting its work, GAO reviewed USDA documents; interviewed agency, industry, and state officials; and consulted 32 animal identification (ID) experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In implementing the NAIS program, USDA has taken some steps to address issues identified by livestock industry groups, market operators, state animal health officials, and others. Nonetheless, the agency has not effectively addressed several issues that, if left unresolved, could undermine the program's ability to achieve the goal of rapid and effective animal disease traceback. Specifically, USDA's decision to implement NAIS as a voluntary program may affect the agency's ability to attract the necessary levels of participation. However, some industry groups believe that NAIS could succeed as a voluntary program, or that USDA needs to first resolve several issues before making participation mandatory. Agency officials are analyzing what participation levels are necessary to meet the program's goal and may introduce benchmarks to measure progress. In addition, several key problems hinder USDA's ability to implement NAIS effectively. USDA has not prioritized the implementation of NAIS by species or other criteria. Instead, the agency is implementing NAIS for numerous species simultaneously, causing federal, state, and industry resources to be allocated widely, rather than being focused on the species of greatest concern. USDA has not developed a plan to integrate NAIS with preexisting USDA and state animal ID requirements. As a result, producers are generally discouraged from investing in new ID devices for NAIS. USDA has not established a robust process for selecting, standardizing, and testing animal ID and tracking technologies. USDA does not clearly define the time frame for rapid traceback, possibly slowing response and causing greater economic losses. USDA does not require potentially critical information to be recorded, such as species or age, in the NAIS databases. USDA has awarded $35 million in NAIS cooperative agreements from fiscal years 2004 through 2006 to 49 states, 29 tribes, and 2 territories to help identify effective approaches to register premises and identify and track animals. However, USDA has not consistently monitored or formally evaluated the results of cooperative agreements or consistently shared the results with states, industry groups, and other stakeholders. As a result, USDA cannot be assured that the agreements' intended outcomes have been achieved and, furthermore, that lessons learned and best practices are used to inform the program's progress. No comprehensive cost estimate or cost-benefit analysis for the implementation and maintenance of NAIS currently exists. As a result, it is not known how much is required in federal, state, and industry resources to achieve rapid and effective traceback, or whether the potential benefits of the program outweigh the costs. Industry groups and state officials say the cost of implementing NAIS is one of their biggest concerns. USDA plans to hire a contractor to conduct a cost-benefit analysis, in part to more precisely forecast the economic effects of NAIS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agriculture provides an abundant supply of food and other products  for Americans and others around the world, annually generating more than  $1 trillion in economic activity, including more than $68 billion in exports  in 2006. Because of the economic importance of the agriculture sector and  the risks to public health as well as the economy, we have designated the  federal oversight of food safety as a high-risk area. Within the broader  sector, livestock production contributed nearly $123 billion to the U.S.  economy in 2006, including $13.4 billion in livestock, poultry, and dairy  exports. One way to protect the health of livestock animals\u2014which are  critically important to the integrity and safety of the nation\u2019s food supply,  the well-being of Americans, and the U.S. economy\u2014is through a national  animal identification (ID) system to trace back and contain diseases that  spread rapidly. Our recent work has described animal diseases and their  economic and, in some cases, human health consequences. For example, a  highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has spread to nearly 60  countries over the past few years, resulting in the death and destruction of  millions of wild and domestic birds and infecting almost 300 humans,  more than one-half of whom have died\u2014creating serious concerns that the  virus could reach North America at any time. In addition, the first known  U.S. case discovered in December 2003 of one cow infected with bovine  spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) caused the U.S. beef industry to lose  more than 80 percent of its export trade, or an estimated $2 billion,  between January and September 2004. Commonly known as mad cow  disease, BSE has been linked by scientists to a fatal neurological disease in  humans known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Another disease of  particular concern is foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious  livestock disease that does not typically affect humans and last occurred  in the United States in 1929. According to several estimates, the direct  costs of controlling and eradicating a U.S. outbreak of FMD could range  up to $27 billion in current dollars.", "In response to concerns about such outbreaks occurring in the United  States and in recognition that speed and accuracy are critical factors in  controlling a disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  announced in December 2003 that it would lead the design and  implementation of a nationwide program\u2014later named the National  Animal Identification System (NAIS)\u2014to enable USDA, states, and  industry to quickly and efficiently locate all infected and potentially  exposed animals and premises that have had contact with a foreign or  domestic disease of concern. USDA recognized that a fully functional  animal tracking system will keep the United States competitive in  international markets, can help reassure foreign consumers about the  health of U.S. livestock, and may satisfy other countries\u2019 import  requirements. Internationally, some of the United States\u2019 major trading  partners\u2014such as the European Union (EU), Japan, and Canada\u2014already  have mandatory national animal ID programs in place for certain species.  The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture  to carry out operations and measures to detect, control, or eradicate  livestock pests and diseases, and USDA has delegated this responsibility  to its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service\u2019s (APHIS) Veterinary  Services. USDA cites this broad authority for implementing NAIS as either  a voluntary or mandatory program.", "NAIS is currently being implemented for nine livestock species groups:  bison; camelids (llamas and alpacas); cattle (beef and dairy); cervids (deer  and elk); equine (horses, mules, donkeys, and burros); goats; poultry;  sheep; and swine. Since 2004, USDA has received input on the design and  implementation of the program from various stakeholders, including  industry groups, individual producers, livestock markets, slaughter  facilities (processors), and state animal health officials. USDA says that  because NAIS is a state-federal-industry partnership, the agency has used  stakeholder input to adjust the program as NAIS has evolved, and it  encourages continued stakeholder input.", "NAIS consists of three components: (1) registering all \u201cpremises\u201d that  manage or handle livestock, such as farms, feedlots, veterinary clinics, and  livestock markets; (2) identifying livestock animals; and (3) tracking  animal movements throughout the production process, from their  premises of origin to their slaughter or death. Initially, USDA stated that  NAIS would start as a voluntary program and later become mandatory,  but, in late 2006, the agency decided that NAIS would remain voluntary.  The agency also provided a timeline for implementation and set  participation benchmarks that called for gradually increasing the  percentages of premises registered, animals identified, and animals  tracked. By August 2005, all states had the capability of registering  premises, and, as of late May 2007, USDA reported that more than 390,000  premises, or 27.5 percent of the national estimate, were registered in NAIS.", "Of the total $85.0 million funding made available for NAIS from fiscal years  2004 through 2006, USDA has awarded $35.0 million in cooperative  agreements to states, territories, and tribes to help identify effective  approaches to register premises and to identify and track animals. In fiscal  year 2007, Congress appropriated another $33.0 million to develop and  implement NAIS, and the President\u2019s Budget in fiscal year 2008 requested  an additional $33.1 million for the program. Premises registration is  currently funded by USDA, states, territories, and tribes and, therefore, is  free to the producer. The costs of animal ID and tracking are to be borne  by the livestock industry and will vary, depending on the choices made by  individual producers.", "In this context, we determined (1) how effectively USDA is implementing  NAIS and, specifically, the key implementation issues identified by  livestock industry groups, market operators, state animal health officials,  and others; (2) how USDA has distributed cooperative agreement funding  to help states and industry prepare for NAIS and evaluated the  agreements\u2019 results; and (3) what USDA and others estimate are the costs  for USDA, states, and the livestock industry to implement and maintain  NAIS.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed USDA documents,  interviewed agency officials responsible for implementing NAIS, and  conducted site visits to selected livestock markets and cooperative  agreement field trials. We also conducted structured interviews in person  or via telephone with animal health officials in seven states. These states  were selected on the basis of their geographic dispersion; the range in the  number of premises located in each state; and, in some cases, their high  levels of livestock production. We also conducted structured interviews in  person or via telephone with, and reviewed documents from,  representatives from numerous stakeholder organizations, including  several NAIS industry working groups. In addition, for the first and third  objectives, we convened a Web-based panel of 32 experts to learn their  beliefs and opinions on various aspects of USDA\u2019s implementation of  NAIS. We selected experts who were actively involved in the development  or implementation of NAIS and were knowledgeable of its details; who  had conducted research on animal ID, or had published in peer-reviewed  journals on animal ID; or who were recognized by their peers as an expert  on NAIS. For the second objective, we also reviewed USDA  documentation related to cooperative agreements signed between USDA  and states, territories, tribes, and industry groups from fiscal years 2004  through 2007. For the third objective, we asked USDA and others for any  NAIS cost estimates they had developed, and we reviewed federal  guidance for developing cost-benefit analyses. A more detailed description  of our scope and methodology is presented in appendix I. We conducted  our work from June 2006 to May 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The concept of animal ID is not new, in the United States or abroad. For  decades, American producers have kept records on, and used ID methods  for, livestock animals for both commercial and regulatory purposes.  Specifically, several USDA and state animal disease eradication  programs\u2014such as programs for tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, pseudorabies  in swine, and scrapie in sheep and goats\u2014include animal ID requirements.  Certain species and classes of animals require officially recognized ID  devices for interstate commerce, and all live animals imported into, or  exported from, the United States require official ID. Thus, many livestock  animals are already identified in the United States by ear tags, branding,  tattoos, or other devices. However, the use of ID devices varies by breed,  species, and state, and, until NAIS, no attempt had been made to create a  uniform animal ID system of national scope and across multiple species  using a universal numbering system and central data repository.", "Due to serious concerns about the United States\u2019 ability to safeguard its  livestock from the harmful effects of disease, in 2002, the National  Institute of Animal Agriculture\u2014an organization of producers,  veterinarians, scientists, government representatives, and allied  industries\u2014initiated a state-USDA-industry task force of approximately 70  representatives to create a national animal ID system. In 2003, USDA  expanded upon this work and established a development team consisting  of more than 70 industry associations, organizations, and government  agencies. That team ultimately produced the United States Animal  Identification Plan in December 2003, which provided the foundation for  NAIS. Although early versions of the plan focused on food animals only,  other livestock species were later incorporated. The plan was being  finalized when the nation\u2019s first case of BSE was confirmed on December  25, 2003. Five days later, the Secretary of Agriculture announced measures  to guard against BSE and indicated that USDA would expedite the  implementation of a national animal ID system.", "Since 2004, USDA has solicited public comments on draft NAIS policy  documents, held public listening sessions, and met with industry groups  and others in its efforts to design and implement NAIS. In addition, USDA  has received input from 10 working groups comprising producers,  academics, and others representing the various livestock species and  industry sectors currently included in NAIS. These working groups make  recommendations to the NAIS Subcommittee, a group of state and  industry stakeholders established by USDA in September 2004 to provide  regular, formal input to the USDA Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on  Foreign Animal and Poultry Diseases (full committee) about how NAIS  should progress. The NAIS Subcommittee is also responsible for receiving  input from the National Institute of Animal Agriculture; the United States  Animal Health Association, an organization representing state  veterinarians and allied industry groups; and other organizations and  individuals. The full committee is a federal advisory group of state,  academic, and industry experts selected by the Secretary, which meets  once a year or as deemed necessary by the Secretary. While the NAIS  Subcommittee meets periodically, the full committee has met only twice\u2014 in September 2004 and September 2006\u2014since the creation of NAIS.  USDA is not obligated to take action on the NAIS Subcommittee\u2019s, full  committee\u2019s, or others\u2019 recommendations.", "For the premises registration component of NAIS, states and tribes are  responsible for submitting premises information\u2014given to them by  producers and others\u2014to a central, Web-based USDA premises database.  In turn, USDA allocates a unique, 7-digit, alphanumeric, premises ID  number (e.g., A123B45). The premises then receives confirmation online  or by mail from the relevant state or tribe with its unique premises ID  number.", "For the animal ID component, USDA published an interim rule, effective in  November 2004, recognizing the Animal Identification Number as a new,  official numbering system for individual animals in interstate commerce.  Producers and other NAIS participants can order ID devices from USDA- approved managers that are imprinted with a unique, 15-digit Animal  Identification Number for use on animals that move through the  production process as individuals, as is typical in the cattle, sheep, and  goat industries. Figure 1 shows a calf that is identified with tags in both  ears, with the calf\u2019s left ear bearing an electronic tag and its right ear  bearing a visual tag. Both tags have the Animal Identification Number for  official ID purposes, and the visual tag also has a number used for the  producer\u2019s herd management purposes. For animals of the same species  that typically move through the production chain as a group, such as  commercial poultry and swine, producers can instead identify the animals  with a group/lot ID number. Group/Lot ID numbers are self-generated by  the premises (not assigned by USDA) and are maintained at the premises  in management records.", "Lastly, for the animal tracking component, USDA has developed the  Animal Trace Processing System to allow state and federal animal health  officials to request information, in the event of an animal health  investigation, from multiple private and state animal tracking databases  containing animal location and movement records. Producers and others  are responsible for reporting certain animal movements, such as when a  change of ownership occurs or when animals commingle with other herds  or flocks. Events that would enable state and federal animal health  officials to request information from this network of databases include an  indication or a confirmed positive test of a foreign animal disease, an  animal disease emergency as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture  or state departments of agriculture, or a need to conduct a trace to  determine the origin of infection for a domestic disease of concern. (See  app. II for a list of domestic and foreign animal diseases of concern  identified by USDA.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key NAIS Implementation Issues Are Unresolved and Could Undermine the Program\u2019s Goal of Rapid and Effective Traceback", "paragraphs": ["USDA has steadily increased the number of livestock premises registered  in the nation and has taken some steps to address stakeholder concerns in  implementing NAIS.

One of USDA\u2019s first major  NAIS policy documents, the Draft Strategic Plan 2005-2009, released in  April 2005, stated that during initial implementation, participation would  be voluntary so that stakeholders could have the opportunity to obtain  experience with the program and provide feedback as successful and  practical solutions evolved. The plan also provided a timeline for  implementation, with premises registration and animal ID to be required  by January 2008 and the reporting of defined animal movements to be  required by January 2009, under what would become an entirely  mandatory program. The plan stated that this phased-in approach was \u201cto  support the transition from voluntary to mandatory as full implementation  is achieved.\u201d In addition, the plan also stated that, \u201cWhile market forces  may eventually create more inclusiveness, the clear stakeholder support  for transitioning to a mandatory program and the urgency of achieving the  goal, suggest that setting a date for that transition would benefit the  program.\u201d", "Later, the April 2006 Strategies for the Implementation of NAIS set  benchmarks that were intended to gauge progress in attaining full  participation. These benchmarks called for gradually increasing the  percentages of premises registered, animals identified, and animals  tracked from January 2007 through January 2009. Specifically, for  premises registration, USDA aimed for 25 percent participation by January  2007, 70 percent by January 2008, and 100 percent by January 2009. In  addition, the implementation plan called for 40 percent of animals being  identified by January 2008, 100 percent of \u201cnew\u201d animals less than 1 year  of age being identified by January 2009, and 60 percent of new animals  having complete tracking data by January 2009. USDA stated that it would  evaluate whether participation levels were increasing at rates that would  achieve full participation by 2009, and that, if this were not the case, USDA  would develop federal regulations to require industry to identify their  premises and animals.", "In May 2006, in an announcement for NAIS cooperative agreements, USDA  stated that it anticipated promulgating regulations by early 2008 to require  participation in all three components of the program. Furthermore, in a  document supporting its fiscal year 2007 budget submission to OMB,  USDA stated that the intrinsic value of its investment in NAIS was based  on the assumption that there would be sufficient animal ID and movement  data available to support the program\u2019s traceback goal. USDA also said  that if participation fell below expectations, traceback would periodically  fail because of the lack of animal tracking information from  nonparticipants.", "However, in August 2006, reporting that 20 percent of the nation\u2019s  premises had been registered, USDA decided that NAIS would  permanently remain a voluntary program. USDA officials told us that due  to opposition from some industry groups, it is imperative that industry  advance the program, rather than government regulations, to encourage  participation. Some industry groups believe that NAIS could succeed as a  voluntary program or that USDA first needs to resolve several key  implementation issues before making participation mandatory. For  example, officials from the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association told us  they believe that NAIS could be successful as a voluntary program, such as  the beef industry\u2019s 20-year-old Beef Quality Assurance program, which  covers about 95 percent of cattle in feedlots and aims to reduce drug  residues and pathogen contamination. The association officials also told  us that if NAIS became mandatory, producers who have voluntarily  participated would lose the market advantage they currently enjoy through  higher prices paid at market or slaughter for animals they identify for  marketing or management purposes. Another industry group, the  American Farm Bureau Federation, which in 2006 supported NAIS being a  mandatory program, expressed its support in January 2007 for NAIS to be  voluntary, while cautioning that USDA should not make the program  mandatory until the agency has published a full cost analysis for the  program. The Livestock Marketing Association\u2014a national trade  association representing over 700 livestock auction markets, dealers, and  other livestock marketing businesses\u2014also wrote in comments to USDA  in 2005 that NAIS should remain voluntary until USDA addresses several  implementation issues, including the effectiveness and availability of  animal ID technology.", "In November 2006, USDA also dropped its participation benchmarks from  the most recent policy document for the program, the draft NAIS User  Guide. Despite a steady increase in the number of premises registered  since USDA began reporting premises registration information in January  2005 and reaching the 25 percent target (nearly 360,000 premises) in early  February 2007 (see fig. 2), USDA officials told us they dropped the  participation benchmarks because meeting future benchmarks for all  components of NAIS was no longer realistic. Instead, the officials said the  agency is analyzing what participation levels for all components of NAIS  would achieve the \u201ccritical mass\u201d necessary to have an efficient and  effective program. The officials added that the agency does not expect that  equal levels of involvement across all species will be necessary, and that  new, risk-based participation benchmarks for premises registration,  animal ID, and animal tracking may be developed accordingly, which  could vary by species. However, USDA has not determined what action it  may take if participation levels do not meet those new benchmarks.", "Although it may be too soon to determine whether USDA\u2019s current  approach will be successful, many industry groups, state animal health  officials, and the experts we surveyed say the program will likely need to  become mandatory to achieve the levels of participation that are necessary  to rapidly and effectively locate all potentially exposed animals in a  disease traceback. In the Draft Strategic Plan, for instance, USDA  reported that most individuals who spoke about this subject at the  agency\u2019s 2004 listening sessions preferred, by a ratio of 3:1, a mandatory  program to a purely voluntary program. USDA also reported at that time  that a survey of National Institute of Animal Agriculture members showed  even stronger support, by a ratio of 8:1, for a program that is or will  become mandatory. In addition, state and industry officials we interviewed  said that as a voluntary program without benchmarks, NAIS has lost  momentum, deterred participation, and faces an uncertain future. For  example, officials from one major agricultural state told us that USDA\u2019s  changed direction on whether the program would become mandatory has  challenged the state\u2019s premises registration efforts, because many  producers are motivated by compliance with federal requirements, not  necessarily by NAIS\u2019s traceback goal alone. These officials also said that  the lack of participation benchmarks had compromised the state\u2019s  credibility with producers and its ability to make progress in  implementation. As of early June 2007, this state had less than 16 percent  of its premises registered, and the officials believed there is little incentive  for producers to participate in NAIS. Moreover, three states where  premises registration is mandatory by state law\u2014Indiana, Michigan, and  Wisconsin\u2014accounted for about 26 percent of USDA\u2019s total premises  registered nationally as of that time.", "Furthermore, a majority of the 32 expert panel members said that 81  percent to 100 percent of producers, livestock markets, and slaughter  facilities would need to register their premises to achieve the program\u2019s  goal of rapid and effective traceback (see apps. III and IV for more details  about these experts and their responses to our questions). By contrast,  under a voluntary program, only 1 expert believed that producers would  achieve at least 81 percent participation in premises registration, while 11  experts believed that level would be achieved by livestock markets, and 20  experts believed that level would be achieved by slaughter facilities. For  the animal ID and tracking components, experts had similar views. For  example, a majority believed that 76 percent to 100 percent of producers,  markets, and slaughter facilities would need to participate in animal  tracking to make the program effective, while a minority believed that  level would be achieved in any of those sections under a voluntary  program. Overall, 27 of the 32 experts said participation in NAIS should  definitely or probably be mandatory.", "Several other countries, including the United States\u2019 major agricultural  trading partners and competitors, have instituted mandatory animal ID  programs for cattle and, in some cases, a few other species. For example,  the EU has mandatory programs in which all cattle born or moved across  EU state lines as of 2000 must be identified with two individual ear tags  and an animal passport, and member states must maintain computerized  databases that record births, movements, and deaths. Since several cases  of BSE were discovered in 2001, Japan has made a series of changes to its  food safety legislation, resulting in a mandatory system where all beef and  dairy cattle must be identified using an ear tag. Information is maintained  on an animal\u2019s ID number, breed, gender, and production history from the  farm of origin through distribution to consumers. Similarly, in 2001,  Canada started a compulsory animal ID program that applies to all bovine  and bison and now requires that animals receive a radio frequency  identification (RFID) tag when leaving their herd of origin, which is  collected at slaughter or export. Canada later expanded its program to  sheep in 2004, requiring the use of visual ear tags. Brazil, the world\u2019s  largest beef exporter, gradually phased in its mandatory ID program for  cattle and bison starting in January 2002; the entire herd is expected to be  identified by the end of 2007. Australia, the world\u2019s second-largest beef  exporter, has developed a mandatory system that uses RFID to identify  and trace cattle from farm of origin to slaughter. Australia has been  moving toward a fully integrated program linking electronic ID devices,  product bar coding, and a central electronic database. Appendix V  provides more detailed information on select international animal ID and  tracking programs.", "To increase participation in NAIS, several industry groups, state animal  health officials, and the experts we surveyed have also suggested that  USDA provide incentives, such as financial assistance, to industry to  implement the animal ID and tracking components. For instance, the NAIS  Cattle Working Group recommended in 2004 that USDA assume primary  financial responsibility for funding the initial development of the basic  infrastructure required for animal ID and tracking\u2014including equipping  concentration points, such as livestock markets and slaughter facilities,  with RFID readers and software to capture the data electronically.  Livestock market operators and others also say such financial support  would be an attractive incentive because RFID technology, if effective,  would allow animal movements to be recorded as quickly as the current  \u201cspeed of commerce\u201d and, therefore, would not slow down business  operations. The NAIS Subcommittee also recommended, in 2005, a cost- sharing arrangement between USDA and industry to fund the program\u2019s  implementation. The Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Foreign Animal  and Poultry Diseases adopted these recommendations as well as the other  NAIS working group and Subcommittee recommendations presented at its  September 2006 meeting. One state that has already created a cost-sharing  incentive is Wisconsin, where the state contributes 50 percent, or up to $1,  of the cost of an RFID ear tag on a first-come, first-served basis under its  voluntary animal ID program. Wisconsin officials say the cost-sharing  arrangement is designed to make the program more attractive to the  state\u2019s producers, and, as of early March 2007, the state had approved  reimbursing producers for a total of 30,000 tags for cattle, which was up  from 20,000 tags the previous month.", "However, USDA officials told us that the power of producers to protect  themselves and their animals is a tremendous incentive for participation in  NAIS, and, as the program continues to be implemented and developed,  additional incentives will be realized by USDA, producers, and state and  industry partners. Nonetheless, whether NAIS is mandatory or voluntary,  the lack of participation benchmarks prevents USDA from measuring  progress in attaining the necessary participation levels for an effective  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Other Key Issues Hinder USDA\u2019s Ability to Implement NAIS Effectively", "paragraphs": ["Industry groups, market operators, state animal health officials, and others  have identified several other key problems that, if left unresolved, could  undermine the program\u2019s goal, further hindering USDA\u2019s ability to  implement the NAIS program effectively."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USDA Has Not Prioritized the Implementation of NAIS by Species or Other Criteria", "paragraphs": ["USDA has not prioritized the implementation of NAIS by species or other  criteria. Instead, the agency is currently implementing NAIS  simultaneously for numerous species, regardless of their economic value,  their risk of diseases of concern, the potential human health impact of  these diseases, or other criteria. Consequently, federal, state, and industry  resources for NAIS have been allocated widely, rather than being focused  first on the species of greatest concern and allowing other species to be  included later, on the basis of lessons learned. In contrast, international  animal ID programs have generally started implementation with one  species (cattle) and, in some cases, later expanded to include a few other  species, such as sheep, bison, and goats, on the basis of disease risk,  economic importance, or potential human health impact. In addition, 21 of  the 32 expert panel members said USDA should definitely or probably  implement NAIS incrementally by species, while 8 experts said USDA  should definitely or probably continue with its current approach to  implement the program for numerous species simultaneously. Many of  the 32 experts suggested criteria that USDA could use to determine the  priorities given to each species in implementing NAIS, including whether it  is a food animal; its likelihood of capturing diseases of concern; the risk  that the animal will spread a disease harmful to human health; the relative  ease of implementation for a particular industry; and the industry\u2019s impact  on the U.S. economy, including export value.", "Prioritizing implementation for certain species before trying to apply the  program to numerous species would likely result in more efficient and  cost-effective implementation, on the basis of lessons learned and best  practices being identified. In addition, the industries currently covered by  NAIS appear to be at various stages of readiness to implement NAIS. For  example, the Bison, Camelid, Cattle, Equine, Swine, Sheep, and Goat  Working Groups have submitted reports to USDA with implementation  recommendations for their industries, but the Cervid and Poultry Working  Groups have not. Furthermore, according to industry representatives,  some industries, such as commercial swine and poultry operations,  already have widespread ID and tracking systems in place that would  allow traceback to occur within 48 hours, while other industries may not.", "USDA officials pointed out that an animal ID program to support the  animal health needs of all livestock species would be unique in the world  and would place the United States in a position to set a new standard for  animal ID. Some industry groups have expressed their support for NAIS  being implemented for all species, since many transmissible diseases are  not species-specific. For example, the National Livestock Producers  Association, which represents about 200,000 producers across the country,  wrote USDA in 2005 that the true value of NAIS rests in its potential ability  to track all livestock animals, regardless of species, due to the extent of  their commingling and potential to spread disease. The association added  that NAIS would not be very effective or equitable if all species were not  included as soon as possible. Furthermore, 21 of the 32 experts we  surveyed said USDA should definitely or probably continue with its  current approach to include all species, rather than limit NAIS to one or a  few species. USDA officials also told us that establishing NAIS across all  species is critical, because many operations handle more than one species,  and that focusing entirely on cattle, as some other countries have done, is  a critical flaw since some animal diseases cross species lines. Nonetheless,  USDA officials told us they recognize that prioritizing program  implementation may be appropriate, such as by focusing on specific  diseases of concern or large commercial operations, and that the states  should determine their own priorities for implementation. These officials  also said future NAIS plans will more clearly identify higher-risk areas or  sectors within the species. In commenting on a draft of this report, USDA  told us it plans to develop, in collaboration with the species working  groups, a NAIS Short-Term and Long-Term Implementation Strategies  document that will contain actions for the remainder of 2007 through 2011.  Specifically, the agency stated that the short-term strategy, targeted for  publication in August 2007, will target species or industry sectors that have  the greatest need for advancing premises registration, animal ID, and  tracking. The long-term strategy will be distributed in early 2008 and will  call for an evaluation of participation through 2009 to determine what  actions, such as incentives, may be needed to accelerate participation in  the voluntary program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Not Developed a Plan for Integrating NAIS with Other USDA and State Animal ID Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Although USDA aims to minimize the financial and practical impact on  producers and others in implementing NAIS, the agency has not developed  a plan to integrate NAIS with preexisting programs and systems. Many  producers are already required to participate in preexisting USDA and  state animal disease eradication programs that use specific ID devices  with different numbering systems or that require branding. For example,  the National Scrapie Eradication Program for sheep and goats requires  visual ear tags, and other USDA-state programs require ear tags for  brucellosis and TB in cattle and ear notches in swine. In addition, several  western states recognize branding as an official ID for disease control  purposes. As a result, producers have generally been discouraged from  investing in new ID devices for NAIS, according to industry groups we  interviewed, thereby inhibiting implementation of the program\u2019s animal ID  and tracking components.", "Importantly, while USDA published an interim rule effective in November  2004 recognizing the Animal Identification Number as a new, official  numbering system for individual animals in interstate commerce, this new  system does not replace other, USDA-recognized, official numbering  systems. The rule established that the Animal Identification Number may  be used for official ID in other disease eradication programs. Nonetheless,  USDA officials told us that they are evaluating how NAIS and other official  ID systems can be standardized and moved to a single numbering system,  to the extent practical, and that eventually, the agency expects Animal  Identification Numbers to become the standard national numbering  system used for certain species, individual ID methods, or both. USDA told  us that as of early March 2007, 1.3 million Animal Identification Number  RFID ear tags had been distributed, including some that are being used for  state disease eradication programs. For example, USDA reported that  about 500,000 tags had been distributed to Michigan producers, where the  state\u2019s bovine TB eradication program requires all cattle to have RFID ear  tags prior to movement from their premises.", "For NAIS not to impose undue costs on producers by requiring additional  ID devices, stakeholders say the program must be integrated with  preexisting programs and systems. However, USDA faces challenges in  integrating NAIS with other animal ID requirements. For example, Sheep  Working Group members told us that because the scrapie program already  assigns a flock ID number to each premises\u2014plus a unique, individual ID  number to each animal\u2014sheep producers do not see the need to  participate in NAIS, which involves different premises and individual  animal ID numbering systems. Another challenge is that brands identify all  animals raised by a specific producer as a group, not as individuals, and  the same brands are often used in different states or even in different  counties within the same state. USDA\u2019s NAIS User Guide states that  registered brands are not considered to be an official, individual animal ID  as called for by NAIS because cattle typically move through the production  process as individuals. In addition, NAIS animal tracking requirements  may differ operationally from state brand laws and practices. For example,  New Mexico requires state authorities to inspect all livestock moving  across brand district lines, which contrasts with NAIS, where the  responsibility of reporting animal movement lies with the premises  receiving animals. New Mexico officials told us that if they were to  implement NAIS as envisioned, the time required for state inspections  would at least double if inspectors were required to read and report ID  tags. The Cattle Working Group recommended, in 2004, that USDA  develop protocols for integrating existing brand laws with NAIS individual  animal ID requirements and for the reporting of animals\u2019 movements from  brand law states to nonbrand law states.", "USDA officials told us that the need to have a single numbering system  across all species is less important than getting animals individually  identified and tracked using any official ID system recognized by USDA.  Furthermore, these officials said that while standardizing to a single  numbering system for animal ID may eventually be appropriate, USDA  recognizes there are differences among species and that cost, technology  capability, and practicality must be considered before phasing out existing  ID devices that have proven to be workable for producers. For example,  the 15-digit Animal Identification Number may not be the most practical  numbering system when used on visual ear tags for smaller animals since  the size of the tag does not lend itself to a 15-digit number. Nonetheless,  USDA officials are starting to address some integration issues. For  example, USDA officials told us in April 2007 that the agency has decided  to allow the official ID devices and numbering systems used by other  disease eradication programs for the purposes of NAIS as well, although  the agency has not yet communicated this development to industry. In  addition, in late 2006, a NAIS Brand State Working Group was formed, in  part to identify what brand concepts could integrate with NAIS. In  commenting on a draft of this report, USDA informed us that it will update  the NAIS User Guide in October 2007 to more clearly reflect the use of  other official ID numbers within NAIS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA Has Not Established a Robust Process for Selecting, Standardizing, and Testing ID and Tracking Technologies", "paragraphs": ["International programs have generally used specific animal ID devices for  their national animal ID programs, and some NAIS working groups have  recommended specific ID devices for their species, such as RFID ear tags  for cattle and RFID microchip implants for horses. However, USDA has  taken a \u201ctechnology-neutral\u201d position to allow market forces to determine  what devices are most effective and practical and to accommodate future  technologies. In a NAIS policy document on ID devices released in  February 2006, USDA stated that individual, visual ID devices are a  starting point to ensure greater participation among producers and  asserted that a neutral approach allows RFID; biometrics, such as DNA  and retinal imaging devices; and other potential technologies to be used as  supplemental identification. Nonetheless, that document also stated that  uniformity and compatibility of technology are critical to ensure that the  collection of animal ID data is practical and cost-effective throughout  production. Furthermore, USDA recognized the need to have ID  technologies that are compatible with Canada and Mexico. USDA also  stated that as NAIS is phased in, ongoing efforts to harmonize animal ID  with other countries will facilitate safe trade.", "While not all species can use the same devices due to industry preferences  or physical limitations, such as small ears, USDA\u2019s technology-neutral  approach means, for example in the cattle industry, that a producer can  choose to use visual ear tags; low- or high-frequency RFID ear tags; or  other advanced technologies, such as retinal imaging. There are costs and  benefits associated with any device. For example, visual ID devices are  less expensive but require manual recording, which may cause errors and  slow down the \u201cspeed of commerce\u201d at livestock markets and slaughter  facilities. RFID systems, on the other hand, allow data to be captured  automatically into databases, but these systems are also not consistently  accurate and are more expensive\u2014in terms of both the ID device and the  associated infrastructure (reader, installation, and computer use). With  such a wide range of options in animal ID and tracking devices, industry  groups and expert panel members told us that producers and market  operators fear that their choices may be inconsistent with others in the  marketplace, or that USDA will adopt specific devices in the future, and  they may find themselves having made the wrong investment decision. For  instance, a producer may find that the closest livestock market uses  electronic readers and cannot easily accommodate visual ear tags;  alternatively, the market may not have installed RFID reader equipment,  and the producer would not get the anticipated return on his or her  investment. From another perspective, a multispecies livestock market,  based on its customers, may face a dilemma of investing in equipment to  read and record visual tags, RFID tags, RFID implants, and other devices\u2014 or risk being unable to capture all information quickly and efficiently and  losing some customers. Consequently, producers, livestock markets, and  slaughter facilities have generally been discouraged from investing in ID or  tracking devices, thus inhibiting implementation of the animal ID and  tracking phases.", "Asked whether USDA\u2019s technology-neutral position encourages or  discourages producers\u2019 investment in animal ID technology, 23 of the 32  expert panel members said this position definitely or probably discourages  investment, and 6 said it definitely or probably encourages investment. In  their written responses elaborating on this question, several experts said  USDA\u2019s technology-neutral approach limits the interoperability  (compatibility) of different systems in place, thus reducing the viability of  a consistent, national traceback program. In addition, they wrote that it  has caused confusion, uncertainty, and a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d attitude in the  marketplace, and that it will take time to sort out efficient from inefficient  technologies. Conversely, other experts replied that USDA\u2019s technology- neutral approach allows marketplace competition to advance new or  improved technologies and drive fair prices. Similarly, for animal tracking,  more experts replied that USDA\u2019s approach definitely or probably  discourages investment by producers, livestock markets, and slaughter  facilities more than it encourages investment. For example, 22 experts said  USDA\u2019s approach discourages investment by livestock markets, compared  with 2 who said it encourages such investment; 17 experts said it  discourages investment by slaughter facilities, whereas 4 said it  encourages that industry sector to invest.", "While USDA has not selected specific animal ID devices, the agency has  published minimum standards for the various ID devices recommended to  date by the species working groups and the NAIS Subcommittee.  Specifically, USDA has established printing and performance standards for  visual and RFID ear tags that address characteristics such as durability  (expected tag life); tag loss; visual readability of the 15-digit Animal  Identification Number; and, in the case of RFID, electronic read rates and  ranges. USDA has published similar performance standards for RFID  implants, with additional characteristics addressing the migration or  breakage of the device and its being harmless to an animal. However,  USDA has not published standards for RFID readers and does not expect  to do so unless the agency purchases readers for use by animal health  officials, in which case it says it will define performance standards for  those specific environments. In addition, USDA has not established a  robust process to independently test and evaluate the performance of  animal ID and tracking devices.", "Industry groups, expert panel members, and others told us that RFID  devices do not always perform well in production environments, such as  livestock markets, particularly with RFID readers being made by different  companies. For example, one NAIS pilot project found that in loading  cattle onto commercial trucks, RFID readers read only 70 percent of the  RFID ear tags, with variations among tag manufacturers ranging from 47  percent to 96 percent. As a result, stakeholders are lacking reliable,  independent information on the effectiveness of animal ID and tracking  devices, and without such information, they are reluctant to invest in these  devices.", "It is common U.S. practice to select one technology for systems that need  to be widely implemented in different environments to ensure consistency  and interoperability across multiple users. We have previously reported  that a robust process for selecting technologies, setting and revising  performance standards, and testing and evaluating technologies against  those standards leads to the most effective and efficient use of  technology. For example, we have reported on the necessity of the  federal government\u2019s selection and standardization of RFID cards and  readers for federal employees so that the ID cards can be read at any  federal agency across the nation.", "Several expert panel members suggested that USDA provide funding for  independent, third-party evaluations of technologies and make results of  such work readily available; appoint a standards committee to evaluate  and make recommendations on the basis of sound science; or require  independent evidence that devices meet standards before approving them.  The NAIS Subcommittee also recommended, in 2006, that USDA establish  an objective process to (1) test the performance of ID devices to ensure  they meet NAIS standards in various production environments and over  extended periods and (2) evaluate new technologies as they emerge.  Typically, federal agencies rely on independent laboratories that are  certified by a government agency, such as the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, for such testing and evaluation.", "USDA officials told us they are working with industry to determine better  ways to define performance criteria and establish a more thorough  process to test and evaluate ID devices, but they did not specify a time  frame for these developments. Toward this end, the agency held  preliminary discussions in mid-April 2007 with the American Society for  Testing and Materials\u2019 Committee on Livestock, Meat and Poultry  Evaluation Systems to form a task force to fine-tune ID performance  standards for NAIS and help USDA put testing protocols in place. In the  February 2006 NAIS policy document on ID devices, USDA stated that  when NAIS becomes fully operational, the agency will develop an approval  process for official ID devices and more complete testing and evaluation  procedures.

However, USDA\u2019s most recent NAIS  policy document, the draft NAIS User Guide issued in November 2006, is  silent on this time frame and instead says NAIS will allow producers and  animal health officials to respond as \u201cquickly, efficiently, and effectively as  possible.\u201d By definition, traceback goals need to be time-sensitive and  cost-effective to efficiently target and evaluate the program\u2019s success in  eliminating a disease outbreak.

State animal  health and industry officials told us it is important that USDA  communicate a specific time frame to encourage participation, reinforce  the necessity of rapid traceback, and have a measure by which to evaluate  results. However, a senior USDA official told us that the definition of  \u201crapid traceback\u201d may vary by disease, because some diseases spread  more quickly than others and some diseases are limited in how they can be  transmitted. For example, traceback for FMD might ideally occur within  12 hours because the disease spreads so rapidly. By contrast, because BSE  is transmitted only through animal feed containing certain contaminated  animal products, and scrapie is transmitted during the breeding season, a  longer traceback would be appropriate.

Many diseases, such as bovine TB, affect only specific species or  generally affect animals of a certain age, such as in the case of Johne\u2019s  disease, which is usually contracted at a young age. Consequently, if a new  case of these diseases arose in the United States, tracing other species or  animals of a different age may unnecessarily use federal, state, and  industry resources in locating animals and premises that may not be  affected\u2014thus impeding the goal of rapid and effective traceback.  Similarly, most equine diseases of concern affect only equine species, and  exotic Newcastle disease affects only poultry, so tracing other species  would be an inefficient use of time and resources.

In addition, participants have  the option to record such information in ID and tracking databases, and  USDA encourages them to do so.

The 18 states that have registered between 11 percent and 25  percent of premises may spend up to 30 percent of their funding on animal  tracking infrastructure, while the 8 states that have registered between 6  percent and 10 percent of premises may spend up to 20 percent of funding  on animal tracking infrastructure.

Without a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for  NAIS, it is not known how much is required in federal, state, and industry  resources to achieve rapid and effective traceback, or whether the  potential benefits of the program outweigh the costs. In 2004, and again in  2006, the NAIS Subcommittee recommended that USDA prepare an in- depth, cost-benefit analysis for NAIS as part of the strategic planning  process. In addition, 29 of the 32 expert panel members said that USDA  should definitely or probably publish a cost-benefit analysis that contains  detailed NAIS cost and benefit information for the different sectors of the  livestock industry, states, and USDA. The NAIS working groups, other  livestock industry representatives, and state animal health officials we  interviewed said that the cost of implementing NAIS remained one of their  biggest concerns. For example, in comments to USDA in 2005, the  Livestock Marketing Association wrote that it is \u201chighly critical of the fact  that too little has been known\u201d about the potential costs of establishing a  national animal ID system and about who will bear those costs.  Furthermore, the association wrote that a cost-benefit analysis is \u201clong  overdue\u201d and that without better information, NAIS appears to be  prohibitively expensive for the livestock industry to implement. As a  result, without a reliable cost-benefit analysis that is consistent with  federal guidance, stakeholders are unlikely to participate in NAIS due to  their uncertainty that NAIS program benefits outweigh program costs.", "USDA announced plans in March 2007 to conduct a cost-benefit analysis  for NAIS. USDA officials told us that the cost-benefit analysis will be used  for program planning and resource allocation, producer and industry  education, and public relations and outreach and to more precisely  forecast the economic effects of NAIS. USDA officials anticipate that the  cost-benefit analysis will be available in 2008.", "As we have previously reported, measuring the economic performance of  federal programs, such as the extent to which program benefits exceed  costs (net benefits) or are achieved at least cost (cost-effectiveness), could  be a useful way to assess, in conjunction with other measures, the extent  to which federal programs are meeting the nation\u2019s priorities. In addition,  OMB has established general guidance on conducting cost-benefit  analyses of federal programs to promote efficient resource allocation  through well-informed decision making. OMB suggests that agencies  follow this guidance in conducting analyses used to support government  decisions to initiate, renew, or expand programs or projects that would  result in a series of measurable benefits or costs extending 3 or more years  into the future.

Because NAIS funding has been designated by  Congress to be available until expended, USDA can carry funds that it did  not expend in prior years forward into the current year. In addition to  these carryover funds, Congress appropriated an additional $33.0 million  for the NAIS program for fiscal year 2007.

In addition, a  successful program in sync with our international trading partners and  competitors could boost consumer confidence in U.S. animal products and  help maintain and expand market access. However, for NAIS to be fully  effective and efficient in responding to an animal disease emergency,  adequate levels of participation need to be achieved in all three NAIS  components\u2014premises registration, animal ID, and tracking. If insufficient  numbers of animals are identified and tracked, the system will have gaps,  despite millions of dollars being invested in the program\u2019s development.  Conversely, high levels of participation would better position the United  States to handle future animal health emergencies and minimize economic,  trade, and possibly human health consequences. USDA\u2019s changes in  direction over the past 3 years have caused considerable confusion and  frustration among many NAIS stakeholders, and the program\u2019s  implementation may be in danger of losing momentum. Most critically,  whether NAIS is voluntary or mandatory, the lack of participation  benchmarks makes it more difficult to gauge progress in attaining the  necessary levels of participation for an effective animal ID program and, if  there is insufficient participation, to develop strategies to achieve it.  Without meaningful progress, USDA\u2019s expenditures on NAIS will continue  to be questioned.", "In addition, if USDA does not resolve several key implementation issues,  the program will continue to face opposition by some industry  stakeholders, and participation in all three NAIS components could be  limited. Collectively, these unresolved issues will likely lead to ineffective  and inefficient implementation and prevent NAIS from achieving the goal  of rapid and effective traceback. First, prioritizing how NAIS is  implemented, such as by species, would allow USDA and stakeholders to  better allocate their resources and improve the program over time.  Second, the integration of NAIS with other USDA and state animal disease  eradication programs and branding systems would remove another hurdle  preventing participation in NAIS\u2019s animal ID and tracking components.  Third, creating a robust process for selecting, setting standards for, and  independently testing and evaluating animal ID and tracking devices in  meeting NAIS standards is important to ensure effectiveness and  interoperability across the national program and, therefore, would  encourage investment. Fourth, identifying time-sensitive and cost-effective  goals for traceback, which may vary by disease, would allow stakeholders  to have common goals in responding to an event, potentially speeding up  response and, therefore, minimizing economic losses. Fifth, requiring the  recording of information in NAIS databases that may be critical for  efficient traceback, such as species, approximate age, or date of birth,  would enable animal health authorities to more quickly locate only those  premises and animals that are relevant in an investigation, thus minimizing  time and resources and hastening response.", "Finally, we believe that if USDA were to provide industry, state, and other  stakeholders with key information on the results of cooperative  agreements, it would help identify the most effective and efficient means  to implement the program and likely increase participation and enable  producers, livestock markets, states, and other stakeholders to make  informed decisions about where to allocate scarce resources. Moreover,  for planning purposes in allocating federal, state, and industry resources, it  is important for stakeholders, Congress, and the public to know how much  it will cost to implement and maintain NAIS, compared with its benefits.

USDA stated that as  performance standards are established, the selection of such devices will  then be warranted. USDA also stated that as part of the evaluation  process, it will specify the testing standards and then review the  manufacturer\u2019s documentation of laboratory testing and field trials. In  addition, USDA stated that testing of such devices should be at the  expense of the device manufacturer.", "We recognize the need for USDA to work with stakeholders before  determining which ID and tracking devices are most appropriate for NAIS.  However, the sooner USDA selects specific technologies, the sooner  producers, livestock markets, slaughter facilities, and others will likely  participate in the animal ID and tracking components of NAIS. As a  starting point, some NAIS working groups have recommended specific ID  devices for their species. It is common U.S. practice to select one  technology for systems that need to be widely implemented in different  environments, and we have previously reported that a robust process for  selecting, standardizing, and testing and evaluating technologies leads to  the most effective and efficient systems. During the course of our work,  we found that USDA\u2019s technology-neutral position has caused producers,  market operators, and slaughter facilities to be generally discouraged from  investing in new animal ID or tracking devices for NAIS due to fear that  their choices might be inconsistent with others in the marketplace, or that  USDA might adopt specific devices in the future. The selection of specific  ID and tracking devices, therefore, would ensure consistency and  interoperability across the program\u2019s many potential users, leading to  more efficient implementation. Furthermore, as stated in this report,  USDA has recognized the need for animal ID technologies that are  compatible with Canada and Mexico, and it also has stated that  harmonizing the United States\u2019 program with other countries will facilitate  safe trade. Selecting technologies for NAIS that are in sync with our  trading partners and competitors could have positive trade implications  for the United States. Lastly, the selection of specific devices would inform  the cost-benefit analysis that USDA is currently conducting, which, in turn,  could affect participation levels. These reasons underscore the need for  USDA to select specific ID and tracking devices, on the basis of  independent, reliable information regarding their performance in meeting  minimum standards and of consultations with stakeholders.", "In its written comments, USDA also provided points of clarification and  provided details about current and future actions that the agency plans to  take to address our recommendations, which we incorporated throughout  the report, as appropriate.

We conducted structured  interviews in person or via telephone with animal health officials in seven  states: California, Iowa, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Vermont, and  Wisconsin. These states were selected on the basis of their geographic  dispersion; the range in the number of premises located in each state; and,  in some cases, their high levels of livestock production.

To determine  how USDA has evaluated the results of cooperative agreements, we  interviewed NAIS program staff, reviewed guidance provided to recipients,  and reviewed quarterly and final reports submitted to USDA by  cooperative agreement recipients. Because some cooperative agreements  were ongoing and because other recipients did not report to USDA in a  timely manner, we could not examine a complete set of quarterly and final  reports for all recipients. We conducted a reliability assessment of the data  that USDA provided to us on the NAIS cooperative agreements and found  these data to be reliable for our reporting purposes.", "For the third objective, to determine estimates of the costs to implement  and maintain NAIS, we asked representatives from USDA, industry groups,  academic institutions, and state animal health agencies for any NAIS cost  estimates they had developed.
