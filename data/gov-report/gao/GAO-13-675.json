Given the countries' dependence on compact funding, GAO was asked to conduct a review of the use and accountability of these funds. This report addresses (1) the FSM's and RMI's use of compact funds in the education and health sectors; (2) the extent to which the FSM and RMI have made progress toward stated goals in education and health; and (3) the extent to which oversight activities by the FSM, RMI, and U.S. governments ensure accountability for compact funding.

Because both countries spent significant amounts of compact funds on personnel in the education and health sectors, the U.S.-FSM and U.S.-RMI joint management and accountability committees capped budgets for personnel in these sectors at fiscal year 2011 levels due to concerns about the sustainability of sector budgets as compact funding continues to decline through fiscal year 2023. The FSM states completed plans to address annual decreases in compact funding; however, the FSM National Government and the RMI have not submitted plans to address these annual decreases as required. Without plans, the countries may not be able to sustain essential services in the education and health sectors in the future.", "Data reliability issues hindered GAO's assessment of progress by the FSM and RMI in the education and health sectors for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for the compacts as a whole. Between 2004 and 2006, both countries began tracking education and health indicators, establishing data collection systems, and collecting data for the majority of the indicators and have continued to track data on their indicators since that time. In education, GAO found 3 of 14 indicators in the subsets of indicators it reviewed for both countries to be sufficiently reliable and 1 also to be capable of demonstrating progress: the education level of teachers in the RMI. GAO found a variety of data reliability problems, such as some FSM states reporting data for both public and private schools while other states included only public schools in their data. In the health sector, GAO determined that data for all 5 of the subset of indicators it reviewed in the FSM were not sufficiently reliable to assess progress for the compacts as a whole, and in the RMI, 1 health indicator was sufficiently reliable and 2 were not sufficiently reliable; for 2 other RMI health indicators, GAO had no basis to judge. In much of their reporting on their education and health indicators, the FSM and RMI have noted data reliability problems and some actions they have taken to address the problems. The U.S.-FSM and U.S.-RMI joint management and accountability committees have also raised concerns about the reliability of FSM's education and health data and RMI's health data and required that each country obtain an independent assessment and verification of these data; both countries have yet to meet that requirement, and, as a result, neither country can determine its progress in these sectors.", "The single audit reports GAO reviewed indicated challenges to ensuring accountability of compact and noncompact U.S. funds in the FSM and RMI. For example, the governments' single audits showed repeat findings and persistent problems in noncompliance with U.S. program requirements, such as accounting for equipment. The Department of the Interior (Interior) has taken steps regarding accountability of compact funds such as establishing the Chuuk Financial Control Commission, but Interior has not coordinated with other U.S. agencies about the risk status of the FSM and RMI. Furthermore, the FSM, RMI, and U.S. offices responsible for compact administration faced limitations hindering their ability to conduct compact oversight. For example, Interior's Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) experienced a staffing shortage that disproportionately affected compact grant oversight compared to other OIA activities, with 5 of 11 planned positions filled."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other actions, Interior should (1) take all necessary steps to ensure the reliability of FSM and RMI indicators in education and health, (2) assess whether to designate each country as high risk, and (3) take actions to correct its disproportionate staffing shortage related to compact grant implementation and oversight.

We also reviewed FSM and RMI single audits for  fiscal years 2006 through 2011. In addition, we interviewed officials from  the Departments of the Interior (Interior), Health and Human Services  (HHS), Education (Education), and State (State). We also interviewed  FSM national and state officials and RMI officials in the health, education,  and infrastructure sectors, and we directly observed selected compact- funded education and health facilities in Chuuk and Pohnpei states in the  FSM and Majuro and Kwajalein Atolls in the RMI. The observations we  made during our site visits to facilities such as hospitals, dispensaries,  and schools in the FSM and RMI are not generalizable.

We found  one RMI education indicator to be both reliable and capable of  demonstrating progress: the education level of teachers in the RMI. The  other reliable RMI education indicator was student enrollment. We  determined that data for all five of the subset of FSM health indicators we  reviewed were not sufficiently reliable to assess progress for the  compacts as a whole. In the RMI, of the subset of five health indicators  we reviewed, we determined that one was sufficiently reliable and two  were not sufficiently reliable to assess progress; for the remaining two  indicators, we had no basis to judge the reliability of the data. In much of  their reporting on these indicators, the FSM and RMI have noted data  reliability problems and some actions they have taken to address the  problems. The compacts\u2019 joint management and accountability  committees have also raised concerns about the reliability of the FSM\u2019s  education and health data and the RMI\u2019s health data and required that  each country obtain an independent assessment and verification of these  data; neither country has met that requirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessment of FSM Progress in Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FSM Has Tracked Annual Indicators in Education since 2005, but We Found Problems with Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, the FSM established 20 indicators to track progress toward its  overarching goals in education: to improve the educational system of  the country, including primary, secondary, and postsecondary education,  and to develop the country\u2019s human and material resources necessary to  deliver these services. However, our review of a subset of 9 of the 20  FSM education indicators found problems with data reliability. Table 1  provides a summary of the data reliability determinations we made in  reviewing the subset of 9 education indicators. (For a complete list of the  indicators the FSM has tracked and reported since fiscal year 2005, see  app. VI.)", "We determined that the data for number of schools by grade level were  sufficiently reliable to report on progress in the FSM education sector.  The number of schools by grade level, by itself, does not necessarily  demonstrate progress or lack thereof; however, it does provide useful  information about the changes in the states\u2019 education systems. Both  Chuuk and Pohnpei, for example, have gone through a process resulting  in school closures, with or without consolidation of some schools, and the  numbers of schools by grade level reflect this. In Chuuk, the number of  schools declined from a total of 154 primary and secondary schools in  2007 to 85 schools in 2012, a 45 percent reduction. In Pohnpei, the  number of schools declined from a total of 41 primary and secondary  schools in 2007 to 34 schools in 2011, a 17 percent reduction.", "We determined that 8 of the subset of 9 FSM education indicators we  reviewed could not be used to assess progress over time because of data  reliability issues summarized above in table 1. For example, we found  that the four FSM states did not use common definitions for some  indicators; consequently, the education indicator reports we reviewed do  not contain consistent data for these indicators and comparisons cannot  be made across states. As an example, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and the FSM  National Government each applied its own definition of dropout, creating  inconsistencies in the data for that indicator. Student enrollment data  provide another example: Chuuk and Kosrae included both public and  private schools in reporting student enrollment data, while Pohnpei and  Yap included only public schools. In addition to data reporting  inconsistencies, we found that data in FSM\u2019s education indicators reports  sometimes were not complete. For example, in 2011, average daily  student attendance data for Chuuk were missing; for that same year,  Chuuk also lacked completion and graduation rate data for 8th and 12th  graders.", "During January 2013 site visits in Chuuk, we visited 13 school sites  selected on the basis of available time and travel constraints. This  included 6 of 8 schools on the island of Weno and 7 schools on four  lagoon islands. In several cases, these were school sites we visited in  2006. In facilities we were able to visit both in 2006 and 2013, we noted  general improvements in the overall maintenance and condition; however,  staff we interviewed reported that a lack of chairs, desks, and textbooks  was a concern, especially in lagoon-island schools. In addition, we visited  the Chuuk Department of Education warehouse where we found  hundreds of cases of books and supplies that had not been shipped to  schools in the outer islands as intended, according to the warehouse  manager. An OIA education grant manager reported that the department  had recently purchased and distributed 4,000 chairs and the distribution  process had gone smoothly. However, as of May 2013, Chuuk did not  have a fully implemented purchasing plan, inventory management  system, or monitoring plan for textbooks, as required by JEMCO,  according to an OIA official.", "In Pohnpei, we visited 8 schools (5 elementary and 3 high schools) of a  total of 34 public elementary and high schools on the main island of  Pohnpei, selected on the basis of available time and travel constraints.  The school buildings we visited were generally clean. From what we were  able to observe, they had electricity, functioning fans in the classrooms,  and functioning windows. We observed desks, chairs, and textbooks in  the classrooms. The newly built schools that we visited, which were  funded through public sector infrastructure grants, had water tanks and  new bathrooms with sinks and toilets that appeared to be operational.

However, our review of  a subset of 5 of the 14 FSM health indicators found problems with data  reliability.

For example, FSM data on immunization cannot be  used due to issues with data in Chuuk. According to the FSM  immunization expert, the data for that indicator were unreliable prior to  2011 because in Chuuk there was no registry of immunization to allow the  computation of a coverage rate. In reviewing the Chuuk medical records,  the immunization expert found that (1) an individual child might have  three different immunization records in the system under three variations  of his or her name, and (2) there was not appropriate consideration as to  when a vaccination was medically valid and therefore should be counted.  For an immunization to be medically valid, for example, a series may  need to be given within certain time frames. The records that the expert  examined showed vaccinations being given too early in the sequence,  resulting in an incorrect dosage and invalidating the vaccination. Finally,  the expert noted that immunization program documentation was bad. We  also identified problems when reviewing how the FSM calculates the  percentage of days when all essential drugs are in stock. Specifically, we  identified problems with the source documents used in the calculations in  Chuuk and Pohnpei, calling into question the reliability of the data  presented in the health indicators report. The key documents from each  health care facility that are used to calculate the indicator are the  formulary (the list of the essential drugs) and each facility\u2019s inventory  report. We attempted to verify the accuracy of the Chuuk hospital drug  inventory report and found that the report contained some incorrect  information. For example, the report listed 219 bottles of Amoxicillin 125  MG/5ML Suspension 150 ML, but the hospital\u2019s storage room had none.  Since the inventory report is used in calculating the number reported for  the essential drugs indicator, incorrect information found in the report  raises questions about the validity and reliability of the information for this  indicator in the health indicators report.", "In January 2013, we visited Chuuk\u2019s only hospital, which we had  previously visited in 2006.

Moreover, officials told us  that it now has reliable and consistent electric power, which was not the  case in the past. Additionally, whereas previously Chuuk\u2019s hospital had  only a small incinerator to burn medical waste, we observed two  functioning medical waste incinerators, which we were told operate on a  routine basis. In 2006, some of the selected medical equipment that we  observed was not working.

In July 2012, the RMI  contacted OIA and requested an extension to file its 2011 single audit  by September 30, 2012. OIA granted the extension, stating no  adverse action would be taken if the single audit was completed and  received by OIA by September 30, 2012. However, RMI submitted its  fiscal year 2011 report in February 2013, 8 months late. According  to the RMI Ministry of Finance, the 2011 single audit report was late  because of staff turnover, computer system issues, and late  reconciliation of general ledger and bank accounts.

At the JEMFAC midyear meeting  held on March14, 2013, discussion included the issue of the RMI\u2019s  inability to comply with requirements regarding allowable costs, cash  management, equipment, and real property management, among  other issues, as well as the related unresolved questioned costs  reported in the 2011 single audit, which totaled over $5 million. The  RMI Secretary of Finance told OIA officials that the RMI had recently  taken positive steps to resolve outstanding questioned costs and to  strengthen the ministry\u2019s internal controls; nevertheless, OIA  recommended that JEMFAC refrain from allocating unexpended grant  funds from fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2012 until the RMI  demonstrated that it had resolved all current questioned costs.

The same  single audit also reported that the FSM National Government  submitted financial reports for Transportation\u2019s Airport Improvement  Project grant that did not agree with underlying financial records.

Education officials noted that the department looks to see if there are  systemic problems when designating a grant recipient as high risk but  they have not formally assessed this status for the FSM or RMI. HHS  officials believe the department\u2019s noncompact funds are at risk, but  HHS has not conducted a systematic review of FSM and RMI audit  results or considered whether the grantees should be considered high  risk.

In 2010, OIA  created a plan that provided detailed staffing projections across OIA for  fiscal years 2010 through 2014. To ensure effective oversight for the  amended compacts, OIA projected a need for 8 staff in the Honolulu field  office, 2 field staff in the FSM, and 1 field staff in the RMI for fiscal years  2011 through 2013, a total of 11 staff.

In March 2013, OIA filled 1 of the 2 projected FSM  field staff positions.", "The OIA 2010 workforce plan projected the need for 50 staff for all of its  divisions in fiscal years 2010 through 2014; it projected that existing  resources would allow OIA to fund a total of 43 staff during this period.  However, actual staffing levels were less than 43 in 2011 and 2012.  Though compact oversight staff would represent 22 percent of total  projected staff in the plan, compact oversight staff represented 12 percent  and 14 percent, respectively, of actual OIA total staff in fiscal years 2011  and 2012. As a result, OIA\u2019s staffing shortage disproportionately affected  compact grant oversight compared to other OIA activities. See table 5.", "According to OIA officials, the following three factors contributed to the  staffing shortages affecting compact oversight in fiscal years 2011 and  2012.", "Budget constraints and uncertainties: OIA officials said budget  constraints and uncertainties prevented the office from hiring staff and  filling vacant positions as outlined in the workforce plan. OIA noted  that the plan assumed sufficient budgetary resources, and with  enacted budgets in fiscal years 2010 through 2013, OIA could not hire  additional staff. OIA officials also cited budget uncertainties for fiscal  years 2012 and 2013 as a factor that kept them from filling the second  education grants specialist position.", "OIA priorities: OIA management did not fill compact-related vacancies  because of other priorities, such as filling headquarters-based  positions before filling field positions. For example, an OIA official said  that OIA management held back some available funding in hopes of  staffing a Guam field office.", "Lack of qualified candidates: OIA officials also noted that in 2011 OIA  posted the vacancy for the second education grants specialist position  in Honolulu but did not receive sufficiently qualified candidates, which  prevented the office from hiring.", "Staffing shortages, particularly those in the Honolulu field office, have  negatively affected OIA\u2019s compact oversight in the FSM and the RMI.  While oversight activities, site visits, and required meetings occurred, OIA  noted the following oversight gaps:  In a 2010 report, Interior\u2019s Office of the Inspector General reported  that OIA\u2019s compact oversight was hindered by the lack of an FSM field  representative to support oversight efforts, despite the fact that the  FSM received about $100 million in grant funds, more than any other  insular area. Additionally, the report questioned whether OIA was  effectively utilizing existing staff in the Honolulu field office.", "One OIA official said that the Honolulu field office\u2019s staffing shortage  hinder OIA\u2019s ability to scrutinize financial reports and provide  feedback to both countries. This official also stated that without a  second person working on education sector compact assistance, OIA  cannot thoroughly analyze education budgets, which results in high- level recommendations to the JEMCO and JEMFAC rather than  specific recommendations that address issues such as the potential  misuse of funds. Noting that the RMI experienced an increase in  unquestioned costs over a period of 3 years, the OIA official stated  that if the Honolulu office had a second education grants specialist,  OIA could identify these issues earlier and support the OIA audit  liaison in following up on issues identified in the single audits."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At the midpoint of the 20-year amended compact assistance term, the  FSM and RMI face critical challenges in compact implementation. During  the first 10 years, the FSM and the RMI spent most of their funds for  education and health, sectors prioritized in the compact agreements.  However, because of data reliability issues, neither country can  demonstrate whether it has made progress toward its goals in these  sectors. Now, with 10 years of amended compact sector funding left, both  countries must quickly plan for reduced grant resources and resolve the  accountability issues that have plagued them to date so that they can fully  utilize the funds and time left to achieve their goals.", "Both countries must complete plans that address annual decrements in  compact funding and determine new revenue sources that will replace  compact grant assistance in 2023. Despite multiple JEMCO and JEMFAC  resolutions calling for the countries to produce these plans, the FSM  National Government has yet to develop a plan that shows how it will  address budgetary and economic challenges through 2023 and support  the states in adjusting to the annual decrements, while the RMI  government has yet to develop a plan that demonstrates how it will adjust  to the annual decrements. In the absence of these plans, JEMCO and  JEMFAC will face challenges ensuring that annual grant assistance for  both countries is allocated in a sustainable manner.", "Ongoing problems with data reliability exist for both countries. Without  reliable data, the countries cannot assess progress toward their goals in  the education and health sectors and cannot effectively use results data  for setting priorities and allocating resources aimed at improving  performance. The lack of reliable data also hampers the ability of JEMCO  and JEMFAC to oversee compact expenditures and assess the countries\u2019  progress toward all its goals in the education and health sectors.", "The FSM\u2019s and RMI\u2019s single audits continue to identify long-standing and  recurring findings, which if addressed could allow both countries to more  effectively use U.S. resources and diminish potential losses that arise  from fraud, waste, and abuse. Given these recurring audit findings, both  compact and noncompact U.S. funds are at risk. Interventions by JEMCO  were effective in Chuuk in bringing improved financial accountability;  however, similar JEMCO and JEMFAC interventions have not been  undertaken for the FSM National Government or the RMI. Furthermore,  U.S. grants provided separately from the amended compact by multiple  agencies are at risk. Although OIA has a lead role regarding audit  matters, it has not formally coordinated with other U.S. agencies to  address audit findings, nor has it assessed whether its own noncompact  grants should be classified as high risk. Moreover, other federal agencies  whose grants may be at risk have not routinely considered designating  either country as a high-risk grantee. Such consideration could enable  U.S. agencies to enforce conditions and restrictions on noncompact grant  funds they provide, thus improving the oversight and management of the  funds.", "Finally, although the majority of grants administered by OIA are amended  compact grants, OIA\u2019s amended compact oversight function was  disproportionally affected by staffing shortages. While budget constraints  prevented OIA from hiring the total number of staff it needed to conduct  oversight for all of its grants, decisions to staff other OIA divisions rather  than hire compact oversight staff affected OIA\u2019s ability to ensure compact  funds were efficiently and effectively used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Interior take the following five  actions:  In order to improve the ability of the U.S. agencies participating in the  JEMCO and JEMFAC committees to conduct required oversight of  compact funds, direct the Director of Insular Affairs, as Chairman of JEMCO, to  coordinate with other JEMCO-member U.S. agencies to have JEMCO  take all necessary steps, or, as the administrator of compact grants, to  directly take all necessary steps, to ensure that the FSM (1)  completes satisfactory plans to address annual decrements in  compact funds, (2) produces reliable indicator data used to track  progress in education and health, and (3) addresses all single audit  findings in a timely manner; and direct the Director of Insular Affairs, as Chairman of the JEMFAC, to  coordinate with other JEMFAC-member U.S. agencies to have  JEMFAC take all necessary steps, or, as the administrator of compact  grants, to directly take all necessary steps, to ensure that the RMI (1)  completes satisfactory plans to address annual decrements in  compact funds, (2) produces reliable indicator data used to track  progress in education and health, and (3) addresses all single audit  findings in a timely manner.", "In order to improve financial accountability of noncompact U.S. grant  assistance provided to the FSM and the RMI,  consult with other grantor agencies to determine whether the FSM  National Government or any FSM states meet the criteria to be  designated as a high-risk grant recipient for noncompact funds, or  whether other steps should be taken to improve accountability; and  consult with other grantor agencies to determine whether the RMI  meets the criteria to be designated as a high-risk grant recipient for  noncompact funds, or whether other steps should be taken to improve  accountability.", "In order to ensure that Interior is providing appropriate resources for  oversight and monitoring of the FSM and RMI compacts,  take actions to correct the disproportionate staffing shortage related to  compact grant implementation and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to Interior, Education,  HHS, and State and also to the FSM National Government and the  government of the RMI.

Education and HHS had no comments on  the draft report. In an e-mail received August 13, 2013, from State\u2019s GAO  Liaison, State indicated that our report will inform its continuing work,  mainly through its involvement in the JEMCO and JEMFAC. For example,  State noted, the U.S. members of the JEMCO are currently taking steps  to address decrement planning and improve the production of reliable  indicator data in the compact priority sectors of health and education in  the FSM. Similarly, the U.S. members of the JEMFAC continue to work  with the RMI on its decrement plan.", "Interior generally concurred with all five of our recommendations and  briefly discussed each. With regard to our recommendations for actions  involving JEMCO and JEMFAC, Interior noted examples of how it and  other U.S. members of JEMCO and JEMFAC have worked to make  improvements in the three areas mentioned in the recommendations:  decrement plans, reliable indicator data to track progress in education  and health, and addressing single audit findings. Interior also discussed  our recommendations to determine, in consultation with grantor agencies,  whether steps should be taken to improve accountability of noncompact  funds to the FSM and RMI, including application of the high-risk  designation for grant recipients. Interior noted that it cannot direct other  agencies to take action with regard to any grant-specific issues and  stated it was unaware of any precedent for federal agencies to jointly  designate a grantee as high risk; however, Interior said it would discuss  this approach with other federal agencies.", "Although Interior also concurred with our final recommendation, to take  actions to correct the disproportionate staffing shortage related to  compact grant implementation and oversight, Interior\u2019s response indicates  that it considers corrective action to be contingent on its receiving funding  for new positions through the annual budget process. However, the intent  of our recommendation is to have Interior work with its actual funding  levels, whatever they may be, to correct what we observed to be a  misalignment in how it allocates its staff. We found that compact grants  account for the majority of grant funds that OIA administers and that  OIA\u2019s staffing shortage has disproportionately affected compact grant  oversight compared with other OIA activities. We believe it is feasible for  OIA to address this imbalance regardless of whether it receives funding  for new positions. Appendix IX presents a copy of the letter from Interior.  Interior also provided technical comments that we incorporated in the  report where appropriate.", "In its written comments on our draft report, the FSM National Government  focused on three areas of our reporting: (1) decrement planning, (2) data  reliability issues for education and health indicators, and (3) financial  accountability over compact and U.S. federal program funds. The FSM  agreed on the importance of these three issues to the successful  implementation of the amended compact. The FSM identified activities  under way to plan for the decrement, such as the 2023 Planning  Committee\u2019s efforts to identify ways to intensify private sector growth.  Regarding data reliability, the FSM cited implementation of a contract to  assess the national education system\u2019s ability to produce valid and  reliable data and efforts under way to review the quality of health  indicators with government staff. The FSM remarked on what it  characterized as the heavy emphasis in our report of the possibility of  achieving increased accountability over noncompact grant funds through  a \u201chigh-risk\u201d designation, but noted that it was assured because the  process involved in a \u201chigh-risk\u201d designation is not an arbitrary one.

Appendix X  presents a copy of the letter from the FSM National Government.", "The government of the RMI also provided written comments on our draft  report. The RMI believes it submitted adequate plans regarding the  medium-term budget and investment framework and the decrement, while  at the same time noting the usefulness of the decrement plan as a policy  guide and planning tool, rather than as a mechanism for making line-item  budgetary decisions. Regarding data reliability, the RMI generally agreed  with our findings of data reliability problems in both the education and  health sectors. The RMI agreed that there were limitations to their  education data for certain indicators, and reported that they faced  challenges in data collection due to the number of schools that were  spread out over a large ocean area, and the deficient state of their  transportation and communication systems. In the health sector, the RMI  pointed out that it has 52 health centers spread throughout 29 atolls,  making it difficult to collect data in a timely manner, and that it also lacks  personnel dedicated solely to collecting and entering health indicator  data. The RMI, however, noted that its Ministry of Health is seeking  external assistance to improve health data. In response to our  recommendation that\u2014in order to improve financial accountability of  noncompact U.S. grant assistance provided to the RMI\u2014the Secretary of  the Interior should consult with other agencies to determine whether the  RMI meets the criteria to be designated as a high-risk grant recipient for  noncompact funds, or whether other steps should be taken to improve  accountability, the RMI noted that internal controls are now in place to  detect and deter fraud, waste, and noncompliance with the fiscal  procedures agreement or other U.S. federal regulations. For that reason,  the RMI Ministry of Finance does not believe that any special conditions  or restrictions for unsatisfactory performance or failure to comply with  grant terms are warranted.

In addition we provide information on  the FSM and the RMI infrastructure sector grants.", "To determine how the FSM and RMI used amended compact funds in the  education and health sectors, we analyzed the single audits for the FSM  National Government and the state governments of Chuuk and Pohnpei  and for the RMI government for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. The  single audits provide information on total education and health sector  compact fund expenditures as well as total supplemental education grant  expenditures in both countries and Ebeye special needs expenditures in  the RMI. The single audits also provide details on specific expenditures  within each of these sectors, such as personnel costs and medical  supplies. However, data on specific expenditures for fiscal year 2007 and  fiscal year 2008 were not available for the FSM National Government or  the state of Chuuk; hence, we reported on specific sector expenditures for  the FSM National Government, Chuuk, and Pohnpei for fiscal years 2009  through 2011 only. We were able, however, to provide specific  expenditure data for the RMI for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. We  report on the specific expenditures that constitute at least the top 80  percent of expenditures in the education and health sectors, as well as for  supplemental education grant expenditures for both countries. Any  remaining expenditure categories are aggregated under an \u201cOther  expenditures\u201d category. Within the single audits, we also analyzed the  total expenditures within the education and health sectors for the FSM  National Government, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and the RMI government to  determine the portion of sector expenditures supported by compact and  noncompact U.S. funds. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our report.", "To evaluate the extent to which the FSM and RMI made progress toward  achieving their stated goals in the education and health sectors from  fiscal years 2007 through 2011, we identified the indicators the FSM and  RMI developed to track progress in those sectors. In assessing FSM  progress, we used data from Chuuk and Pohnpei since these two states  represent 82 percent of the FSM population. As each country had  numerous indicators, we selected a subset of the health and education  indicators in both countries to review. We used the U.S. 5-year reviews of  the FSM and RMI; Joint Economic Management Committee (JEMCO)  and Joint Economic Management and Financial Accountability Committee  (JEMFAC) health and education related resolutions from 2007 through  2012; and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) performance  measures as criteria to determine the subset of measures. We selected  these criteria for the following reasons: the U.S. 5-year reviews and the  JEMCO and JEMFAC resolutions identified indicators that reflected  country-specific concerns, while the MDG reflected global standards  because they were developed by international health and education  experts and agreed upon by almost all developing countries. An indicator  was selected to be part of the subset if it was included in two of the three  sources listed above for the FSM, and listed in all three sources for the  RMI. We also consulted with officials at the U.S. Departments of  Education (Education) and Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding  our proposed methodology. We then reviewed FSM and RMI annual  reports tracking these indicators for 2007 through 2011. To determine  whether the data presented in the annual health and education indicator  reports were sufficiently reliable to measure progress in the compacts as  a whole, and in selected states, we reviewed the reports themselves,  reviewed JEMCO and JEMFAC resolutions related to health and  education data, and interviewed FSM and RMI officials responsible for  collecting and providing the data during our site visits in January 2013. In  the FSM and RMI, we also attempted to replicate the reported data in  some of the education and health reports. Additionally, we sent each  country a series of specific follow-up questions related to the subset of  indicators to learn more about each country\u2019s data collection and  verification activities, as well as to try to clarify discrepancies in the data  we identified. In some instances, the responses we obtained did not  provide sufficient information for us to determine that the data were  reliable; in those instances we classified the indicators as \u201cno basis to  judge.\u201d We reported on the reliability of these indicators in the report.", "To identify the extent to which the FSM and RMI governments conducted  monitoring and oversight activities, we reviewed the amended compacts  and fiscal procedures agreements to identify specific monitoring  responsibilities. We also reviewed the U.S. briefing documents, as well as  the minutes and resolutions, when available, related to the JEMCO and  JEMFAC meetings. We further reviewed FSM and RMI documents\u2014such  as portfolios, quarterly performance reports, and annual reports, for fiscal  years 2007-2011 as available\u2014submitted by the FSM and RMI  governments to the U.S. government to confirm compliance with  accountability reporting requirements. We discussed the lack of required  annual reporting with Department of the Interior (Interior) Office of Insular  Affairs (OIA) officials. We obtained the single audit reports for the years  2006 through 2011 from the FSM Office of the National Auditor\u2019s website  and the RMI\u2019s Office of the Auditor General. These reports included  audits for the FSM National Government and the state governments of  Chuuk and Pohnpei, and for the RMI government. In total, 24 single audit  reports covered 6 years, a period that we considered sufficient for  identifying common or persistent compliance and financial management  problems involving U.S. funds (amended compact and other noncompact  funds). We determined the timeliness of submission of the single audit  reports by the insular area governments using the Federal Audit  Clearinghouse\u2019s (FAC) \u201cForm Date,\u201d which is the most recent date that  the required SF-SAC data collection form was received by the FAC. We  did note that the \u201cForm Date\u201d is updated if a revised SF-SAC for that  same fiscal year is subsequently filed. Our review of the contents of the  single audit reports identified the auditors\u2019 opinions on the financial  statements, matters cited by the auditors in their qualified opinions, the  numbers of material weaknesses and reportable conditions reported by  the auditors, and the status of corrective actions. We did not  independently assess the quality of the audits or the reliability of the audit  finding information. We analyzed the audit findings to determine if they  had recurred in successive single audits and were still occurring in their  most recent audit and categorized the auditor\u2019s opinions on the financial  statements and the Schedules of Expenditures of Federal Awards.", "To determine oversight activities conducted by the OIA Honolulu office,  we reviewed senior management statements regarding the purpose and  function of this office and job descriptions for OIA staff. To identify the  staffing levels for the Honolulu office we reviewed Interior\u2019s 2010  workforce plan and obtained current staffing levels from OIA, as well as  reviewed Interior congressional budget submissions for 2013 and 2014  for actual staffing levels in 2011 and 2012.

The single audits provide information on  total infrastructure sector compact fund expenditures and provide details  on specific expenditures within the infrastructure sector, such as  contractual services. However, data on specific expenditures for fiscal  year 2007 and fiscal year 2008 were not available for the FSM National  Government or the state of Chuuk; hence, we reported on specific sector  expenditures for the FSM National Government, Chuuk, and Pohnpei for  fiscal years 2009 through 2011 only. We were able, however, to provide  specific expenditure data for the RMI for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.

Any remaining  expenditure categories are aggregated under an \u201cOther expenditures\u201d  category. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. We also reviewed the infrastructure development  and infrastructure maintenance plans for the FSM and RMI, interviewed  officials in the FSM and RMI project management units, and reviewed  progress reports submitted by the FSM and RMI. We reviewed JEMCO  and JEMFAC minutes and resolutions related to the infrastructure sector  and discussed the status of the infrastructure development plans and  projects with OIA\u2019s infrastructure grant manager.

In both countries we visited selected primary and  secondary schools, hospitals, and dispensaries. Our site selections were  judgmental because of the number of facilities on the islands, logistics,  and the time at our disposal. The facilities we visited exhibited a mix of  factors, such as facility type (elementary and secondary schools), age  (older and newer facilities), renovation status (those which had been  renovated and those that had not), and logistical needs. Where possible,  we selected facilities that we had visited in 2006 in order to draw  comparisons, to the degree possible. During our site visits we made  observations and performed spot checks. We used our 2006 report to  help select aspects to observe\u2014such as cleanliness, electrical power,  and desks\u2014and drug expiry dates to spot-check. These site visits were  not designed to yield generalizable conclusions but rather to illustrate  relevant conditions in the education and health sectors, including whether  there was functioning equipment, in both countries. We discussed  compact implementation with FSM (national, Chuuk, and Pohnpei  governments, as applicable) and RMI officials from the attorney general,  education, finance, foreign affairs, health, auditor general, public works,  and public service commission offices.
