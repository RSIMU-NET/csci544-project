Section 2667 of Title 10, U.S. Code, provides authority to the military departments to lease nonexcess real property, subject to several provisions, in exchange for cash or in-kind consideration. According to the military services, some leases, referred to as enhanced use leases (EUL), are more complex with long terms and could provide hundreds of millions of dollars for in-kind services to improve installation facilities. A committee report accompanying the 2011 defense authorization directed GAO to review the EUL program. This report (1) assesses the extent to which selected EULs complied with section 2667 of Title 10, U.S. Code; (2) determines to what extent the services' expectations for their EULs have been realized; and (3) evaluates the services' management of the EUL program. GAO reviewed information on the services' 17 EULs in place at the end of fiscal year 2010 and selected 9 for detailed case study."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["One of the Army EULs included in the GAO case studies did not comply with the EUL authorizing statute, section 2667 of Title 10, U.S. Code. In March 2011, GAO issued a legal opinion finding that certain terms and conditions of the legal documents comprising the Army's Picatinny Arsenal EUL violated section 2667(e) and the miscellaneous receipts statute by failing to require that cash consideration be deposited into the appropriate account of the U.S. Treasury. Instead, the cash was deposited into an escrow account at a local credit union. Also, while no two EULs are identical, GAO found that the two other Army and the three Air Force case study EULs included some terms and conditions similar to those that were found to be problematic by the legal opinion, which raised questions about the extent to which such EULs also comply with the statutory requirements. Moreover, beyond those issues addressed in the legal opinion, GAO found that three Army and one Air Force case study EULs did not comply with another provision in section 2667, which requires that each lease executed pursuant to section 2667 provide that if and to the extent that the leased property is later made taxable by state or local governments under an act of Congress, the lease shall be renegotiated. The services' expectations for EUL development timeframes and financial benefits were not realized in two Army and one Air Force EULs included in the GAO case studies largely because, according to the services, the recent economic downturn caused EUL development plans to significantly slow down or to be placed on hold. To illustrate, in the Fort Sam Houston EUL that was signed in 2001, only two of the three large deteriorated buildings included in the lease have been renovated, and the Army now estimates that EUL consideration will be about 22 percent less than was originally estimated. Moreover, in this case, the Army, rather than private sector tenants as was originally planned, has rented most of the EUL space that has been renovated. Thus, Army officials stated that nearly all of the estimated future consideration is now expected to be the result of the Army getting back a portion of the rent that the Army pays to the EUL developer. The services' management of the EUL program included weaknesses related to internal controls and program guidance. First, because the services generally lacked documentation showing how certain provisions contained in the authorizing statute were addressed, it was not clear to what extent the services addressed each provision before entering into the leases. Second, in some EUL cases, it was not clear how and to what extent the services ensured the receipt of the fair market value of the lease interest, as required by the authorizing statute. Third, some EULs included property that was being used or might be needed by the military over the lease term, which could result in increased costs to relocate military activities or increased potential costs, if a lease had to be terminated early to permit the military to regain control of the property. Fourth, the services were not regularly monitoring EUL program administration costs, as called for by internal control standards, to help ensure that costs were in line with program benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD take several actions to address EUL statutory compliance issues and EUL management weaknesses.

To  address these challenges, DOD has pursued a multipart strategy involving  base realignment and closure (BRAC), housing privatization, and  demolition of facilities that are no longer needed. In addition, DOD has  also pursued a strategy of leasing underused real property to gain  additional resources for the maintenance and repair of existing facilities or  the construction of new facilities. For example, subject to provisions  contained in section 2667 of Title 10, U.S. Code, the secretaries of the  military departments have the authority to lease nonexcess real property  under the control of the respective departments in exchange for cash or  in-kind consideration that is not less than the fair market value (FMV) of  the lease interest. Among other things, in-kind consideration accepted  with respect to a lease under this section can include the maintenance of  existing facilities or the construction of new facilities.", "The military services have long used the authority under section 2667 to  enter into short-term leases of military property for such uses as farming,  grazing, and cellular towers, and in turn received cash consideration. The  services have also used the authority contained in the statute to enter into  more complex leases that the services refer to as enhanced use leases  (EUL). EULs generally provide for in-kind consideration, and some EULs  involve complex agreements and long terms. For example, an EUL might  provide for a 50-year lease of military land to a private developer that  would be expected to construct office or other commercial buildings on  the land and then rent the facilities to private sector tenants for profit. As  consideration, the military might receive cash or in-kind services valued at  an amount equal to a share of the net rental revenues from the developed  property.", "According to the military services, EULs offer significant opportunities to  reduce infrastructure costs. Over the terms of some EULs, the services  have estimated that they would receive in-kind consideration valued at  hundreds of millions of dollars that would be used to improve installation  facilities. As of the end of fiscal year 2010, the services reported that 17  EULs were in place\u2014the Army reported 7, the Navy reported 5, and the  Air Force reported 5.

In response, this report (1) assesses the extent to which  selected EULs complied with section 2667, (2) determines to what extent  the services\u2019 expectations for their EULs have been realized, and (3)  evaluates the services\u2019 management of the EUL program.", "To address these areas, we reviewed statutory requirements; examined  military service policies, instructions, and other guidance related to  ensuring statutory compliance; and interviewed officials from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to discuss  efforts to ensure compliance. While we reviewed information on all 17  EULs in place at the end of fiscal year 2010, to specifically assess EUL  compliance with statutory requirements, we selected 9 of the 17 EULs for  detailed case study review. The EULs were selected nonrandomly to  include 3 from each service and a range of lease purposes, estimated  financial benefits, and geographic locations. In each case study, we  obtained, reviewed, and compared the lease agreements and related  documentation with statutory requirements in place at the time the  respective agreements were signed, as well as applicable case law, to  assess compliance. To determine the realization of service EUL  expectations, we summarized EUL program status information obtained  from the services, including data on each EUL\u2019s estimated and actual  development time frames and financial benefits received through  September 30, 2010. For the nine EUL case studies, we obtained and  reviewed more detailed information on how the services initially estimated  expected EUL financial benefits and how the expected benefits compared  with actual benefits obtained to date and, in cases where expected  benefits were not realized, explored the reasons why. Further, we  reviewed the services\u2019 policies, guidance, and practices for managing the  EUL program and, for the nine case studies, examined how the services  documented fulfillment of certain section 2667 provisions, provided for  the receipt of the FMV of the leased property, and considered whether  leased property might be needed for military purposes over the lease term.  Finally, we compared the services\u2019 EUL program administration costs with  EUL consideration received through September 30, 2010, and reviewed  how the services monitored program administration costs in relation to  program benefits.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In  addition, each lease may not be for more than 5 years, unless the secretary  concerned determines that a lease for a longer period will promote the  national defense or be in the public interest; shall permit the secretary to  revoke the lease at any time, unless the secretary determines that the  omission of such a provision will promote the national defense or be in the  public interest; shall provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the  lessee of consideration in an amount that is not less than the FMV of the  lease interest, as determined by the secretary; and shall provide that if  and to the extent that the leased property is later made taxable by state or  local governments under an act of Congress, the lease shall be  renegotiated.", "Concerning lease consideration, section 2667 provides that if the  consideration is to be cash, then the cash payments must be deposited into  a special account in the U.S. Treasury and may only be used in such  amounts as provided in appropriations acts. Also, once these amounts  are appropriated, section 2667 provides that the installation where the  leased property is located receive at least 50 percent of that consideration  and that the appropriated cash may be used for specific enumerated  purposes relating to real property construction, maintenance services,  lease of facilities, or payment of utility services. In the event that  consideration for the lease is to be in kind, then section 2667 provides a  nonexhaustive set of examples of acceptable forms of in-kind  consideration that includes the maintenance, protection, alteration, repair,  improvement, or restoration of property or facilities; the construction of  new facilities; and the provision of facilities, utility services, or real  property maintenance services.", "The military services have long used the authority under section 2667 to  enter into short-term leases of military property for such uses as farming,  grazing, and cellular towers, and in turn received cash consideration.  According to the services, they had about 3,000 such leases, which  generated about $20.8 million in cash consideration in fiscal year 2010. The  services have also used the authority contained in section 2667 to enter  into more complex leases that the services refer to as EULs. Although the  authorizing statute, section 2667, does not use \u201cenhanced use lease\u201d to  differentiate leases executed pursuant to this authority, the services  generally distinguish an EUL from a normal outlease on the basis of scope,  process, term, and consideration. For example, according to the services,  EULs generally involve larger amounts of property, generally undergo a  more detailed evaluation and review before approval and greater oversight  after approval, often are executed for longer periods of time (such as 25 to  50 years), and generally focus on in-kind, rather than cash, consideration.

Many of the Army\u2019s  EULs were long-term leases that called for the development of leased land,  which would be rented to private sector entities for profit. Army officials  stated that many of the leases provided for the Army to receive a share of  the net rental income as compensation in the form of in-kind services for  the maintenance or improvement of installation facilities. The three Army  EULs in our case studies, which were composed of several different leases  and other legal documents, follow:    Fort Sam Houston EUL. In June 2001, the Army entered into three 50- year lease agreements at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. According to the  Army, the overall purpose of the EUL was to lease three large,  deteriorated, vacant buildings situated on the installation to a private  developer who would renovate the buildings as office space and then  sublease the space to private sector tenants for profit. As consideration,  the Army was to receive a share of the development\u2019s net rental income.  Such revenue was to be deposited into an escrow account in order to fund  future work projects on installation facilities. Army officials stated that  the EUL also benefited the Army by eliminating Army costs associated  with maintaining the old buildings.", "Picatinny Arsenal EUL. In September 2006, the Army entered into a master  agreement with a private developer at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. The  master agreement does not lease any property but instead is an  agreement to later enter into separate leases with the lessee to  incrementally develop 13 different parcels of property, which consists of  100,000 square feet of existing facility space in four buildings and about  120 acres of land. The master agreement makes the majority of the  parcels available for lease at the lessee\u2019s sole discretion, in any order and  at any time of the lessee\u2019s choosing. The Army\u2019s expectation was that the  developer would renovate or replace the existing buildings and build and  rent laboratory, administrative, educational, and light manufacturing space  as part of a research campus on up to 120 acres, which would in turn be  leased to private sector tenants for profit. As consideration, the Army  would receive certain up-front payments upon the execution of leases for  the various parcels, and would also receive a share of the net rental  income generated by the developed property. Both the up-front payments  and the revenue share were to be deposited into an escrow account, from  which funds could be disbursed as cash or to pay for in-kind projects at  the installation.

In turn, the lessee was expected to construct  buildings for an office and technology park. As consideration, the EUL  called for the lessee to pay the Army rent on completed buildings and the  rent would be deposited into an escrow account, from which funds would  be disbursed as cash or to pay for in-kind projects at the installation. At  the time of our review, the Army had entered into eight separate site lease  agreements with 50-year terms.", "Table 1 also shows that the Navy reported 5 EULs in place and 10 EULs  under consideration at the end of fiscal year 2010. Most of the Navy\u2019s EULs  involved leases of Navy property that the lessee used without further  development, such as the leasing of Navy-owned land to a private  company for off-loading and storing automobiles. According to the Navy,  the leases typically provided for the Navy to receive rent as consideration  for the leased property in the form of in-kind services for the maintenance  or improvement of installation facilities. The Navy EULs in our case  studies did not provide for consideration to be deposited in an escrow  account, from which funds could be disbursed to pay for in-kind services.  Rather, upon satisfactory completion of in-kind services, the rental  payment value due would be credited by an amount equal to the cost of  the in-kind services. The three Navy EULs in our case studies follow:    Naval Base Point Loma EUL. In October 2005, the Navy entered into a 5- year lease agreement at Naval Base Point Loma, California. According to  the Navy, the overall purpose of the EUL was to lease about 432,000  square feet of industrial and storage space in a Navy-owned building to a  private sector company, which planned to use the property to assemble  rocket propulsion fuel tanks in fulfillment of military contracts. The EUL  required the lessee to pay rent to the Navy in five consecutive, annual  payments; but at the option and sole discretion of the Navy, the annual  rental payment could be offset by the costs of accomplishing in-kind  services. Upon satisfactory completion of in-kind services, the annual  rental payment due would be credited by an amount equal to the cost of  the services. Thus far, all of the consideration the Navy has received under  this EUL has been in the form of in-kind services, such as performing roof  repairs and modernizing restrooms at the leased building.", "Naval Base Ventura County EUL.

As consideration, the Navy would  receive annual rent; but at the sole option of the Navy, the annual rent  could be offset by the cost of accomplishing in-kind services. Thus far, all  of the consideration the Navy has received under this EUL has been in the  form of in-kind services, such as performing road and pavement repairs at  the installation.", "Naval Base San Diego EUL. In August 2008, the Navy entered into a 30- year lease agreement at Naval Base San Diego, California. According to the  Navy, the overall purpose of the EUL was to lease about 4.8 acres of Navy  land and one Navy-owned building situated on the land to a private sector  company, which planned to use the property to assist in the construction  of ships under a contract with the Navy. As consideration, the EUL  provided for rental payments, but in lieu of cash payments, the lessee  would provide in-kind consideration in the form of maintenance, repair,  improvement, and construction of new facilities. Specifically, the EUL  required the lessee to perform the in-kind services at its own expense, and  in exchange, the Navy would provide a rent credit for the actual cost  incurred against the annual rent. Thus far, all of the consideration the  Navy has received under this EUL has been in the form of in-kind services.", "Table 1 further shows that the Air Force reported 5 EULs in place and 13  EULs under consideration at the end of fiscal year 2010. Air Force  officials stated that Air Force EULs generally were long-term leases that  included various arrangements from relatively straightforward leases of  land in exchange for rent payments as consideration to one more complex  lease that called for the development of leased land, which would be  rented to private sector tenants with the Air Force receiving a  consideration payment when the EUL was signed and also receiving a  share of the development\u2019s net rental income as compensation. According  to Air Force officials, the Air Force EULs generally called for  consideration to be received in the form of in-kind services for the  maintenance or improvement of installation facilities. The three Air Force  EULs in our case studies follow:    Eglin Air Force Base. In October 2006, the Air Force entered into a 30-year  lease agreement at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. According to the Air  Force, the overall purpose of the EUL was to lease 255.5 acres of land to a  Florida county government, which planned to use the property to  construct a new wastewater treatment plant and disposal system.

In August 2008, the Air Force entered into a master  development agreement with a private developer at Hill Air Force Base,  Utah. The master development agreement does not lease any property.  Instead, the agreement explains that the EUL site consists of 499 acres  that will be outleased incrementally through individual site leases and sets  forth the general terms, conditions, and rights under which the Air Force  and the developer may later execute these site leases. The developer was  expected to construct commercial facilities for rent to private sector  tenants for profit. As consideration for the EUL, the Air Force received an  up-front payment from the developer when the master development  agreement was signed. The Air Force also expects to receive a share of  the development\u2019s net rental revenues from developed property, which is  to be placed in a special account outside the U.S. Treasury and used to  fund in-kind services at the installation. Additionally, grants from the  State of Utah were anticipated to be disbursed to the developer for  acceptable state purposes\u2014such highway improvements and  infrastructure development\u2014that may facilitate and benefit the Hill Air  Force Base EUL. At the same time that the Air Force entered into the  master development agreement, the Air Force also entered into a master  lease, which grants to the developer certain limited property rights for a  50-year term, including entry, planning and constructing certain utility  systems and infrastructure necessary to support development of the  anticipated site leases.

Further, the opinion found that the Picatinny Arsenal EUL  violated the Antideficiency Act by including a clause in the escrow  agreement whereby the government indemnified the escrow account agent  against all liabilities arising under the escrow agreement. A summary of  the legal opinion follows:    First, the opinion concluded that certain terms and conditions of the  Picatinny Arsenal EUL did not comply with section 2667. Section 2667  specifies that consideration for a lease executed under this authority must  come in one of two forms\u2014cash payments or in-kind consideration\u2014and  subsection 2667(e) requires that cash payments be deposited into a special  account in the U.S. Treasury and are available to the Secretary concerned  only to the extent provided in appropriations acts. However, the  applicable legal documents comprising the Picatinny Arsenal EUL  provided that rent consideration from the lessee be deposited into an  escrow account\u2014specifically, deposited into an individual interest-bearing  account at a local credit union. The legal documents further provide that  such escrowed funds may be disbursed either to a third-party contractor  as payment for services rendered or directly as a cash payment to the  Army. At the time of our visit to Picatinny Arsenal in July 2010, about   $1.5 million of escrowed funds had been disbursed to pay third-party  contractors for construction, repairs or similar work performed on  property under the control of the Secretary. The opinion found that the  terms and conditions of the legal documents comprising the Picatinny  Arsenal EUL indicated that the Army had control over the disposition of  the escrow funds which, except for the payment of expenses of the escrow  agent, are used solely for the benefit of the Army. Therefore, the opinion  concluded that the Picatinny Arsenal EUL violated section 2667 by  effectively receiving cash, not in-kind, consideration, and depositing such  proceeds into an escrow account instead of the special account in the U.S.  Treasury for such purposes as required by subsection 2667(e).", "Second, the opinion concluded that certain terms and conditions of the  Picatinny Arsenal EUL did not comply with the miscellaneous receipts  statute. The miscellaneous receipts statute provides that an official or  agent of the government receiving money for the government from any  source shall deposit the money in the U.S. Treasury as soon as practicable  without deduction for any charge or claim. However, as discussed above,  the applicable legal documents comprising the Picatinny Arsenal EUL  provided that rent consideration from the lessee be deposited into an  escrow account at a local credit union. The opinion found that the  escrowed funds constituted \u201cmoney for the government\u201d and that the  Army\u2019s failure to immediately deposit the consideration received for the  Picatinny Arsenal EUL into the appropriate account in the U.S. Treasury  was a violation of the miscellaneous receipts statute.", "Third, the opinion concluded that an indemnification provision in the  escrow agreement for the Picatinny Arsenal EUL, whereby the government  agreed to indemnify the escrow agent against all liabilities, violated the  Antideficiency Act. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from  spending, or committing themselves to spending, in advance of or in  excess of appropriations, unless specifically authorized by law. Once it  has been determined that there has been a violation of the Antideficiency  Act, the agency head must report immediately to the President and  Congress all relevant facts and provide a statement of actions taken, and  must also transmit a copy of each report to the Comptroller General. The  opinion concluded that the open-ended indemnification provision  constituted a violation of the Antideficiency Act. Further, the opinion  noted that although the Army subsequently cured the violation by  amending the escrow agreement to delete the indemnification provision,  a report of the violation is still required.", "The legal opinion recommended three actions. First, with respect to the  section 2667 and miscellaneous receipts violation, the opinion  recommended that the Army transfer the balance of the escrow funds to  the appropriate account in the Treasury, and with respect to the escrow  funds that have been expended to date, the Army adjust its accounts by  transferring funds from an Army account available to pay for services to  property under the control of the Secretary to the appropriate account in  the Treasury. Further, the opinion noted that if the Army finds it lacks  sufficient budget authority to adjust its accounts, it should report a  violation of the Antideficiency Act. Second, with respect to the  indemnification provision in the original escrow agreement, the opinion  encouraged the Army to make the necessary report as soon as possible.

Thus, projected rental  revenues and the services\u2019 expected share of these revenues did not  materialize."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army and Air Force Expectations for EUL Development Time Frames and Financial Benefits Were Not Realized in Some Cases", "paragraphs": ["We found that expected development time frames and financial benefits  were not realized in two of the Army and one of the Air Force EULs we  reviewed. For example, when the first site leases for the Fort Sam Houston  EUL were signed in 2001, the Army expected that the developer would  renovate the three large, deteriorated buildings included in the lease for  use as office space and then sublease the space to private sector tenants  for profit. Initially, the Army expected that it would receive about   $253 million in in-kind consideration over the 50-year lease term from its  share of the project\u2019s net rental revenue. However, the project has not  been developed as expected. Specifically, the lessee has renovated only  two of the three deteriorated buildings, and according to Army officials,  nearly all of the EUL office space is rented to the Army rather than to  private sector tenants. This occurred for two reasons. First, after the  terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, access to the installation became  restricted, which increased the complexity of renting space to private  sector tenants. Second, the Army made several decisions after the lease  was signed to relocate Army organizations to Fort Sam Houston, which  resulted in a significant increase in the need for Army office space at the  installation. Even if the Army had wanted to terminate one or all of the  EUL leases because of these changes, none of the leases included a clause  to permit the government to terminate the lease for convenience. At the  time of our visit in August 2010, the Army estimated that EUL  consideration over 50 years would total about $198 million, or about 22  percent less than was originally expected. Moreover, rather than resulting  from the Army\u2019s share of rental revenues from private sector tenants,  Army officials stated that nearly all of the estimated future consideration  is now expected to be the result of the Army getting back a portion of the  rent that the Army pays to the developer for using EUL office space.  Figure 1 contains photographs of property included in the Fort Sam  Houston EUL, including views of one of the renovated buildings, the  building that has not been renovated, and a newly constructed office  building on leased land.", "The Picatinny Arsenal EUL is the second EUL where expectations were  not realized. When the master agreement for the Picatinny Arsenal EUL  was signed in 2006, the Army anticipated that by October 2007 the  developer would have renovated or replaced the four Picatinny Arsenal  buildings included in the lease plan to provide 100,000 square feet of new  or renovated office space that would be rented to private sector tenants  for profit. Also, by May 2008, the Army anticipated that the developer  would have constructed and rented to private sector tenants about 150,000  square feet of office space on vacant land included in the lease plan.  Further, the Army initially estimated that it would receive about   $500 million in total in-kind consideration over the term of the EUL, of  which about $7.4 million in in-kind consideration from developer  payments and the Army\u2019s share of net rental revenues would have been  received by the end of 2010. However, the project has not been developed  as expected and the expected financial benefits have not been realized. At  the time of our visit in July 2010, about 27,500 square feet of office space,  or about 89 percent less than the amount initially expected, had been  developed and about 16,200 square feet of this space was rented to private  sector tenants. Also, through the end of 2010, the Army had received   $1.7 million in consideration for the lease, or 77 percent less than the  amount initially expected, and the entire amount was paid by the  developer when the first site lease was signed in 2006. According to Army  officials, the project has not met expectations because of the economic  downturn and it is not clear how much additional consideration will be  obtained over the remaining lease term. The leases do not include a  provision requiring minimal consideration payments to the Army in the  event that the property was not developed as expected, and none of the  leases contain a termination for convenience clause in the event that the  Army desired to terminate the lease before the end of the EUL term.  Figure 2 shows photographs of buildings covered by the Picatinny Arsenal  EUL.", "The Hill Air Force Base EUL is the third EUL where expectations were not  yet realized. When the Hill Air Force Base master agreement was signed in  2008, the Air Force estimated that in addition to $10 million in developer  paid consideration, the Air Force would receive about $385 million in in- kind facility improvements as consideration from its share of the project\u2019s  net rental revenue over the EUL term. The Air Force also anticipated that  about $75 million in public funds from tax increment financing proceeds  and public grants from the State of Utah would be provided to help  support infrastructure improvements near military installations. Further,  by the end of 2010, the Air Force estimated that the developer would have  begun construction of at least seven commercial buildings and that four of  these buildings would be completed, leased to private sector tenants, and  generating net rental income from which the Air Force would be receiving  a share as consideration. However, the project has not been developed as  expected largely, according to Air Force officials, because of the economic  slowdown. At the time of our visit in August 2010, construction had not  begun on any commercial buildings, and the only lease consideration  actually received by the Air Force was about $2.5 million, which the  developer paid when the master lease agreement was signed in 2008.  Also, of the projected $75 million in public funding, the Air Force  originally estimated that $45 million would be available to benefit the  project by the end of fiscal year 2010. However, at the end of fiscal year  2010, about $10 million in state grants had been made toward military  installation infrastructure improvements\u2014$35 million less than  estimated\u2014and of this amount, about $800,000 had been used to pay for  the design of two facilities at Hill Air Force Base. The balance of the state  funds was held by a state-created military installation development  authority. Installation officials stated that they remained optimistic that  the project would eventually develop as envisioned.", "Although not one of our case studies, the EUL at Kirtland Air Force Base,  New Mexico, also illustrates missed expectations. When the Kirtland Air  Force Base EUL was signed in 2005, the Air Force expected that the lessee  would develop the 8.3 acre property by constructing and subleasing office,  research, and education facilities. Over the 50-year lease, the Air Force  estimated that it would receive about $2.7 million in lease consideration  from annual ground rent payments and additional rent payments as the  planned facilities were completed. However, from the time the lease was  signed in 2005 through December 2010, Air Force officials stated that the  Air Force received no consideration for the lease\u2014the lessee made no  ground rent payments to the Air Force and no facilities were constructed  to generate additional rent.

Third, some EULs included property that was being used by the  military or might be needed for military purposes over the lease term,  which could result in increased costs to relocate military activities or  increased potential government costs in the event a service had to  terminate a lease to regain use of the property. Fourth, the services have  not regularly monitored EUL program administration costs to help ensure  that the costs are in line with program benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Services Lack Documentation That Certain Statutory Requirements Were Met", "paragraphs": ["In the nine EUL case studies we reviewed, we found that the services  generally lacked methodologies, analyses, or other documentation  showing that certain provisions contained in section 2667 were addressed  prior to entering into the leases. Among other things, section 2667 requires  that each lease does not include excess property. This determination is  particularly important given that some EULs include terms of 50 years or  more and in view of recent emphasis on the disposal of excess or  underused federal property as a cost savings measure. Other section 2667  provisions require that a lease may not be for a term in excess of 5 years,  unless the secretary concerned determines that the lease will promote the  national defense or be in the public interest, and that each lease permit the  service to revoke the lease at any time, unless the secretary concerned  determines that omission of such a provision will promote the national  defense or be in the public interest. These determinations are left to  secretarial discretion and supporting analyses or documentation  evidencing the determinations is not specifically required by law.  Nevertheless, internal control standards call for the documentation of  management decisions and our review found that the services lacked  guidance on how to make the determinations and document them. Without  such evidence, it is not clear to what extent the services systematically  considered and assessed each requirement to ensure that each was met  prior to entering into the leases.", "In most cases, the services lacked supporting analyses or other specific  documentation to show how the excess property determination was made.  For example, five of the nine EULs in our case studies provided  declarative statements in the lease documents that the property included  in the lease was not excess property, and four EULs were silent on the  matter. Similarly, concerning the secretarial determinations that leases  exceeding 5 years would promote the national defense or be in the public  interest, six of the seven EULs in our case studies with terms exceeding 5  years provided declarative statements that the leases promoted the  national defense or were in the public interest, and the remaining EUL was  silent on the issue. However, in most cases the services did not have  analyses or documentation to support the determinations. Service officials  explained that the declarative statements alone in some cases constituted  the totality of the documentation of the secretary\u2019s determination.", "Further, seven of the nine EULs in our case studies did not include terms  permitting the government to revoke the lease at any time. According to  some service officials, the primary reason for the omission is that at least  for those EULs that call for property development, the lessee normally  seeks commercial loans to aid in the development and commercial lenders  would not lend money for a project that might be terminated before the  lender was able to recover the loan. Thus, the services often omit from  their EULs a clause permitting lease termination at the government\u2019s  convenience. However, the statute requires a determination that the  omission would promote the national defense or be in the public interest.  We found that six of the seven EULs without the clause included a  declarative statement that the omission would promote the national  defense or be in the public interest and the remaining EUL was silent on  the matter. Yet in all seven cases the services lacked analyses or  documentation showing how the secretary determined that the omission  would promote the national defense or be in the public interest.", "Table 2 summarizes our analysis of the services\u2019 consideration of these  three section 2667 provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Is Not Clear How and to What Extent the Army\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s EULs Provided for the Receipt of Fair Market Value", "paragraphs": ["How and to what extent the Army\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s EULs provide for  the receipt of the FMV of the leased property, as required by section 2667,  is unclear. Section 2667 requires that each lease provide for the payment  (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is not  less than the FMV of the lease interest, as determined by the service  secretary. While the statute leaves the determination of FMV to secretarial  discretion, and thus a particular methodology for determining FMV is not  required, we found cases where receipt of FMV was questionable largely  because service guidance for determining and ensuring the receipt of FMV  for proposed EULs was not always clear. Specifically, as illustrated below,  we found one Army case where receipt of FMV cannot be ensured because  the FMV of leased property was not determined; two Air Force cases  where the agreed-to amount of lease consideration was below at least one  appraisal of the value of the leased property; and other cases where the  receipt of FMV depended on the service receiving a share of the net rental  revenues from a project\u2019s development, which could potentially result in  FMV not being obtained in the future.", "First, the Army did not appraise about 39 of the approximately 41 acres of  land included in the Fort Sam Houston EUL. The three 2001 site leases  comprising the Fort Sam Houston EUL initially included three primary old,  deteriorated buildings and associated land that was used mostly for  parking. According to the Army, about 36 acres of land was included in  these original leases. To determine the FMV of the property, the Army  used an appraisal that determined that the FMV of several buildings was  $1.00 per year because of their poor condition. However, in determining  the FMV of the land, an appraisal was conducted for only 2 acres\u2014not the  36 total acres included in the original leases. Also, Army officials stated  that the Army and the lessee subsequently agreed in 2008 to add several  acres of Fort Sam Houston land to the EUL in exchange for the lessee  returning to the Army some land associated with two of the old buildings\u2019  parking lots. The Army wanted to build a lodging facility on the land that  had been included in the original lease. Although Army officials stated that  the exchange resulted in a net increase of the total amount of Army land  included in the EUL by about 5 acres, the Army did not determine the FMV  of the additional land, which the lessee subsequently used as the site for  constructing a new office building. Without a determination of the FMV of  the land included in the Fort Sam Houston EUL, the Army cannot ensure  that the FMV of this property will be obtained over the remaining term of  the EUL.", "Second, for two of the three Air Force EULs in our case studies, the Air  Force had appraisals completed to help determine the value of the  property that was to be leased. Ultimately, the Air Force relied upon  negotiations with the lessee, rather than the appraisals, to determine the  FMV of the property, and in both cases, the Air Force accepted a  negotiated amount of consideration that was less than the appraised value  of the property. According to the Air Force, although it uses property  appraisals as a guide for determining FMV, a property\u2019s actual FMV is the  price a willing buyer could reasonably expect to pay a willing seller in a  competitive market to acquire the property. Yet, in at least these two EUL  cases, the Air Force\u2019s negotiations did not take place in a competitive  market because the Air Force only negotiated with one party to determine  the amount of consideration accepted for the lease interest. To illustrate,  the Air Force hired a company to review two appraisals with differing  estimates of the value of the property included in one Eglin Air Force Base  EUL, referred to as the Okaloosa County Regional Airport EUL, and to  provide its perspective on the value of the property. The company  estimated that the FMV of the property was $1,274,000 annually. After  negotiations with one party, the lessee, the Air Force agreed to accept  $318,000 annually as consideration. Thus, the negotiated amount was  $956,000, or 75 percent, less per year than the appraised value of the  property. As another example, at the request of the Air Force, the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers performed an appraisal on about 256 acres of  land included in the other Eglin Air Force Base EUL, referred to as the  Arbennie Pritchett Water Reclamation Facility EUL. The appraisal  estimated that the FMV of the leased property was $513,000 annually. After  negotiations with one party, the lessee, the Air Force agreed to accept  $325,000 annually as consideration. Thus, in this case, the negotiated  amount was $188,000, or 37 percent, less per year than the appraised value  of the property. Such cases raise questions about the extent to which the  EULs will provide for receipt of the FMV of the lease interest.", "Third, we found that FMV, as determined by the secretary concerned,  might not be obtained in some EULs because of the terms contained in the  lease agreements. For example, providing for the receipt of FMV can be  problematic in EULs where, in accordance with lease terms, the receipt of  FMV depends on the service receiving a share of the net rental revenues  from a project\u2019s development rather than receiving agreed-to rent  payments or sufficient up-front cash payments that match or exceed the  FMV. In such cases, if project development does not occur as expected,  then project rental revenues\u2014and thus the service\u2019s share of the rental  revenues\u2014also would not materialize as expected and the FMV of the  lease interest might not be obtained. To illustrate, in the Picatinny Arsenal  case, the Army determined that the FMV of the property that had been  leased to the developer at the time of our visit in July 2010 was $1,850,000.  The Army received $1,700,000 from the lessee when the first site lease was  signed. However, obtaining the balance of the FMV depends on the Army  receiving a share of net rental revenues, and because the project has not  been developed as expected, the Army had not received any share of net  rental revenues at the time of our visit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some EULs Included Property That Was Being Used by the Military or Had Potential for Being Needed by the Military over the Lease Term", "paragraphs": ["Because of the cost to relocate military activities or the increased  potential financial liability to the government if a service had to terminate  a lease to regain use of leased property, it would appear imprudent for  economic reasons for the services to lease property needed for military  purposes.

As a result, the government apparently will incur increased  relocation costs in one case and in other cases increased potential for  future costs in the event that the service has to terminate a lease to regain  use of the property. In 2008, after many of the leases in our case studies  were signed, the Congress added a provision to section 2667 requiring that  property to be leased must not for the time be needed for public use.  However, we found that the services lacked guidance on the analyses and  documentation needed to show that property to be leased is not needed  for public use. Without such documentation, it will not be clear that the  new provision will be met prior to entering into future leases.", "For example, the master development agreement and master lease for the  Hill Air Force Base EUL included property being used by the Defense Non- Tactical Generator and Rail Equipment Center, a DOD depot-level  maintenance activity. The master development agreement obligates the Air  Force to maintain and deliver the project site \u201cfree of tenants.\u201d As such,  the Air Force told the center that it would not be renewing the permit that  allowed the center to operate on Air Force land and that the center would  have to relocate. However, according to the Army, which manages the  center, funds were not available to pay for the relocation, which was  estimated to cost from about $37 million to $45 million. Because the legal  agreements that the Air Force signed obligate the Air Force to maintain  and deliver the project site \u201cfree of tenants,\u201d Air Force officials stated that  if the center does not relocate, the lessee could sue the Air Force for   $41 million in damages. The issue was not resolved at the time we  completed our review. Figure 3 shows photographs of the Defense Non- Tactical Generator and Rail Equipment Center at Hill Air Force Base.", "As another example, when the first three site leases for the Fort Sam  Houston EUL were signed in 2001, Army officials stated that the  installation had no apparent need for the three large, deteriorated  buildings and the associated land included in the lease. Still, given that the  property was located in the interior of the installation surrounded by other  Army buildings and activities, it would appear that there was a reasonable  probability that the Army might have a need for the property over the 50- year lease term. As noted previously, shortly after the three original leases  were signed in 2001, the Army relocated several Army organizations to  Fort Sam Houston, which created a significant demand for office space.  Because other office space on the installation was not readily available,  Army officials stated that the Army leased back from the developer nearly  all of the space in the EUL buildings that had been renovated. During our  visit to Fort Sam Houston in August 2010, installation officials stated that  the installation continued to have a need for office space and that the  officials had considered terminating a portion of the EUL to regain control  of the one large building that the developer had not renovated so that the  Army could renovate the building for its use. However, the officials stated  that the Army most likely would not pursue this option because the lease  did not include a termination for convenience clause, and therefore early  termination could be very costly to the Army. Instead, installation officials  stated that the Army was in the process of converting an old barracks  building at the installation into office space for Army use. In another  instance involving property included in the EUL, in 2008, the Army needed  some of the land included in the EUL to build a new lodging facility. In this  instance, Army officials stated that the Army was able to regain use of the  needed property through a land exchange by amending the lease.

Instead,  such consideration was deposited into an escrow account in satisfaction  of the lessee\u2019s rent obligations, and the Army used these funds as if they  were permissible in-kind consideration. Several provisions in the Picatinny  Arsenal EUL and its associated legal documents indicated that the Army  owned the funds in the escrow account. For example, the lessee was not  obligated to provide any additional in-kind consideration beyond the funds  deposited in the escrow account, escrow funds could only be used with  the Army\u2019s consent, the lessee had no rights to the escrow funds, no in- kind deliverables were specified, and any interest earned in escrow was  earned by the Army for income tax purposes. We would emphasize that  simply calling a cash payment \u201cin-kind services\u201d does not make it so. As a  consequence, the Army violated section 2667, violated the miscellaneous  receipts statute, and augmented its appropriations. In its comments, DOD  also stated that the department does not read either our report or our legal  opinion as prohibiting the use of escrow agreements in connection with  EUL transactions, provided the terms of those escrow agreements do not  amount to constructive receipt of funds in the escrow agreement by the  government. As we stated in our legal opinion, the opinion pertains  primarily to the Picatinny Arsenal EUL and its associated legal documents.  However, to the extent other EULs are on substantially similar terms as  the Picatinny Arsenal EUL, our conclusions in the legal opinion apply to  those EULs as well, hence our recommendation, with which DOD  concurred and said that it would implement.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation that the Army and the Air  Force take steps to ensure that all EULs provide that if and to the extent  that the leased property is later made taxable by state or local  governments under an act of Congress, the lease shall be renegotiated, as  required by subsection 2667(f) of Title 10, U.S. Code. DOD stated that the  services will amend their existing EULs as needed and will incorporate the  required provision in future EUL legal instruments.", "In response to our recommendation that the Army and the Air Force  review and clarify guidance describing how the FMV of the lease interest  should be determined and how the receipt of FMV can best be ensured,  DOD concurred. DOD stated that the Army and Air Force will revise their  processes for establishing the FMV and prepare appropriate guidance,  which will also establish procedures to verify that in-kind consideration  received is not less than the FMV of the leasehold.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation that the Army, the Navy,  and the Air Force issue guidance on how to determine and document that  section 2667 provisions were met prior to entering into an EUL, including  the required secretarial determinations and the basis for the  determinations. DOD did not provide specific details for implementing the  recommendation.", "Concerning our recommendation that the services issue guidance on the  analyses or documentation needed to show that future leases executed  under section 2667 do not include property needed for public use, as is  now required by section 2667, DOD concurred and stated that all three  services will issue and update their EUL guidance on the analyses or  documentation needed to establish that leases executed do not include  property needed for public use. While concurring with the  recommendation, DOD also stated that it disagreed with our use of the  Fort Sam Houston EUL as an example of military property that was leased  when there was a reasonable probability that the Army might have a need  for the property in the future. DOD stated that the combination of  circumstances that occurred after lease execution, including the terrorist  attacks of September 11, 2001, and consequent effects on base access and  Army space requirements, could not have been reasonably foreseen. We  agree that the specific events that occurred after lease execution might not  have been reasonably foreseen. However, our point is that the leased  property was located in the interior of the installation surrounded by other  Army buildings and activities and that over the 50-year lease time frame,  there was a reasonable probability that the Army might develop a need for  the property, regardless of the specific events that might create a need. At  a minimum, the Army could have anticipated that a requirement for the  property or a portion of the property might arise and mitigated the  potential consequences by including a termination for convenience clause  or other appropriate provisions in the EUL.", "Finally, DOD concurred with our recommendation that the services  develop procedures to regularly monitor and analyze EUL program  administration costs to help ensure that the costs are in line with program  benefits. DOD stated that the Army will revise its EUL guidance to require  standardization of EUL accounting and reporting of program costs and  benefits and that the Air Force is developing methodology for baselining  and tracking project and program administrative costs and rates of return  to better enable the Air Force to forecast and monitor the effectiveness of  the EUL program. DOD also stated that it expected administrative costs to  decline in the future through the use of standardized documents and  processes and that some EULs have benefits other than rental  consideration that should be considered when comparing program costs  and benefits.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; and the Commandant  of the Marine Corps.

We  also interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to discuss the EUL program and service  efforts to ensure that each EUL complies with the provisions contained in  section 2667. While we reviewed information on all 17 EULs in place at the  end of fiscal year 2010, to specifically assess EUL compliance with  statutory requirements, we selected 9 of the 17 EULs for detailed case  study review. The EULs were selected nonrandomly to include 3 from  each service and a range of lease purposes, estimated financial benefits,  and geographic locations. We judgmentally selected these EULs because  they represented each of the military services and were located in several  different geographic locations. In each case study, we obtained, reviewed,  and compared the lease agreements and related documentation with the  statutory requirements in place at the time the respective agreements were  signed, as well as applicable case law, to assess compliance. Also, at each  installation visited, we discussed with installation officials the policies,  procedures, and practices used for implementing the EULs and ensuring  compliance with section 2667. Further, for those areas where we identified  questions regarding compliance, we asked each service\u2019s general counsel\u2019s  office for a legal response to our questions, which we considered as part  of our review. On March 30, 2011, on the basis of information developed  during our review, GAO issued a legal opinion on the terms and conditions  of the legal documents comprising the Picatinny Arsenal EUL. The legal  opinion supplements our audit report.", "To determine to what extent the services\u2019 expectations for their EULs  have been realized, we obtained and summarized EUL program  information from the services, including information on each EUL\u2019s  estimated and actual development time frames and financial benefits  received through September 30, 2010. For the nine EUL case studies, we  obtained and reviewed more detailed information on how the services  initially estimated expected EUL development time frames and financial  benefits and how actual EUL development progress and financial benefits  through September 2010 compared to expectations. We mostly relied on  the services for the accuracy of the information on EUL development time  frames and financial benefits, although we corroborated the information  based on our review of EUL legal documentation and escrow account  records. In the case studies where the expected development time frames  and financial benefits were not realized, we discussed the reasons why  with officials at service headquarters and at the installations where the  EULs were located. Further, we observed EUL property and, when  applicable, development progress at most installations where the case  study EULs were located.", "To evaluate the services\u2019 management of the EUL program, we reviewed  and considered Department of Defense and military service guidance,  policies, instructions, and practices for managing the EUL program in view  of federal internal control standards. We also interviewed officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense; Army, Navy, and Air Force  headquarters; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the Naval Facilities  Command; and the Air Force Real Property Agency to discuss the  implementation and management of the EUL program. We specifically  discussed with these officials how and to what extent they document  various secretarial determinations required by section 2667\u2014that the lease  does not include excess property; that the lease may not be for more than  5 years unless the service secretary determines that a longer term will  promote the national defense or be in the public interest; and that the  lease include a provision permitting the service to revoke the lease at any  time, unless the secretary determines that omission of such a provision  will promote the national defense or be in the public interest. In addition,  for the nine case studies, we determined how the service determined and  provided for the receipt of the fair market value of the lease interest and  reviewed how the leased property was used before the lease was signed.  We also discussed with service officials the potential that the leased  property might be needed for military purposes during the lease term.  Further, we discussed with service officials how and to what extent they  monitor EUL program administration costs, and we obtained and  compared each service\u2019s EUL program administration costs, including the  costs of service personnel and consultants used to administer the  program, during fiscal years 2006 through 2010, with the total amount of  consideration received from each service\u2019s EULs through fiscal year 2010.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
