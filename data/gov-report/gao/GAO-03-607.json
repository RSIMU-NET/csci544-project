However, the inadequacy of the international community's financial and in-kind support of the World Food Program's (WFP) appeal for assistance disrupted the provision of food assistance throughout 2002. Because of a lack of resources, WFP reduced the amount of food rations provided to returning refugees from 150 kilograms to 50 kilograms. Meanwhile, as a result of the statutory requirement that U.S. agencies providing food assistance purchase U.S.-origin commodities and ship them on U.S.-flag vessels, assistance costs and delivery times were higher by $35 million and 120 days, respectively, than if the United States had provided WFP with cash or regionally produced commodities. Had the U.S. assistance been purchased regionally, an additional 685,000 people could have been fed for 1 year. The livelihood of 85 percent of Afghanistan's approximately 26 million people depends on agriculture. Over 50 percent of the gross domestic product and 80 percent of export earnings have historically come from agriculture. Over the 4-year period, because of continued conflict and drought, the international community provided primarily short-term agricultural assistance such as tools and seed. As a result, the assistance did not significantly contribute to the reconstruction of the agricultural sector. In 2002, agricultural assistance was not adequately coordinated with the Afghan government; a new coordination mechanism was established in December 2002, but it is too early to determine its effectiveness. As a result of the weak coordination, the Afghan government and the international community have not developed a joint strategy to direct the overall agricultural rehabilitation effort. Meanwhile, inadequate assistance funding, continuing terrorist attacks, warlords' control of much of the country, and the growth of opium production threaten the recovery of the agricultural sector and the U.S. goals of food security and political stability in Afghanistan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Afghanistan is a country devastated by 23 years of war and destructive  domestic policies and more than 4 years of drought. The livelihood of 85  percent of Afghanistan\u2019s approximately 26 million inhabitants depends on  agriculture, yet the food and agricultural sector has been severely  damaged. Since 1978, the country has required international food aid to  help meet the shortfall between food supply and demand. Since 1999, the  United States has been the largest donor of food and agricultural assistance  to Afghanistan. The U.S. policy goal in Afghanistan is to create a stable  Afghan society that is not a threat to itself or others and is not a base for  terrorism; U.S. food and agricultural assistance to Afghanistan is intended  not only to provide emergency relief but also to help achieve this long-term  goal. The United States has provided short-term, emergency food  assistance to feed Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerable populations, as well as longer- term agricultural development assistance to help Afghanistan improve its  food security and political stability. The majority of U.S. assistance has  been given through the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the United  Nations (UN) World Food Program (WFP) and the UN Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO), as well as nongovernmental organizations.", "Nongovernmental organizations and contractors distribute most of the  assistance provided through the UN organizations in Afghanistan.", "Because of concerns about the United States\u2019 and UN\u2019s ability to deliver  assistance in such a complex environment, and recognizing the  interrelationship of short-term emergency food assistance and longer-term  agricultural assistance, you asked that we examine the food and  agricultural assistance provided to date. We assessed, for 1999\u20132002, (1)  the impact, management, and U.S. and international support of short-term,  emergency food assistance to Afghanistan and (2) the impact and  management of long-term, agricultural development assistance to  Afghanistan, as well as obstacles to achieving food security and political  stability.", "To address these issues, we collected and analyzed information from the  U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and State; the U.S. Agency for  International Development; the UN World Food Program, Food and  Agriculture Organization, and Development Program; the World Bank; the  Asian Development Bank; and the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture and  Animal Husbandry and Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources. This  effort included an analysis of the cost data for U.S. food assistance  provided through these agencies and organizations. In addition, we  contacted 14 nongovernmental organizations, responsible for delivering  WFP and FAO assistance in Afghanistan, to obtain their views on a range of  issues including the management of donated commodities and  coordination. Finally, we traveled to Afghanistan to examine the WFP\u2019s  operations in country. Our presence in Afghanistan was limited due to  security precautions imposed by the Department of State.

At 647,500 square kilometers, it is slightly smaller  than the state of Texas. Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and  south; Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and China to the north; and  Iran to the west (see fig. 1). Its population, currently estimated at 26 million, is ethnically diverse, largely rural, and mostly uneducated. Life  expectancy in Afghanistan is among the lowest in the world, with some of  the highest rates of infant and child mortality.", "Political conflicts have ravaged Afghanistan for years, limiting  development within the country. Conflict broke out in 1978 when a  communist-backed coup led to a change in government. One year later, the  Soviet Union began its occupation of Afghanistan, initiating more than two  decades of conflict. Over the course of the 10-year occupation, various  countries, including the United States, backed Afghan resistance efforts.  The protracted conflict led to the flight of a large number of refugees into  Pakistan and Iran. In 1989, the Soviet forces withdrew, and in 1992, the  communist regime fell to the Afghan resistance. Unrest continued,  however, fueled by factions and warlords fighting for control.", "The Taliban movement emerged in the mid 1990s, and by 1998 it controlled  approximately 90 percent of the country. Although it provided some  political stability, the Taliban regime did not make significant  improvements to the country\u2019s food security. Furthermore, the Taliban\u2019s  continuing war with the Northern Alliance and the Taliban\u2019s destructive  policies, highlighted in its treatment of women, further impeded aid and  development. Coalition forces removed the regime in late 2001, responding  to its protection of al Qaeda terrorists who attacked the United States. In  December 2001, an international summit in Bonn, Germany, established a  framework for the new Afghan government, known as the Bonn  Agreement.", "Agriculture is essential to Afghanistan. Despite the fact that only 11.5  percent (7.5 million hectares) of Afghanistan\u2019s total area is cultivable, 85  percent of the population depends on agriculture for its livelihood, and 80  percent of export earnings and more than 50 percent of the gross domestic  product have historically come from agriculture. However, Afghanistan\u2019s  agricultural sector continues to suffer from the effects of prolonged  drought, war, and neglect. It lacks high-quality seed, draft animals, and  fertilizer, as well as adequate veterinary services, modern technology,  advanced farming methods, and a credit system for farmers. Further,  Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and its Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources lack the infrastructure and  resources to assist farmers.", "Because Afghanistan experiences limited rainfall, its agricultural sector is  highly dependent on irrigation\u201485 percent of its agricultural products  derives from irrigated areas. Thus, the conservation and efficient use of  water is the foundation of the agricultural sector. The severe drought that  has gripped the country since 1998 has resulted in drastic decreases in  domestic production of livestock and agricultural supplies including seed,  fertilizer, and feed (see fig. 2). Several earthquakes and the worst locust  infestation in 30 years exacerbated this crisis in 2002. Without adequate  supplies and repairs to irrigation systems, even if the drought breaks,  farmers will be unable to produce the food that the country needs to feed  itself.", "Since 1965, the WFP has been the major provider of food assistance to  Afghanistan. Partnering with nongovernmental organizations, it delivers  assistance through emergency operations that provide short-term relief to  populations affected by a specific crisis such as war or drought. It also  conducts protracted relief and recovery operations designed to shift  assistance toward longer-term reconstruction efforts. Because of its policy  to target assistance at specific populations, WFP does not attempt to  provide food for all of the vulnerable people within a country or affected  area. Instead, it focuses on specific vulnerable populations such as  internally displaced people or widows (see fig. 3). Further, it does not try to  meet all of the daily requirements of the targeted populations. WFP\u2019s 2002  emergency operation in Afghanistan targeted internally displaced people,  people affected by drought, and children, among others. The assistance  programs designed to assist these populations provide between 46 and 79  percent, or 970 to 1671 kilocalories, of the recommended minimum daily  requirement of 2100 kilocalories. WFP assumes that beneficiaries will  obtain the remainder of their food through subsistence farming or the  market.", "FAO has provided much of the agricultural assistance to Afghanistan.  FAO has been involved in agricultural development and natural resource  management in Afghanistan for more than 50 years. FAO was founded in  1945 with a mandate to raise levels of nutrition and standards of living, to  improve agricultural productivity, and to better the condition of rural  populations. Today, FAO is one of the largest specialized agencies in the UN  system and the lead agency for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and rural  development. An intergovernmental organization, FAO has 183 member  countries plus one member organization, the European Community. FAO  has traditionally carried out reconstruction efforts in relatively stable  environments. Although FAO is increasingly implementing its programs in  unstable postconflict situations such as Afghanistan, the agency and its  staff are still adjusting to operating in such environments. FAO's regular  program budget provides funding for the organization's normative work  and, to a limited extent, for advice to member states on policy and planning  in the agricultural sector. FAO's regular budget can also fund limited  technical assistance projects through its Technical Cooperation Program.  Apart from this, extrabudgetary resources, through trust funds provided by  donors or other funding arrangements, fund all emergency and  development assistance provided by FAO.

To overcome these obstacles, WFP negotiated with the Taliban to  allow the movement of food to areas occupied by the Northern Alliance; it  also threatened to cancel certain projects unless women were allowed to  continue to work for WFP. Further, WFP found ways to deliver food to  remote areas, including airlifting food and hiring donkeys (see fig. 5). In  addition, it purchased trucks to supplement a fleet of contracted trucks.  Using these trucks as leverage against the Afghan trucking cartel, WFP  forced the cartel to negotiate when the cartel attempted to dramatically  increase transport fees.", "WFP created the position of Special Envoy of the Executive Director for  the Afghan Region to lead and direct all WFP operations in Afghanistan and  neighboring countries during the winter of 2001\u20132002, when it was believed  that the combination of winter weather and conflict would increase the  need for food assistance. WFP was thus able to consolidate the control of  all resources in the region, streamline its operations, and accelerate the  movement of assistance. WFP points to the creation of the position as one  of the main reasons it was able to move record amounts of food into  Afghanistan from November 2001 through January 2002.

WFP made its initial appeal in February 2002 for the operation and it made  subsequent appeals for donor support throughout the operation. The  operation was designed to benefit 9,885,000 Afghans over a 9-month period,  through the provision of 543,837 metric tons of food at a cost of over $295  million. It was also intended to allow WFP to begin to shift from  emergency to recovery operations with particular emphasis on education,  health, and the agricultural sector. When the operation began in April 2002,  WFP\u2019s Kabul office warned that it might have to stop or slow projects if  donors did not provide more support. At that time, WFP had received only  $63.9 million, or 22 percent of the required resources. The United States  provided most of this funding.

The rations are intended to  enable these groups to sustain themselves long enough to reestablish their  lives; reducing the rations may have compromised efforts to stabilize  population movements within Afghanistan. The lack of donor support also  forced WFP and its implementing partners to delay for up to 10 weeks, in  some cases, the compensation promised to Afghans who participated in the  food-for-work and food-for-asset-creation projects, resulting in a loss of  credibility in the eyes of the Afghans and nongovernmental organizations.  Similarly, because of resource shortages, WFP had to delay for up to 8  weeks in-kind payments of food in its civil service support program,  intended to help the new government establish itself, and it never received  enough contributions to provide civil servants with the allocation of tea  they were to be given as part of their support package. In addition, WFP  was forced to reduce the number of new projects it initiated, thus limiting  the level of reconstruction efforts it completed.", "In January 2003, WFP expressed concern that the problems it encountered  with donor support in 2002 could recur in 2003. Despite the expansion of  agricultural production in 2002 because of increased rainfall, 6 million  Afghans will require food assistance in 2003. Although the United States  was the largest donor of food assistance to Afghanistan in 2002, the U.S.  contribution may be smaller in 2003 than in previous years owing to  reduced surpluses of commodities, higher commodity prices, and  competing crises in Africa, North Korea, and Iraq. The UN forecasts  Afghan cereal production for July 2002 through June 2003 at 3.59 million  metric tons, a cereal import requirement of 1.38 million metric tons, and  Afghan commercial food imports at 911,000 metric tons.

We estimated that the savings in freight  costs would have enabled WFP to provide food assistance to  approximately 685,000 additional people for 1 year. In addition, we  estimated that if the United States had donated cash or regionally  purchased commodities instead of air-dropping rations, WFP could have  provided food assistance for another 1.0 million people for a year.", "U.S.-Produced Commodities Raised Costs and Slowed Delivery Most of the food assistance that the United States donated to Afghanistan  in 1999\u20132002 was provided through WFP as in-kind donations of U.S.  agricultural products as well as cash to cover shipping and freight costs.  Since the commodities were purchased in the United States, much of the  cost of the assistance represented shipping and freight costs rather than  the price of the commodities.

WFP officials in Rome  and Cairo stated that cash was greatly preferable to in-kind donations  because it allows for flexibility and for local and regional purchases. Other  contributors to WFP efforts in Afghanistan have provided cash, allowing  WFP to make the purchases it deemed most expedient, including  purchases from Central Asian countries that produced large surpluses in  2002. Ninety-three percent of the commodities WFP purchased for the  emergency operation that began in April 2002 (157,128 metric tons) were  from Kazakhstan and Pakistan. WFP also stated that it could have saved  approximately 120 days in delivery time if it had received U.S.  contributions in cash that it could have used for regional purchases.", "Although the commodity costs and some of the freight costs for regional  purchases are lower, the largest portion of the savings from regional  purchases comes from eliminating ocean freight costs. In 2002, USDA spent  $5.6 million on ocean freight, or 31 percent of the value of the aid it  provided to Afghanistan. USAID spent $29.4 million on ocean freight, or  18.3 percent of the value of the aid it provided to Afghanistan. Overall,  USDA and USAID spent approximately $35.0 million on ocean freight and  commissions, or 19.6 percent of the total value ($178,068,786) of the food  aid they provided through WFP to Afghanistan. Had this money been spent  on regional purchases instead of on ocean freight, it could have paid for  103,000 additional metric tons of commodities, or enough to provide food  assistance for approximately 685,000 people for 1 year. However, the laws  governing the main food assistance programs under which most of the U.S.  assistance was provided to Afghanistan through WFP do not provide for  USAID and USDA to purchase food assistance commodities regionally or  provide cash to WFP to make regional purchases. All of the assistance must  be provided in the form of U.S. commodities, and 75 percent of the  commodities by weight must be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. According to  USDA, this requirement referred to as \u201ccargo preference\u201d accounts for 9  percent of the cost of U.S. food assistance shipments worldwide. In this  case, it accounted for approximately $16 million of the $35 million in ocean  freight. In prior reports we reported that the most significant impact of the  cargo preference requirement on U.S. food assistance programs is the  additional costs incurred. Using U.S.-flag vessels reduces funds available  for purchasing commodities, thus the amount of food delivered to  vulnerable populations is decreased. In its 2002 annual assessment of  management performance, the Office of Management and Budget  concluded that U.S. food assistance programs would be more cost effective  and flexible if the requirement to ship U.S. food assistance on U.S.-flag  vessels was eliminated. In commenting on a draft of this report, USDA  stated that consideration should be given to waiving cargo preference  requirements in specific food aid situations.", "In February 2003, the President announced a new humanitarian $200  million Famine Fund. Use of the fund will be subject to presidential  decision and will draw upon the broad disaster assistance authorities in the  Foreign Assistance Act. According to USAID, these authorities allow the  U.S. government to purchase commodities overseas to meet emergency  food assistance needs. However, this authority does not extend to the  United States\u2019 fiscal year 2003 $2.6 billion food assistance programs under  existing food assistance legislation.", "Humanitarian Daily Rations Were Expensive and Inefficient The U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s humanitarian daily ration program was a  largely ineffective and expensive component of the U.S. food assistance  effort. The program was initiated to alleviate suffering and convey that the  United States was waging war against the Taliban, not the Afghan people.  However, the program\u2019s public relations and military impact have not been  formally evaluated. Airdrops of the humanitarian daily rations were  intended to disperse the packets over a wide area, avoiding the dangers of  heavy pallet drops or having concentrations of food fall into the hands of a  few. On October 8, 2001, U.S. Air Force C-17s began dropping rations on  various areas within Afghanistan. Drops averaged 35,000 packets per night  (two planeloads) and ended on December 21, 2001. In 198 missions over 74  days, the Air Force dropped 2,489,880 rations (see fig. 8).", "According to WFP, one of the major problems with the ration program was  the lack of any assessment to identify the needs of the target populations or  their locations. WFP representatives were part of the coordination team  located at Central Command in late 2001 when the airdrops were made.  These representatives provided the Defense Department with general  information on drought-affected areas but were not asked to provide  information on specific areas to target. According to Department of  Defense officials, the drop areas were selected based on consultations with  USAID staff familiar with the situation in Afghanistan.", "Defense officials told us that the rations are an expensive and inefficient  means of delivering food assistance and were designed to relieve  temporary food shortages resulting from manmade or natural disasters\u2014 not, as in Afghanistan, to feed a large number of people affected by a long- term food shortage. Defense officials responsible for the ration program  stated that the humanitarian, public relations, and military impact of the  effort in Afghanistan had not been evaluated. According to these officials,  anecdotal reports from Special Forces soldiers indicated that vulnerable  populations did receive the food and that the rations helped to generate  goodwill among the Afghan people. However, reports from  nongovernmental organizations in Afghanistan indicated that often the  rations went to the healthiest, since they were able to access the drop zone  most quickly, and were hoarded by a few rather than distributed among the  population.", "The cost of the rations was $4.25 per unit, or $10,581,990 for the  approximately 2.5 million dropped. The total cost of the program was  $50,897,769, or $20.44 per daily ration. Delivery cost is estimated at $16.19  per unit, based on the difference in the ration cost and the department\u2019s  total expenditure.

However, we maintain that amending the Agricultural Trade  Development and Assistance Act of 1954 to allow the provision of cash or  food commodities outside the United States will greatly improve U.S.  flexibility in responding to crises that affect U.S. national security and  foreign policy interests. The act is the principal authority for providing food  assistance in emergency situations. In both 2002 and 2003 over $2 billion in  food assistance, the preponderant amount of this type of assistance, was  dispersed under this authority. Amending the act will provide the United  States with more flexibility to respond rapidly and at lower cost to events  that affect U.S. national security; this is particularly important given the  number and magnitude of crises requiring food assistance and decreasing  surpluses of U.S. commodities. We also agree with USDA that the cargo  preference requirement adds additional cost to food assistance and should  be waived in specific situations, and we have adjusted the matter for  congressional consideration contained in the report on this issue.", "In its comments, USDA stated that the report did not provide enough  evidence about the existence of surpluses in 2002 in the Central Asia  region. It also stated that if the U.S. had procured greater levels of  commodities with the savings accrued by purchasing regional versus U.S. - origin commodities, the additional commodities would have over burdened  WFP\u2019s logistics system while generating only \u201cmarginal savings in time and  money.\u201d", "We have added additional information on the 7.6 million metric ton 2002  grain surplus in Kazakhstan and Pakistan. We disagree with USDA\u2019s  assertions that additional regionally procured commodities would have  taxed WFP\u2019s logistics system and brought only marginal gains. In  December 2002, while fighting between coalition forces, the Northern  Alliance, and the Taliban was still occurring, and winter weather was  complicating food deliveries, WFP delivered 116,000 metric tons of food to  Afghan beneficiaries, in the single largest movement of food by WFP in a 1- month period. According to WFP, its Afghanistan logistics system was  capable of routinely moving more than 50,000 metric tons of food per  month. Further, we disagree with USDA\u2019s statement that the potential  savings in cost and time by purchasing commodities regionally are  marginal. Savings from the elimination of ocean freight costs could have  fed 685,000 people for 1 year, and commodities purchased regionally are  delivered to beneficiaries within weeks of being purchased, compared with  the 4 months that it can take for commodities purchased in the United  States.", "WFP, the Department of State, USDA, and USAID all agreed with the  report\u2019s conclusion and recommendation pertaining to assistance  coordination and the need to develop a joint international-Afghan  agricultural rehabilitation strategy. WFP pointed out that although the  international assistance effort may have been aided by better coordination  in 2002, the overall level of assistance might have been too small in 2002 to  have any long-term impact on the agricultural sector. Although USAID  agreed with our recommendation, it stated it did not want to lead the  strategy development effort. We believe that USAID should take an active  and aggressive role in the development of a joint international\u2013Afghan  government strategy, because the United States is the largest donor to  Afghanistan, agriculture rehabilitation is the focus of USAID\u2019s assistance  effort in Afghanistan, and the achievement of U.S. goals in Afghanistan is  tightly linked to the rehabilitation of the country\u2019s agricultural sector.  According to USAID\u2019s assistance strategy for Afghanistan, restoring food  security is USAID\u2019s highest priority.", "Finally, the Department of Defense focused its comments on the report\u2019s  discussion of the humanitarian daily ration program. Specifically, the  Department of Defense stated that (1) the report incorrectly characterized  the ration program as a food assistance program, (2) informal evaluations  of the program indicated that the program alleviated hunger and generated  goodwill from the Afghan people toward U.S. soldiers, and (3) although the  funds used to purchase rations could have been used to purchase bulk  food, the bulk food could not have been delivered to remote areas. The  report discusses both the food assistance and nonfood assistance aspects  of the rations program, and we have added information on page 30 about  the goodwill generated by the rations to the report. Finally, as discussed on  page 20 of the report, bulk food could have been delivered to remote areas  during the period of time (October-December 2001) when the ration  program was implemented. During the month of December 2001, WFP  delivered 116,000 metric tons of food to Afghanistan, a level of food  assistance that exceeds any 1-month total for any emergency operation in  WFP\u2019s history.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Richard J.

We did  not verify the statistical data provided by WFP. We also reviewed donor  resource contribution data for recent emergency and special operations.  We contacted by e-mail, or spoke with, 14 Afghan and international  nongovernmental organizations to obtain their views on the delivery of  assistance, WFP monitoring and reporting, and overall assistance  coordination issues. We interviewed WFP management and staff at WFP  headquarters in Rome, Italy; at the Regional Bureau for the Mediterranean,  Middle East, and Central Asia, in Cairo, Egypt; at the Country Office in  Kabul, Afghanistan; and at the Area Office in Hirat, Afghanistan. We also  interviewed USAID, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S.  Department of State staff in Washington, D.C., and Kabul; U.S. Department  of Defense Staff in Washington; the International Security Afghanistan  Force, UN Development Program (UNDP), and UN Assistance Mission in  Afghanistan (UNAMA) staff in Kabul; and UN High Commissioner for  Refugees staff in Kabul and Hirat. Finally, we visited WFP project sites and  warehouses in Kabul and Hirat. The number of sites visited was limited  because of constraints placed on our movement within Afghanistan by the  U.S. Embassy because of security considerations.", "We also examined cost data provided by USDA and USAID. The data  included commodity costs; total ocean freight charges; inland freight;  internal transport, storage, and handling charges; and administrative  support costs. We used the data to calculate two additional expenses, per  USDA statements about the composition of costs and additional costs that  are not stated on the data sheets. First, the \"freight forwarder\" fees  represent 2.5 percent of the total cost of ocean freight. Thus, ocean freight  charges were divided between freight forwarder fees (total freight minus  total freight divided by 1.025) and actual freight costs (total freight minus  freight forwarder fees). This was true for both USDA and USAID  assistance. In the final analysis, the freight forwarder fee was included in  the ocean freight cost because it is an expense that would not have been  incurred if ocean shipping had not been used. Second, with each donation  to WFP, USDA provides an administrative support grant at the rate of 7.5  percent of the total value of the donated commodities. We calculated these  data accordingly.", "We checked all USAID and USDA data for validity, where possible to the  level of individual shipment. We cross-checked USAID data with USDA  data. (USAID typically provided only estimated costs for commodities for  the period 1999\u20132002. Because USDA conducts almost all commodity  purchases for USAID, USAID estimates the commodity costs at the time it  places its order with USDA, based on the current market cost. However,  because USDA provided actual costs for USAID purchases in 1999, 2000,  and 2001, the USAID commodity costs we cited for 2002 are based on  USAID's estimate.) We then compared the cost of the U.S.-purchased  commodities with the cost of commodities purchased in the Central Asia  region to determine whether any savings could have been realized by  purchasing commodities regionally versus buying U.S. commodities.  Finally, using the level of rations that WFP provides to returning refugees,  12.5 kilograms per month, we calculated the amount of food assistance that  the United States could have purchased and the number of people that  could have received food assistance if it had purchased commodities in the  Central Asia region.", "Further, we examined the costs associated with the Department of  Defense\u2019s Afghan humanitarian daily ration program, implemented from  October 2001 through December 2001. Using the level of rations that WFP  provides to returning refugees, 12.5 kilograms per month, we calculated the  amount of food assistance that the United States could have purchased and  the number of people that could have received food assistance if it had  purchased commodities in the Central Asia region.", "In addition, we reviewed relevant food assistance legislation including the  Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (P.L. 83-480) to  determine whether provisions in the law allowed the U.S. government to  purchase commodities outside the United States or provide cash transfers  to assistance agencies for the provision of commodities from sources other  than U.S. suppliers.", "To assess U.S. and international agricultural assistance, coordination,  strategies, and funding intended to help Afghanistan maintain stability and  achieve long-term food security, we reviewed documentation provided by  FAO, UNDP, and UNAMA; the World Bank; the Asian Development Bank;  USAID; and the Afghan Ministries of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry,  and Irrigation and Water Resources. We reviewed information pertaining to  past and current coordination mechanisms in the Afghan government\u2019s  National Development Framework and National Development Budget. We  examined the structure and content of the assistance strategies published  by FAO, UNDP, UNAMA, the European Commission, the World Bank, Asian  Development Bank, and USAID, and we examined the proposed funding  levels contained in each strategy. Using the criteria contained in the U.S.  Government Performance and Results Act, we examined the strategies to  determine whether each contained the basic elements of an operational  strategy articulated in the act. Further, we examined the overall assistance  funding requirements contained in the January 2002 UNDP, World Bank,  and Asian Development Bank Comprehensive Needs Assessment, which  served as a guideline for international donor contributions for Afghanistan.  We interpolated the funding projection data to construct annual aid flows,  so that the cumulative totals were equal to those contained in the  assessment.

We agree with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that the  cargo preference requirement adds additional cost to food assistance  and should be waived in specific situations, and we have adjusted the  matter for congressional consideration to reflect this. As stated in the  report, 19.6 percent of total food assistance costs in fiscal year 2002  were for ocean freight. These costs were incurred because of the  requirement that assistance commodities must be purchased in the  United States, and 75 percent of the purchased commodities by weight  must be shipped on U.S.-flagged carriers. In previous reports, we  analyzed the costs of cargo preference requirements on food assistance  and demonstrated the negative impact of these costs on U.S. food aid  programs. it had used the savings realized through the purchase of regional  commodities versus U.S. commodities to procure additional  commodities. Further, WFP has commodity quality control standards  and would not purchase commodities with donor funds that were  objectionable to the donor providing the funds. Finally, much of the  wheat that was purchased in the United States was shipped in bulk to  ports in Pakistan where it was bagged for final distribution in bags  clearly marked \u201cUSA.\u201d Wheat purchased regionally with U.S. funds was  packaged in Pakistan in the same type of bags. Thus, any regional  purchases could be packaged in appropriately marked bags in the  country of origin or at a bagging facility in a transit country. WFP uses  this practice in other regions, such as southern Africa. 6. WFP made regional purchases during late 2001, but it also made  regional purchases during 2002. As stated in the report, the amount of  food available for food assistance in 2003 is less than in 2002, while the  need for food aid continues to grow around the world, most notably in  southern Africa. In addition, even if the U.S. grain infrastructure system  is able to respond to ongoing demands for food aid, purchasing U.S.  origin commodities and shipping the commodities via expensive ocean  freight is not the most cost effective or quickest means either of  supplying food to hungry people or of achieving U.S. national security  and foreign policy objectives, such as stability in Afghanistan. 7.
