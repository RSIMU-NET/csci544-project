According to DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program , DOD should apply risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and loss of mission capability or resources. The instruction also requires all DOD components to establish procedures to ensure that risk-acceptance decisions were documented, archived, and reevaluated on a recurring basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of exposure patterns, duration, and rates.", "While DOD has guidance that applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits, according to DOD officials.", "According to DOD officials, DOD's ability to assess these risks was limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as required by its own guidance. Given the potential use of burn pits near installations and during future contingency operations, establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to collect data that could help assess exposure to risks.", "GAO recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1) take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures; and (2) in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health-related issues. DOD concurred with the first recommendation and partially concurred with the second. In a May 2018 status update regarding these recommendations, DOD outlined a series of steps it had implemented as well as steps that it intends to implement. The department believes these efforts will further enhance its ability to better monitor burn-pit emissions and examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure and potential long-term health related issues. GAO believes the steps DOD is taking are appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made two recommendations focused on improving monitoring of burn pit emissions and examining any associated health effects related to burn pit exposure.

Since the  initiation of military operations in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003,  the Department of Defense (DOD) has employed several methods to  dispose of the waste that U.S. forces have generated in both countries. In  general, the methods employed have been left to the discretion of base  commanders and include the use of incinerators, landfills, and open-air  burn pits on or near military bases. According to DOD officials, when  making these decisions base commanders may take into consideration a  number of factors, including the local security situation, the number of  personnel on the installation, and the amount and type of waste  generated by those personnel. As one of the options available, burn pits  help base commanders manage waste, but they also produce smoke and  harmful emissions that military and other health professionals believe  may result in acute and chronic health effects for those exposed to the  emissions.", "My statement today focuses on the extent to which DOD has assessed  any health risks of burn pit use. This statement is based on our  September 2016 report. That work was conducted in response to section  313 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015).  Specifically, we assessed the methodology DOD used in conducting a  review of the compliance of the military departments and combatant  commands with DOD Instruction 4715.19, Use of Open-Air Burn Pits in  Contingency Operations, and the adequacy of the subsequent report  DOD sent to the defense committees containing the results of its review.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has assessed any health effects of  burn pit use, we reviewed relevant health assessments on the effects of  burn pits, including a 2011 report by the Institute of Medicine that was  contracted by the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as prior related  reports by GAO and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction. We also interviewed officials from U.S. Central Command  (CENTCOM), U.S. Army Central Command, U.S. Air Force Central  Command, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Institute of Medicine to  discuss any effects of exposures to burn pit emissions, among other  things. Additionally, we obtained an update from DOD in May 2018 on  actions taken regarding our findings and recommendations from our  September 2016 report.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Burn pits\u2014shallow excavations or surface features with berms used to  conduct open-air burning\u2014were often chosen as a method of waste  disposal during recent contingency operations in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility, which extends from the Middle East to Central Asia and  includes Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2010, we reported that there were 251  active burns pits in Afghanistan and 22 in Iraq. However, in 2016, we  reported that the use of burn pits in the CENTCOM area of responsibility  had declined since that time. As of June 2016, DOD officials told us that  there were no military-operated burn pits in Afghanistan and only one in  Iraq. According to DOD officials, the decline in the number of burn pits  from 2010 to 2016 could be attributed to such factors as (1) using  contractors for waste disposal and (2) increased use of waste  management alternatives such as landfills and incinerators. However,  DOD officials acknowledged that burn pits were being used to dispose of  waste in other locations that are not military-operated. Specifically, these  officials noted instances in which local contractors had been contracted to  haul away waste and subsequently disposed of the waste in a burn pit  located in close proximity to the installation. In such instances, officials  stated that they requested that the contractors relocate the burn pit.  According to a DOD official, as of May 2018 there are two active burn pits  in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.", "Although burn pits help base commanders to manage waste, they also  produce smoke and emissions that military and other health professionals  believe may result in acute and chronic health effects for those exposed.  We previously reported that some veterans returning from the Iraq and  Afghanistan conflicts have reported pulmonary and respiratory ailments,  among other health concerns, that they attributed to burn pit emissions.  Numerous veterans have also filed lawsuits against a DOD contractor  alleging that the contractor mismanaged burn pit operations at several  installations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting in exposure to harmful  smoke that caused these adverse health effects. We also previously  reported on the difficulty of establishing a correlation between  occupational and environmental exposures and health issues. For  example, in 2012 we reported that establishing causation between an  exposure and an adverse health condition can be difficult for several  reasons, including that for many environmental exposures, there is a  latency period\u2014the time period between initial exposure to a contaminant  and the date on which an adverse health condition is diagnosed. When  there is a long latency period between an environmental exposure and an  adverse health condition, choosing between multiple causes of exposure  may be difficult. In addition, in 2015 we reported that the Army had  recently published a study that evaluated associations between  deployment to Iraq and Kuwait and the development of respiratory  conditions post-deployment. However, the study was unable to identify a  causal link between exposures to burn pits and respiratory conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Had Not Fully Assessed the Health Risks of Burn Pits", "paragraphs": ["In our 2016 report, we found that the effects from exposing individuals to  burn pit emissions were not well understood, and DOD had not fully  assessed these health risks. Under DOD Instruction 6055.01, DOD  Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program, it is DOD policy to apply  risk-management strategies to eliminate occupational injury or illness and  loss of mission capability or resources. DOD Instruction 6055.01 also  instructs all DOD components to establish procedures to ensure that risk- acceptance decisions were documented, archived, and reevaluated on a  recurring basis. Furthermore, DOD Instruction 6055.05, Occupational  and Environmental Health (OEH), requires that hazards be identified and  risk evaluated as early as possible, including the consideration of  exposure patterns, duration, and rates. Notwithstanding this guidance,  which applies to burn pit emissions among other health hazards, DOD  had not fully assessed the health risks of use of burn pits according to  DOD officials.", "According to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s ability to assess these risks was  limited by a lack of adequate information on (1) the levels of exposure to  burn pit emissions and (2) the health impacts these exposures had on  individuals. With respect to information on exposure levels, DOD had not  collected data from emissions or monitored exposures from burn pits as  required by its own guidance. DOD Instruction 4715.19 requires that  plans for the use of open-air burn pits include ensuring the area was  monitored by qualified force health protection personnel for unacceptable  exposures, and CENTCOM Regulation 200-2, CENTCOM Contingency  Environmental Standards, requires steps to be taken to sample or monitor  burn pit emissions. However, DOD officials stated that there were no  processes in place to specifically monitor burn pit emissions for the  purposes of correlating potential exposures. They attributed this to a lack  of singular exposure to the burn pit emissions, or emissions from any  other individual item; instead, monitoring was done for the totality of air  pollutants from all sources at the point of population exposure. As we  reported in September 2016, given the potential use of burn pits near  installations and their potential use in future contingency operations,  establishing processes to monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable  exposures would better position DOD and combatant commanders to  collect data that could help assess exposure to risks.", "In the absence of the collection of data to examine the effects of burn pit  exposure on servicemembers, the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2014  created the airborne hazards and open-air burn pit registry, which  allows eligible individuals to self-report exposures to airborne hazards  (such as smoke from burn pits, oil-well fires, or pollution during  deployment), as well as other exposures and health concerns. The  registry helps to monitor health conditions affecting veterans and  servicemembers, and to collect data that would assist in improving  programs to help those with deployment exposure concerns.", "With respect to the information on the health effects from exposure to  burn pit emissions, DOD officials stated that there were short-term effects  from being exposed to toxins from the burning of waste, such as eye  irritation and burning, coughing and throat irritation, breathing difficulties,  and skin itching and rashes. However, the officials also stated that DOD  did not have enough data to confirm whether direct exposure to burn pits  caused long-term health issues. Although DOD and the Department of  Veterans Affairs had commissioned studies to enhance their  understanding of airborne hazards, including burn pit emissions, the then- current lack of data on emissions specific to burn pits limited DOD\u2019s ability  to fully assess potential health impacts on servicemembers and other  base personnel, such as contractors.", "For example, in a 2011 study that was contracted by the Department of  Veterans Affairs, the Institute of Medicine stated that it was unable to  determine whether long-term health effects are likely to result from burn  pit exposure due to inadequate evidence of an association. While the  study did not determine a linkage to long-term health effects, because of  the lack of data, it did not discredit the relationship either. Rather, it  outlined a methodology of how to collect the necessary data to determine  the effects of the exposure. Specifically, the 2011 study outlined the  feasibility and design issues for an epidemiologic study\u2014that is, a study  of the distribution and determinants of diseases and injuries in human  populations\u2014of veterans exposed to burn pit emissions. Further, the  2011 study reported that there were a variety of methods for collecting  exposure information, but the most desirable was to measure exposures  quantitatively at the individual level. Individual exposure measurements  could be obtained through personal monitoring data or biomonitoring.  However, if individual monitoring data were not available, and they rarely  are, individual exposure data might also be estimated from modeling of  exposures, self-reported surveys, interviews, job exposure matrixes, and  environmental monitoring. Further, to determine the incidence of chronic  disease, the study stated that servicemembers must be tracked from their  time of deployment, over many years.", "While the Institute of Medicine outlined a methodology of how to conduct  an epidemiologic study, DOD had not taken steps to conduct this type of  research study, specifically one that focused on the direct, individual  exposure to burn pit emissions and the possible long-term health effects  of such exposure. Instead, some officials commented that there were no  long-term health effects linked to the exposures of burn pits because the  2011 study did not acknowledge any. Conversely, Veterans Affairs  officials stated that a study aimed at establishing health effect linkages  could be enabled by the data in its airborne hazards and open-air burn pit  registry, which collects self-reported information on servicemembers\u2019  deployment location and exposure.", "In response to a mandate contained in section 201 of Public Law 112- 260, the Department of Veterans Affairs entered into an agreement with  the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to  convene a committee to provide recommendations on collecting,  maintaining, and monitoring information through the registry. The  committee assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans  Affairs\u2019 information gathering efforts and provided recommendations for  addressing the future medical needs of the affected groups. The study  was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was a review of the data  collection methods and outcomes, as well as an analysis of the self- reported veteran experience data gathered in the registry. Phase 2 was  focused on the assessment of the effectiveness of the actions taken by  the Department of Veterans Affairs and DOD and provided  recommendations for improving the methods enacted. The committee  released its final report in February 2017. As we reported in September  2016, considering the results of this review as well as the methodology of  the 2011 Institute of Medicine study as part of an examination of the  relationship between direct, individual exposure to burn pit emissions and  long-term health effects could better position DOD to fully assess those  health risks.", "In our September 2016 report we recommended that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics to:  take steps to ensure CENTCOM and other geographic combatant  commands, as appropriate, establish processes to consistently  monitor burn pit emissions for unacceptable exposures; and  in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, specifically  examine the relationship between direct, individual, burn pit exposure  and potential long-term health-related issues. As part of that  examination, consider the results of the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2019s report on the Department of  Veteran Affairs registry and the methodology outlined in the 2011  Institute of Medicine study that suggests the need to evaluate the  health status of service members from their time of deployment over  many years to determine their incidence of chronic disease, with  particular attention to the collection of data at the individual level,  including the means by which that data is obtained.", "DOD concurred with the first recommendation, stating that the  department will ensure that geographic combatant commands establish  and employ processes to consistently monitor burn pit emissions for  unacceptable exposures at the point of exposure and if necessary at  individual sources. In a May 2018 status update regarding this  recommendation, DOD stated that it will be updating applicable  department policy and procedures, its tactics techniques and procedures  manual, and guidance for sampling and analysis plans to improve  monitoring of burn pit emissions and other airborne hazard emissions.  Specifically, DOD stated it will update DOD Instruction 6490.03,  Deployment Health; that the update will provide revised procedures on  deployment health activities required before, during, and after  deployments, including Occupational and Environmental Health Site  Assessments; and that it estimates this will be completed by the 4th  quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, the department stated it will  update its Occupational and Environmental Health Site Assessments  tactics, techniques, and procedures manual and update guidance for  sampling and analysis plans and that the updates will provide revised  tactics, techniques, and procedures that will improve the quality of health  risk assessment. The department expects this to be completed by the 1st  quarter of fiscal year 2019. GAO believes that upon completion of these  actions, DOD will have met the intent of this recommendation.", "With respect to our recommendation to sponsor research, in coordination  with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to specifically examine the  relationship between burn pit exposure and potential health-related  issues, DOD partially concurred, stating that a considerable volume of  research studies had already been completed, were ongoing, or were  planned in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and  other research entities to improve the understanding of burn pit and other  ambient exposures to potential long-term health outcomes and that the  studies, where applicable, consider and incorporate the methodology  outlined in the 2011 Institute of Medicine study. In a May 2018 status  update regarding this recommendation, the department stated that DOD  and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to collaborate with each  other and other entities on research activities that address burn pit and  other airborne exposures, and potential long-term health outcomes.  Specifically, the department cited a DOD/Veterans Affairs Airborne  Hazards Symposium held in May 2017; an update to the Veterans  Affairs/DOD Deployment Health Working Group \"Airborne Hazards Joint  Action Plan\" to be completed by the 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2018; and  the completion of research to examine airborne hazard exposures and  potential health-related issues. GAO believes that to the extent that  continued studies consider and incorporate the methodology outlined the  2011 Institute of Medicine study, where appropriate, DOD will have met  the intent of this recommendation.", "Chairman Dunn, Ranking Member Brownley, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my statement for the record."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["If you or your staff have any questions about this statement, please  contact Cary Russell, Director, Defense Capabilities and Management, at  202-512-5431 or russellc@gao.gov.
