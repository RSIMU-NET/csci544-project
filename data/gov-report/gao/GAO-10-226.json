FDA's employees in mission-critical occupations received the greatest number of 3R incentives from 2007 to 2009. However, without an updated strategic workforce plan or established agencywide indicators for tracking its use of 3R incentives, FDA cannot assess the impact that these incentives have on its overall human capital strategy. While FDA collects data on workforce indicators at the agency and center levels, it has not analyzed how 3R incentives are helping the agency achieve its recruitment and retention goals. On the basis of GAO's review of a stratified sample of FDA's 3R incentive files awarded from January 2007 through October 2008, GAO found that FDA maintained documentation which provided sufficient explanation to justify each award. However, several of the incentive files we reviewed lacked adherence to certain other requirements, such as prescribed contents of a service agreement, which in most instances may have resulted from a lack of documentation. To help ensure the proper awarding of 3R incentives, FDA has various internal controls in place, such as a centralized review and approval process for incentive requests. Over the past 3 years, FDA has made some changes to its internal controls, such as updating its guidance including the standard forms for 3R incentive requests. If effectively implemented, FDA's revisions to its internal controls may help ensure that in the future 3R incentives are properly awarded and documentation exists to support the incentives. While both OPM and HHS provide oversight of 3R incentives through various mechanisms, including guidance and periodic evaluations and accountability reviews, there are opportunities for improvement. As a next step, OPM could provide guidance to all agencies on the importance of considering succession planning in the decision process for awarding retention incentives. While HHS's 3R incentive policy generally addressed the requirements for 3R incentive plans as outlined in OPM's regulations, there were several instances where the policy omitted or did not clearly address certain important requirements, such as the conditions for terminating or reducing an incentive."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), has had difficulties carrying out its  expanding mission in part because of challenges in obtaining the  workforce needed to support its increased responsibilities.

Although these are positive steps, FDA  still faces workforce challenges. For example, about 70 percent of FDA\u2019s  career employees onboard as of fiscal year 2008 will be eligible to retire by  the end of fiscal year 2014, which may lead to gaps in institutional  knowledge at all levels.

In May 2009, the U.S. Office  of Personnel Management (OPM) asked agencies to review their 3R  incentive programs to ensure that current and future incentives are used  only when necessary to support their mission and program needs, and are  consistent with the criteria in law and regulations. As a next step, in July  2009, OPM directed agencies to review and certify that 3R incentive plans  and internal approval and monitoring procedures were consistent with  regulations.", "In the last few years, FDA\u2019s use of retention incentives has come under  greater congressional scrutiny.

We randomly  selected files for review from the 2007 and 2008 retention incentives and  2008 recruitment incentives. For the 2007 and 2008 relocation incentives  and 2007 recruitment incentives, we reviewed all of the files due to the  small population size. For the randomly selected files, we weighted each  incentive file so that our sample statistically represented the population. In  addition, we analyzed data provided by HHS on FDA\u2019s and the  department\u2019s use of 3R incentives for calendar years 2007 to 2009 (as of  July 4) along various categories including type of incentive, pay plan,  occupational series, and duty station; analyzed FDA data from OPM\u2019s  Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) for fiscal year 2008 to identify trends  in FDA\u2019s workforce, such as retirement eligibility by occupational series  for career permanent employees; analyzed HHS\u2019s 3R incentive policy to  determine consistency with OPM\u2019s regulatory requirements; and  interviewed HHS, FDA, and OPM senior officials knowledgeable about 3R  incentives. We checked the 3R incentive data provided by HHS for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness. We interviewed selected HHS officials  knowledgeable about the data, and brought to the attention of these  officials any concerns or discrepancies we found with the data for  correcting or updating and further clarification.

According to OPM, the intent of 3R incentives is to provide  agencies with discretionary authority to use nonbase compensation to  help recruit, relocate, and retain employees in difficult staffing situations.  On the basis of OPM\u2019s regulations for 3R incentives, employees eligible to  receive these incentives include the following positions: General Schedule  (GS), senior-level, scientific or professional, Senior Executive Service  (SES), law enforcement, Executive Schedule or those whose pay is set at a  rate equal to a rate for the Executive Schedule, prevailing rate positions  (employment in a recognized trade or manual labor occupation), and  employees in a category approved by OPM at the request of the head of an  agency. The regulations also prohibit certain employees from receiving 3R  incentives including those who are in positions that are appointed by the  President with or without Senate confirmation, noncareer SES members,  agency heads or those expected to receive an appointment as an agency  head, and employees in positions excepted from the competitive service  by reason of their confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or  policy-advocating duties (i.e., Schedule C employees).", "At FDA, certain physicians and dentists appointed under title 38 of the  United States Code and Senior Biomedical Research Service employees  appointed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 237 are also eligible for 3R incentives. FDA  employees appointed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 209(f) and 209(g) are not  eligible to receive 3R incentives under the authority contained in title 5 of  the United States Code. According to an HHS official, FDA\u2019s authority to  award incentive payments to these employees is derived from the  appointment provisions themselves. Beginning in 2007, FDA began  phasing out the use of retention incentives for employees paid under titles  38 and 42. (See app. II for additional details on employee eligibility.)", "The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 first authorized  OPM to allow federal agencies to give 3R incentives to employees under  the following circumstances.", "A recruitment incentive could be given to a new employee in a federal  position and a relocation incentive to a current employee who had to  move to accept a different federal position if it was determined that the  agency would be likely to encounter difficulty filling the position in the  absence of such an incentive.", "A retention incentive could be given to a current employee if the unusually  high or unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the  agency made retaining that employee essential, and it was determined that  the employee would be likely to leave federal service without the  incentive.", "The Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004 revised prior 3R incentive  authorities with the goal of increasing agencies\u2019 flexibility in using 3R  incentives. We and OPM had reported that 3R incentives were effective  human capital management tools, but agencies were failing to use them  extensively due to a variety of factors including limited funds and reduced  hiring due to downsizing. The 2004 act increased the number of situations  in which agencies may give 3R incentives; allowed for alternative methods  of payments, such as installments or lump sum; and increased the  potential size of the incentives. For example, individual retention  incentives that were capped at 25 percent of the employee\u2019s basic pay rate  could be increased to up to 50 percent in cases of critical agency need  with OPM\u2019s approval. The act also required OPM to annually report to  Congress to ensure the incentives were being used effectively. In  December 2007, OPM issued final regulations on 3R incentives reflecting  its technical modifications and corrections to and clarifications of the  interim regulations issued in May 2005. Separately, in November 2007,  OPM issued final regulations implementing an additional authority to  agencies to pay a retention incentive to an employee who would be likely  to leave for a different federal position before the closure or relocation of  the employee\u2019s office, activity, or organization.", "Through its regulations, OPM requires agencies to develop plans for using  3R incentives outlining, among other things, the required documentation  for the justification and any criteria for determining the amount of the  incentive and the length of the service period under a service agreement,  which is a written agreement between the agency and the employee  outlining the terms of the incentive. According to OPM officials, agencies  do not need OPM approval of their 3R incentive plans in order to use these  incentives. HHS has issued a departmentwide 3R incentive plan or policy  that applies to all of its agencies or operating divisions (OPDIV), as HHS  refers to them, including FDA. According to HHS\u2019s Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Human Resources, the OPDIVs are allowed to develop more  stringent internal guidance to supplement HHS\u2019s policy, but they cannot  make their internal processes for awarding 3R incentives more lenient.  Building on HHS\u2019s 3R incentive policy for the department, FDA issues  supplemental guidance and instructions to its employees for awarding 3R  incentives. Applicable to all of its centers and offices, FDA uses standard  forms for requesting recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives with  instructions attached for completing the forms that outline the regulatory  and HHS policy requirements for those types of incentives.

These positions encompass the core scientific base of FDA, and include  occupations such as medical officers, pharmacologists, and consumer  safety officers. According to this official, mission-critical positions have  remained unchanged with the exception of a few positions that have  become more significant as the nature of FDA\u2019s work has evolved, such as  operations research analysts and veterinary medical officers.", "As shown in figure 1, employees in different mission-critical occupations  received different percentages of each type of incentive. Medical officers,  which includes physicians and surgeons, consistently received on average  the greatest number of recruitment incentives of any mission-critical  occupation from 2007 to 2009. Consumer safety officers, which is the  largest mission-critical occupation according to FDA, on average received  the majority of relocation incentives among mission-critical occupations,  while pharmacologists on average ranked first among all mission-critical  occupations that received retention incentives over this time period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Lacks an Updated Strategic Workforce Plan to Document Its Strategies for Achieving Its Recruitment and Retention Goals", "paragraphs": ["FDA is facing potential retirements that could result in a loss of leadership  and institutional knowledge in its mission-critical occupations.

Additionally, about 73 percent of  career pharmacologists and about 68 percent of career medical officers  onboard as of fiscal year 2008 will be eligible for retirement by the end of  2014. Therefore, it is important to ensure that FDA\u2019s 3R incentives are  helping the agency meet its human capital goals. Our previous work has  shown that federal agencies should ensure that the use of human capital  flexibilities including 3R incentives are part of an overall human capital  strategy clearly linked to the mission and program goals of the  organization. Agencies need to plan for how they will use and fund these  flexibilities, what results they expect to achieve, and what methods they  will use to evaluate actual results, such as establishing indicators for  measuring success. Importantly, 3R incentives are just one type of  flexibility available to agencies for recruiting and retaining a quality  workforce. Agencies need to assess and determine which human capital  flexibilities are the most appropriate and effective for managing their  workforces. Furthermore, an updated strategic workforce plan would help  FDA clearly document its strategies for addressing gaps in the number,  skills, competencies, and deployment of its workforce and how human  capital flexibilities, such as 3R incentives, are being used to help achieve  recruitment and retention goals.", "FDA has outlined its goals and approaches for recruiting and retaining the  necessary workforce to meet its mission and program goals in its  succession plan and strategic workforce plan. In its succession plan for  2009-2012, FDA defines succession management as the ongoing  development of potential successors to ensure a smooth transition and  minimum loss of efficiency when management vacancies occur. To help  prepare its current and future leadership, FDA outlines specific succession  planning initiatives in its plan, such as individual development planning  and training that aligns with organizational goals. According to officials at  FDA, succession planning has played a significant role in filling mission- critical occupations at its centers and the plan should help assist FDA with  these efforts. While some of what is described in FDA\u2019s succession plan is  prospective, FDA officials told us that they are partnering with a university  in Florida in an attempt to satisfy the agency\u2019s long-term staffing needs for  a mission-critical occupation. Specifically, they are developing an  undergraduate curriculum for pharmacokineticists intended to help  increase FDA\u2019s recruitment pool for this occupation.", "FDA\u2019s fiscal year 2006 workforce plan provides an overview of past and  projected workforce trends and emphasizes the staffing needs of FDA\u2019s  mission-critical programs. According to the Assistant Commissioner for  Management at FDA, the plan was intended to be a road map for future  hiring strategies across the agency. However, FDA has not updated the  workforce plan since 2006 and targets for its recent hiring surges have not  been included. According to this official, managing FDA leadership  transitions has been a higher priority than strategic workforce planning.  FDA is preparing to begin a workforce planning effort in fiscal year 2010 to  address key agency-level initiatives and provide linkages between the  agency\u2019s use of 3R incentives and broader human capital decisions. Having  an agencywide workforce plan that clearly documents the recruiting and  retention goals and strategies FDA is working to achieve can help to  ensure that the centers are aware of the agency\u2019s goals and strategies and  strategically managing their workforces in a manner that meets the  agency\u2019s needs. Given FDA\u2019s period of leadership transitions, developing  such a workforce plan creates a road map for the agency to use to move  from the current to the future workforce needed to achieve agency goals.", "While not documented in its current workforce plan, FDA has set  recruitment targets for the agency to address the need to hire additional  employees in recent years. Specifically, as part of its hiring surges in fiscal  years 2008 and 2009, FDA set staffing goals that were linked to the agency  achieving its mission and goals. For example, the agency set targets to fill  more than 600 new positions and to backfill over 700 others in fiscal year  2008 to implement new responsibilities as a result of legislation, which it  achieved within the first 6 or 7 months, according to FDA\u2019s Assistant  Commissioner for Management. That was nearly triple the number of  people FDA hired from 2005 to 2007. Similarly in fiscal year 2009, the  agency set a goal to hire 1,600 additional full-time equivalent positions.  According to FDA officials, the agency has exceeded its 2009 hiring goals  by 22 percent and these targets were set within the centers based on their  staffing needs. Further, FDA officials told us one of its recruitment  strategies to increase its Hispanic workforce was to target this population  during its interview job fairs, but this strategy is not documented in its  current workforce plan.", "FDA officials told us that they award 3R incentives where they are needed  most and the type of incentive awarded depends largely on the location.  For example, recruitment is a larger issue in some of FDA\u2019s field locations,  including areas in Montana and in the southwest along the Mexican  border. To address this challenge FDA offers relocation incentives to  employees in its headquarters and field to move to other areas of the  country. Recognizing the challenge of recruitment in its remote field  locations, FDA is looking for additional sources of recruiting, including  state and local governments in these areas.

Agencies need such measurements to help them determine if a  program is worth the investment compared to other available human  capital flexibilities targeted at recruitment and retention of employees,  such as student loan repayment. FDA has not established agencywide  indicators for tracking the progress of 3R incentives in addressing  recruitment and retention needs. While FDA collects data on workforce  indicators at the agency and center levels, it has not analyzed how 3R  incentives are helping the agency achieve its recruitment and retention  goals.", "FDA collects data on agencywide workforce indicators, such as attrition,  retirement, and declination rates, which measure the number of jobs  offered that are declined by potential employees. In addition, FDA\u2019s  centers and offices are responsible for tracking their own workforce data  as well as the effect of 3R incentives on their organizational goals.  Specifically, FDA has asked its centers to provide more detailed attrition  rates over a 2-year period to help support the need for 3R incentives.  Officials stated that FDA has no agencywide exit interview process; rather,  it uses HHS\u2019s quarterly exit survey results. Although some centers track  exit survey results to determine why employees are leaving the agency, the  center data are not necessarily provided to the Office of Management\u2014the  human capital office within FDA\u2014according to the Assistant  Commissioner for Management at FDA. Further, FDA officials stated that  the agency relies on HHS-provided data for tracking the number of  responses to job announcements, and the basis for employee separations,  but FDA does not have access to all of the necessary data in a useful  format to accurately track workforce statistics and the linkage to the use  of 3R incentives.", "Additionally, FDA\u2019s Assistant Commissioner for Management said the  agency does not track the use of 3R incentives to assess the effectiveness  of these payments or how they contribute to FDA\u2019s human capital goals.  For example, FDA does not track statistics on its diversity initiatives or  the impact of 3R incentives on diversity recruiting because there is a lack  of available data. However, FDA officials said they need to document the  agency\u2019s short- and long-term goals for its 3R incentive program and  identify better agencywide indicators to support the need for 3R  incentives. Presently FDA\u2019s guiding principles for awarding 3R incentives  developed in the summer of 2009 are the only documented guidance to  centers on 3R incentives, but the guiding principles do not address how 3R  incentives should be used strategically to help achieve agencywide  recruitment and retention goals.", "Updating its workforce plan to document its recruitment and retention  goals and strategies and include indicators to track the progress of 3R  incentives in achieving these goals will help ensure FDA makes maximum  use of funds to recruit and retain key talent, a critical goal in an era of  fiscal constraints. As we have found in our work on human capital  flexibilities, gauging the 3R incentive program\u2019s direct effect on  recruitment and retention trends may be difficult because a 3R incentive is  not likely to be the only major factor in an employee\u2019s decision to join or  stay with an agency, although the incentive may help to tip the scale in the  agency\u2019s favor.

To  explain the large decrease in the number of retention incentives between  2007 and 2008, FDA officials told us that they have taken a more strategic  approach to awarding retention incentives over the last few years by  elevating the approving authority of retention incentive renewals to the  Commissioner and phasing out the use of retention incentives for certain  employees paid under titles 38 and 42 of the United States Code given  existing compensation flexibilities with those positions. For example, in  2007, FDA employees appointed under title 42, which includes service or  staff fellows and senior science managers, received 15 percent of all  retention incentives FDA awarded and 5 percent of retention incentives  awarded as of July 4, 2009. As a result of its detailed review of its 3R  incentives in 2009, FDA officials said several retention incentives were  eliminated.

All the FDA files we reviewed provided  sufficient explanation to justify the awards, addressing one or more of the  factors for each type of incentive which OPM regulations state must be  considered, as applicable to the case at hand, to support the awarding of  the incentive. These factors are to guide the agency in determining  whether a particular position would be difficult to fill in the absence of a  recruitment or relocation incentive, or whether the unusually high or  unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the agency for  the employee\u2019s services makes it essential to retain the employee and the  employee would be likely to leave the federal service in the absence of a  retention incentive. According to OPM, since the regulations require an  agency to document only those factors that are applicable to the case at  hand, one factor could be sufficient support for authorizing the incentive.

Since that time, FDA has continued to streamline its process,  assign oversight responsibility to its Executive Review Board (ERB), and  issue updated guidance, which it calls guiding principles. FDA\u2019s ERB,  which consists of the Principal Deputy Commissioner who serves as the  chair, the center directors, the Associate Commissioner for Policy, and the  Assistant Commissioner for Management, is responsible for reviewing all  compensation programs and flexibilities including 3R incentives across  the agency and developing guidelines for implementing each program.  Since the time of our file review, FDA undertook a detailed review of its  3R incentive program and as a result of its review, clarified details of  FDA\u2019s process for approving 3R incentives and the role of the ERB. Figure  4 shows the revised review and approval process for 3R incentive requests  that FDA currently follows.", "Beginning in September 2009, FDA\u2019s procedures call for its Office of  Management to certify if a new 3R incentive request addresses FDA\u2019s  guiding principles prior to submitting the incentive request to the ERB for  its review. Further, in an effort to streamline the process, the ERB Chair  may review and recommend some of the incentive requests to the  Commissioner without the full ERB review when the Office of  Management certifies the request. The ERB Chair can request a review by  the full ERB for any incentive request, according to a senior FDA official.  Finally, according to a senior official from the Rockville Human Resources  Center (RHRC), which is responsible for processing FDA\u2019s personnel  actions such as incentive requests, the center adopted the practice of  double checking the incentive file to ensure the documentation in the file,  such as the commencement and termination dates on the service  agreements, are complete after the incentive has been processed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relocation Incentive Files Did Not Consistently Document Employees\u2019 Relocation, but Revisions to the Incentive Form Address These Requirements", "paragraphs": ["OPM regulations for relocation incentives require that in order to receive a  relocation incentive the employee\u2019s work site for the new position must be  50 miles or more from the work site of the position held immediately  before the move, unless the agency waives the 50-mile requirement, and  the employee must establish a new residence to accept the position. We  found that in 3 of 12 of the relocation incentives awarded from 2007  through October 2008, the incentive files did not document that the  employee\u2019s new work site was more than 50 miles from the previous work  site. For example, an individual who received a relocation incentive was  transferring from another federal agency to work at FDA in the  Washington, D.C., area and the file did not document where that previous  agency was located (e.g., Washington, D.C., or another city). In addition, 8  of 12 of the relocation incentives were paid to the employee before or on  the same day that the agency had record of the employee establishing a  residence in the new geographic area. In three of these cases, the  sequence of dates was less than a month different, but in three other cases  it was several months. For the remaining two cases, the first record of the  employee\u2019s residence in HHS\u2019s human capital data system was the date of  the incentive payment. By reviewing the data system and additional  employee records, we found proof that for 11 of the 12 relocation  incentives, the employee eventually established a residence in the new  geographic area. For one incentive the previous address on file was an  Army P.O. box with no city or state included. According to FDA, this  individual was deployed with the military to Europe prior to establishing a  residence in the geographic area for the new position. While the relocation  incentive forms we reviewed did not include these relocation  requirements, in the fall of 2008, FDA recognized the need to more clearly  document these relocation requirements and revised its recruitment or  relocation incentive form to include check boxes addressing these  requirements.", "In response to our finding on the dates of relocation, senior officials from  FDA and RHRC acknowledged that there is no formal process to  document that the new work site is greater than 50 miles from the  previous work site or that the individual has established a residence in the  new geographic area before the incentive is awarded. Rather, the RHRC  official said they check these requirements through more informal  means\u2014conversations with the employee, reviewing the resume, and  knowledge of where the person is coming from, which in some cases, is  such a great distance from the new duty station that it is common  knowledge that the new work site is greater than 50 miles from the  previous work site and the individual has established a residence in the  new geographic area. According to FDA, the centers are to verify the  change of residence before submitting the incentive request for payment  processing to RHRC by checking that a personnel action for an address  change to the new duty station has been submitted. As a next step, the  centers are to check in the data system that the address has been changed.  In addition, FDA and RHRC officials said there may be a delay in RHRC\u2019s  processing of the change of address from the time the employee submits  the request, which may account for the sequence of dates.", "As another explanation for the difference in dates, a senior FDA official  explained that employees who have received the incentive are permitted  to stay in temporary housing after receiving the incentive before they  officially establish a new residence and change their residence with the  agency. OPM officials stated that the regulations do not define \u201cresidence\u201d  for this purpose and since relocation incentives may be paid for temporary  work site changes, it is not necessary for an employee to move his or her  permanent residence to qualify for a relocation incentive; establishing  temporary housing is acceptable. FDA and RHRC officials noted that in  some of the older files we reviewed there was no place to document that  an employee had established a new residence or relocated a distance  greater than 50 miles, as the current incentive form now allows."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Agreements Failed to Include Elements Required in Statute and OPM Regulations, but Revised Guidance May Lead to Some Improvement", "paragraphs": ["The service agreements frequently failed to include contents prescribed by  statute and OPM regulations. Consistent with the statute and regulations,  FDA requires service agreements for recruitment and relocation  incentives, but does not use service agreements for retention incentives.  In some areas, we observed appropriate documentation of the prescribed  contents in the service agreement, such as the total amount of the  incentive and length of the service period, but other areas were lacking,  such as the method of paying the incentive and timing and amounts of  each incentive payment. Not including the prescribed contents of the  service agreement may affect FDA\u2019s ability to recover funds should the  agency terminate or reduce an incentive. For an employee who leaves the  position prior to completing the service period for the incentive, FDA uses  information in the service agreement to determine the prorated amount of  the incentive payment that needs to be collected from the former  employee. Since the time of our file review, FDA has updated its guidance  and recruitment or relocation incentive form including the service  agreement section, which if effectively implemented may help prevent  future problems associated with deficient service agreements.", "We estimate that all of the recruitment incentive files and 11 of 12 of the  relocation incentive files awarded from 2007 through October 2008  documented a permitted total incentive amount in the service  agreement\u2014the maximum amount is 25 percent of base pay\u2014with the  exception of the 1 relocation incentive file that lacked a service  agreement, but documented an appropriate total incentive amount  elsewhere in the file. While considering the criteria in HHS\u2019s 3R incentive  policy, FDA has established guidelines for determining the amounts of the  3R incentives. Specifically, during the time of our file review, recruitment  and relocation incentives were to be between 10 and 15 percent of base  pay.", "The service period, which is a specified period of employment with the  agency the employee agrees to complete in exchange for payment of the  incentive, may not exceed 4 years for recruitment and relocation  incentives with a minimum of 6 months for recruitment incentives. With  the exception of one relocation incentive file which lacked a service  agreement, all the recruitment and relocation incentive files documented a  permitted length of service in the service agreement length field. FDA  sets guidelines for determining the length of the service period for  recruitment and relocation incentives. According to a senior FDA official,  FDA has traditionally used 12 months as the length, but in early 2008, as  FDA began hiring a large number of employees, it started requiring a  length of 18 months. If FDA authorized multiple incentives to an employee,  e.g., student loan repayment in addition to a recruitment incentive, it  required a 24-month service period and in some cases where FDA  approved a higher percentage for the incentive amount, it required a 36- month service period.", "Further, the service agreement for recruitment and relocation incentives  must specify the method of paying the incentive, and the timing and  amounts of each incentive payment (i.e., a lump sum at the beginning or  end of the service period, installments throughout the service period, or a  combination). We estimate that 12 percent of the recruitment incentives,  and 1 of 12 of the relocation incentives awarded from 2007 to October  2008, included how the incentive was to be paid\u2014a lump sum payment\u2014 and the amount. None of the recruitment and relocation incentives  included when the incentive would be paid\u2014at the beginning of the  service period\u2014in the service agreements. According to a senior FDA  official, FDA has traditionally paid recruitment and relocation incentives  as lump sum payments at the beginning of the service period because it is  most attractive to prospective employees at recruitment fairs or interviews  and it places less burden on FDA to maintain records and monitor  payments than biweekly or quarterly payments. According to this official,  FDA has previously explored providing managers with other payment  options and managers overwhelmingly responded that this payment  method was most effective. The service agreement section of FDA\u2019s  current recruitment or relocation incentive form now states that the  payment is to be made as a lump sum, but does not specify the timing of  the payment.", "FDA\u2019s service agreements for recruitment and relocation incentives also  included fields for the commencement and termination dates of the  service period as required. We estimate that about 25 percent of  recruitment incentive files, and 1 of 12 of the relocation incentive files  during the time of our file review, included both commencement and  termination dates. A senior FDA official explained that once the  Commissioner approves the award, the Office of Management sends the  incentive file to RHRC, which is responsible for processing the incentives.  During the processing of the award, the dates of the service period are  finalized and according to this FDA official, RHRC officials must fill in the  dates once they determine the official effective date of the incentive. A  senior RHRC official noted that there previously has been no system to  add these dates, so this step was often missed. As discussed earlier,  according to this official, in the fall of 2009, RHRC adopted the practice of  double checking the incentives to ensure the documentation in the file,  such as the commencement and termination dates on the service  agreements, are complete after the incentive has been processed.", "OPM officials responsible for administering the governmentwide 3R  incentive program commented that while not necessarily invalidating the  incentive, these missing elements in the service agreements are potentially  significant omissions and a lack of documentation may lead to problems in  paying the incentives. For example, the timing and amount of each  incentive payment needs to be documented in the service agreement for  disbursement purposes and to ensure that the employee and agency  concur about the payment schedule. Without this information, the agency  may have a difficult time supporting its case if the employee questions  payments, and the payment schedule is not documented in the file. OPM  officials said that the agency has a general responsibility to ensure all  requirements of the incentive are clearly laid out in the incentive file and  communicated to the employee. The officials added that it was important  that the commencement and termination dates of the service period be  documented because FDA may be hindered in exercising proper oversight.  Without the dates, it could be difficult for the agency to recover incorrect  payments or establish that an employee has left the position prior to  completing the service period outlined in the service agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Could Further Improve Its Guidance for 3R Incentives", "paragraphs": ["While FDA revised its guidance since the time of our file review, FDA has  not addressed several areas specified in the regulations in its guidance for  retention incentives.

A senior FDA official said it has  been a long-standing practice in HHS to give retention incentive payments  in biweekly installments and acknowledged that the guidance should be  updated to reflect this practice.

OPM supports succession planning as a vital tool for  maintaining a highly-skilled workforce and, according to OPM, succession  planning may help an agency reduce its need more quickly for an  employee\u2019s services to a level that makes it unnecessary to continue  paying the retention incentive and allows the agency to terminate it.  However, through its regulations and guidance, OPM does not require  agencies to consider succession planning as part of the decision and  documentation process for awarding a retention incentive. The regulations  allow agencies to award retention incentives to employees, including  those who are eligible to retire and are likely to leave federal service in the  absence of receiving an incentive.

However, HHS\u2019s policy incorrectly refers to a  condition for reducing or terminating a retention incentive authorization  as a discretionary (may) condition, when it should be documented as a  mandatory (must) condition.

OPM\u2019s call  to agencies to review their 3R incentive programs has raised awareness  about the importance of ensuring that current and future incentives are  used only when necessary to support agency mission and program needs.  FDA, OPM, and HHS have an opportunity to make further improvements  to internal controls and oversight of 3R incentives. FDA lacks an updated  strategic workforce plan that would help it determine how its use of 3R  incentives is contributing to its human capital goals. Despite positive  enhancements over the past 3 years, FDA\u2019s internal controls have  weaknesses related to requesting, approving, and processing 3R incentive  requests. Strong internal controls help provide assurance that 3R  incentives are used efficiently and effectively.", "As for oversight, OPM requiring all federal agencies to incorporate  succession planning in the decision process for awarding retention  incentives would help to ensure that agencies consider other effective  means to acquire and retain talent. Clearly incorporating important  requirements into HHS\u2019s 3R incentive policy will help to ensure that  managers and OPDIVs are using 3R incentives consistent with the law and  regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better align the use of 3R incentives with the agency\u2019s human capital  goals, we recommend that the Commissioner of FDA update FDA\u2019s  strategic workforce plan to document the agency\u2019s recruitment and  retention goals and strategies and as part of that update, identify  indicators to better track the progress of 3R incentives over time in  addressing the agency\u2019s recruitment and retention goals.", "As FDA implements the results of its 2009 review of 3R incentives, we  recommend that the Commissioner of FDA continue to strengthen FDA\u2019s  internal controls for requesting, approving, and processing 3R incentives  by taking the following two actions:    update the guidance for awarding 3R incentives to include the payment  method used for retention incentives and all the conditions for terminating  a retention incentive when no service agreement is required, and    ensure 3R incentive files are properly completed and reviewed to address  policy and regulatory requirements before the employees receive the  incentive payments.", "As OPM implements the results of its governmentwide 3R incentive  review, we recommend that the Director of OPM require agencies to  incorporate succession planning efforts into the decision process for  awarding retention incentives and document this requirement for  succession planning in their 3R incentive plans.", "To ensure the department and OPDIVs are aware of HHS\u2019s policy in all  areas of 3R incentives and use these incentives consistent with law and  OPM regulations, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS revise HHS\u2019s  3R incentive policy to ensure that the guidance provided clearly addresses  certain important requirements outlined in the regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of the draft report to the Secretary of HHS and  Director of OPM for their review and comment.

FDA stated that it will continue to review its 3R  incentives to ensure that their use is consistent with the agency\u2019s guidance  for the use of 3R incentives. In response to its recommendation, HHS  acknowledged the need to revise its 3R incentive policy and stated that it  is in the process of reviewing and making the appropriate changes.

OPM  agreed with our recommendation and stated that it will develop future  guidance on the importance of considering succession planning in the  decision process for awarding retention incentive. OPM stated that it is  working with agencies to review the 3R incentive program and its current  regulations, guidance, and monitoring policies to identify areas where  improvements can be made, such as developing and using metrics to  monitor and evaluate 3R incentive usage.

To describe  FDA\u2019s use of 3R incentives and draw a comparison to the rest of HHS, we  analyzed and compared the data on FDA and the rest of HHS to determine  the number of each type of 3R incentive provided to employees and the  aggregate distributions across various categories including duty location,  pay plan, and occupational series by calendar year. Using the HHS pay  data, we calculated the percentage of FDA and HHS total numbers of 3R  incentives and total expenditures on these incentives, the mission-critical  occupational series\u2019 percentage of FDA\u2019s total number of 3R incentives  with mission-critical occupations as defined by FDA, the average  distribution of FDA 3R incentives by top occupational series, and the  distribution of FDA 3R incentives by pay plan.", "To compare the use of 3R incentives in FDA with trends in its workforce,  using data from CPDF, we calculated FDA retirement eligibility by  occupational series for career permanent employees, and FDA\u2019s  percentage of HHS\u2019s total workforce. As a point of comparison on the  governmentwide use of 3R incentives, we reviewed OPM\u2019s Recruitment,  Relocation, and Retention Incentives Calendar Year 2007: Report to the  Congress, issued in September 2008, and identified the total dollar amount  spent on 3R incentives in 2007. We checked the HHS data for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness. We conducted interviews with selected HHS  officials knowledgeable about the data, and brought to the attention of  these officials any concerns or discrepancies we found with the data for  correcting or updating and further clarification. On the basis of these  procedures, we believe the data provided by HHS are sufficiently reliable  for use in the analyses presented in this report. In addition, we believe the  CPDF is sufficiently reliable for the informational purpose of this report.", "To identify linkage with the use of 3R incentives and FDA\u2019s human capital  documents, we analyzed FDA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2006 Workforce Plan\u2014the  most recent workforce plan available\u2014and FDA\u2019s Succession Plan 2009- 2012. We also conducted interviews with FDA officials about the trends  we identified in the 3R incentives pay data, FDA\u2019s strategic human capital  approaches and how the use of 3R incentives fits into broader human  capital decisions at the agencywide and center-specific levels, and how the  agency tracks the use of 3R incentives to assess the effectiveness of these  payments and how they contribute to FDA\u2019s broader human capital goals.", "To address our second objective, we identified all elements that are  required to be included in documenting the awarding of an incentive. We  analyzed applicable provisions of title 5 of the United States Code, OPM  regulations, HHS policy, and FDA guidance, and interviewed HHS, FDA,  and OPM officials to create a data collection instrument identifying the  applicable requirements. We used this data collection instrument to  analyze a sample of 3R incentives awarded by FDA in 2007 and 2008 in  order to determine the extent to which documentation elements required  for the awarding of 3R incentives were present.", "To review the FDA 3R incentive files, we took a stratified sample. We  looked at new incentives for three categories of incentive files\u2014  recruitment, relocation, and retention\u2014from 2007 and 2008. There were  2,056 incentive actions in this population from January 1, 2007, to October  31, 2008. We randomly selected files for review from each set, or stratum,  of incentive actions for each category and year, except for three strata  where we reviewed all of the files due to the small population size. Our  sample size was 107 files, with the number of selected files per stratum  shown in table 2.", "Subsequent analysis of the 107 files showed that 2 of the files were not in  the scope for this review, leaving us with a random sample of 105 files. We  applied our data collection instrument to the random sample of 105 files to  determine whether each file contained all the elements that needed to be  documented in the awarding of a 3R incentive. Each incentive file was  weighted so that our random sample statistically represented the  population in each stratum.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample of 3R incentive files was only one of a large number of samples  that we might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided  different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results in 95 percent confidence intervals. These are  intervals that would contain the actual population values for 95 percent of  the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population. All percentage estimates from the 3R  incentive file review have margins of error at the 95 percent confidence  level of plus or minus 10 percentage points or less, unless otherwise noted.", "The practical difficulties of utilizing any data collection instrument may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the  data are entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce unwanted  variability into the results. We took steps in the development of the  instrument, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these  nonsampling errors, including providing detailed instructions of the data  collection instrument. In addition, we had a second independent reviewer  for the data analysis to further minimize such errors.", "We interviewed OPM officials to help understand OPM\u2019s policy on  oversight of 3R incentives and the regulations, their interpretation of  HHS\u2019s policy and FDA\u2019s guidance on 3R incentives, and how the results of  the file review were viewed in this context. We did not ask OPM to review  HHS\u2019s policy or FDA\u2019s guidance on 3R incentives as part of our review.
