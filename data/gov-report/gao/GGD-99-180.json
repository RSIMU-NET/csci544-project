In reviewing BHC merger applications, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has a statutory responsibility, established by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), to take into account an institution\u2019s record of community credit performance when evaluating the application. In addition, the BHC Act requires that FRB take into account the convenience and needs of the community to be served when reviewing BHC merger applications.", "As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to analyze (1) FRB\u2019s legal responsibilities in assessing BHC mergers for CRA performance; (2) FRB\u2019s process for assessing the CRA performance of six large BHC merger applicants, including how FRB addressed the principal public concerns related to the CRA performance; and (3) the premerger and postmerger mortgage lending in LMI and minority communities for three large BHC mergers.  To meet the first two objectives, we focused on six of the largest bank mergers in the period of 1995-98."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company must obtain FRB\u2019s approval before merging with or acquiring another bank holding company. In reviewing an application filed by a bank holding company, FRB is required to consider several factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the applicant, the future prospects of both the applicant and the bank holding company that is to be acquired, the competitive effects of the merger, and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. Even before CRA was enacted, FRB\u2019s regulations called for public comments in connection with the merger applications pursuant to the BHC Act obligation of FRB to ensure that the merger would meet the convenience and needs of the local community.  The Board of Governors has the authority to delegate its application authority to the Reserve Banks if the application fits certain criteria.  However, an application may raise several issues that might require Board Action under such factors as the financial, managerial, and convenience and needs of the community, including the CRA performance of the applicant.", "FRB approved the six BHC mergers in our study.  With the exception of NBD\u2019s acquisition of First Chicago and Bank One\u2019s acquisition of NBD First Chicago, the lead bank subsidiaries also took actions to merge their operations.  Bank subsidiaries are also required to receive approval from their primary regulators for such combinations.  For three BHC mergers, the lead bank subsidiaries of the merging BHCs submitted their applications to their primary regulators after FRB approved their BHC applications.", "CRA requires all federal bank and thrift regulators\u2014FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\u2014to encourage depository institutions under their jurisdiction to help meet the credit needs in all areas of the community that the institution is chartered to serve, consistent with safe and sound operations.  CRA requires that the appropriate federal supervisory authority (1) assess the institution\u2019s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI areas, and (2) take that record into account in its evaluation of bank expansion applications.  Such applications include those to establish or relocate a branch or home office and applications for mergers, consolidations, or the purchase of assets or assumption of liabilities of a regulated financial institution.  Assessment areas, also called delineated areas, represent the communities for which the regulators are to assess an institution\u2019s record of CRA performance.  CRA also requires the regulators to periodically assess an institution\u2019s community lending performance during examinations.  Only insured banks and thrifts are subject to the provisions of CRA.  On the basis of the findings of the examination, depository institutions are assigned a rating\u2014that is, outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance.  Nonbank financial institutions, such as mortgage companies, are not subject to CRA provisions.", "Unlike certain other banking laws, CRA does not provide regulators with the authority to take enforcement action on the basis of findings of noncompliance resulting from the examination process.  The CRA application evaluation process is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing the statute.  Regulations proposed in 1993 and 1994 by the regulators included a new set of sanctions to enforce CRA.  According to the proposed regulations, a poor CRA rating would have been considered a violation of a bank\u2019s affirmative obligation to meet the credit needs of its entire community.  A bank that received a CRA rating of substantial noncompliance would have been subject to enforcement actions authorized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  In a letter to OCC dated December 15, 1994, the Department of Justice (Justice) concluded that the agencies lack legal authority to use cease and desist orders and civil money penalties to combat noncompliance with CRA.  The final regulations did not contain the enforcement provisions, but, consistent with the statute, did require that the CRA record be taken into account in the application process.", "Since the initial enactment of CRA, the regulations that implement the act have been amended. In 1993, the Clinton Administration instructed the federal bank regulators to revise the CRA regulations by moving from a process- and paperwork-based system to a performance-based system focusing on results, especially the results in LMI areas of an institution\u2019s communities.  Based on these instructions, the federal banking agencies replaced the qualitative CRA examination system with a more quantitative system that is based on actual performance.  For large retail institutions, CRA performance is measured through the use of three tests as follows.", "The lending test entails a review of an institution\u2019s lending record, including originations and purchases of home mortgage, small business, small farm, and, at the institution\u2019s option, consumer loans throughout the institution\u2019s service area, including the LMI areas.  The lending test is weighted more heavily than the investment and service tests in the institution\u2019s overall CRA rating.", "The investment test evaluates an institution\u2019s investment in community development activities.", "The service test requires the examiner to analyze an institution\u2019s system for delivering retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development services.", "In May 1995, the bank regulators issued the new CRA regulations (the performance-based CRA regulations).  For large institutions, the performance-based CRA regulations became effective on July 1, 1997. Therefore, CRA ratings that FRB relied upon in the six merger applications we considered were mostly from the previous process- and paperwork- based system.", "Most of the bank subsidiaries of the BHCs we reviewed were national banks regulated by OCC.  The exception was Chemical Bank, which is a state-chartered bank regulated by FRB and the New York State Banking Supervisor.", "HMDA was enacted to provide regulators and the public with information on home mortgage lending so that both could determine whether institutions were serving the credit needs of their communities.  HMDA was amended in 1989 to include the collection of data on the race, sex, and income of applicants and the action taken on the application. Home mortgage lenders that are required to report are to submit HMDA data files for each loan application. HMDA reporting requirements first only applied to banks and their subsidiaries. Over the years, Congress has expanded HMDA\u2019s coverage to include mortgage banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies and independent mortgage companies that have assets above a certain level and a home or branch office in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA).  For data collection in 1998, depository institutions with an office in an MSA are covered if they had more than $29 million in assets as of December 31, 1997.  Nondepository lenders are covered if they were located in or made loans in metropolitan areas and had assets of more than $10 million or if they originated 100 or more home purchase loans in the preceding year.", "FRB\u2019s Regulation BB describes the data that depository institutions are required to collect and maintain for CRA purposes.  Under revisions of Regulation BB, depository institutions defined as \u201clarge\u201d were required, beginning in 1996, to collect and report data annually on the number and dollar amount of their originations and purchases of small loans to businesses and farms and on any community development loans.  Only independent institutions with total assets of $250 million or more and institutions of any size if owned by a holding company that has assets of $1 billion or more are subject to the data reporting requirements.  The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) made the CRA data on 1996 small business lending available to the public in October 1997.  The data on business and farm lending reported under the CRA regulations are more limited in scope than data reported on home mortgage lending under HMDA. In particular, the CRA data include information only on loans originated or purchased, not on applications that are turned down or withdrawn by the customer. Also, unlike HMDA data, the CRA data do not include the income, sex, or racial or ethnic background of applicants. Finally, again unlike HMDA data, the CRA data are not reported and disclosed application by application; rather, the data are aggregated into three loan-size categories and then reported at the census tract level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine FRB\u2019s legal responsibilities for assessing CRA performance, we reviewed the BHC Act and CRA, their legislative histories, regulations promulgated under each act, and related published materials.", "To assess FRB\u2019s process for reviewing BHC merger applications for CRA performance, we used a case study approach.

The Statement was designed to provide federally insured financial institutions and the public with guidance regarding the requirements of CRA and the policies and procedures the agencies will apply during the depository institution application process.  After the performance-based CRA regulations were issued in 1995, FFIEC published Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment in 1997 and 1999.

According to the 1989 Statement, the CRA examination is not conclusive evidence in the face of significant and supported allegations from a commenter.  Moreover, the balance may be shifted further when the examination is not recent or the particular issue raised in the application proceeding was not addressed in the examination.  During the development of the performance-based CRA regulations, a number of commenters expressed concern that the regulators may provide a \u201csafe harbor\u201d to depository institutions from challenges to their CRA performance record in the application process if they achieved an outstanding CRA examination rating.

Chemical Bank issued a pledge for increased lending and community development funding of $18.1 billion primarily in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Texas.  The goals of the pledge included loans and investments to assist small businesses, affordable mortgages, and commercial and economic development. According to the summary of comments prepared by FRB, commenters criticized the pledge as inadequate because it was not enforceable, could not be monitored by community groups, was too vague to be meaningful, and did not identify the amount of lending that would be made within specific communities. Before its merger with BankAmerica, NationsBank made a 10-year pledge of $350 billion, for community development lending and investment. The comments were similar to those made for Chemical Bank\u2019s pledge. NationsBank\u2019s pledge was also criticized for lacking geographic detail and enforceability.", "In 1998, before Bank One\u2019s acquisition of NBD First Chicago, a Chicago community group obtained a CRA commitment from NBD First Chicago and Bank One.

According to DCCA analysts, many of the commenters did not include the home mortgage lending of the nonbank subsidiaries in their analysis.

He told us that FRB has a responsibility to address such comments because the BHC Act, which governs the bank and nonbank subsidiaries of a BHC, calls upon FRB to assess the impacts of the BHC merger on convenience and needs.  FRB responded to this general comment by stating that nonbank subsidiaries of BHCs are not subject to CRA and their lending is only relevant in the delineated areas of the bank subsidiaries.
