The GOES-R program has moved into the development phase of its acquisition life cycle. It has awarded development contracts for the instruments and plans to award contracts for the spacecraft and ground segments by mid-2009. However, after reconciling program and independent cost estimates, the program established a new cost estimate of $7.67 billion--a $670 million increase from the prior $7 billion estimate. The program also reduced the number of products the satellites will produce from 81 to 34 and slowed the delivery of these products in order to reduce costs. More recently, the program also delayed key milestones, including the launch of the first satellite, which was delayed from December 2014 to April 2015. Such delays could lead to gaps in satellite coverage if NOAA experiences problems with its current operational satellites before a backup satellite is in orbit. GOES-R has taken steps to address lessons from other satellite programs, but important actions remain to be completed. NOAA has made progress in its efforts to address prior lessons by taking steps to ensure technical readiness on key components, using an acceptable cost estimating approach, implementing techniques to enhance contractor oversight, and regularly briefing agency executives. However, technical challenges remain on both the ground segment and the instruments. In addition, the program did not perform a comprehensive review after rebaselining a critical instrument, and it has not documented all of the reasons for cost overruns. Until these issues are addressed, NOAA faces an increased risk that the GOES-Rprogram will repeat the same mistakes that have plagued other satellite programs. NOAA has a plan to meet some, but not all, data requirements. An instrument that was originally planned as part of the GOES-R satellite was to meet requirements for 15 products that are currently produced, as well as 11 new, technically advanced, products. When NOAA removed this instrument from the GOES-R satellite program, it arranged to obtain the current products from another instrument. However, the agency has not developed plans or a timeline to address the requirements for the new products. Doing so would include justifying the funding for any new initiatives within the agency's investment decision process. Until a decision is made on whether and how to proceed in providing the advanced products, key system users, such as weather forecasters, will not be able to meet their goals for improving the accuracy of severe weather warnings.

In  addition, NOAA had planned to use the new coastal waters imaging  products to provide more accurate and quantitative understanding of areas  along the U.S. East Coast (within 50 miles of the shore) and 130 estuaries  throughout the United States\u2014areas for which NOAA has management  responsibilities.", "Similarly, the environmental science communities have continued to  express a need for the advanced products. In 2007, the National Research  Council recommended that NOAA develop a strategy to restore the  planned geostationary advanced sounding capability that was removed  from the GOES-R program in order to allow high-temporal and high- vertical resolution measurements of temperature and water vapor. As  part of that strategy, the report recommended that NOAA work with NASA  to complete a demonstration satellite in the near term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NOAA Plans to Fulfill Requirements for Current Products", "paragraphs": ["In light of the cancellation of the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite,  NOAA decided to use the planned Advanced Baseline Imager to develop  the products that are currently produced by the GOES satellite sounders  now in orbit. In mid-2006, NOAA compared the imager\u2019s anticipated  capabilities with the legacy GOES sounder instrument and reported that  the advanced imager would be able to produce the necessary data 20 times  faster than the legacy sounder and with comparable or better spatial  resolution. However, NOAA also reported that the advanced imager will be  less accurate than the legacy sounder for four of the seven product groups.  Table 10 compares the capabilities of the Advanced Baseline Imager with  the legacy sounder in seven product groups.", "In an effort to obtain consensus from the GOES user community, NOAA  briefed sounding experts on the Advanced Baseline Imager\u2019s ability to  develop products currently produced by the legacy GOES sounder. These  experts included representatives from the National Weather Service; the  National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Services; the  Department of Defense\u2019s satellite data processing centers; academia; and  attendees at a weather-related conference. NOAA reported that users  accepted this plan as a suitable alternative until an advanced sounder  could be flown on the GOES series. NOAA noted that users were pleased  with the anticipated improvements in refresh rates.", "While satellite data users were eager to obtain faster refresh rates, recent  contract changes have since reduced these expected rates. As previously  reported, when the program office reconciled its cost estimate with the  independent estimate, the program removed or reduced selected  capabilities from the ground segment project. One of the reduced  capabilities was the refresh rates for most of the products. Instead of  refresh rates that are 20 times faster, current plans call for refresh rates  that are only 2 to 4 times faster than current products. The faster refresh  rates are now options in the contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NOAA Assessed Alternatives for Addressing Requirements for Advanced Products but Has Not Yet Defined Its Plans", "paragraphs": ["In addition to efforts to address the requirements for existing products  that were removed with the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite, NOAA,  NASA, and the Department of Defense assessed alternatives for obtaining  advanced sounding and coastal waters imaging products from a  geostationary orbit. The options include placing an advanced instrument  on a stand-alone satellite or on later GOES satellites. The results of the  analysis recommended that NOAA work with NASA to develop a  demonstration sounder to fly on an as-yet undetermined satellite in order  to build a foundation for an eventual operational advanced sounder on a  future GOES satellite. For coastal waters imaging, the analysis  recommended that, in the near-term, NOAA evaluate a hyperspectral  imager that is planned to be included on the International Space Station  and that NOAA and NASA coordinate to identify and evaluate other  options for the future. NOAA plans to assess the technical feasibility of  various options and to have the National Research Council make  recommendations on long-term options for coastal waters imaging.", "However, NOAA has not defined plans or a timeline for implementing any  of the options or for addressing the requirements for advanced products.  Further, agency officials were unable to estimate when they would  establish plans to fulfill the requirements. Doing so would include  justifying the funding for any new initiatives within the agency\u2019s  investment decision process. Until a decision is made on whether and how  to proceed in providing the advanced products, key system users such as  the National Weather Service will not be able to meet their goals for  improving the lead times or accuracy of severe weather warnings,  including warnings for tornadoes and hurricanes.

Any delays in the launch of the first satellite in the   GOES-R program increase the risk of gaps in satellite coverage.", "The program office has made repeated and continuing efforts to learn  from problems experienced on other satellite programs, but more can be  done in selected areas. Specifically, the program has improved the  technical readiness of key components, adopted many sound estimating  practices, implemented an earned value management process for  overseeing contracts, and is obtaining executive-level oversight. However,  the program\u2019s approach to earned value management has shortfalls. The  program did not perform a comprehensive review after rebaselining a  critical instrument\u2014the Advanced Baseline Imager\u2014and has not  documented the reasons for all cost overruns. Until these issues are  addressed, NOAA faces an increased risk that the GOES-R program will  repeat the cost increases, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls that  have plagued other satellite programs.", "In addition, while the GOES-R program office plans to recover existing  product capabilities that were lost when a critical sensor was removed  from the satellites, NOAA has not yet developed a plan or a timeline for  recovering the advanced capabilities that were removed.
