We expressed continued concerns  about VA health care in our 2017 high-risk report.", "VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates one of the largest  health care delivery systems in the nation, with 168 medical centers and  more than 1,000 outpatient facilities organized into regional networks. VA  has faced a growing demand by veterans for its health care services\u2014 due, in part, to servicemembers returning from military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq and the needs of an aging veteran population\u2014and  that trend is expected to continue. The total number of veteran enrollees  in VA\u2019s health care system rose from 7.9 million to almost 9 million from  fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016. Over that same period, VHA\u2019s  total budgetary resources have increased substantially, from $37.8 billion  in fiscal year 2006 to $91.2 billion in fiscal year 2016.", "Although VA\u2019s budget and enrollees have substantially increased for at  least a decade, there have been numerous reports during this same  period\u2014by us, VA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, and others\u2014of VA  facilities failing to provide timely health care. In some cases, the delays  in care or VA\u2019s failure to provide care at all reportedly have resulted in  harm to veterans. In response to these serious and longstanding  problems with access to VA health care, the Veterans Access, Choice,  and Accountability Act of 2014 was enacted, which provided temporary  authority and $10 billion in funding through August 7, 2017 (or sooner, if  those funds are exhausted) for veterans to obtain health care services  from community (non-VA) providers to address long wait times, lengthy  travel distances, or other challenges they may face accessing VA health  care. Under this authority, VA introduced the Veterans Choice Program  in November 2014, which offers veterans the option to receive hospital  care and medical services from a non-VA provider when a VA facility  cannot provide an appointment within 30 days, or when veterans reside  more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility.", "In addition to concerns about timely access to care, VA faces challenges  regarding the reliability, transparency, and consistency of its budget  estimates for medical services, as well as weaknesses in tracking  obligations for medical services and estimating budgetary needs for future  years. These challenges were evident in June 2015, when VA requested  additional funds from Congress because agency officials projected a  fiscal year 2015 funding gap of about $3 billion in its medical services  appropriation account. The projected funding gap was largely due to  administrative weaknesses that slowed the utilization of the Veterans  Choice Program in fiscal year 2015 and resulted in higher-than-expected  demand for VA\u2019s previously established VA community care programs.  To address the projected funding gap in fiscal year 2015, the VA Budget  and Choice Improvement Act provided VA temporary authority to use up  to $3.3 billion from the Veterans Choice Program appropriation for  obligations incurred for other specified medical services. In our June  2016 report on VA\u2019s health care budget, we reported that VA officials  anticipated requesting another increase in funding for health care  services in the budget request for fiscal year 2018. Over the course of  fiscal year 2016, utilization of the Veterans Choice Program increased  considerably, and the Veterans Choice Fund had a $4.5 billion remaining  balance at the start of fiscal year 2017 to cover community care  services. However, in February 2017, a VA official told us that VA would  need an estimated $2 billion in addition to its fiscal year 2018 advance  appropriation of about $70 billion to continue providing services.", "My statement today, which is based on our February 2017 High-Risk  Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial Efforts  Needed on Others, will address (1) actions VA has taken over the past 2  years to address the areas of concern that led us to place VA health care  on our High-Risk List in 2015, (2) the number of open GAO  recommendations related to VA health care, and (3) additional actions VA  needs to take to address the concerns that led to the high-risk  designation.

Our high-risk program\u2014 which is intended to help inform the congressional oversight agenda and  to guide efforts of the administration and agencies to improve government  performance\u2014has brought much-needed focus to problems impeding  effective government and costing billions of dollars. In 1990, we  designated 14 high-risk areas. Since then, generally coinciding with the  start of each new Congress, we have reported on the status of progress  to address previously designated high-risk areas, determined whether  any areas could be removed or consolidated, and identified new high-risk  areas.", "Since 1990, a total of 60 different areas have appeared on the High-Risk  List, 24 areas have been removed, and 2 areas have been consolidated.  On average, high-risk areas that have been removed from the list  remained on it for 9 years after they were initially added. Our experience  has shown that the key elements needed to make progress in high-risk  areas are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders  grounded in the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, as well as  any needed congressional action. The five criteria for removal that we  issued in November 2000 are as follows:", "Leadership Commitment. The agency demonstrates strong  commitment and top leadership support.", "Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to  resolve the risk(s).", "Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root  cause and solutions, and provides for substantially completing  corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement  solutions we recommended.", "Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and  independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of  corrective measures.", "Demonstrated Progress. The agency is able to demonstrate  progress in implementing corrective measures and in resolving the  high-risk area.", "These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately  address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to  progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the  list. In our April 2016 report, we provided additional information on how  agencies had made progress addressing high-risk issues. Figure 1  shows the five criteria for removal for a designated high-risk area and  examples of actions taken by agencies as cited in that report.", "Importantly, the actions listed are not \u201cstand alone\u201d efforts taken in  isolation from other actions to address high-risk issues. That is, actions  taken under one criterion may also be important in meeting other criteria.  For example, top leadership can demonstrate its commitment by  establishing a corrective action plan including long-term priorities and  goals to address the high-risk issue and using data to gauge progress\u2014 actions which are also vital to monitoring criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Made Limited Progress in Addressing the Concerns That Led to the 2015 VA Health Care High-Risk Designation", "paragraphs": ["VA officials have expressed their commitment to addressing the concerns  that led to the high-risk designation for VA health care. As part of our  work for the 2017 high-risk report, we identified actions VA had taken,  such as establishing a task force, working groups, and a governance  structure for addressing the five areas of concern contributing to the  designation: (1) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; (2)  inadequate oversight and accountability; (3) information technology (IT)  challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear resource  needs and allocation priorities. For example, in July 2016, VA chartered  the GAO High Risk List Area Task Force for Managing Risk and  Improving VA Health Care to develop and oversee implementation of  VA\u2019s plan to address the root causes of the five areas of concern we  identified in 2015.", "VA\u2019s task force and associated working groups are responsible for  developing and executing the department\u2019s high-risk mitigation plan for  each of the five areas of concern we identified. VA also executed two  contracts with a total value of $7.8 million to support its actions to address  the concerns behind the high-risk designation. These contracts\u2014with the  MITRE Corporation and Atlas Research, LLC\u2014are intended to provide  additional support for actions such as developing and executing an action  plan, creating a plan to enhance VA\u2019s capacity to manage the five areas,  and assisting with establishing the management functions necessary to  oversee the five high-risk-area working groups.", "On August 18, 2016, VA provided us with an action plan that  acknowledged the deep-rooted nature of the areas of concern, and stated  that these concerns would require substantial time and work to address.  Although the action plan outlined some steps VA plans to take over the  next several years to address the concerns that led to its high-risk  designation, several sections were missing critical actions that would  support our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, such as analyzing  the root causes of the issues and measuring progress with clear metrics.  In our feedback to VHA on drafts of its action plan, we highlighted these  missing actions and also stressed the need for specific timelines and an  assessment of needed resources for implementation. For example, VA  plans to use staff from various sources, including contractors and  temporarily detailed employees, to support its high-risk-area working  groups, so it is important for VA to ensure that these efforts are  sufficiently resourced."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overall Rating for Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, when we applied  the five criteria for High-Risk List removal to each of the areas of concern,  we determined that VA has partially met two of the five criteria: leadership  commitment and an action plan.

It is  worth noting that although both criteria were rated as partially met, the  department made significantly less progress in developing a viable action  plan than it has in demonstrating leadership commitment. Specifically, VA  partially met the action plan criterion for only one of the five areas of  concern\u2014ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes\u2014whereas VA  partially met the leadership commitment criterion for four out of five areas  of concern.", "The following is a summary of the progress VA has made in addressing  the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for each of the five  areas of concern we identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ambiguous Policies and Inconsistent Processes", "paragraphs": ["Summary of concern. When we designated VA health care as a high- risk area in 2015, we reported that ambiguous VA policies led to  inconsistent processes at local VA medical facilities, which may have  posed risks for veterans\u2019 access to VA health care. Since then, we  highlighted the inconsistent application of policies in two recent reports  examining mental health and primary care access at VA medical facilities  in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In both reports, we found wide variation  in the time that veterans waited for primary and mental health care, which  was in part caused by a lack of clear, updated policies for appointment  scheduling; therefore, we recommended that VA update these policies.  These ambiguous policies contributed to errors made by appointment  schedulers, which led to inconsistent and unreliable wait-time data. For  mental health, we also found that two policies conflicted, leading to  confusion among VA medical center staff as to which wait-time policy to  follow. In 2015, VA resolved this policy conflict by revising its mental  health handbook, but other inconsistent applications of mental health  policy have not yet been addressed, such as our recommendation to  issue guidance about the definitions used to calculate veteran  appointment wait times, and communicate any changes to those  definitions within and outside VHA.  2017 assessment of VA\u2019s progress. Based on actions taken since  2015, VA has partially met our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List  for this area of concern for leadership commitment and action plan. VA  has partially met the leadership commitment criterion because it  established a framework for developing and reviewing policies\u2014with the  goal of ensuring greater consistency and clarity\u2014and set goals for  making the policy-development process more efficient. VA has partially  met the action plan criterion for this high-risk area of concern because its  action plan described an analysis of the root causes of problems related  to ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes, an important aspect of  an action plan. However, VA has not met our criteria for removal from the  High-Risk List for capacity, monitoring, and demonstrated progress for  this area of concern because it has not addressed gaps that exist  between its stated goals and available resources, addressed inconsistent  application of policies at the local level, or demonstrated that its actions  are linked to identified root causes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Oversight and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Summary of concern. In our 2015 high-risk report, we found that VA had  problems holding its facilities accountable for their performance because  it relied on self-reported data from facilities, its oversight activities were  not sufficiently focused on compliance, and it did not routinely assess  policy implementation. We continued to find a lack of oversight in our  October 2015 review of the efficiency and timeliness of VA\u2019s primary care.  For example, we found inaccuracies in VA\u2019s data on primary care panel  sizes, which are used to help medical centers manage their workload and  ensure that veterans receive timely and efficient care. We found that  while VA\u2019s primary care panel management policy required facilities to  ensure the reliability of their panel size data, it did not assign  responsibility for verifying data reliability to regional- or national-level  officials or require them to use the data for monitoring purposes. As a  result, VA could not be assured that local panel size data were reliable, or  know whether its medical centers had met VA\u2019s goals for efficient, timely,  and quality care. We recommended that VA incorporate an oversight  process in its primary care panel management policy that assigns  responsibility, as appropriate, to regional networks and to VA\u2019s central  office for verifying and monitoring panel sizes.  2017 assessment of VA\u2019s progress. VA has partially met the leadership  commitment criterion for this area of concern because it established a  high-level governance structure and adopted a new model to guide the  department\u2019s oversight and accountability activities. However, VA has not  met our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for capacity, action  plan, monitoring, or demonstrated progress for this area of concern  because the department continues to rely on existing processes that  contribute to inadequate oversight and accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Summary of concern. In our 2015 high-risk report, we identified  limitations in the capacity of VA\u2019s existing IT systems, including the  outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system  interoperability as contributors to VA\u2019s IT challenges related to VA health  care. We have continued to report on the importance of VA working with  the Department of Defense to achieve electronic health record  interoperability. In August 2015, we reported on the status of these  interoperability efforts and noted that the departments had engaged in  several near-term efforts focused on expanding interoperability between  their existing electronic health record systems. However, we were  concerned by the lack of outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would  more clearly define what VA and the Department of Defense aim to  achieve from their interoperability efforts. Accordingly, we recommended  that the departments establish a time frame for identifying outcome- oriented metrics and define related goals for achieving interoperability. In  February 2017, we reported that VA has begun to define an approach for  identifying outcome-oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in  selected clinical areas, and it also has begun to establish baseline  measurements. We intend to continue monitoring the departments\u2019  efforts to determine how these metrics define and measure the results  achieved by interoperability between the departments.  2017 assessment of VA\u2019s progress. VA has partially met our leadership  commitment criterion by involving top leadership from VA\u2019s Office of  Information & Technology in this area of concern, but it has not met our  four remaining criteria for removing IT challenges from the High-Risk List.  For example, VA has not demonstrated improvement in several capacity  actions, such as establishing specific responsibilities for its new functions,  improving collaboration between internal and external stakeholders, and  addressing skill gaps.

When identifying this area of concern in our 2015  high-risk report, we described several gaps in VA\u2019s training, as well as  burdensome training requirements. We have continued to find these  issues in our subsequent work. For example, in our December 2016  report on VHA\u2019s human resources (HR) capacity, we found that VA\u2019s  competency assessment tool did not address two of the three personnel  systems under which VHA staff may be hired. We recommended that  VHA (1) develop a comprehensive competency assessment tool for HR  staff that evaluates knowledge of all three of VHA\u2019s personnel systems  and (2) ensure that all VHA HR staff complete it so that VHA may use the  data to identify and address competency gaps among HR staff. Without  such a tool, VHA will have limited insights into the abilities of its HR staff  and will be ill-positioned to provide necessary support and training.  2017 assessment of VA\u2019s progress. VA has not met any of our criteria  for removing this area of concern from the High-Risk List. VA intends to  establish a comprehensive health care training management policy and a  mandatory annual training process; however, as of December 2016, VA  officials said they had not begun drafting a new policy to replace an  outdated document from 2002 that contains training requirements that are  no longer relevant. The high-level nature of the descriptions in the action  plan and lack of action to update outdated policies and set goals for  improving training shows that VA lacks leadership commitment to address  the concerns that led to our inclusion of this area in the 2015 high-risk  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear Resource Needs and Allocation Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Summary of concern.

We have continued to report on this concern. For  example, in our September 2016 report on VHA\u2019s organizational  structure, we found that VA devoted significant time, effort, and funds to  generate recommendations for organizational structure changes intended  to improve the efficiency of VHA operations. However, the department  then either did not act or acted slowly to implement the recommendations.  Without robust processes for evaluating and implementing  recommendations, there was little assurance that VHA\u2019s delivery of health  care to the nation\u2019s veterans would improve. We recommended that VA  develop a process to ensure that it evaluates organizational structure  recommendations resulting from internal and external reviews of VHA.  This process should include documenting decisions and assigning  officials or offices responsibility for ensuring that approved  recommendations are implemented. We concluded that such a process  would help VA ensure that it is using resources efficiently, monitoring and  evaluating implementation, and holding officials accountable.  2017 assessment of VA\u2019s progress. VA\u2019s actions have partially met our  criterion for leadership commitment but not met the other four criteria for  removing this area of concern from the High Risk List.
