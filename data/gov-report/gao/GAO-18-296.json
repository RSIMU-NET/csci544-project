Futures contract terms that reflect the underlying fed cattle  market help ensure that prices in both the fed cattle and futures markets  are closely linked because they are influenced over the long run by the  same market forces. The two markets also show similar patterns because  participants in both markets tend to rely on the same types of information  when entering into transactions.

The only aspect left unspecified is the price at which  each individual contract will be bought or sold.", "The futures market provides cattle market participants with a means to  hedge\u2014shift unwanted price risk to others more willing to assume the  risk. Some buyers and sellers in the fed cattle market, such as packers  and feeders, trade in futures contracts to hedge the risks of price changes  in the fed cattle or wholesale and retail beef markets. For example, a  feeder concerned that fed cattle prices may decline in the future may  decide to lock in his or her sell price by selling futures contracts: if fed  cattle prices decline, profits from the futures contracts will generally offset  losses from the lower fed cattle prices. The same is true for a meat  packer concerned about prices going up. The packer might buy a futures  contract to lock in a purchase price, with futures profits offsetting higher  fed cattle prices. Other futures market participants\u2014generally,  speculators\u2014may take a view about whether the price of fed cattle may  go up or down and, based on that view, enter into the market as a buyer  or seller. For example, speculators could purchase futures contracts from  cattle market participants if they think that futures prices may increase in  the future or, conversely, sell a futures contract if they believe prices may  decline.

These factors  included drought, costs for feed, and the price of substitute proteins, such  as pork. As it relates to supply factors, from 2010 through early 2013 a  prolonged drought\u2014beginning in the southern United States in late 2010  and expanding to the High Plains in 2012\u2014affected major cattle areas.  This drought caused the supply of young cattle to decrease and then  increase and, correspondingly, the national price of fed cattle to increase  and then decrease when those cattle came to market as fed cattle. Some  experts and stakeholders we interviewed told us that cow-calf operators  may have liquidated their herds in 2012 and 2013 because the droughts  reduced the supply of forage available to raise younger cattle, and cow- calf operators could not feed as many cattle on available pasture and  rangeland. The domestic cattle inventory decreased from about 96.5  million in 2007 to about 88.5 million in 2014. This decrease in inventory  reduced the supply of fed cattle available for sale in 2013 and 2014,  which could have driven up prices for fed cattle. As the drought eased in  late 2013, it became more feasible to feed herds on forage, creating  incentives for cow-calf operators to expand their herds throughout 2014  and 2015. This increased the number of fed cattle sold for slaughter by  late 2015, and prices began to drop at that time. See figure 4 for  information on the relationship between fed cattle price changes and the  U.S. cattle inventory over the past 10 years. See appendix II for more  information on the number of U.S. cattle at various points in the supply  chain.", "Costs for feed also affected the fed cattle supply, contributing to the large  changes in fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2016. An easing of the  widespread drought in late 2013 reduced the price of corn and other  grains used to feed cattle, which, according to some experts and P&SP  officials, may have created an incentive for feeders to grow their cattle to  heavier weights before marketing them to packers. For example, the price  of corn decreased from about $6.87 per bushel in late 2012 to about  $3.50 per bushel in late 2014. According to data from USDA\u2019s price  reporting group, fed cattle weight increases from 2003 through 2013  averaged about 14 pounds per year; however, our analysis of cattle  market data from USDA showed average fed cattle weights increased by  about 40 pounds in 2015. For additional longer-term information on  increases in cattle weights, see appendix II. However, particularly heavy  cattle can receive lower prices per pound, in part because packers told us  that unusually large cuts of beef can be more difficult to sell. In 2014  when the fed cattle supply was low, P&SP officials reported that packers  were not necessarily paying lower prices for over-heavy cattle, so feeders  would not have received this price indicator to keep the cattle they sold  below certain weights. According to some experts, these heavier weights,  combined with the larger overall number of cattle offered for sale in 2015,  resulted in increased supply, exacerbating the price decline.", "Reduced demand for wholesale beef and for fed cattle also affected the  large national changes in fed cattle prices. Our analysis of cattle market  and other economic data showed that several factors reduced demand for  beef; this in turn reduced demand for fed cattle. These factors included  (1) higher wholesale beef prices and concurrently lower relative prices of  pork and chicken, which are substitutes for beef for consumers and which  would reduce demand for retail beef; (2) increases in the amount of beef  in cold storage, also limiting packer demand for fed cattle; and (3)  fluctuations in the strength of the U.S. dollar, which would shift consumer  purchases toward or away from relatively less expensive imported beef,  as well as contribute to shifts in net exports\u2014that is, total exports minus  total imports. In addition, according to some experts and stakeholders, an  overall reduction in packing capacity when packers closed several plants,  including one large plant in Texas, may have also limited packer demand  for fed cattle.", "P&SP officials conducted an investigation into the price drop beginning in  August 2015. P&SP officials told us that as they saw fed cattle prices  rapidly decreasing in August and September 2015, they included this  investigation in the agency\u2019s annual work plan for 2016. They also told us  that P&SP conducted the work based on its own initiative and not as the  result of a request from a market participant or because it received  specific information on possible wrongdoing. The P&SP investigation  reviewed changes in price spreads between fed cattle and wholesale\u2014or  boxed\u2014beef because such price spreads can serve as a rough indicator  of packer profit. P&SP found that packers may have benefitted for a short  period as the prices they paid for fed cattle decreased more quickly than  the prices they received for boxed beef, but it also found that those price  differences quickly diminished to smaller levels than before the price  drop. The report concluded that the sharp price decrease in 2015 was  likely due to a number of market factors that affected both supply and  demand, such as an increased number of fed cattle sold for slaughter and  lower relative prices for pork and chicken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competition Levels among Packers Did Not Appear to Affect National Price Changes in the Fed Cattle Market but May Have Contributed to Price Variations in Different Areas of the Country", "paragraphs": ["Competition levels among packers varied in different areas of the country.  These variations did not appear to explain the large national changes in  fed cattle prices from 2013 through 2015 but may have contributed to  variations in fed cattle prices in different areas of the country. Specifically,  at the national level, packer competition levels were stable from 2013  through 2015. Using P&SP\u2019s annual data on transactions between  packers and feeders during this time frame, we estimated the degree of  competition in any given area by calculating market concentration levels  among packers using a measure called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index  (HHI). From a practical perspective, a lower HHI indicates generally that  there is more competition in a market. In particular, an HHI is lowest when  a market is occupied by a large number of firms of relatively equal size  and is highest when a market is controlled by a single firm (i.e., there is  no competition in that market). Some large packing plants closed from  2013 through 2015, but the average HHI level varied by only one  percentage point (from about 51 to about 52 percent), whereas the total  price decrease from November 2014 through December 2015 was about  30 percent. Because of this, it was unlikely that variations in competition  affected the large price decrease.", "However, variations in competition levels in different areas of the country  may have contributed to price differences we observed in those areas.  The data show that the average competition level was about 51 percent,  suggesting that, on average, a given feedlot had two packing plants to  which it could sell its fed cattle. Competition levels tended to be higher in  states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, South  Dakota, and Iowa, where there are more cattle on feed as we showed in  figure 2, suggesting that feeders in those areas had more packing plants  to choose from. Competition levels tended to be lower in areas that had  fewer cattle on feed, such as in the northeast and the Pacific Northwest, suggesting that feeders in those areas had fewer packing plants to which  they could sell their cattle.", "Using an econometric model, after controlling for other factors that could  affect price\u2014such as the supply and demand factors we discuss above,  or attributes of the beef produced by fed cattle such as yield and quality  grade\u2014we found that less packer competition in any given area was  associated with lower fed cattle prices in that area. Specifically, our  model estimated that fed cattle prices in less concentrated areas (those  with an HHI in the 25th percentile of our analysis) may have been about 9  percent higher than in more concentrated areas (those with an HHI in the  75th percentile of our analysis). Such competition effects can exist in  legitimately functioning markets. The results of our analysis suggest that  some packers may have been able to exercise market power in areas  with less competition. Evidence of this effect alone does not imply that  packers engaged in anticompetitive or improper behavior.

Specifically, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange concluded that  the futures market volatility was predominantly the result of non-high  frequency traders placing and executing large, aggressive futures orders.", "Furthermore, as a way of comparing the use of automated and high- frequency trading in the futures market for fed cattle to related markets,  CFTC officials told us that their review found that futures contract markets  for other agricultural commodities from 2014 through 2016\u2014including for  corn, wheat, soybeans, and pork\u2014were characterized by a greater  percentage of automated trading, including high-frequency trading, than  the futures market for fed cattle. Finally, according to documentation from  the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the high levels of volatility in the  futures market could be related to both the swift declines in fed cattle  prices and the fact that an increasing number of fed cattle are sold during  the last few business days of the week, rather than throughout the week.  Concentrating purchases to one or two days of the business week  decreases the number of price signals that the fed cattle market can  provide futures market participants. According to Chicago Mercantile  Exchange documentation, a decrease in the frequency of price signals  creates information gaps for market participants and likely contributes to  price volatility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFTC and Some Stakeholders Expressed Concern about Cattle Futures Contract Terms, and CFTC Is Overseeing Related Changes", "paragraphs": ["CFTC and some stakeholders expressed concern that the terms of cattle  futures contracts did not adequately reflect structural changes in the fed  cattle market and that differences between the terms of futures contracts  and the fed cattle market could cause futures contracts to become less  useful to cattle market participants to hedge risks. According to Chicago  Mercantile Exchange documents, futures contract terms are designed to  match relevant commodities markets and industry standards to help  ensure that there is a two-way relationship between the futures market  and the relevant commodity market. When contract terms reflect the  market and futures markets operate properly, prices in the fed cattle and  futures markets may initially diverge, but over time should generally  converge by the time a contract expires. If the prices do not converge,  contracts become less useful to market participants as a way to hedge  risks. For example, prior to October 2017, cattle futures contracts  specified that at least 55 percent of the fed cattle in those contracts were  to produce a beef quality grade of Choice or better. From fiscal years  2013 through 2017, the percentage of beef graded nationally as Choice  or better has been higher than this\u2014at times as high as about 80 percent,  although proportions have varied by region. Stakeholders have expressed  concern that because the beef quality specifications in futures contracts  for fed cattle are lower than the beef quality produced by animals traded  in the fed cattle market, this difference may decrease the value of those  futures contracts. Additionally, stakeholders expressed concern that this  difference can negatively impact whether prices in the futures and fed  cattle markets effectively converge as expected.", "In response to these concerns, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange made  changes to the terms of futures contracts for fed cattle in 2016 and 2017,  which were reviewed and approved by CFTC. To better align futures  contracts with the fed cattle market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  has increased the quality percentage of Choice or better quality beef to  60 percent, starting with October 2017 futures contracts, and to 65  percent Choice or better quality beef, starting with October 2018 futures  contracts.", "In 2016, also in response to concerns raised by stakeholders, CFTC  asked the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to provide information on  additional measures under consideration by the exchange, such as  changing the terms in futures contracts for fed cattle and making them  more consistent with the fed cattle market. As a result of dialogue  between the two entities, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange revised its  delivery process and expanded the timeframe for making deliveries,  which has allowed it to add locations where cattle can be delivered to  satisfy a futures contract. According to CFTC, this change made  delivery more accessible and improved the connection between the fed  cattle and futures markets. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange submitted  these and similar changes to CFTC. CFTC reviewed those changes, and  where the agency found the changes consistent with the Commodity  Exchange Act and regulations, allowed or expressly approved those  changes. Chicago Mercantile Exchange representatives told us that these  changes will help futures contracts better reflect the fed cattle market.
