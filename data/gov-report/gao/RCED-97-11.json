If the legislation passes, this greater discretion is expected to strengthen the long-term viability of public and assisted housing and allow PHAs to operate their housing more in line with the needs of the local community. The added flexibility also will be important because other factors, such as increasing operating expenses for public housing and residents\u2019 decreasing contributions toward their rent, are limiting the financial resources available to housing authorities to manage their properties effectively.", "Before the pending housing reform legislation was introduced, housing authorities recognized the limits on their financial resources and had begun establishing partnerships and other business-like arrangements with public and private sector groups to provide residents with needed services as well as supplement their traditional sources of funds. At your request, this report provides information that describes four types of arrangements that public housing authorities have established and provides the views of PHA officials on the benefits of these arrangements. The information is based on our discussions with 29 housing authorities whose partnership efforts were commended to us by Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) officials and industry associations that represent housing authorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["PHAs are key players along with federal, state, and local governments and other entities trying to address the housing needs of low-income families. PHAs contract with HUD to provide adequate housing for low-income residents in return for federal grants and subsidies. Therefore, HUD is not only the primary source of public housing funding but also has the primary responsibility for monitoring and enforcing federal housing regulations. Although the federal government provides PHAs with funding for operating expenses and repairs of public housing, state and local laws determine a housing authority\u2019s organization and structure. In many cities, the mayor appoints the PHA\u2019s policy-setting body or board of commissioners, which, in turn, hires the housing authority\u2019s executive director and may approve other top management positions. Housing authorities may also receive funding from state and local sources.", "Over time, costs for PHAs have begun to exceed the financial resources available to them, while at the same time the demand for low-income housing offered by PHAs has increased. Although HUD calculates and provides an operating subsidy to supplement the rent paid by residents, the subsidy and rent have not been always sufficient to cover PHAs\u2019 costs. In fiscal year 1996, the federal subsidy of $2.8 billion and the total rent paid by residents covered almost 90 percent of housing authorities\u2019 operating expenses, leaving a gap of about 10 percent of expenses that are not funded by the subsidy or rent. Moreover, residents\u2019 rent has also declined. Currently, residents\u2019 rent is based on their annual income minus certain deductions. Generally, if residents\u2019 incomes decline, the rent they pay declines as well. And a steady decline in the average income of public housing residents has occurred over the last decade: Average income has decreased from 33 percent of the local geographic area\u2019s median income in 1981 to 17 percent in 1995. All the while, according to HUD, the demand for low-income housing has increased, with the number of low-income households with worst case housing needs increasing by 1.5 million between 1978 and 1993 to an all-time high of 5.3 million households in 1993.", "One purpose of the pending housing legislation is to provide greater flexibility to housing authorities in their operations. The legislation does this by consolidating many public housing grant programs and subsidies into two funds and eliminating statutory requirements such as the \u201cone-for-one\u201d requirement for replacing housing units and the federal preferences for admission that limited housing authorities\u2019 management discretion. Another of the pending legislation\u2019s purposes is to provide for more flexible use of federal assistance to PHAs, allowing them to leverage and combine assistance with funds obtained from other sources.", "In addition to the pending legislation, HUD and the public housing industry have also begun to foster partnerships in public housing. In May 1996, HUD issued an interim rule to allow housing authorities to combine their funds with private financing to develop public housing or a mixture of public housing and nonpublic housing. HUD has also established an Office of Public Housing Partnerships to oversee financial partnerships that PHAs establish with other entities to leverage federal funding to develop or rehabilitate public housing. Also, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, an industry group representing over 2,100 housing authorities, annually highlights innovative management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Authorities Partnered Among Themselves and With Other Groups", "paragraphs": ["Because federal funding and residents\u2019 rent have been insufficient to fully fund PHAs\u2019 operating expenses, PHAs have begun to search for new ways to make their resources go further. PHAs have formed partnerships with private developers as well as state and local governments and entities to take advantage of such federal programs as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and HUD\u2019s HOME Investment Partnerships Program. On the basis of information provided to us by HUD headquarters and field office officials, as well as officials from public housing associations and professional organizations, we contacted 29 housing authorities across the country. We found a broad array of sharing and partnering. PHAs have partnered or entered into business-like arrangements with other PHAs to share resources or to consolidate management in which one PHA manages several others; residents, social service agencies, and community groups to provide employment and other services to residents; nonprofit organizations and state governments to develop low-income housing and affordable housing; and state and local governments to obtain lower cost goods and services.", "These four types of partnerships or arrangements are summarized below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Partnerships Among PHAs to Reduce Operating or Management Costs", "paragraphs": ["Our study of 29 PHAs found eight instances of PHAs\u2019 working together to jointly purchase goods and services or consolidate management and thereby achieving cost savings or increased efficiency. By purchasing items together, PHAs can share the costs of the goods and services rather than bearing the costs separately. For example, one group of PHAs split the costs and use of consultants to help comply with regulations governing services for handicapped residents. In another case, a group of over 80 PHAs jointly purchased items such as major appliances\u2014which, according to PHA officials, has increased the efficiency of operations by reducing the administrative burdens of time and paperwork in the purchasing process. Similarly, two housing authorities estimated that they saved $25,000 in staff and travel costs by jointly operating a community development program.", "According to several PHA officials with experience in consolidating management, consolidation enables PHAs to obtain the benefits of sharing the use and costs of employees and services. For small housing authorities, this partnering can greatly reduce the cost of additional staff and overhead. For example, one large housing authority in our study took over the management of three nearby small housing authorities without increasing the size of its staff. The executive director of the large housing authority said that the consolidation has resulted in reduced overhead and maintenance costs, reduced staff costs, higher productivity, and greater satisfaction by residents at the three smaller authorities. Another official at the large authority said that the smaller housing authorities benefit from the large housing authority\u2019s knowledge of and experience with HUD\u2019s rules and regulations. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Deputy Director of HUD\u2019s Office of Urban Revitalization concurred in this view and said that a tremendous opportunity exists for greater efficiency of operations and cost savings if there is consolidation among smaller PHAs. The Deputy Director said that because executive directors of smaller PHAs may be part-time managers, the PHAs often are not able to remain abreast of public housing regulations. Thus, this economy of management through consolidation can allow the PHAs to maximize the use of their operating subsidies.", "The Deputy Director also recognized the issue of political resistance to consolidation\u2014an issue that we have heard from PHA executive directors and HUD field office officials\u2014whereby a local mayor may not support consolidation if it means losing control over the city\u2019s housing authority. The Deputy Director said that a way to gain the support of local officials for consolidation may be to allow each PHA to retain its local board of commissioners. In this way, the board would still have policymaking authority for its PHA. In our study, the board was retained in two instances of consolidation, while in a third instance a single board was created for a regional PHA serving 60 cities in six counties. This board consisted of representatives from each of the six counties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Partnerships to Provide Employment and Social Services to Residents", "paragraphs": ["Through partnerships and other business-like arrangements with labor unions and residents, four PHAs that we contacted have had some success in providing employment opportunities for some residents. The residents hired through these arrangements engaged in repairing vacant units, maintaining the grounds, and performing janitorial services. By employing residents, PHAs provide them with an income, enable PHA staff to do higher-priority work, and can give residents, as one executive director said, \u201ca sense of pride in their housing developments.\u201d In addition, officials at one of the PHAs that hired residents said that this practice was less costly than hiring private firms to do similar work; officials at another PHA said that the average time that units have been left vacant has been reduced because of residents\u2019 work on the units.", "For example, one PHA formed a partnership with a local union to provide four residents with union jobs through a 4-year apprenticeship program. Union workers trained and supervised residents in renovating the PHA\u2019s housing units. The PHA pays each apprentice on a sliding wage scale that increases with training and experience. By the end of the 4-year program, residents become members of the union and are paid the same wage as fully trained union workers. In addition to a salary, the residents in the program obtain medical and health insurance, which they may not have had previously. According to the PHA executive director, union officials, and residents, all parties to this partnership benefit: The union increases its membership and work for union members, the housing authority obtains an employed resident and can renovate its units at less cost than using a contractor, and the resident begins a path to self-sufficiency.", "In addition, eight PHAs in our study took part in partnerships with social service organizations to supply such services as child care and health care to residents and with local colleges to teach college credit courses to residents. These partnerships often made use of programs and grants from HUD and state and local governments. For example, PHAs used the social service agencies to operate programs funded under grants from HUD, such as the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program. Social service agencies provided staff to operate the program and saved the PHAs the cost of hiring staff and, in some cases, provided services at no cost to PHAs. In return for space provided to social service agencies, one housing authority estimates that it has received $400,000 worth of services at no charge over a 2-year period. In another example, a housing authority developed a partnership with a local university to operate a health care clinic for residents. The university provides its faculty and graduate student nurses to staff the clinic, while doctors volunteer their time to provide health services.", "According to an executive director, an added benefit of partnerships with social service agencies is that the housing authority is connected to a network of services and funding sources that were not previously available. Social service partners have expertise in areas such as providing counseling or health care that PHA employees may not have. Three PHA executive directors told us that they could not have offered services to residents if it were not for the partnerships that were formed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Partnerships With State, Local, and Commercial Entities to Develop Affordable Housing", "paragraphs": ["To meet the local need of housing for low-income people, public housing authorities are increasingly working with banks, cities, nonprofit groups, and state and local governments to develop affordable housing. To do this, PHAs use proceeds from the sale of bonds, Community Development Block Grant funds, and state and local funds. One authority that we contacted uses a combination of HUD\u2019s HOME program funds, tax-exempt bond funding, and state funding to develop affordable housing for persons with moderate, low, and very low incomes. To develop affordable housing in another partnership, a housing authority worked with two local nonprofit organizations to operate a handicapped-accessible building for very-low-income persons. The nonprofits owned the building and provided supportive services for persons with disabilities. The housing authority earned income by charging a fee to manage the building. In addition, one authority developed a nonprofit entity that obtained tax credits to develop affordable housing that is not public housing.

For instance, by joining a state unemployment insurance program instead of being self-insured, one housing authority estimated savings of $20,000 per year. In addition, by joining the local county\u2019s health insurance program, one housing authority reduced its cost to fund employees\u2019 family insurance plans by about 50 percent (from $400 per month to $198 per month per employee)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HUD for its review and comment.
