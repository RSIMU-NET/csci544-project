GAO and others have reported that Interior has faced challenges hiring and retaining sufficient staff to carry out these responsibilities. In February 2011, GAO added Interior's management of federal oil and gas resources to its list of programs at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in part because of Interior's long-standing and continued human capital challenges.", "GAO was asked to update the status of Interior's human capital challenges. This report examines: (1) the extent to which Interior continues to face challenges hiring and retaining key oil and gas staff and the causes of these challenges; (2) Interior's efforts to address its hiring and retention challenges; and (3) the effects of hiring and retention challenges on Interior's oversight of oil and gas activities. GAO surveyed 44 Interior offices that oversee oil and gas operations of which 40 responded; analyzed offshore inspection records and other documents; and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Interior (Interior) continues to face challenges hiring and retaining staff with key skills needed to manage and oversee oil and gas operations on federal leases. Interior officials noted two major factors that contribute to challenges in hiring and retaining staff: lower salaries and a slow hiring process compared with similar positions in industry. In response to GAO's survey, officials from a majority of the offices in the three Interior bureaus that manage oil and gas activities--the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)--reported ongoing difficulties filling vacancies, particularly for petroleum engineers and geologists. Many of these officials also reported that retention is an ongoing concern as staff leave for positions in industry. Bureau of Labor Statistics data confirm a wide gap between industry and federal salaries for petroleum engineers and geologists. According to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data, the fiscal year 2012 attrition rate for petroleum engineers at BLM was over 20 percent, or more than double the average federal attrition rate of 9.1 percent. However, the attrition rate for other key oil and gas staff during fiscal year 2012 was lower than the federal average. Nonetheless, field office officials stated that attrition is of concern because some field offices have only a few employees in any given position, and a single separation can significantly affect operations. Additionally, Interior records show that the average time required to hire petroleum engineers and inspectors in recent months generally exceeded 120 calendar days--much longer than OPM's target of 80 calendar days.", "Interior and the three bureaus--BLM, BOEM, and BSEE--have taken some actions to address their hiring and retention challenges but have not fully used their existing authorities to supplement salaries or collect and analyze hiring data to identify the causes of delays in the hiring process. For instance, BLM, BOEM, and BSEE officials said that recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives are key options to help hire and retain staff, but use of these incentives to attract and retain petroleum engineers and inspectors has been limited. Moreover, the department and bureaus have taken some steps to reduce hiring times, but they do not have complete and accurate data on hiring times. For instance, while BSEE and BOEM collect hiring data on a biweekly basis, the data are used primarily to track the progress of individual applicants as they move through the hiring process. Likewise, a BLM official stated that the bureau does not systematically analyze data on hiring times. Without reliable data on hiring times, Interior's bureaus cannot identify how long it takes to complete individual stages in the hiring process or effectively implement changes to expedite the hiring process.", "According to BLM, BOEM, and BSEE officials, hiring and retention challenges have made it more difficult to carry out oversight activities in some field offices. For example, many BLM and BSEE officials GAO surveyed reported that vacancies have resulted in a reduction in the number of inspections conducted. As a result of these challenges, bureau officials cited steps they have taken to address vacancies in key positions, such as borrowing staff from other offices or using overtime, but these solutions are not sustainable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of the Interior explore the bureaus' expanded use of recruitment, relocation, retention, and other incentives and systematically collect and analyze hiring data.

The Department of  the Interior (Interior), which oversees the development of federal oil and  gas resources, collecting nearly $10 billion in fiscal year 2012 in royalties  and other payments from oil and gas companies. Onshore, Interior  oversees about 700 million subsurface acres, including minerals beneath  more than 245 million federally managed surface acres. Offshore, Interior  oversees more than 1.7 billion acres in the waters of the Outer  Continental Shelf, which includes submerged lands in federal waters off  the coast of Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic and Pacific  coasts. Interior\u2019s responsibilities include administering leases; reviewing  and approving oil and gas companies\u2019 (operators) plans, and applications  for permit to drill (APD); inspecting oil and gas operations, such as drilling  rigs and production platforms, to ensure compliance with safety and  environmental regulations; and determining how much oil and gas is  produced from federal lands and waters to calculate royalties and other  revenues due to the federal government.", "Three bureaus within Interior provide oversight of oil and gas activities on  federal lands and waters: (1) the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),  which oversees onshore federal oil and gas activities; (2) the Bureau of  Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which oversees offshore oil and  gas leasing; and (3) the Bureau of Safety and Environmental  Enforcement (BSEE), which reviews applications from operators and  conducts inspections of offshore oil and gas activities. In addition, a fourth  office, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, is responsible for  collecting revenues owed to the federal government by operators  producing oil and gas on federal leases, both onshore and offshore. To  do this work, Interior employs highly trained specialists and scientists  such as archeologists, geologists, biologists, environmental protection  specialists, inspectors, and petroleum engineers. In March 2010, we  reported that Interior faced various human capital challenges, including  hiring and retaining staff and, as a result, had difficulty meeting its  responsibilities to oversee oil and gas activities on offshore federal  leases.", "The April 2010 explosion and fire onboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling  rig\u2013\u2013which resulted in 11 deaths, serious injuries, and the largest marine  oil spill in the history of the United States\u2013\u2013highlighted the importance of  effective oversight of oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters.  Since that event, Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas resources  has faced additional scrutiny by us and others. In light of the problems  that we and others have identified\u2014including Interior\u2019s ongoing human  capital challenges\u2014in February 2011, we added Interior\u2019s management  of federal oil and gas resources to our list of U.S. government programs  at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement or in need of  broad reform. In July 2012, we reported, among other things, that BOEM  and BSEE continued to face challenges hiring and retaining staff for  oversight of oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico and did not have a  strategic workforce plan in place to outline strategies to address its  human capital challenges.", "Furthermore, increasing oil prices, along with advances in technologies,  such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in shale formations  onshore and deepwater drilling offshore, have made it possible to develop  substantially more oil and gas resources than ever before. These  technological advances make it imperative that Interior be able to hire and  retain sufficient staff with the skills and experience needed to oversee the  changing oil and gas industry in an efficient and effective way. This report  responds to your request that we review the current status of Interior\u2019s  human capital challenges. Accordingly, this report examines: (1) the  extent to which Interior continues to face challenges hiring and retaining  key oil and gas staff and the causes of these challenges; (2) Interior\u2019s  efforts to address its hiring and retention challenges; and (3) the effects, if  any, of hiring and retention challenges on Interior\u2019s oversight of oil and  gas activities.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant laws and Interior\u2019s guidance,  as well as independent studies by Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General  and others. We also interviewed officials from BLM, BOEM, and BSEE.  Specifically, we interviewed BLM field office officials in Bakersfield,  California, which oversees some of the highest producing federal onshore  leases in the country, and Dickinson, North Dakota, which has  experienced a rapid increase in industry activity in recent years. We  interviewed BOEM and BSEE officials in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and  Pacific regional offices; and BSEE officials in all five Gulf of Mexico  district offices. In addition, to determine the extent to which Interior  continues to face hiring and retention challenges across the department  and the possible effects of these challenges, we surveyed management  officials representing all of Interior\u2019s offices responsible for oil and gas  oversight\u20143 BOEM regional offices, 5 BSEE district offices and 3 BSEE  regional offices, and 33 BLM field offices and one BLM state office. We  received responses from 40 of the 44 field offices (i.e., 30 of the 34 BLM  offices, 7 of the 7 BSEE offices, and 3 of the 3 BOEM offices) for an  overall response rate of 91 percent.", "To examine the extent to which Interior continues to face challenges  hiring and retaining key oil and gas personnel and the causes of these  challenges, we analyzed statistical data on attrition and retirement  eligibility from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Enterprise  Human Resources Integration (EHRI) database of federal civilian  employees and reviewed and analyzed Interior data on vacancies and  hiring times. We also analyzed Bureau of Labor Statistics data to  compare industry and federal government salaries for oil and gas  positions. To identify key Interior oil and gas oversight positions, we  interviewed Interior officials and reviewed Interior staffing data. We  determined the following are the key BLM oil and gas oversight positions:  petroleum engineers, petroleum engineering technicians (inspectors),  natural resource specialists, environmental protection specialists, and  geologists. Similarly, we determined that the key BOEM and BSEE oil  and gas oversight positions are petroleum engineers, inspectors,  biologists (natural resource specialists), geophysicists, and geologists.  To examine Interior\u2019s efforts to address its hiring and retention  challenges, we reviewed documents such as strategic workforce plans  and other documents outlining steps Interior has taken with regard to  hiring and retention and spoke with officials responsible for their  implementation. We also discussed special salary rates for specific  positions with officials from OPM, as well as BOEM, BSEE, and BLM. To  examine the effects, if any, of hiring and retention challenges on Interior\u2019s  oversight of federal oil and gas activities, we surveyed BLM, BOEM, and  BSEE field offices about the factors affecting their ability to hire and retain  key oil and gas oversight staff and how vacancies of key positions have  affected day-to-day operations. We also analyzed BSEE inspection data  from the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Regions\u2014where nearly all federal  offshore drilling has occurred\u2014for fiscal years 2010 through 2012.  Appendix I presents a more detailed description of our objectives, scope,  and methodology, appendix II presents more information about our  survey, and appendix III presents more information about our analysis of  BSEE inspection data.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to January 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

BLM manages  onshore oil and gas activities, and BOEM and BSEE manage offshore oil  and gas activities.", "Onshore. BLM manages more than 245 million surface acres of federal  land for multiple uses, including recreation; range; timber; minerals;  watershed; wildlife and fish; natural scenic, scientific, and historical  values; and for the sustained yield of renewable resources. BLM  oversees onshore oil and gas development on and under BLM-managed  federal lands, under other federal agencies\u2019 lands, and under private  lands for which the federal government has retained mineral rights\u2014 totaling about 700 million subsurface acres. BLM manages these  responsibilities through its headquarters office in Washington, D.C.; 12  state offices; 38 district offices; and 127 field offices. BLM\u2019s headquarters  office develops guidance and regulations for the bureau, and the state,  district, and field offices manage and implement the bureau\u2019s programs.  BLM\u2019s oil and gas development oversight efforts are led by 33 field offices  located primarily in the Mountain West\u2014the center of much of Interior\u2019s  onshore oil and gas development and production\u2014although some BLM  offices in other locations have small oil and gas programs that are  administered with the assistance of these 33 offices (see fig. 1). Across  these offices, BLM employs petroleum engineers, natural resource  specialists, geologists, and other scientists to carry out land-use planning  efforts and review and approve APDs before operators can begin to drill  any new oil or gas wells. Operators that obtain leases for oil and gas  development are required to submit to BLM (onshore) or BSEE (offshore)  an APD for approval before beginning to drill any new oil or gas wells.  The APD contains a detailed set of forms and documents that specify  requirements that the operator must follow when drilling. In addition, other  specialists, including petroleum engineering technicians, carry out a  variety of oil and gas inspections, including drilling inspections, production  inspections, and environmental compliance inspections.", "Offshore. BOEM and BSEE oversee all offshore oil and gas activities on  federal leases in the United States. Through its three regional offices\u2014 in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific\u2013\u2013Interior manages more  than 1.7 billion offshore acres. The vast majority of Interior\u2019s offshore oil  and gas development and production occurs in the Gulf of Mexico;  accordingly, the majority of BOEM\u2019s and BSEE\u2019s workforces are located  in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Region. BOEM and BSEE  also have offices in the Pacific and Alaska Outer Continental Shelf  Regions (see fig. 2). BOEM employs petroleum engineers, geoscientists,  and other specialists who are responsible for leasing and resource  management, and BSEE employs petroleum and other engineers,  inspectors, and other specialists who are responsible for reviewing and  approving APDs and conducting drilling and production inspections to  ensure that operators comply with all regulatory requirements.", "Over the last decade, we have reported on Interior\u2019s persistent challenges  hiring and retaining sufficient staff to provide efficient and effective  oversight of oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters, and we  have made a number of recommendations to Interior to address these  challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hiring", "paragraphs": ["In June 2005, we reported that BLM did not have sufficient staff to  manage the increasing demand for onshore oil and gas drilling  permits while fulfilling its environmental protection responsibilities.  We recommended that BLM ensure that its staffing needs are  accurately reflected in its workforce plans. In response to this  recommendation, BLM analyzed the staffing levels needed to process  drilling permits and used this analysis to fill additional inspection and  environmental monitoring positions.  In March 2010, among other things, we reported that BLM field offices  were unable to hire and retain sufficient numbers of staff to complete  all required inspections. We reported that, according to BLM  officials, low pay when compared with industry salaries and the high  housing costs in energy boom towns were major factors affecting their  ability to hire sufficient numbers of staff. We recommended that  Interior determine what additional policies or incentives were  necessary, if any, to attract and retain staff. Interior agreed with our  recommendation, and we are evaluating the actions they have taken,  including developing a workforce strategy and issuing guidance for  the use of recruitment and retention incentives.  In June 2012, we reported that salaries for some key oil and gas  oversight positions\u2014which are generally set by the federal salary  schedule\u2014were significantly lower than salaries offered by industry  for candidates with similar skills, and that top applicants are typically  hired by the petroleum industry, leaving Interior with less-skilled  applicants. To improve Interior\u2019s oversight of oil and gas activities in  the Gulf of Mexico, we recommended that Interior assess how the  number of inspectors affects the agency\u2019s ability to conduct monthly  inspections and whether the monthly inspection goals were  appropriate. Interior agreed with our recommendation but has not fully  taken action to address it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retention", "paragraphs": ["In August 2013, we reported that BLM also faces challenges in  retaining its oil and gas staff and in hiring new employees, including  staff responsible for environmental inspections and enforcement. BLM  officials told us that some environmental protection positions were  unfilled for long periods, and new hires were often inexperienced and  required greater supervision, limiting their effectiveness. We did not  make any recommendations that directly addressed this concern.  In March 2010, we reported that BLM had experienced high turnover  rates in key oil and gas inspection and engineering positions from  2004 through 2008, and that this high turnover resulted in a greater  reliance on less-trained and less-experienced staff.  In July 2012, we reported that Interior continued to face workforce  planning challenges following a reorganization effort to improve its  oversight of oil and gas activities in the wake of the April 2010 oil spill  in the Gulf of Mexico. In particular, we found that Interior had not  developed a strategic workforce plan that outlined specific strategies  to help address recruitment and retention challenges. We  recommended that BOEM and BSEE develop a strategic workforce  plan that would determine the critical skills and competencies needed  to achieve current and future programmatic results and develop  strategies to address critical skills gaps. In response to this  recommendation, BSEE completed its workforce plan in September  2013, and BOEM officials told us that they will complete their plan in  fiscal year 2014.", "In addition to our work, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) and  others have reported on Interior\u2019s challenges related to hiring and  retention of key oil and gas oversight staff. With respect to hiring, in  September 2010, Interior\u2019s Outer Continental Shelf Safety Oversight  Board reported that Interior did not have a formal program for recruiting  the best candidates or well-defined career advancement and promotion  opportunities for inspectors. A December 2010 report from Interior\u2019s  Inspector General echoed that finding and concluded that the Pacific  Region faced considerable hiring challenges because of increased hiring  by the oil and gas industry, citing the industry\u2019s significant salary  advantage over federal service. With respect to retention, the Outer  Continental Shelf Safety Board also reported that Interior lacked a formal  program for retaining the most-qualified inspectors. Moreover, the report  found that in the Pacific Region, 8 out of 10 staff responsible for  permitting were eligible for retirement within the next 3 years. In  December 2010, Interior\u2019s Inspector General reported that, in spite of the  considerable investment in both time and money for inspector training,  BLM\u2019s inspection and enforcement program risked losing its inspectors  once they were trained because trained inspectors were highly sought by  industry. Interior\u2019s Inspector General reported that oil and gas operators  commonly recruit petroleum engineering technicians by offering high  salaries during successful business periods, and recommended, among  other things, that BLM consider developing and implementing a continued  service agreement requiring newly certified inspectors to stay with the  bureau for a specified period of time following certification. In February  2013, BLM issued guidance that requires the use of a mandatory service  agreement for inspectors as a condition of employment. According to the  guidance, if an inspector voluntarily separates from BLM within 2 years of  certification, the inspector will have to reimburse BLM the full cost of the  training, which is estimated at $48,000 per certification.", "In 2011, we added Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas resources  to our list of programs at high risk for waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement in part because Interior continued to experience  problems hiring and retaining sufficient staff to provide oversight and  management of oil gas operations on federal lands and waters. More  broadly, in 2001 we added strategic human capital management across  the federal government to our high-risk list. At that time, we highlighted  various challenges the federal government faces, including strategic  human capital planning, succession planning, and acquiring and  developing staff sufficient to meet agencies\u2019 needs. We concluded that  these challenges may leave agencies unable to effectively, efficiently, and  economically perform their missions. In addition, we have issued a  series of reports highlighting human capital challenges at individual  federal agencies\u2014including the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Food and  Drug Administration, and the Department of State\u2014and these reports  highlight problems similar to the problems at Interior.", "The federal government has made substantial progress addressing its  human capital challenges over the past 12 years. As we noted in  September 2012, both Congress and OPM have taken several actions in  this regard. For example, in 2002, Congress created a chief human  capital officer position in 24 agencies to advise and assist the head of  these agencies and other agency officials in their strategic human capital  efforts. In addition, in 2002 and 2004, Congress provided agencies with  additional authorities and flexibilities to manage the federal workforce,  such as the authority to offer recruitment bonuses. In 2005, and again in  2008, OPM issued guidance on the use of hiring authorities and  flexibilities. In 2008, OPM launched an 80-day hiring model to help speed  the hiring process. In 2012, OPM launched the Pathways Programs to  recruit and hire students and recent graduates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Interior Continues to Face Challenges Hiring and Retaining Key Oil and Gas Staff Primarily Because of Higher Industry Salaries and the Lengthy Federal Hiring Process", "paragraphs": ["Interior continues to face challenges hiring and retaining key oil and gas  staff\u2014particularly petroleum engineers, inspectors, and geologists.

In addition, many field offices reported difficulties retaining key oil  and gas staff, and officials told us that they are concerned that key staff  will leave for industry. (See app. II for information regarding survey  responses.) With the exception of BLM\u2019s petroleum engineers (21.7  percent attrition) and BSEE inspectors (10.1 percent attrition), however,  the attrition rate for other key oil and gas staff for fiscal year 2012 was  less than the rest of the federal government, which had an average 9.1  percent attrition rate for all federal positions. Nonetheless, field office  officials told us that attrition raises concerns because it is not unusual for  some field offices to have only one or two employees in any given  position, meaning that a single retirement or resignation can significantly  affect office operations. At BLM, the fiscal year 2012 attrition rate for  petroleum engineers was over 20 percent, or more than double the  average federal attrition (see fig. 3). Significantly, resignations rather than  retirements, accounted for nearly half of BLM\u2019s petroleum engineer  attrition rate, suggesting that petroleum engineers sought employment  opportunities outside the bureau.", "Hiring and retention problems appear to be more acute at offices where  industry activity is greatest. For example, attrition rates for BLM oil and  gas oversight positions\u2014especially petroleum engineers\u2014appeared to be  higher at field offices where industry submitted the highest number of  APDs in recent years. From 2010 to 2012, at the five BLM field offices  that received the highest number of APDs, the average attrition rate for  petroleum engineers was 21.2 percent annually, while the average  attrition rate for petroleum engineers at all other BLM field offices was  11.4 percent. At a BLM field office in North Dakota, which has  experienced significant new industry activity in recent years, APDs have  increased from 84 in fiscal year 2007 to 287 in fiscal year 2012. Office  managers from this field office told us that they have been understaffed  for the past few years and struggled to hire sufficient numbers of staff to  meet the increased APD and inspection workload. Officials at BOEM\u2019s  Alaska Regional Office, where both BOEM and industry are preparing for  potential development of offshore oil and gas, stated that they face  challenges hiring and retaining staff because they are competing with  industry for the same small group of geologists, geophysicists, and  petroleum engineers.", "Adding to Interior\u2019s retention difficulties is the high proportion of staff in  key oil and gas positions that will be eligible to retire within a few years  (see fig. 4). For example, according to our analysis of OPM data on  federal civilian personnel, more than half of BLM petroleum engineers  and BOEM geologists will be eligible to retire by 2017 compared with a  government-wide average of about 27.5 percent for all federal employees  during the same period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Major Factors Affect Hiring and Retention of Key Oil and Gas Staff", "paragraphs": ["Interior officials widely agreed that two major factors contribute to  difficulties in hiring and retention of oil and gas oversight staff\u2014higher  salaries in industry and the lengthy federal hiring process\u2014but cited other  factors as well, including not having qualified applicants in some areas  and limited opportunities for career advancement and promotion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Higher Industry Salaries", "paragraphs": ["BLM, BOEM, and BSEE officials overwhelmingly cited the difference  between federal and industry salaries as a major factor contributing to  difficulties in hiring and retaining staff.

For example, an official from a BLM field office in  rural Colorado reported that the office was located in an area where  winter temperatures can fall to -40 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult  to attract qualified applicants and fill positions. In addition, the high cost of  living in many areas limited the pool of qualified applicants, according to  officials.

OPM initially declined the request, citing the federal salary freeze that  limited special salary rates only to agencies experiencing extraordinary  circumstances. However, OPM noted that Interior\u2019s need to quickly fill  new positions created by the reorganization of MMS, which was replaced  first by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and  Enforcement (BOEMRE) and then by BOEM and BSEE, could be  considered an extraordinary circumstance and suggested that Interior  suspend its request until Congress provides funding for the additional  positions. Interior did not resubmit its request, however, because in its  fiscal year 2012 appropriation, Congress provided a special 25 percent  base pay increase for geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers  in the Gulf of Mexico applicable to fiscal years 2012 and 2013. BOEM  and BSEE officials in the Gulf of Mexico Region noted that the actual pay  increase is lower than 25 percent because it does not include locality  pay. For example, staff in BSEE\u2019s Lake Jackson District office in Texas  did not receive a pay increase because their locality rate is higher than  the 25 percent provided by Congress. Nonetheless, BOEM and BSEE  officials in the Gulf of Mexico Region stated that this special pay authority  appears to have helped in the near term to retain some geologists,  geophysicists, and petroleum engineers.

OPM  officials told us that use of these incentives was a factor they consider  when evaluating agency requests for special salary rates. Although BLM,  BOEM, and BSEE officials told us that the use of these recruitment,  retention, and relocation awards were key options to address salary  differences with industry, our review of OPM and Interior data indicated  that they were not widely used by the three bureaus. For instance, our  assessment of Interior data indicates that Interior\u2019s use of recruitment,  relocation, and retention awards for petroleum engineers and  inspectors\u2014critical positions that the bureaus have had difficulty hiring  and retaining in recent years\u2014has been limited (see tables 3 and 4).", "BLM officials cited fiscal constraints as the primary reason why they did  not use these incentives more often. A July 2011 memorandum from  OPM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed federal  agencies to limit the use of recruitment, retention, and relocation incentive  awards to fiscal year 2010 levels. Our review of OPM data shows,  however, that in 2011Interior paid about one-third less in such awards  than it did in 2010. Specifically, in 2010, Interior paid just over $3 million  for 401 recruiting, retention, and relocation incentive awards as opposed  to 2011, when the department paid just under $2 million. As such, Interior  had the discretion to spend another $1 million on these incentive awards  in 2011 but chose not to do so even as it faced difficulty hiring and  retaining key oil and gas oversight positions.", "Other factors may have also contributed to the limited use of recruitment,  retention, and relocation incentive awards. Specifically, a BLM official  stated that there was confusion about OPM and OMB\u2019s requirement to  limit incentive awards to 2010 levels, and that some field office managers  were uncertain about the extent to which they were allowed to use these  incentive awards. A 2012 BLM report on BLM\u2019s oil and gas inspection and  enforcement workforce strategy reported that the process to request use  of these incentive awards required the development of a justification on a  case-by-case basis for each award. Therefore, it recommended  developing a \u201cbureau-wide blanket authorization\u201d for a 25 percent  recruitment and retention incentive for all petroleum engineers and  inspectors. BSEE officials, however, also described situations where  potential employees declined job offers even though they were offered  these incentive awards.

The team compared  Interior\u2019s hiring processes to OPM\u2019s 80-day hiring model and identified 27  action items to reduce hiring times, including standardizing position  descriptions and reducing the number of managers involved in the hiring  approval process. Interior and its bureaus have addressed many of these  action items over the past few years and, according to Interior officials  and agency records, made significant progress in reducing hiring times.", "For example, in 2010, BLM developed and distributed guidance to  streamline its hiring processes, including the use of standardized position  descriptions and vacancy announcements. According to Interior officials,  these steps reduced hiring times at Interior as a whole from an average of  190 days in fiscal year 2009 to 80 days in fiscal year 2012, although, as  discussed above, hiring times for some key oil and gas positions  averaged over 120 days.", "In addition, BLM, BOEM, and BSEE have taken other steps to expedite  the hiring process. To respond to the hiring needs of BOEM and BSEE  following the reorganization of BOEMRE in October 2011, BSEE hired  additional human resources staff in the Gulf of Mexico Region. In August  2012, BSEE implemented a new process that reduced the number of  days from 90 to 30 for managers to select eligible applicants. Although  this new guidance still exceeds OPM\u2019s 80-day hiring model, which  allocates 15 days for a manager to review and select eligible candidates.  BSEE\u2019s analysis of its hiring data shows that this guidance has reduced  hiring times at BSEE headquarters and two of the three BSEE regional  offices. A BLM official told us that the bureau is working on additional  initiatives to improve the efficiency of the hiring process such as  automating vacancy announcements and streamlining administrative  processes.", "However, neither the department nor the three bureaus have complete  and accurate data on hiring times that could help them identify and  address the causes of delays in the hiring process. In 2011, Interior  began reporting data on hiring times to OPM on a quarterly basis. A  senior Interior official explained that the department calculates hiring  times based on a combination of dates from Interior\u2019s personnel and  payroll databases. However, we identified instances where these data  appear to be inaccurate\u2014for example, in some cases, hiring times were  recorded as 0 days or 1 day. An official from BLM stated that the bureau  does not have a systematic approach to analyzing data on hiring times,  and neither BOEM nor BSEE collects comprehensive data that could be  used to identify delays in the hiring process so that problems can be  systematically addressed. BSEE has begun taking some informal actions  to identify the causes of delays. For example, BSEE human resources  officials said that, in August 2012, they began collecting hiring data on a  biweekly basis in a spreadsheet and tracking the status of each BOEM  and BSEE job announcement to help track the progress of individual  applicants as they move through the hiring process. To use these data to  evaluate hiring times at various stages of the hiring process, however,  BOEM and BSEE would have to manually sum how long it takes each  applicant to complete each stage of the hiring process.

BOEM and BSEE officials cited various advantages to  employment at Interior as compared with industry, including more flexible  work hours, better job satisfaction, and more employment security. For  example, according to BSEE officials, many industry oil and gas jobs  require staff to spend up to 2 consecutive weeks offshore, whereas BSEE  inspectors or engineers rarely spend more than 2 to 5 nights offshore.  One BSEE manager stated that some of its new hires are former industry  employees who do not want to be away from their families for extended  periods.

As we have  previously reported, strategic workforce planning helps an organization  align its human capital program with its current and emerging mission and  programmatic goals, as well as develop long-term strategies for acquiring,  developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. We also  previously reported on the importance of workforce planning to ensure  that programs are implemented consistently across the department.", "At the department level, Interior is currently participating in two efforts to  improve its workforce planning. First, Interior is participating in a  government-wide initiative led by OPM to identify and mitigate critical  skills gaps across the federal government. Specifically, this effort aims to  develop strategies to hire and retain staff possessing targeted skills to  help address government-wide and department-specific mission-critical  occupations and skill gaps. Second, in response to an OMB request,  Interior issued Managing People and Programs \u2013 Department of the  Interior Strategic Workforce Management Plan in March 2012, which  provided an overview of workforce planning strategies that Interior can  use to manage workforce levels in consideration of emerging needs, skills  gaps, and constrained budgets. As part of the next phase of this effort,  Interior has asked its bureaus and offices to begin developing detailed  workforce plans using a standardized model based on best practices  used at Interior. According to the March 2012 plan, these bureau-level  plans are to include a risk assessment of funding, workload, personnel,  and positions; an analysis of workforce demand and supply; a skills gap  analysis; and an action plan to mitigate risks and address skills gaps.  Because both of these initiatives are ongoing, however, it is too early to  assess the effect of these efforts on Interior\u2019s hiring and retention  challenges for key oil and gas positions.", "BLM, BOEM, and BSEE are also developing or implementing workforce  plans, which are in various stages of completion. As previously  mentioned, in July 2012, we reported that BOEM and BSEE did not have  strategic workforce plans in place and recommended that each bureau  develop such a plan. BSEE recently issued its Human Capital Strategic  Plan, 2013-2018, in September 2013. BOEM officials told us that they  expect to complete their strategic workforce plan in 2014. In March 2012,  BLM issued its Workforce Planning Strategy, 2011 to 2015, which  outlines broad, strategic objectives that addressed some key human  capital challenges but leaves the development of implementation  strategies to BLM managers at other organizational levels, including the  state office level. In addition, BLM\u2019s plan did not address challenges  with the hiring process or outline mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, or  improve the hiring process. Although BLM\u2019s plan discusses the use of  relocation and other incentive awards, it does not indicate when the use  of these incentive awards is warranted, how the effectiveness of their use  will be assessed, or how BLM will balance priorities to budget for these  incentives. It remains unclear whether these efforts will help BLM address  its human capital challenges. In addition, BLM and BSEE have a number  of planning teams working on various aspects of recruitment and  retention. In particular, these teams make recommendations for bureau  initiatives, including actions to improve the hiring process or to increase  the use of recruitment and retention incentives. These efforts, however,  do not appear to have been conducted as part of a workforce plan.", "Therefore, these efforts do not appear to have been conducted in a  coordinated and consistent manner across the bureaus or offices, and  officials do not have a basis to assess the success of these efforts or  determine whether and how these efforts should be adjusted over time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Hiring and Retention Challenges Have Made It More Difficult to Carry Out Some Oversight Activities", "paragraphs": ["Officials from BLM, BOEM, and BSEE reported that hiring and retention  challenges have had numerous effects on some field offices\u2019 operations,  including making it more difficult for some field offices to carry out  oversight activities because of position vacancies.", "Officials we interviewed and surveyed at the three bureaus reported that  their hiring and retention challenges have generally resulted in less time  available for oversight activities. These officials stated that vacancies  directly affect the number of oversight activities they can carry out\u2014 including the number of inspections they can conduct and the amount of  time they can spend processing APDs. Officials at some BLM field offices  reported that they have not been able to meet their annual inspection and  enforcement goals because of vacancies. Compounding these problems  is the fact that new staff are less experienced and, thus, less efficient in  carrying out oversight activities, according to BLM, BOEM, and BSEE  officials. In addition, officials said that experienced staff are expected to  help train and mentor new staff, which reduces the amount of time they  can spend on their own oversight work. Interior officials also told us that  retention challenges in particular have led to a loss of institutional  knowledge and fewer staff available to mentor the less-experienced  newcomers. For instance, a BOEM official in Alaska stated that the  primary effect of hiring difficulties in Alaska is the lost mentoring  opportunities for senior geologists and engineers to train new staff. He  said the work BOEM does is highly specialized and technical and that the  bureau is often not able to hire candidates with related experience, which  exacerbates the lost mentoring opportunities. In response to our survey,  officials from 13 of the 20 BLM and BSEE offices with inspector vacancies  reported that they somewhat or greatly reduced the number of  inspections conducted in 2012 compared with what they would have done  if fully staffed, and officials from 9 of the 20 offices with inspector  vacancies indicated that the thoroughness of inspections was somewhat  or greatly reduced because of these vacancies. In addition, officials from  8 of the 21 BLM and BSEE offices with petroleum engineer vacancies  indicated that vacancies somewhat or greatly reduced the number of  APDs reviewed in 2012 compared with what they would have done if fully  staffed.", "The effects of vacancies can be difficult to quantify because so much  depends on the circumstances of the office, including the type and scale  of local industry activity, as well as the field office\u2019s overall staffing levels  and ability to adjust to vacancies. BSEE officials said, however, that fewer  or less-thorough inspections may mean that some offices are less able to  ensure operator compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, as  a result, there is an increased risk to human health and safety due to a  spill or accident. According to a BSEE official, the longer federal  inspectors are away from a site, the more likely operators are to deviate  from operating in accordance with laws and regulations. In responding to  our survey, a few BLM field offices noted that hiring and retention  difficulties have hindered the development of oil and gas resources in  some cases. In particular, the survey respondents reported experiencing  delays in conducting leasing reviews, conducting resource management  plan amendment reviews, or approving seismic studies to locate oil and  gas reservoirs. For instance, in May 2013, a BLM field office postponed  all remaining oil and gas leasing activities in California for the remainder  of the fiscal year due, in part, to the need to shift staff to permitting and  inspections. In addition, according to some BSEE officials we interviewed,  field offices are not always able to reassign staff to make up for staffing  shortfalls as some positions are highly specialized.", "Officials at the three bureaus cited steps they have taken to address  vacancies in key oil and gas positions, including reassigning staff from  lower-priority to higher-priority tasks, borrowing staff from other offices, or  increasing overtime. However, each of these steps comes at a cost to the  agency and are not sustainable solutions. Interior officials stated, for  instance, that shifting staff from lower to higher priority work means that  the lower priority tasks\u2014many of which are critical to the bureaus\u2019  mission\u2014are deferred or not conducted. For example, a BLM office in  Utah reported in our survey that, while it was able to conduct all high- priority inspections, doing so delayed other priorities, such as processing  APDs and planning for an oil or gas lease sale. Similarly, offices that  borrow staff from other offices gain the ability to carry out their activities,  but this comes at a cost to the office that loaned the staff. For example,  officials from a BLM field office in North Dakota described how they  borrowed staff from a field office in Montana to help process APDs and  carry out inspections. As a result, the BLM officials in the North Dakota  field office told us they were able to make some progress to address a  backlog of APDs and complete required inspections; however, according  to BLM survey respondents, the field office work in Montana has suffered.  With regard to overtime, offices from BOEM reported in our survey that a  heavy reliance on overtime was exhausting their staff.", "Further, both BLM and BSEE are developing and implementing risk- based inspection strategies\u2014long recommended by us and others\u2014as  they work to ensure their oversight resources are efficiently and  effectively allocated; however, staffing shortfalls and turnover may  adversely affect the bureaus\u2019 ability to carry out these new strategies.  Specifically, in 2010, we found that BLM routinely did not meet its goals  for conducting key oil and gas facility inspections and recommended that  the bureau consider an alternative inspection strategy that allows it to  inspect all wells within a reasonable time frame, given available  resources. In response to this recommendation, in fiscal year 2011,  BLM implemented a risk-based inspection strategy whereby each field  office inspects the highest risk wells first. Similarly, BSEE officials told us  that they have contracted with Argonne National Laboratory to help  develop a risk-based inspection strategy.", "As part of this review, we analyzed the effect of staffing shortages on  oversight of offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico Region  and found that continued hiring difficulties could hinder implementation of  a risk-based inspection strategy. Specifically, we estimated the number of  inspections that could have been conducted in the Gulf of Mexico under  three staffing scenarios: (1) a scenario where BSEE was unable to hire  additional inspectors between fiscal years 2010 and 2012; (2) a scenario  approximating the actual number of inspectors in fiscal year 2012; and  (3) a scenario where BSEE was able to hire double the number of  inspectors it hired between fiscal years 2010 and 2012. Based on our  analysis, increasing the number of production inspectors by 14 provided  the capacity to conduct annual inspections at all or almost all Gulf of  Mexico production facilities in fiscal year 2012. If BSEE had increased the  number of production inspectors by 28 before fiscal year 2012, our  analysis indicates that it would have been able to conduct annual  inspections at all production facilities and conduct additional inspections  at some production facilities considered high risk. Even with these  additional staff, however, BSEE would not have had the capacity to  conduct additional inspections at every facility considered high risk. See  appendix III for details on our analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, Interior has navigated major challenges in its oversight of  oil and gas activities on federal lands and waters\u2014including a major  reorganization of its oil and gas oversight activities amid a dramatic  increase in domestic oil and gas development.

Interior has faced long-standing  challenges hiring and retaining these staff and, with the current energy  boom and increased industry competition for skilled workers, these  problems have been exacerbated.", "Interior and its bureaus have made some progress to address the two  major factors affecting hiring and retention of key oil and gas staff\u2014higher  salaries in industry and the lengthy federal hiring process\u2014but difficulties  persist. While federal salaries for key oil and gas positions may not match  salaries in industry\u2014particularly in periods and locations of rapid industry  growth\u2014Interior is not doing all that it can to bridge this gap. Interior has  obtained special salary rates in certain regions, such as in the Gulf of  Mexico, and for certain positions, such as petroleum engineers and  geologists, but it has not made full use of its existing authorities to offer  recruitment, retention, and relocation incentives. We recognize that the  use of these incentives comes at a cost to other programmatic efforts,  and Interior must balance these needs as it develops its workforce plans.  However, in the event that Interior applies for special salary rates for key  oil and gas positions in the future, whether from OPM or Congress,  demonstrating that it has fully utilized its existing authorities can help  support its request for such salary rates. Similarly, Interior\u2019s hiring times  for key oil and gas positions continue to lag behind hiring times for other  positions at Interior and lag behind the federal government more broadly.  However, because Interior does not systematically collect and analyze  data on its hiring process, it cannot readily identify delays in the process  or the causes of such delays.

Interior also stated that the bureaus  have begun a more systematic collection and analysis of hiring data to  identify the causes of delays and help expedite the hiring process. Interior  noted, as described in our report, that it has taken a number of actions to  address its hiring and retention challenges. Interior noted that the  continuing resolutions and sequester in fiscal years 2013 and 2014  reduced funds available for bureaus\u2019 staffing. This required a hiring freeze  as well as a reduction to the bureaus\u2019 budget allocations for oil and gas  activities. Interior also noted that, beginning in fiscal year 2012, the  agency requested the authority to collect fees for BLM\u2019s onshore  inspection program. Interior stated that this would increase the certainty  of available funding for staffing and help adequately fund the inspection  program. In its written comments, Interior stated that it believed it has  implemented one of our recommendations from GAO-12-423, Oil and  Gas Management: Interior\u2019s Reorganization Complete, but Challenges  Remain in Implementing New Requirements, that BOEM and BSEE need  to prepare strategic workforce plans. However, as discussed in this  report, BSEE completed its plan in September 2013 and BOEM officials  told us that they will complete their plan in fiscal year 2014.

We compared the second set  of estimates with the number of facilities that the bureau identified as high  risk in fiscal year 2012. Our model operates in two stages. The first stage  assumes that the bureau would conduct an annual inspection of each  offshore facility as provided for by OCSLA. The second stage assumes,  after annual inspections are completed, that inspectors would use the  remaining time to conduct additional inspections at high-risk facilities.  These additional inspections are not required by statute, but bureau  officials told us they are necessary to more fully ensure compliance with  regulations, and that additional staff hired prior to fiscal year 2012 would  likely have been used to carry out these additional inspections.

BSEE defines a major facility  as one that has at least six wells or more, as well as more than two  pieces of production equipment, which are components that process oil,  gas, or water, such as a separator. BSEE defines a high-risk facility by a  number of characteristics, such as the amount of oil or gas the facility  produces, whether the facility is staffed or unstaffed, and the history of the  operator\u2019s compliance with regulations. Of the inspections conducted in  fiscal year 2012, 36.9 percent were classified as major and higher-risk,  10.9 percent were classified as major and low-risk, 19.4 percent were  classified as minor and high-risk, and 31.5 percent were classified as  minor and low-risk. We included these variables in our analysis based on  the premise that larger, riskier facilities would require more time to  inspect.", "The results of the multiple regression model are presented in table 12.  Both variables were statistically significant predictors of the time required  to inspect a facility and, correspondingly, we found that the time required  to conduct an inspection varies widely by facility type. As expected, major  and high-risk facilities require the most time to inspect. On average,  inspections of such facilities require approximately 22.4 staff hours,  according to our model. By contrast, minor, low-risk facilities require the  least amount of time to inspect. On average, inspections of such facilities  require approximately 4.0 staff hours, according to our model. Other types  of facilities require a more moderate amount of time, with minor, high-risk  facilities requiring an average of 5.8 hours to inspect and major, low-risk  facilities requiring an average of 8.6 hours to inspect. To make these  predictions, we transformed the estimates from the regression equation,  which are on a logarithmic scale, to a linear scale.", "The model has a good fit based on the F statistic (p<.001) and predicts 37  percent of the variance in the time required to conduct an inspection  (adjusted R=0.37).

A Monte Carlo  simulation is a type of numerical analysis that produces a range of  estimates to account for the random variability among inspections and the  statistical uncertainty in the model\u2019s equations. In this case, we used a  Monte Carlo simulation to account for the variability in the number of  hours necessary to inspect each facility and the number of inspections  conducted by each inspector. For instance, BSEE officials told us that  some facilities may take longer to inspect than others because of factors  that are difficult to account for, such as the availability and ability of the  operator\u2019s onboard personnel on offshore facilities being inspected.  Similarly, not all inspectors spend the same amount of time conducting  inspections each year, so there is some variability in the total amount of  time that a given number of inspectors would spend on production  inspections.", "The Monte Carlo simulation entailed several key steps. For each staffing  scenario, the model estimates the amount of time that a given number of  inspectors has available for conducting production inspections, taking into  account the variation we found in our analysis of BSEE\u2019s fiscal year 2012  inspection records. On average, production inspectors spent 627 hours  conducting production inspections, though some inspectors spent  considerably more time, and others spent considerably less time. The  model also estimates the number of hours required to inspect each facility  for each staffing scenario, taking into account the variability in inspection  times we found in the multiple regression model described above. The  model then simulates facility inspections until the total number of hours  available for inspections is reached. If all facilities are able to be  inspected within the total number of available hours, the model uses the  remaining time to simulate additional inspections beginning with the high- risk facilities. When the total number of available hours is reached, the  model stops simulating inspections and calculates the total number of  facilities inspected. The model repeats each of these steps 1,000 times to  produce 1,000 estimates of the total number of facilities inspected for a  given number of inspectors. Collectively, these 1,000 estimates  characterize the range of uncertainty in the bureau\u2019s capacity to conduct  inspections for each of the staffing scenarios. To further assess the  accuracy of the model, we compared the number of inspections estimated  by our model with the number of inspections conducted by BSEE in fiscal  year 2012.

Second, because of the natural variability in  inspections\u2014such as variations in the amount of time that inspectors  spend inspecting production facilities during a year and the number of  hours required to inspect a given facility\u2014it is difficult to make precise  predictions about the outcomes of any given staffing scenario. Third,  because our estimates are based on data from fiscal year 2012, our  results may not apply to future years if future years differ significantly.
