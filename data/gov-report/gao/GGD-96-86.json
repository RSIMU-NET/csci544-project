Concessions services included, but were not limited to, food operations, vending machines, retail shops, public pay telephones, barber/beauty shops, transportation, lodging, marinas, and campgrounds. We excluded day care centers, employee association stores, and services provided by visually impaired persons under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.", "Under concessions agreements with federal agencies, private parties and nonfederal public entities, such as local governments, supply many of the services and accommodations provided on federal property to the public. Each year, millions of people use the services made possible through these agreements. Some agreements are long-term and some are short-term. A long-term agreement, which generally involves a large financial investment by the concessioner for construction or capital improvements, may last up to 50 years. A short-term permit or license, which generally requires little or no financial investment in facilities by the concessioner, may last up to 5 years.", "Each agency is responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring its concessions program to ensure that the federal government receives a fair return from the partnership. No overall federal concessions policy exists. In exchange for use of federal property, concessioners pay the government a concessions, franchise, permit, or license fee. Most agreements provide that the concessioner will pay the government either a flat fee or a percentage of gross revenues.", "The primary purpose of the six land management agencies\u2019 concessions programs is to encourage operation of a public-private partnership to provide recreation for visitors to national parks, forests, and other public lands and waters.

Further, if concessions services in agencies were provided under agreements with GSA, we requested agencies not to include these operations in their responses. GSA agreed to include these concessions in its response.", "Our information on the concessions agreements comes from only the agency\u2019s questionnaire responses for the agreements. However, we checked selected responses against copies of the concessions agreements sent to us, checked agency totals for concessions revenues and fees against our prior reports, and followed up with agency staff in selected cases to clarify their responses.", "Because agencies did not collect revenue data on all concessions, we could calculate the rate of return only for those agreements where agencies reported both the revenues and fees. As shown in appendix III, we used the detailed information they provided on agreements containing both revenue and fee data that were either initiated or extended in fiscal year 1994. From this reported information, we calculated the rate of return by dividing gross revenues into the sum of concessions fees and special accounts.", "To determine how the federal government\u2019s rate of return compared with that of other governments, we also sent a questionnaire to five state governments and Canada. We selected the five states\u2014California, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, and Tennessee\u2014on the basis of each government\u2019s rate of return that was collected by the National Parks and Conservation Association. This Association is a private, nonprofit citizens organization organized to protect, preserve, and enhance the U.S. National Park System. We also visited two of the states\u2014Maryland and Tennessee\u2014and met with their key concessions managers.

We did our work in Washington, D.C.; Nashville, Tennessee; and Annapolis, Maryland. Because it was impractical for us to obtain comments from all 75 agencies, we provided copies of a draft of this report to the heads of the departments of the 6 land management agencies for comment. The six agencies accounted for over 92 percent of the concessions. On March 25, 1996, we discussed the draft report with officials designated by the departments.

However, the actual amount of gross revenues was greater because some agencies did not collect gross revenue data from all concessioners. Eight of the 42 agencies or agency components with concessions reported that some concessioners were not required to report revenues, particularly those paying a flat concessions fee. Some agency officials said they had no requirement to track concessioners\u2019 revenues when concessioners paid a flat concessions fee. However, the National Park Service said it plans to change this practice in the future, because some of these agreements may be conducive to competitive agreements.", "As shown in table 2, agencies reported that the government received over $82 million from concessions operations during fiscal year 1994.", "The reported $82.5 million of government receipts includes funds that concessioners deposited into special accounts that officials said are primarily used for repairs and improvements to facilities on government property.", "Nine of the 42 agencies or agency components also estimated that concessioners provided an additional $4.7 million in nonfee compensation by maintaining government property. This amount is not included in table 2. Some agency officials said they estimated nonfee compensation value by considering what the cost would have been for the agency to perform the work, obtaining quoted prices from vendors, using receipts maintained by the concessioners, and reviewing concessioners\u2019 annual financial reports. This estimated value likely did not include the total nonfee value; some agencies said they did not monitor the value of concessioners\u2019 maintenance of government property for various reasons, including the difficulty of distinguishing between maintenance costs for federal property and concessioners\u2019 property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Rate of Return on Concessions Agreements Either Initiated or Extended During Fiscal Year 1994", "paragraphs": ["As shown in appendix III, our analysis of financial data from the questionnaire showed a 3.6 percent rate of return to the government on reported concessioners\u2019 revenues from concessions agreements either initiated or extended in fiscal year 1994.

As shown in appendix V, Canada and the four states reported that their concessions services included marinas, food service operations, campgrounds, and retail sales\u2014some of the same types of services reported by the agencies we surveyed.", "All four states and Canada said they generally compete concessions agreements. They said that key factors for selecting concessioners were the amount of fees generated for the government and bidders\u2019 experience and financial status. According to state officials, agreements exempted from competition included short-term permits expecting to gross a low level of revenue, generally $5,000 or less. Officials for one state also said the state would enter into a noncompetitive agreement with a business that initiated a proposal for a concession, but if the operation proved lucrative after 1 year, the state would renegotiate the concessions agreement through a competitive process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting the Rate of Return From Concessions", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed numerous factors to determine their impact on the rate of return, including competition, background of concession staff, type of service, agencies\u2019 retention of concessions fees, and the methods used to determine concessions fees. Questionnaire data showed that although some of these factors affected the rate of return to the government, others did not. For example, our analysis of the reported data showed that the lack of a procurement background for concessions staff did not have an impact on the rate of return. In addition, officials from the five states said none of their concessions staff had procurement backgrounds. They reported that they had contracting officers to set policies but delegated concessions management to park managers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competition Resulted in a Higher Rate of Return From Concessions Operations", "paragraphs": ["As shown in appendix VI, concessions agreements entered into on a competitive basis had higher rates of return than those that were not competed. Our calculated rate of return for agreements where agencies reported that they competed concessions fees was 5.1 percent, compared to a 2.0-percent rate when agencies reported that they did not use competition. The impact of competition on the rate of return remained when the differences among services were considered.", "Detailed analysis of reported information on the recreation service providing the highest rate of return in the land management agencies\u2014campground\u2014showed that competition was a factor. For campground permits where agencies reported both revenue and fee data, agencies reported that they competed 82 percent of the permits issued in fiscal year 1994. Campground permits that agencies reported competing averaged a 7.1 percent rate of return compared to a 4.1-percent rate of return for campground permits agencies said they issued noncompetitively.", "Questionnaire information showed that nonland management agencies competed more of their concessions than the land management agencies. Information on 2,234 concessions agreements reporting both revenue and fee data detailed how they were entered into during fiscal year 1994. The information showed that nonland management agencies entered into 101 of the agreements and competed 96 percent of them, and the land management agencies initiated 2,133 of these concessions agreements and competed 8.6 percent of them. Nonland management agencies reported that they either entered into concessions agreements using the Federal Acquisition Regulation or other policies that under most circumstances provide for competition.", "Most land management agencies generally have discretion whether to compete concessions agreements. The Concessions Policy Act of 1965, governing National Park Service concessions, is the only law covering concessions in land management agencies that specifically requires competition. The act requires the National Park Service to give the public the right to compete for concessions contracts. However, competition is limited by the requirement that existing concessioners who perform satisfactorily be given a preferential right of contract renewal when the agreement expires.", "Officials in the land management agencies said that more competition is needed, but they also said it can not always be used. They said some operations could not be competed, such as ski areas where major portions of the operations are located on private land and the concessioners have a substantial financial investment in the activities. In such situations, the federal government\u2019s land is usually needed to complete a service, such as adding a ski lift or extending a ski lift to the top of a mountain.", "However, they noted that other activities, such as river running, jeep tours through scenic areas, and hunting trips, were very profitable to concessioners and conducive to competition. On the basis of questionnaire data, we determined that 6 of these types of concessions were among the 50 concessions with the highest reported gross revenues to the concessioners in our survey and were initiated in fiscal year 1994.

The rate of return on agreements where agencies reported that they were authorized to retain over 50 percent of the fees was 3.3 times the rate on agreements where agencies reported that over 50 percent of the fees were to be deposited into the Department of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Further questionnaire data analysis showed that concessions with the highest gross revenues in our survey managed by agencies retaining fees averaged an 11.1 percent rate of return to the government. In contrast, the reported data showed that this category of concessions managed by agencies that did not retain fees averaged a 2.6 percent rate of return.", "Additionally, five nonland management agencies (with authority to retain fees) reported 5 percent of the total agreements and 3 percent of concessioners\u2019 gross revenues but reported 18 percent of concessions fees. In contrast, the six land management agencies (without authority to retain their fees) reported 93 percent of the total agreements and 93 percent of concessioners\u2019 gross revenues but reported 73 percent of concessions fees, as shown in table 3. Therefore, agencies authorized to retain fees reported obtaining more fees in proportion to their concessioners\u2019 gross revenues than agencies that were not authorized to retain fees.", "Generally, agencies are not authorized to retain and use money they receive from outside sources in the absence of express statutory authority to do so. As shown in figure 1, most concessions fees are to be deposited into the Department of the Treasury as general miscellaneous receipts.", "Since agencies that collect concessions fees generally are not able to use them, they have less incentive to maximize fees. An official from one of the agencies that retained fees said that since the fees support agency operations, staff put forth extra effort to obtain a high rate of return on concessions. About 70 percent of the 42 agencies or agency components responding to our survey said retaining fees is or would be beneficial to them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preferential Right of Contract Renewal Reduces Competition", "paragraphs": ["The Concessions Policy Act of 1965 grants existing National Park Service concessioners a preferential right of contract renewal when their agreements expire. Under the legislation, the Secretary of the Interior is to give preference to the renewal of a concessions contract to existing concessioners who have satisfactorily performed their obligations. Under the Department of the Interior\u2019s regulations, the preferential right for contract renewal is the right of incumbent concessioners to match or better the best offer received from firms competing for the concessions contract. The existing concessioner must have performed satisfactorily and must have been under the existing contract for 2 years.", "This preference reduces competition because it may limit the number of prospective concessioners. Businesses are reluctant to expend time and money preparing bids in a process where the award is most likely going to the incumbent contractor. The National Park Service said that between 1985 and 1989, 28 of 29 contracts up for renewal were awarded to the incumbent concessioner.", "The National Park Service reported 23 of the 50 concessions agreements with the highest revenues reported in our survey. On the basis of the reported data, when 17 of the contracts were last awarded, the incumbent concessioners received preferential right of contract renewal and received 16 of the contracts, with 1 contract awarded to a new concessioner.

The Concessions Policy Act of 1965 gives National Park Service concessioners the right to be compensated for improvements they construct on federal lands, which is called possessory interest. The legislation specifies that unless otherwise provided by agreement, the compensation must be based on \u201csound value,\u201d which is generally defined as reconstruction cost less depreciation, not to exceed fair market value. Either the National Park Service or a successor concessioner has the liability to pay the concessioner sound value compensation. According to National Park Service officials, this valuation limits the number of businesses submitting offers for concessions.", "In 1993, the National Park Service issued a new policy covering standard concessions contract language, which included a provision to reduce possessory interest for contracts awarded after January 7, 1993. The policy revises the calculation of possessory interest to \u201cfair value,\u201d which is defined as the original cost of improvements less straight-line depreciation. This change is being challenged by the National Park Hospitality Association in the courts on the basis that the new policy is not in accordance with the Concessions Policy Act of 1965.", "Officials from the four states and Canada said their regulations do not allow concessioners to acquire possessory interests. However, they said they consider the amount of a concessioner\u2019s investment when deciding the length of the contract. According to the officials, concessioners are given enough time to make a profit and amortize their investments, but the maximum term of contracts is 20 years.", "Calculation of questionnaire data on the National Park Service concessions that reported both revenue and fee data for contracts either awarded or extended during fiscal year 1994 showed that:", "New and extended agreements granting possessory interest resulted in a rate of return of 3.8 percent, and those without possessory interest resulted in a rate of return of 4.5 percent.", "New agreements with preferential right of contract renewal resulted in a 3.8 percent rate of return, and those without the preference resulted in a rate of return of 6.4 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reported Nonconcessions Activities Generating Income", "paragraphs": ["Fifty components from 29 of the 75 federal agencies we surveyed said they received income of $20.5 billion in 1994 from activities that were not concessions.

Officials from the Forest Service and the Bureau of Reclamation noted that high investments made by some concessioners also affect the rate of return that the government receives, which our report recognizes.", "The National Park Service official said the report highlighted two factors required by legislation\u2014preferential right of contract renewal to the existing contractor and granting possessory interest to concessioners\u2014that affect the agency\u2019s rate of return. He added that three other factors also affect the rate of return: (1) the National Park Service\u2019s periodic operational reviews of concessioners, which may increase maintenance costs of concessioners; (2) the legislatively required rate control of concessioners\u2019 prices for goods and services; and (3) the expense for financial audits to concessioners grossing over 1 million dollars annually that the National Park Service requires. Our review was not designed to measure what impact, if any, that operational reviews or rate controls have on a concessioner\u2019s profitability or whether all concessioners had financial audits. We would expect, however, that economic market forces for large dollar value concessions would be similar for the National Park Service and other agencies\u2019 concessions. It is likely that all larger concessioners would incur the costs of financial and routine maintenance audits, regardless of the agencies\u2019 requirements. Also with respect to prices, the legislative requirement calls for National Park Service concessioners\u2019 prices to be comparable to those of similar services and facilities under similar circumstances.

The first questionnaire requested summary information on all concessions agreements in effect during fiscal year 1994, such as the total number of agreements, concessioners\u2019 revenues, and concessions fees. The second questionnaire asked for detailed agreement-specific information on each concessions agreements either initiated or extended during fiscal year 1994. Details included the amount of revenues and fees, information on whether competition was used to select the concessioner, whether fees was one of the factors considered during competition, how competed agreements were advertised, and terms of agreements. We also requested copies of pertinent agency policies and each agreement that was either issued or extended in fiscal year 1994. The third questionnaire asked for information on agencies\u2019 income-generating activities that were not concessions.", "We pretested the questionnaires at six federal agencies or agency components: the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service, the Department of the Army Corps of Engineers, the General Services Administration, the Smithsonian, and the Department of the Interior\u2019s National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service. These agencies\u2014the land management agencies in particular\u2014are responsible for most federal concessions. We revised the questionnaires on the basis of their detailed feedback.", "For the purpose of this assignment, we defined \u201cconcessions\u201d as private or public entities using federally owned/leased property under a government permit, contract, or other similar agreement to provide recreation, food, or other services to either the general public or specific individuals. Concession services included, but were not limited to, food operations, vending machines, retail shops, public pay telephones, barber/beauty shops, transportation, lodging, marinas, and campgrounds. We excluded day care centers, employee association stores, and services provided by the visually impaired under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. State governments manage Randolph-Sheppard concessions that are on federal property. Further, if concessions services in an agency were provided under an agreement with GSA, we requested agencies not to include these operations in their response. GSA agreed to include these concessions in its response.", "All 75 agencies responded to our request. Twenty-seven of the agencies said they had at least one concessions agreement. Forty-two respondents provided concessions information, because some agencies, such as the Department of the Interior, had more than one component managing concessions (see app. II). Fifteen of the 27 agencies either initiated or extended at least 1 concession agreement during fiscal year 1994. The Central Intelligence Agency provided an oral briefing on its concessions program and did not provide any details on its concessions agreements.", "In response to our questionnaires, we received information on 5,000 concessions agreements. Our information about the agreements comes from only the agencies\u2019 questionnaire responses for the agreements. However, to check whether the questionnaires were filled out completely and accurately, we (1) checked selected responses against copies of the concessions agreements that agencies sent to us; (2) checked agency totals for concessions revenues and fees against prior GAO reports; (3) followed up with agency staff in selected cases to clarify their responses; (4) manually reviewed all pages of each form; (5) had specially trained staff convert the data to computer-readable format and verify their entries; (6) manually checked computerized data against the original forms, including all data on concessions revenues and fees; and (7) conducted computerized checks for data consistency. We analyzed the information using standard software for tabulating and analyzing data.", "To calculate the rate of return from concessions, we used questionnaire financial data for concessions agreements either initiated or extended during fiscal year 1994. From this reported information, we calculated the rate of return by dividing gross revenues into the sum of concessions fees and the amount in special accounts. For rate of return analyses, we excluded questionnaires that did not contain both gross revenue and concessions fee data.", "In addition to the questionnaire data, we also (1) interviewed federal concessions management staff at both headquarters and field levels and officials of the National Parks and Conservation Association and the National Park Hospitality Association; and (2) reviewed our previous work in this area; Inspector General reports; and laws, regulations, and policies for each federal entity\u2019s concessions operations.", "To determine how the federal government\u2019s rate of return compared with that of other governments, we used the data we obtained from objectives one, two, and four and sent a questionnaire to five state governments and Canada. We selected the five states\u2014California, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, and Tennessee\u2014on the basis of information we received from the National Parks and Conservation Association. The information showed that these five states had relatively high rates of return. We visited two of the states\u2014Maryland and Tennessee\u2014and met with their key concessions managers. We selected Canada to obtain information on another country\u2019s experience.", "We did our review from January 1995 to November 1995, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Because it was impractical for us to obtain comments from all 75 agencies, we provided copies of a draft of this report to the heads of the departments of the six land management agencies for comment. The six agencies accounted for over 92 percent of the concessions. On March 25, 1996, we discussed the draft report with officials designated by the departments.
