The act designated four major goals for the program:", "Stimulating technological innovation.", "Using small business to meet federal R&D needs.", "Fostering and encouraging participation by minorities and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation. Increasing private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D.", "Under the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-564, Oct. 28, 1992), important changes were made to the program, including greater funding because of its success and greater emphasis on the goal of commercializing technical innovations developed under the program. The program also added a provision for discretionary technical assistance, which authorized agencies to help companies with the technical and commercial aspects of their SBIR projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Administration of the SBIR Program", "paragraphs": ["In addition to establishing goals, the original legislation determined agencies\u2019 participation in and funding for the program. Agencies spending more than $100 million annually for external R&D were required to set aside not less than 1.25 percent of their total R&D funds for the SBIR program. The 1992 reauthorization directed agencies to increase the set-aside to not less than 1.5 percent in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, not less than 2 percent in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and not less than 2.5 percent in fiscal year 1997 and thereafter. This requirement will effectively double the annual funding for the program to about $1 billion. At present, 11 agencies participate in the program. The five largest, accounting for over 90 percent of all SBIR awards, include the Department of Defense (DOD); the Department of Energy (DOE); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its National Institutes of Health (NIH), in particular; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).", "The original legislation required agencies to issue a solicitation for proposals that sets the SBIR process in motion. The solicitation, a formal document issued by each agency, lists and describes the topics to be addressed by each company\u2019s proposals and invites companies to submit proposals for consideration. Each agency with an SBIR program is responsible for targeting research areas and administering its own SBIR funding agreements. Such agreements include any contract, grant, or cooperative agreement entered into between a federal agency and any small business for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work funded in whole or in part by the federal government.", "The original legislation also required the Small Business Administration (SBA) to issue policy directives for the general conduct of the SBIR programs within the federal government. The directives were to include such features as simplified, standardized, and timely SBIR solicitations; a simplified, standardized funding process; and minimization of the regulatory burden for small businesses participating in the program. Issued in January 1993, the current policy directive incorporated changes made by the 1992 legislation. Federal agencies were also required to report key data to SBA, which in turn has published annual reports on the progress of the program.", "SBA\u2019s SBIR policy directive states that to be eligible for an SBIR award, small businesses must be independently owned and operated, other than the dominant firms in the field in which they are proposing to carry out SBIR projects, organized and operated for profit, the employer of 500 or fewer employees (including employees of subsidiaries and affiliates), the primary source of employment for the project\u2019s principal investigator at the time of award and during the period when the research is conducted, and at least 51-percent owned by U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens.", "The law established a three-phase structure for the program. The first phase, not to exceed 6 months, is designed to determine the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of a proposed idea. The second phase, not to exceed 2 years, is designed to further develop the idea. The SBA policy directives established $50,000 and $500,000 as the general limits for phase I and II awards, respectively. The 1992 reauthorization directed SBA to raise these figures to $100,000 and $750,000, respectively, with an adjustment every 5 years to reflect economic and programmatic considerations.", "The third phase is somewhat more flexible and difficult to define. In general, it is expected to result in commercialization or further continuation of R&D. Unlike phases I and II, phase III has no general limits in time or dollar amounts. In addition, it can include not only federal, non-SBIR funds but private-sector funds.", "Regarding the selection of phase I proposals for SBIR awards, SBA\u2019s 1993 policy directive states that an agency\u2019s criteria shall give primary consideration to scientific and technical merit along with the potential for commercialization. According to the directive, funding for phase II shall be based upon the results of phase I and the scientific and technical merit and commercial potential of the phase II proposal.", "In reauthorizing the SBIR program, the Congress added a new feature to the program. Section 301 of the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 provides for supplying discretionary technical assistance to SBIR awardees. The provision authorizes SBIR agencies to enter into an agreement with a vendor to provide small business concerns engaged in SBIR projects with technical assistance services, such as access to a network of scientists and engineers engaged in a wide range of technologies, or access to technical and business literature available through databases. The purpose of this agreement is to assist SBIR awardees in (1) making better technical decisions regarding such projects, (2) solving technical problems that arise during the conduct of such projects, (3) minimizing technical risks associated with such projects, and (4) developing and commercializing new products and processes that might result from such projects.", "In funding this assistance, the provision authorizes not more than $4,000 for phase I award recipients and $4,000 annually for phase II award recipients. The source of the funding, however, is somewhat different for each of the phases. For phase I, the legislation specifies that the money shall be given in addition to the amount of the recipient\u2019s award. For phase II, a recipient may purchase, with funds available from SBIR awards, services in an amount not more than $4,000 per year.", "We have issued several reports on the SBIR program.

More specifically, the legislation required us to address, with respect to each agency, whether a demonstrable reduction occurred in the quality of research and, in the case of such reduction, whether an increase in the agency\u2019s SBIR participation would adversely affect the performance of the agency\u2019s research programs. The legislation also required us to address the implementation of the Discretionary Technical Assistance program. In contrast to the first two objectives, which provided specific guidance for our work, the third objective gave us greater latitude in selecting and investigating additional issues that we deemed appropriate. We focused on the issue of duplicate funding of similar proposals because of several recent occurrences.", "At the start of our review, the House Committee on Small Business directed us to focus our work on SBA as the main administrative agency for the program and on the five major funding agencies (DOD, HHS, NASA, NSF, and DOE) that accounted for more than 90 percent of the total expenditures for SBIR projects. Within HHS, our review focused on NIH, which accounted for almost all of the SBIR program at HHS.", "In responding to the first objective, we began by reviewing our earlier report that also addressed the issue of research quality in the SBIR program. In that report, we identified two ways of approaching the concern about quality. One involved an extensive questionnaire survey of project managers responsible for overseeing both SBIR and non-SBIR research; the other involved the use of a key indicator, the SBIR proposal selection rate, to show the level of competitiveness in the program.", "We decided that a questionnaire survey would be inappropriate for this interim report because very little time has elapsed since the reauthorization of the program. In fact, only the first (and smallest) of the three scheduled increases in funding had occurred at the time of our review. Consequently, we made use of the SBIR proposal selection rate as a key indicator of the quality of research proposals. We obtained data from the five major agencies for fiscal years 1991-93 regarding the number of proposals and awards. These years were selected because they provided an overview of the program just before and just after the reauthorization.", "These data enabled us to evaluate the effects of increased funding in fiscal year 1993 and compare them with the ratios in the previous 2 years. Where available, we also obtained the number of proposals that agencies deemed worthy of funding but that received no award. These data provided additional evidence of the quality of research proposals and competitiveness of the program. We further interviewed SBIR officials, mainly SBIR directors and managers, in the major agencies to obtain their views on factors affecting quality.", "In responding to the second objective, we interviewed SBA officials and SBIR officials in the major agencies regarding discretionary technical assistance and any further assistance that they may have provided. We also attended a meeting of SBIR agency officials, convened by staff of the House Committee on Small Business, that addressed agencies\u2019 concerns about implementing the technical assistance provision.", "In responding to the third objective, we focused on the problem of duplicate funding. We met with officials in NSF\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG), who have investigated this matter. We obtained documents from NSF, NASA, and Department of the Army officials regarding the problem. We also met with computer specialists from NSF, NASA, and SBA regarding their efforts to resolve this problem.", "We conducted our audit work between February 1994 and January 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, SBIR officials in the five major agencies stated that in their view, the quality of research proposals is being maintained."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Competitiveness Remained High", "paragraphs": ["Preliminary information suggests that the level of competitiveness remained high following the initial increase in funding (from 1.25 to 1.5 percent) in fiscal year 1993. At all five major agencies during fiscal year 1993, the number of proposals rose from 9 to 30 percent, and the ratio of awards to proposals remained fairly constant, ranging from 8 to 28 percent.", "One of the best indicators of the continuing quality of research proposals is the ratio of funded to unfunded proposals in the SBIR program. We used this ratio as a key indicator in our January 1989 report on SBIR. The report noted that the SBIR proposal selection process was highly competitive because a large \u201cpool\u201d of proposals was available for agencies to consider in selecting proposals that meet standards of technical quality. During fiscal years 1983-87, the percentage of phase I proposals winning phase I awards ranged from 8 to 16 percent.", "As a continuation of the results of this earlier study, we found a generally large pool of unfunded proposals evident for each of the major agencies during the last 3 fiscal years (fiscal years 1991-93). The data show that the ratio of awards to proposals by four of the five major agencies fits within the 8-to-16-percent range that we found in our previous study of the program. (The one exception, NIH, is discussed in detail later in this chapter.) In addition, among all five agencies, the data for fiscal year 1993 show virtually no change in the ratio from the previous 2 years, suggesting that the funding increase in fiscal year 1993 exerted no adverse effect on the competitiveness of the program.", "Table 2.1 shows the number of phase I proposals submitted in fiscal years 1991-93 to the five major SBIR agencies, the number of proposals funded, and the percentage of proposals funded.", "The number of proposals submitted to all five agencies increased from fiscal year 1992 to 1993. The increases ranged from a low of 9 percent at DOD to a high of more than 30 percent at DOE from fiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1993. The increases in fiscal year 1993 were important in maintaining the competitiveness of the program during the first year that the program\u2019s funding percentage increased to 1.5 percent. SBIR officials believe that there is further room for growth in the number of proposals.", "Among the five major agencies, DOD was the only one that experienced a slight decrease in proposals submitted over the 3-year interval. DOD\u2019s program director told us that the number of proposals received annually has leveled off for about the last 3 or 4 years. He did not know why the number of proposals had \u201cplateaued.\u201d He noted, however, that at national SBIR conferences sponsored by DOD and NSF, it was typical for 30 to 60 percent of the attending companies never to have participated in the program. DOD feels that this indicates that the program has not yet run out of potential sources of proposals. DOD\u2019s 9-percent increase in proposals from fiscal year 1992 to 1993 may indicate some movement beyond the plateau that the program director noted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Deemed More Proposals Worthy of Award Than They Were Able to Fund", "paragraphs": ["SBIR officials told us that the large numbers of worthy but unfunded projects indicated a continuing pool of quality proposals.

In general, the data showed substantial reserves of projects deemed worthy of funding but receiving no awards.", "For example, the Air Force funded 470 projects in fiscal year 1993, but it deemed 1,174 worthy of award. NASA funded only 346 of at least 789 projects that were considered competitive. NSF made 284 awards among 642 that were recommended for funding. The number of worthy but unfunded projects was smaller at NIH. SBIR officials cited the projects in this category in support of their view that the quality of research proposals has remained high. Additional details are provided in the next section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Agencies Stated That Quality Was Being Maintained", "paragraphs": ["Officials at individual agencies stated that the quality of research proposals was being maintained or even improved. The one exception involved NIH\u2019s National Cancer Institute (NCI), which we explored in greater detail because of a potential shortage of qualified proposals for funding in fiscal year 1993.", "DOD\u2019s SBIR director does not believe that a decline in the quality of research proposals has occurred as a result of SBIR\u2019s expansion. He said that DOD aims for about a 1-to-10 ratio of awards to proposals and that the program has maintained this ratio despite the changes in funding.", "The Air Force\u2019s SBIR program gave us a special opportunity to examine the effects of a sharp increase in funding on the quality of proposals selected for awards. The Air Force\u2019s SBIR manager noted that the program experienced a 1-year \u201cspike\u201d in funding from $70 million in fiscal year 1992 to $134 million in fiscal year 1993. According to the Air Force\u2019s SBIR manager, the data provided by the four Air Force laboratories and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, which make the awards, indicated that the Air Force was able to absorb this increase without lessening the competitiveness of the program. The Air Force received 3,010 proposals in fiscal year 1993, deemed 1,174 worthy of award, and funded 470 projects (or 16 percent). A very large increase in the number of proposals helped maintain quality and create a sizable reserve of projects deemed worthy but unfunded. The number of proposals grew from 2,119 in fiscal year 1992 to the 3,010 previously mentioned, an increase of about 42 percent.", "Data provided by the individual agencies within DOD showed a consistently large reserve of projects deemed worthy of funding but receiving no award. This pool of projects was evident, for example, not only in the Air Force, but in the Army and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. Among the Army\u2019s 2,840 proposals received in fiscal year 1993, the agency found 750 worthy of funding and made 162 awards (or 6 percent of submissions). In a similar vein, the Advanced Research Projects Agency received 1,224 proposals in fiscal year 1993, deemed 563 worthy, and funded 151 (or 12 percent of submissions).", "Among the five major agencies, NIH was the only one in which we found some cause for concern about the expansion of the program in fiscal year 1993. The problem occurred primarily in NCI, the largest of the 20 institutes. NCI accounted for about 18 percent of the program at NIH. Further information obtained for fiscal year 1994 suggests that the difficulty experienced in fiscal year 1993 is being overcome.", "Concerns about NIH\u2019s ability to absorb a funding increase have surfaced before. During our work for our June 1989 report on SBIR, which dealt in part with the advisability of a proposed increase in the funding percentage, NIH\u2019s SBIR manager analyzed the program\u2019s ability to expand. At that time, the manager concluded that a decline in quality might result from the funding of any additional projects because the number of unequivocally meritorious SBIR applications was not large enough to absorb such an increase.", "During fiscal years 1991-93, NIH\u2019s ratio of awards to proposals, at about 28 percent, was more than twice as high as that of the other agencies. Within NIH, NCI is the largest single institute, and its SBIR funding ratio in fiscal year 1993 reached almost 50 percent. In addition, NCI nearly exhausted all of the projects deemed worthy of funding during fiscal year 1993. Because of this recurrence of a concern about the quality of SBIR research proposals within NIH, we looked more closely at NIH and at NCI, in particular.", "In evaluating proposals, NIH officials group them into three basic categories: not recommended for further consideration, eligible but not funded, and actually funded. Each proposal is reviewed by a peer review panel assembled by the Division of Research Grants. The panel identifies the proposals that require no further consideration and then rates the remainder on a scale from 100 to 500, with 100 being the best score and 500 the worst. All of the projects on this scale are considered worthy of funding, even if they have received one of the less favorable ratings. The level of quality is defined in terms of the following scores:", "100 to 150: Outstanding.", "150 to 200: Excellent.", "200 to 250: Very good.", "250 to 350: Good.", "350 to 500: Acceptable.", "The funding of projects with less favorable evaluations was especially evident at NCI, although all of the projects fell into the broad general category \u201cconsidered worthy of funding.\u201d For phase I awards by NCI in fiscal year 1993, the worst score receiving an award was 399; the worst for phase II was 289. In contrast, the worst score for phase I at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders was 186; the worst for phase II was 167. In other words, NCI funded projects in all five categories of quality, whereas awards made by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders were concentrated in the \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d categories. In addition, as shown by NIH\u2019s data, NCI left only 29 of the 182 projects recommended for funding without an award. NCI funded 40 of 42 proposals in the 301-to-350 range and 7 of 18 proposals in the 351-400 range. Fifteen proposals with scores between 401 and 500 were left unfunded.", "The Chief of NCI\u2019s Extramural Financial Data Branch discussed this problem with us. He said that top NCI officials had expressed concern about the quality of research proposals in relation to the funds available in fiscal year 1993. Therefore, NCI staff conducted an assessment to assure themselves that all of the projects selected for awards were in fact worthy of funding. As a result of the review, they concluded that all of the projects selected should have been funded.", "Further information provided by the Chief indicated that the fiscal year 1993 problem was not recurring in fiscal year 1994. Of a total of 568 proposals in fiscal year 1994, 308 were not recommended for funding, 147 were considered worthy but not selected for an award, and 112 received awards. Thus, according to these data, NCI selected only about 20 percent of its proposals for awards and funded considerably less than 50 percent of the projects considered worthy of support. In addition, the data showed that the NCI phase I award with the least favorable rating (298) in fiscal year 1994 represented an improvement of 101 points over the least favorable rating for a phase I award in fiscal year 1993.", "NIH\u2019s director told us that in his view, the quality of R&D is being maintained because of the increased number of proposals. A nearly 40-percent boost has occurred in the number of proposals received by NIH as a result of the program\u2019s increased funding in the last year alone.", "The SBIR director believes that the increase in the size of the individual awards will be especially important at NIH because it will attract more proposals from somewhat larger small businesses. He noted that NIH has three proposal receipt dates each calendar year, which result in awards in the following fiscal year. Proposals received during calendar year 1992 were awarded in fiscal year 1993 at a maximum level of $50,000 for phase I and $500,000 for phase II. Therefore, although the program\u2019s expansion occurred in fiscal year 1993, proposals received for awards in that fiscal year were restricted to the previous levels of $50,000 and $500,000, respectively. The award level for phase I was increased to $75,000 (a 50-percent increase) for proposals received in calendar year 1993 and awarded in fiscal year 1994, while the size of phase II awards\u2014at $500,000\u2014remained the same (except for unique and costly projects involving special factors such as clinical trials). However, proposals received during calendar year 1994 are being solicited at the current levels of $100,000 for phase I and $750,000 for phase II. Thus, in fiscal year 1995, NIH will be making more awards at substantially higher dollar values per award, a combination that the SBIR director believes will encourage even more companies to compete, including larger small business concerns.", "The SBIR director at NASA was optimistic that the expansion of the program was not jeopardizing the quality of research proposals. Several factors accounted for his optimism. He noted that the number of applications for phase I awards has increased and that the ratio of phase I awards made to proposals received has remained about the same as in the past. He attributed the increased number of proposals to various factors, including a more general awareness of the program after 10 years and more money for the program.", "The SBIR director also pointed out that a large pool of phase I proposals was evaluated as being in the \u201ccompetitive range\u201d during fiscal years 1991-93 but received no award. In fiscal year 1993, for example, of the 2,880 proposals submitted, at least 789 were considered to be in the \u201ccompetitive range,\u201d but the number may have been as high as 952.However, only 346 (or 12 percent) received an award. Using the minimum figure of 789, slightly less than half (49 percent) of the proposals in the competitive range were actually selected for awards. Thus, although the number of awards has grown, the SBIR director believed that the level of competitiveness has remained high and the quality of research proposals may well have improved.", "SBIR managers at NSF told us that NSF divides SBIR proposals into three categories on the basis of quality\u2014declined or not recommended for funding, recommended if funding is available, and highly recommended. In general, they said that about twice as many projects are recommended or highly recommended as are actually funded. They noted, however, that they were not even able to fund all of those that were highly recommended.", "They pointed out that NSF\u2019s SBIR program is seeing a continuing increase in the number of proposals; hence, the competitive ratio of awards to proposals is being maintained. In addition, data for fiscal years 1991-93 indicated that a consistently large pool of proposals was received and recommended for funding. In fiscal year 1993, 2,201 proposals were received, 642 were recommended for funding, and 284 (or 13 percent) received awards. Less than half (44 percent) of the recommended proposals went on to win awards. In general, NSF\u2019s SBIR managers indicated that even with a substantial increase in the number of awards, they foresee no shortage of projects worthy of funding.", "The SBIR manager for DOE noted several factors that contributed to the continuing quality of SBIR research proposals. He pointed out that in fiscal year 1993, a temporary reduction in the number of awards occurred because the additional funds went into making larger individual awards rather than more awards in the aggregate. Thus, DOE made 198 phase I awards in fiscal year 1992 and only 168 phase I awards in fiscal year 1993. As shown in table 2.1, the percentage of proposals receiving awards declined from 13 percent in fiscal year 1992 to only 8 percent in fiscal year 1993, thus making the program even more competitive.", "The SBIR manager also stated that when the major funding increase occurs in fiscal year 1995, he anticipates that DOE would make about the same number of awards (198) as in fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year 1994, the size of DOE\u2019s phase II awards increased to $600,000, and in 1995 it is expected to rise to $750,000. Once again, the growth in the size of the individual awards will consume most, if not all, of the additional funds.", "At the same time, according to DOE\u2019s SBIR manager, the increase in funding will probably lead to a rise in quality because more proposals, drawn by the increased dollar amounts per award, would be competing for the same number of awards. He noted that somewhat larger small businesses would be more likely to participate as a result of the larger awards; they would be more apt to add their own funds to supplement the phase I awards in the hope of receiving phase II awards. In general, he said that DOE is already rejecting very good proposals and that the competitiveness of the program is expected to continue to increase in the next several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although it is somewhat early to draw conclusions because the major funding increases will not occur until fiscal years 1995 and 1997, several factors suggest that quality research proposals have kept pace with the SBIR program\u2019s initial expansion.

However, some SBIR officials have taken steps, independent of the provision, to provide assistance with commercialization of research conducted by SBIR companies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SBIR Officials Were Critical of the Provision", "paragraphs": ["SBIR officials at all five of the major SBIR agencies as well as SBA officials involved in the program were critical of the technical assistance provision. Officials at several agencies, including SBA, NASA, NIH, and NSF, questioned the use of SBIR funds for technical assistance. SBA\u2019s Assistant Administrator of the Office of Innovation, Research, and Technology pointed out that money for phase I awardees would be drawn from the program, which would place the need for technical assistance in competition with the need for SBIR funds for other potential awardees. NASA\u2019s SBIR director told us that NASA was reluctant to use money from the program itself because it would reduce the funds available for additional awards. NSF\u2019s SBIR managers shared this concern. NIH\u2019s SBIR manager noted that certain other agencies have been able to provide assistance from non-SBIR funds, which he considered preferable to using SBIR funds.", "SBIR officials also expressed reservations about the appropriateness of the technical (as contrasted with commercial) assistance for SBIR awardees and emphasized the need among SBIR awardees for assistance with commercialization. NASA\u2019s SBIR director told us that SBIR firms in general do not need technical assistance. He pointed out that among all SBIR agencies, the largest single portion (40 percent) of a company\u2019s score in the selection process is based on technical merit at the outset. A company would be eliminated from the competition if any indications of technical inadequacies appeared. He added that if a specific need for such assistance did arise after an award was granted, an SBIR company would be able to obtain assistance on its own without the need for special funding to seek such help.

SBA\u2019s Assistant Administrator told us that implementation would lead to difficulties because there would be a need for review and approval of each small award ($4,000 or less) to each awardee that requested funding under the provision. Officials at DOD and NSF expressed similar concerns about the potentially large number of requests and approvals that would be involved.", "Among other reasons preventing implementation, SBIR officials pointed to unrealistic requirements in the provision.

SBA\u2019s Assistant Administrator described this arrangement as a virtual impossibility. DOD\u2019s SBIR director told us that the only way one vendor could succeed would be as a broker for a host of other companies under subcontract. According to the DOD director, the concept of one small company providing all of the services for potentially hundreds of SBIR winners was otherwise impossible.", "A second problem is the clause that requires an annual selection of the vendor using competitive criteria.
