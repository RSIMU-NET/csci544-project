GAO is mandated by law to assess the extent to which MDA has achieved its acquisition goals and objectives, as reported to Congress through its acquisition baselines, and to report on other issues as appropriate. This report examines the agency's progress and any challenges in fiscal year 2013 associated with (1) developing, flight testing, and producing individual systems, which MDA refers to as BMDS elements; and (2) reporting resource and schedule baselines that support oversight. To support this effort, GAO examined MDA's acquisition and test reports, analyzed two of MDA's acquisition baselines\u2014resource and schedule\u2014to discern progress, and interviewed a wide range of DOD and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2013, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) made mixed progress in achieving its acquisition goals to develop, test, and produce elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). For the first time, MDA conducted an operational flight test that involved warfighters from several combatant commands using multiple BMDS elements simultaneously. The agency also successfully conducted several developmental flight tests that demonstrated key capabilities and modifications made to resolve prior production issues. However, the Aegis BMD and Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) continued to experience testing and development challenges.", "Aegis BMD\u2014while the program successfully conducted three intercept flight tests with the Standard Missile (SM)-3 Block IB missile in support of a full production decision planned for fiscal year 2015, a missile failed during one of these tests. Although the cause of failure is not known, the program plans to move forward with missile production in 2014. The program is also determining whether a key component that is common with the already fielded SM-3 Block IA missile will need to be redesigned.", "GMD\u2014although the program successfully conducted a non-intercept flight test of its upgraded interceptor, the program is nearing a seven year delay in completing its first successful intercept. Until this upgraded interceptor is demonstrated in an intercept test, expected to be conducted in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, manufacturing and deliveries remain on hold. In July 2013, the GMD program also failed a flight test of its fielded interceptor. This flight test was designed to assess the fielded interceptor under more challenging conditions and to confirm design changes to resolve prior issues. MDA has not yet made a decision on how to proceed since the cause of failure has not been determined.", "MDA has improved the clarity of its resource and schedule baselines since it first submitted them to Congress in 2010. However, issues with the content and presentation of these baselines continue to limit the usefulness of the information available to decision makers for oversight. First, as the agency is still in the process of improving the quality and comprehensiveness of the cost estimates that support its resource baselines, for the fourth year, GAO has found that MDA's cost estimates are unreliable. For example, MDA's 2013 cost estimates still do not include operations and support costs for military services which may significantly understate total costs. Congress has recently required MDA to include these costs in future acquisition baselines which may improve transparency. Second, MDA's schedule baselines are presented in a way that makes it difficult to assess progress. Specifically, MDA's 2013 schedule baselines include numerous events but provide very little information about them, making it difficult to understand what the events are and why they are important. Additionally, the 2013 schedule baselines do not compare the current event dates with previously reported dates, so decision makers cannot easily assess how the program is performing over time. Until MDA improves the quality and comprehensiveness of its cost estimates and the content of its schedule information, its baselines will not be useful for decision makers to gauge progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends (1) any changes to the SM-3 Block IB be flight tested before DOD approves full production; (2) retest the fielded GMD interceptor to demonstrate performance; and (3) improve the content of its schedule baselines.

This flexibility  allows MDA to develop BMDS elements outside of DOD\u2019s standard  acquisition process until they are mature enough to be handed over to a  military service for production and deployment. Because the BMDS\u2019s  entrance into DOD\u2019s acquisition process is deferred, certain laws and  policies that generally require major defense acquisition programs to take  certain steps at certain phases in the DOD acquisition process do not yet  apply to MDA. For example, before a major defense acquisition program  begins the product development phase, it must document key  performance, cost, and schedule goals in an acquisition baseline that has  been approved by a higher-level DOD official. This acquisition baseline  is used to measure a program\u2019s performance as it progresses.  Specifically, as implemented by DOD, major defense acquisition  programs\u2019 baselines provide decision makers with key goals such as the  program\u2019s total cost for an increment of work, key dates associated with  acquiring a capability, and the weapon\u2019s intended performance.  Additionally, once a baseline has been approved, DOD\u2019s major defense  acquisition programs are required to measure performance against their  baseline and report certain changes to Congress. For instance, they are  required to report certain increases in unit cost (cost divided by the  quantity produced) measured from the original and the current program  baseline.", "While this flexibility allows MDA latitude to manage the BMDS and enable  it to rapidly develop and field new systems, we have previously reported  that the agency has used this flexibility to employ acquisition strategies  with high levels of concurrency (that is, overlapping activities such as  testing and production), which increases the risk for performance  shortfalls, costly retrofits, and test problems. this flexibility has hampered oversight and accountability.MDA officials, MDA has taken some steps to identify and track  concurrency in their programs.", "We have also reported that  Congress has taken steps to improve the transparency and accountability  of BMDS development efforts.

During the test,  warfighters from several combatant commands employed multiple missile  defense systems including Aegis BMD and THAAD to demonstrate the  regional capabilities of U.S. missile defense. This is a significant  achievement because it is the first operational test that involved multiple  elements working simultaneously. To conduct this test, MDA invested in  range assets and conducted other activities to ensure it could test  multiple elements at once. For example, MDA conducted its first  integrated system-level flight test, known as Flight Test Integrated-01, in  October 2012 as a risk-reduction exercise for the operational test.  During FTO-01, MDA launched two nearly simultaneous threat- representative medium-range ballistic missile targets including its air- launched extended-medium range ballistic missile (eMRBM) target for the  first time.because of development problems associated with the eMRBM target.  MDA also had to make some adjustments to the FTO-01 test plan  because of fiscal year 2013 sequestration.

However, DOD\u2019s Director,  Operational Test and Evaluation, also found that the test failed to achieve  full integration between all systems due to challenges with system  networks, limitations in elements\u2019 ability to work together and component  failures.

These challenges delayed the SM-3 Block IB full production  authorization by more than two years to fiscal year 2015. Largely  resolving these previous challenges, in fiscal year 2013 the program  received permission to procure 33 additional initial production missiles.  Although MDA initially planned to award a contract for 29 SM-3 Block IB  missiles in fiscal year 2013, it bought four additional missiles in August  2013 to recover an earlier reduction. That reduction occurred to provide  funds to resolve technical and production issues. Based on successful  intercepts of the last three flight tests, the program also received  permission to buy 52 more interceptors in fiscal year 2014.", "Despite the three successful intercepts, the effect of the missile failure in  September 2013 on the upcoming full production decision remains  unclear. Before the program enters into full production, MDA\u2019s acquisition  management instruction requires it to demonstrate to the Under Secretary  of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics that there are no  significant risks to production and that the planned production quantities  are affordable and fully funded. The permission to enter full production is  also based on independent assessments of the weapon\u2019s effectiveness  and suitability by the DOD\u2019s Director, Operational Test and Evaluation  and the Navy\u2019s Commander Operational Test & Evaluation Force.  Although the failure investigation is ongoing, preliminary results indicate  that the failure occurred in the third-stage rocket motor, a component  common to the SM-3 Block IA, which is nearing the end of its production.  Different issues with that same component have contributed to previous  SM-3 Block IB schedule delays and production disruptions. While the  precise cause of the September 2013 failure is under review, MDA  documentation indicates that it could potentially result in design changes  to the third-stage rocket motor and changes to manufacturing processes.  Additionally, retrofits may be required for SM-3 Block IB and SM-3 Block  IA interceptors that were already produced. If design changes are  necessary, program documentation indicates that they will not be flight  tested until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, just prior to the planned  deployment of the SM-3 Block IB to support the regional defense of  Europe and 6 months after its planned full production decision.  Consequently, until the program thoroughly understands the extent of  needed modifications, if any, and their effects on performance as  demonstrated though testing, its production strategy is at risk of cost  growth and schedule delays. MDA has experienced these consequences  in other elements when it pursued design changes concurrently with  production.", "Although the GMD program made progress in resolving a prior CE-II  intercept failure, test failures and development challenges continue to  disrupt the program and increase the cost to demonstrate the new CE-II.

The program initially planned to conduct FTG-06b  in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 but the test has since been delayed  to at least the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 because of challenges  resolving test failures. For example, while initial results from CTV-01  indicated the redesigned guidance system component could be used to  resolve the problem that caused the FTG-06a failure, subsequent ground  testing revealed that only one-third of those produced could be used in  future interceptor production or flight tests because the component\u2019s  performance was uncertain. The program mitigated the issue by  implementing software and hardware modifications and delivered the  redesigned component for kill vehicle integration in October 2013.  However, according to MDA, the program experienced further delays in  the FTG-06b test while it implemented changes based on assessments  from the ongoing FTG-07 failure review. Consequently, confirmation that  the CE-II design works as intended has been delayed by nearly seven  years and costs have increased by over $1 billion because of the CE-II  development challenges and test failures.", "In July 2013, MDA conducted the FTG-07 developmental test to  understand the performance of the fielded CE-I against a longer range  target in more challenging conditions and assess the performance of  upgrades. This interceptor was fielded before completing developmental  testing, leading MDA to undertake retrofit efforts and upgrades to fix  issues identified during testing. According to acquisition best practices,  developmental testing should be complete before beginning production  and fielding in order to, among other reasons, avoid the need for retrofits  and upgrades to fix issues discovered during testing. The test failed,  delaying understanding of the capabilities and limitations of upgrades to  the fielded CE-I. Shortly after the test failure, the Director, MDA stated a  failure review was initiated to not only identify the root cause of the failure,  but also provide a comprehensive review of potential CE-I failures and  identify any correlations with the CE-II. Since then, according to program  officials, MDA has identified a kill vehicle component common to both  interceptors that could be associated with the FTG-07 failure. However, it  remains unclear what, if any, design changes, retrofits, or other corrective  actions to the CE-I or CE-II are necessary since the failure review is not  complete. According to MDA officials, they have not determined if they  will re-conduct the flight test. If the CE-I is not flight tested again, the  warfighter will not have a full understanding of the capabilities and  limitations of the upgrades to the CE-I interceptor, the original purpose of  the FTG-07 test.", "Overall, GMD\u2019s ongoing testing issues in conjunction with concurrent  acquisition practices have caused\u2014and will likely continue to cause\u2014 major disruptions to the program. We previously found that, in 2004, MDA  committed to a highly concurrent development, production, and fielding  strategy for the CE-II interceptor and began delivering interceptors in  2008. Because MDA moved forward with CE-I and CE-II interceptor  production before completing its flight testing program, test failures have  exacerbated disruptions to the program. For example, because the  program has delivered approximately three-fourths of the interceptors for  fielding, the program faces difficult and costly decisions on how it will  implement corrections from prior test failures. Also, the program has had  to add tests that were previously not planned and delay tests that are  necessary to understand the system\u2019s capabilities and limitations.

In  response to our April 2013 recommendation, DOD agreed that decision  makers should have insight into the full life cycle costs of DOD programs,  but the department stated that the BAR should only include content for  which MDA is responsible. Because MDA already reports the estimated  acquisition costs and some of the operation and support costs for the  acquisitions in the annual BAR, we concluded that annual document to be  the most appropriate way to report the full costs to Congress. Additionally,  we concluded that good budgeting requires that the full costs of a project  be considered when making decisions to provide resources and,  therefore, both DOD and Congress would benefit from a comprehensive  understanding of the full costs of MDA\u2019s acquisition programs. Until  MDA\u2019s resource baselines are based on reliable information and are  comprehensive, they will not be useful for decision makers to understand  progress or make well-informed investment decisions.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, Congress  took steps to address concerns over MDA\u2019s cost estimates by requiring  MDA to report to the congressional defense committees on its efforts to  improve the quality of the cost estimates included in its acquisition    For example, the act requires MDA to report on a description  baselines.of and schedule for planned actions to improve its cost estimates, as well  as an assessment of how the planned improvements align with GAO\u2019s  cost estimating best practices. We are also required to provide our views  on the content of MDA\u2019s report. Additionally, the act requires that the life  cycle cost estimate included in the agency\u2019s acquisition baselines include  a description of the operations and support functions and costs for which  the military services are responsible, in addition to the costs borne by  MDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA\u2019s Schedule Baseline Reporting Makes Assessing Progress Difficult", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s schedule baselines are presented in a way that makes it difficult  for decision makers to understand a program\u2019s planned activities and  therefore hold programs accountable for their performance. According to  GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide, a reliable program schedule  includes all activities required to complete a project, but the schedule  should not be too detailed to interfere with its use.presenting decision makers with a high-level summary of the schedule is  a best practice because schedules that include too many milestones or  have too much detail make it difficult to manage progress. Additionally,  the activities included on the schedule should have descriptive names  that clearly communicate the work required. MDA\u2019s 2013 BAR schedule  baselines include numerous events but provide very little information  about them, making it difficult to understand what the events are and why  they are important. For example, the milestones identifying significant  increases in performance for C2BMC Spiral 8.2 are numbered with no  description of the capabilities they represent. Additionally, several of the  events reported for Aegis modernized weapon system software are titled  with abbreviations that are not explained in the BAR.", "In addition, MDA does not present any comparisons of event dates with  previously reported dates. In contrast, DOD\u2019s major defense acquisition  programs report a comparison of current schedule estimates against their  original and current schedule goals. According to GAO\u2019s Schedule  Assessment Guide, comparing the current schedule to the baseline  schedule to track deviations from the plan provides decision makers  valuable insight into program risk and can help identify where corrective  action may be needed. While removing the formatting that identified  changes in prior BARs made the schedule baselines easier to read, doing  so removed the ability for decision makers to see if the planned dates for  events had changed. As a result, decision makers must consult past  versions of the BAR to identify any changes in the planned schedule for a  specific event, which can be difficult or impossible in some cases. For  example, we found in April 2013 that we were unable to compare the  current estimated dates for the activities presented in the Aegis Ashore  schedule baseline to the dates baselined in the 2010 BAR because  activities were split into multiple events, renamed, eliminated, or moved to  several other Aegis BMD schedule baselines.audit we raised this issue with MDA and, according to agency officials,  MDA is open to considering alternative formats for presenting the  schedule baseline in future version of the BARs. Until MDA improves the  content of its schedule baselines, decision makers will not be able to  assess how a program is performing over time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2013, MDA was able to make some significant  acquisition progress, including the first operational system-level flight test  involving multiple BMDS elements, but it continued to experience  difficulties achieving its goals for testing. This has resulted in delaying  progress on individual elements, delaying understanding of the overall  performance of the BMDS, and fielding assets before all testing is  complete. The most significant acquisition effects have been experienced  on the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB and GMD program where testing and  development challenges have led to failure investigations and increased  the risk of continued cost growth and schedule delays. Both programs  conducted flight tests and made progress in resolving design flaws in  2013, but still have further development, testing, and production issues to  address. For Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB, the failure of its interceptor in a  September 2013 flight test means that a key component may need to be  redesigned and that change confirmed to work in additional flight testing.  For GMD, the failure of the deployed CE-I interceptor in a July 2013 flight  test compounds its challenge because the program did not gain the  expected understanding of the effectiveness of software upgrades  planned for the operational fleet and now must determine the cause of the  failure. As a result, for both programs, to the extent that software or  hardware changes are necessary to resolve the cause of these failures,  new flight tests will likely be needed to demonstrate both the  effectiveness of any resolutions and, for GMD, understand the  performance of the software upgrades that were the original purpose of  the test.", "Additionally, for over a decade, we have reported that MDA provides  Congress with only limited insight into the acquisition progress for  individual programs. While MDA has taken steps to improve the clarity of  the baselines it reports to Congress, the agency\u2019s cost and schedule  reporting still lacks the quality, completeness, and clarity necessary to  track actual cost or schedule growth over time. Specifically, the agency  has not addressed all of the critical gaps in the quality of its underlying  cost estimates used to develop its resource baselines that we have  identified over the years. Until corrective actions are implemented and  substantial improvements are made to MDA\u2019s cost estimates, its reported  resource baselines will not be useful for decision makers to hold MDA  accountable for its performance or make informed decisions on how best  to allocate limited resources. Congress recently amended the  requirements for the cost estimates MDA must report in its baselines,  which may enhance the transparency into MDA\u2019s cost estimating  processes. As a result, we do not make any new recommendations  regarding cost at this time. However, additional actions can be taken in  the schedule baselines to improve the ability of decision makers to  understand what program events are most critical and identify whether  the dates for those critical events have changed. Until improvements are  made, the schedule baselines will not be a useful tool for providing  oversight of the BMDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following three  actions to strengthen MDA\u2019s acquisitions and help support oversight.  1.  To the extent that MDA determines hardware or software  modifications are required to address the September 2013 Aegis BMD  SM-3 Block IB failure, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct,  a)  the Director of the MDA to verify the changes work as intended  through subsequent flight testing, and  b)  the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisitions, Technology, and  Logistics to delay the decision to approve the program\u2019s full  production until such testing demonstrates that the redesigned  missile is effective and suitable.  2.  To demonstrate the CE-I\u2019s effectiveness against a longer range target  in more challenging conditions and to confirm the design changes  implemented to improve performance, as well as any changes needed  to resolve the July 2013 CE-I flight test failure work as intended, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct MDA\u2019s Director to  conduct a flight test of the CE-I interceptor once the cause of the  failure has been determined and any mitigations have been  developed.  3.  To improve the content of the schedule baselines it reports to  Congress for monitoring program performance, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense direct MDA\u2019s Director to take the following  actions as MDA implements other improvements required by the  Congress:  a)  Focus the information included in the schedule baselines to  highlight critical events.  b)  For each event included in the schedule baseline, provide a  description of the event explaining what it entails and why it is  important.  c)  Present the schedule baseline in a format that allows decision  makers to identify any changes made from the current estimated  date to the date reported in not only the prior year\u2019s BAR but also  to the date established in the initial baseline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report. These  comments are reprinted in appendix II. DOD also provided technical  comments, which were incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation, non-concurred  with our second recommendation and concurred with our third  recommendation. The department partially concurred with our first  recommendation to flight test any modifications that may be required to  the Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IB as a result of September 2013 failure,  before the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisitions, Technology, and  Logistics approves full production. In its comments, DOD acknowledged  that if modifications are required they will be tested, but added that the  type of testing\u2014flight or ground testing\u2014will depend on the magnitude of  such modifications. The department also believes that the component  currently tied to the failure, has a successful testing history and thus  expects to meet the reliability requirement needed for the full production  decision in fiscal year 2015. However, there have now been three flight  test anomalies associated with this component over the last three years.  According to Aegis BMD officials, they are considering design changes  for this component. Since the fiscal year 2015 full production decision is  the commitment by the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisitions,  Technology, and Logistics to produce several hundred missiles, this  decision should be supported by an assessment of the final product under  operational mission conditions to ensure that it is effective and suitable.  As such, we maintain our recommendation that before the program is  approved for full production, flight testing should demonstrate that any  modifications work as intended.", "DOD did not concur with our second recommendation to complete the  original purpose of the July 2013 CE-I flight test once the cause of that  failure has been determined and any mitigations have been developed. In  its response, DOD stated that the decision to flight test a CE-I interceptor  will be made by the Director, MDA, based on the judgment of  stakeholders from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and combatant  commands on the need to perform a test. The DOD response focused  almost exclusively on the steps it is taking to identify the cause of the July  2013 failure and mitigate it and did not address the main part of our  recommendation\u2014determining the effectiveness of the CE-I under more  challenging conditions and confirming that design changes previously  made improve performance. These were the objectives of FTG-07. In our  view, resolving these performance questions remains important. Since  the FTG-07 failure review is still ongoing, we cannot assess whether DOD  should conduct a CE-I test for the sole purpose of demonstrating  corrective actions, to the extent any are needed, to address the cause of  the failure. While we acknowledge that DOD must balance several  competing GMD priorities, including which flight tests to conduct, and  conducting another CE-I flight test may not be feasible in the immediate  future, we also maintain that demonstrating CE-I intercept capabilities  should continue to be a priority for DOD since the CE-I interceptor  constitutes a multi-billion dollar investment by DOD and serves as the  primary defense of the United States homeland against enemy ballistic  missile attacks.", "In addition to responding to our recommendations, the department\u2019s letter  raised additional concerns about our draft report. First, DOD disagreed  with our statement that because the BMDS entrance into DOD\u2019s  acquisition process is deferred, it is exempt from certain acquisition laws  and policies that generally provide oversight of major defense acquisition  programs. DOD stated that MDA is not exempt from acquisition-related  laws because, while it is not captured by several statutes, Congress has  provided legislation specific to MDA to ensure oversight and  accountability. We clarified the language in our report to remove the term  exempt. However, because of the acquisition flexibility it has been  granted, MDA is not yet required to apply certain laws and policies to the  BMDS. We have found that while the flexibility allows MDA latitude to  manage the BMDS and to rapidly develop and field new systems, we  have also found that this flexibility has hampered oversight and  accountability. Our report recognizes the actions Congress has taken to  improve the transparency and accountability of the BMDS development  efforts through legislation specific to MDA, particularly to require MDA to  report baselines to Congress. However, there are a number of  requirements that are triggered by phases of the DOD acquisition process  that are important to sound acquisition management. For example, we  have previously found that MDA is not yet required to conduct an analysis  of alternatives to compare potential solutions and determine the most cost  effective weapon system to acquire nor is MDA yet required to obtain an  independent cost estimate prior to beginning product development.", "Second, DOD stated that it disagreed with our assessment that MDA\u2019s  cost estimates are not sufficiently reliable to support oversight, suggesting  that the report be revised to include more of MDA\u2019s efforts to improve the  quality of its cost estimates. Since 2011, we have found that there are  issues with the cost estimates and baseline reporting, including  incomplete cost estimates due to the exclusion of military service  operation and support costs as well as instability in the content of the  baselines, which makes assessing progress difficult or impossible. While  the draft report was being reviewed by DOD, we met with MDA officials  who discussed more of their efforts to improve their cost estimates;  however, we were not provided sufficient information to change our  determination. We did clarify the report to better reflect the efforts they  have undertaken. DOD stated in its response that MDA has included  previously unreported costs in the baselines it provides to Congress,  which we have previously found is an improvement to the amount of  information reported to Congress, but which does not demonstrate that  the quality of the cost estimates themselves have improved. DOD stated  in its response that it has provided joint operation and support costs  documentation for two programs reported in the 2013 BAR. However, we  did not assess the joint operation and support costs because they were  not included in the 2013 resource baselines reported to Congress. DOD  also stated in its response that it received an assessment from us on cost  estimate documentation for a third program. We did not perform a formal  assessment of the third program because it was cancelled and not  included in the 2013 BAR. In order to assist MDA in improving its cost  estimates, we did informally assess the third program\u2019s cost estimate, but  reached no conclusion as to its quality. However, we noted several issues  in that informal review. For example, we concluded that because MDA did  not provide a cost model to support the estimate we were unable to check  the cost estimate for accuracy. Finally, DOD stated in its response that  MDA has published and implemented a cost estimating handbook. We  have previously found that fully implementing that handbook could  improve the quality of MDA\u2019s cost estimates.  However, during this  review, we specifically asked to review the cost estimate documentation  supporting MDA\u2019s fiscal year 2013 BAR baselines in order to assess its  progress in implementing that handbook. An MDA senior cost official told  us that the agency was working to fill in documentation gaps on existing  cost estimates and that the estimates were not ready for us to review. In  the course of our work, we concluded and informed MDA that the cost  estimating process defined in that handbook has not been applied to any  systems that are currently baselined or part of the BMDS. Until MDA is  able to provide us with documentation that supports the actual baselines  reported to Congress so we can independently assess the quality of the  cost estimates, we have no basis to change our assessment.", "Third, DOD disputed that MDA has not obtained independent cost  estimates from DOD\u2019s Office of the Director of Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation for any of the elements GAO reviewed since 2010. In  response, we clarified the language in the report so that it specifically  refers to the lack of independent cost estimates completed for any of the  resource baselines reported to Congress in the 2013 BAR. We also  clarified in the report that DOD\u2019s Office of the Director of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation has assessed other BMDS costs.  DOD was unable to provide us with documentation of independent cost  estimates completed for MDA\u2019s BAR baselines, therefore, we have no  basis to change our determination.", "Lastly, DOD identified 35 \u201ctechnical and factual errors\u201d in its technical  comments. However, upon review we found that 29 were not technical or  factual errors, but rather different conclusions, errors in DOD\u2019s comments,  or required additional substantiation that was not provided.  We  determined that 6 were actual technical or factual errors and therefore  made the appropriate changes in those circumstances.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and to  the Director, MDA.

We also examined MDA\u2019s master test plan and flight  test reports, and discussed the element- and BMDS-level test programs  and test results with the BMDS Operational Test Agency and the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Office of the Director, Operational Test  and Evaluation and office of Developmental Test and Evaluation. In  addition, we also met with officials from MDA\u2019s functional directorates  including the Engineering Directorate to discuss the agency\u2019s process for  delivering and integrating BMDS capabilities as well as the Directorates  for Acquisition and Operations to discuss significant internal and external  events and decisions that occurred in fiscal year 2013, such as  sequestration, that affected the agency\u2019s overall acquisition of the BMDS.", "To assess the progress made as well as any remaining challenges MDA  faces in reporting resource and schedule baselines that support  oversight, we examined MDA\u2019s reported baselines in the 2010, 2011,  2012, and 2013 BARs. To be consistent with last year, we focused our  assessment on the resource and schedule baselines as they continue to  be the only reported baselines that have measurable goals, such as cost  estimates and dates of program events, and separately explain when  current estimates have deviated to a certain extent from the baselines set  in prior BARs. We also examined the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2012, which required MDA to establish and maintain  baselines for program elements or major portions of such program  elements and outlined the information to be included in MDA\u2019s baselines,  as well as interviewed officials within MDA\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office. We  also interviewed officials in MDA\u2019s Acquisitions Directorate about how the  agency establishes and manages its acquisition baselines and met with  MDA officials in the Operations Directorate to discuss their progress in  adopting best practices in cost estimating based on our Cost Guide. We  also reviewed findings and recommendations from several of our past  reports to see if MDA had made progress in improving the completeness,  clarity, and stability of its reported resource and schedule baselines. In  addition, we examined DOD acquisition policy such as the Interim DOD  Instruction 5000.02 issued in November 2013 and the Defense  Acquisition University\u2019s Defense Acquisition Guidebook to discern how  other major defense acquisition programs are required to report baselines  and measure program progress. We also reviewed GAO\u2019s cost and  schedule guides, which outline best practices for establishing and  managing program cost and schedule estimates.", "To gauge the extent to which MDA reported changes or variances in the  current baselines from the baselines presented in the prior year\u2019s BAR  and from when the baselines were initially established, we compared the  2013 BAR resource and schedule baselines for each BMDS element in  our review to the baselines presented in the 2012 and 2010 BARs. In  order to compare unit costs calculated in different years, there were  instances where it was necessary to convert prior cost estimates to match  the base year of the estimates presented in the 2013 BAR. We  performed these conversions using indexes published by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in the National Defense Budget  Estimates, commonly referred to as the \u201cGreen Book.\u201d", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 directed  GAO to provide separate assessments on several other missile defense  related issues.
