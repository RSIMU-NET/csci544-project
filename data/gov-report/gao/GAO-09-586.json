To assist in addressing DOD's business system modernization challenges, the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (the Act) contains provisions that require the department to take certain actions and to annually report to its congressional committees on these actions. The Act also directs GAO to review each annual report. In response, GAO performed its fifth annual review of DOD's actions to comply with key aspects in the Act and related federal guidance. To do so, GAO reviewed, for example, the latest version of DOD's business enterprise architecture (BEA) and transition plan, investment management policies and procedures, and information in the department's business system data repositories."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The pace of DOD's progress in defining and implementing key institutional modernization management controls has slowed compared with progress made in each of the last 4 years, leaving much still to be accomplished to fully implement the Act's requirements and related guidance. In particular, the corporate BEA continues to evolve and address previously identified missing elements, inconsistencies, and usability issues, but gaps still remain. For example, while the BEA now identifies information assurance laws, regulations, and policies, it still does not include business rules for all business processes. Further, little progress has been made in the last year in extending (i.e., federating) the BEA to the entire family of business mission area architectures, including using an independent verification and validation agent to assess the components' subsidiary architectures and federation efforts. The updated enterprise transition plan continues to identify systems and initiatives, but important elements are still missing, as are individual component plans. For example, while the plan provides a range of information, such as budgets and performance measures, for key enterprisewide and component-specific investments, it is missing information on identified investments. The fiscal year 2009 budget submission included some, but omitted other, key information about business system investments, in part because of the lack of a reliable comprehensive inventory of all defense business systems. Investment approval and accountability structures have been established for DOD and the Air Force, and related policies and procedures that are consistent with relevant guidance have been partially defined. However, these structures and processes are still lacking for the Navy. Business system investments costing over $1 million continue to be certified and approved, but these decisions are not always based on complete information. For example, key Navy investments have not fully demonstrated compliance with the department's BEA, and their economic justifications were not based on reliable estimates of cost and benefits. In addition, the information in DOD's authoritative repository of system investments that is used to make these decisions is not always accurate. Department officials attributed this slowdown in large part to pending decisions surrounding the roles, responsibilities, authorities, and relationships among key senior leadership positions, such as DOD's Deputy Chief Management Officer and the military departments' Chief Management Officers. Until DOD fully implements these long-standing institutional modernization management controls provided for under the Act, addressed in GAO recommendations, and otherwise embodied in relevant guidance, its business systems modernization will likely remain a high-risk program. As a result, it is important that the department act quickly to resolve pending decisions about key positions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems.

Between 2001 and 2005, we  reported that the department\u2019s business systems modernization program  continued to lack both of these, concluding in 2005 that hundreds of  millions of dollars had been spent on a business enterprise architecture  (BEA) and investment management structures that had limited value.  Accordingly, we made more explicit architecture and investment  management-related recommendations.", "To further assist DOD in addressing these modernization management  challenges, Congress included provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (the Act) that  were consistent with our recommendations. More specifically, the Act  requires the department to, among other things, (1) develop a BEA,   (2) develop a transition plan to implement the architecture, (3) identify  systems information in its annual budget submission, (4) establish a  system investment approval and accountability structure, (5) establish an  investment review process, and (6) certify and approve any system  modernizations costing in excess of $1 million. The Act further requires  that the Secretary of Defense submit an annual report to congressional  defense committees on DOD\u2019s compliance with certain requirements of  the Act not later than March 15 of each year from 2005 through 2009.  Additionally, the Act directs us to submit to these congressional  committees\u2014within 60 days of DOD\u2019s report submission\u2014an assessment  of DOD\u2019s actions to comply with these requirements.", "As agreed with your offices, the objective of our review was to assess the  actions taken by DOD to comply with requirements of section 2222 of Title  10, U.S. Code. To accomplish this, we used our prior annual report under  the Act as a baseline, analyzing whether the department had taken actions  to comply with those requirements, related guidance, and our prior  recommendations that we previously identified as not yet addressed. In  doing this, we also relied on the results of relevant reports that we have  issued since our prior annual report.

Moreover, the recent  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contains nearly $12.6  billion in appropriations for DOD for military construction, environmental  restoration, and other purposes. Organizationally, the department includes  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the  military departments, numerous defense agencies and field activities, and  various unified combatant commands that are responsible for either  specific geographic regions or specific functions. (See fig. 1 for a  simplified depiction of DOD\u2019s organizational structure.)", "In support of its military operations, the department performs an  assortment of interrelated and interdependent business functions,  including logistics management, procurement, health care management,  and financial management. As we have previously reported, the DOD  systems environment that supports these business functions is overly  complex and error prone, and is characterized by (1) little standardization  across the department, (2) multiple systems performing the same tasks,  (3) the same data stored in multiple systems, and (4) the need for data to  be entered manually into multiple systems. Moreover, the department  recently reported that this systems environment is composed of  approximately 2,480 separate business systems. For fiscal year 2009, DOD  requested about $15.3 billion in funds to operate, maintain, and modernize  these business systems and associated IT infrastructure.", "As we have previously reported, the department\u2019s nonintegrated and  duplicative systems impair its ability to combat fraud, waste, and abuse.  In fact, DOD currently bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for 15 of  our 30 high-risk areas. Eight of these areas are specific to the  department, while it shares responsibility for 7 other governmentwide  high-risk areas. Collectively, these high-risk areas relate to DOD\u2019s major  business operations that are inextricably linked to the department\u2019s ability  to perform its overall mission, directly affect the readiness and capabilities  of U.S. military forces, and can affect the success of a mission. DOD\u2019s  business systems modernization is one of the high-risk areas, and it is an  essential enabler to addressing many of the department\u2019s other high-risk  areas.

Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  and the federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council have also  recognized the importance of an architecture-centric approach to  modernization. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 mandates that an agency\u2019s  CIO develop, maintain, and facilitate the implementation of an information  technology architecture. Further, the E-Government Act of 2002 requires  OMB to oversee the development of enterprise architectures within and  across agencies. In addition, we, OMB, and the CIO Council have issued  guidance that emphasizes the need for system investments to be  consistent with these architectures.

Moreover, when an enterprise architecture is  employed in concert with other important management controls, such as  portfolio-based capital planning and investment control practices,  architectures can greatly increase the chances that an organization\u2019s  operational and IT environments will be configured to optimize mission  performance. The alternative, as our work has shown, is the perpetuation  of the kinds of operational environments that burden many agencies  today, where a lack of integration among business operations and the IT  resources supporting them leads to systems that are duplicative, poorly  integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface. Our  framework provides federal agencies with a common benchmarking tool  for planning and measuring their efforts to improve enterprise architecture  management.", "One approach to structuring an enterprise architecture is referred to as a  federated enterprise architecture. Such a structure treats the architecture  as a family of coherent but distinct member architectures that conform to  an overarching architectural view and rule set. This approach recognizes  that each member of the federation has unique goals and needs as well as  common roles and responsibilities with the levels above and below it.  Under a federated approach, member architectures are substantially  autonomous, although they also inherit certain rules, policies, procedures,  and services from higher-level architectures. As such, a federated  architecture gives autonomy to an organization\u2019s components while  ensuring enterprisewide linkages and alignment where appropriate. Where  commonality among components exists, there are also opportunities for  identifying and leveraging shared services.", "A service-oriented architecture is an approach for sharing business  capabilities across the enterprise by designing functions and applications  as discrete, reusable, and business-oriented services. As such, service  orientation permits sharing capabilities that may be under the control of  different component organizations.

Examples of new business rules in the  Common Supplier Engagement business priority area are (1) an  accepting or inspecting organization must be provided on all contracts for  goods or services and (2) both a minimum and a maximum ordering limit  must be provided when the contract is an indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity contract. In addition to adding business rules, Version 6.0  reflects the deletion of 22 business rules that, according to DOD, were no  longer applicable and were thus obsolete. Notwithstanding these additions  and deletions, BEA 6.0 still does not provide business rules for all business  processes. For example, there are no business rules for the File  Discrepancy Report for Other Goods and Services business process in the  Common Supplier Engagement and Materiel Visibility business priority  areas. Such limitations in DOD\u2019s business rules limit the department\u2019s  ability to ensure that business operations and supporting systems are  properly implemented.", "The latest version includes additional information on important security  architecture content. For example, it now identifies information assurance  laws, regulations, and policies and describes information assurance  characteristics of key information exchanges (e.g., Awarded Contract is  designated as a sensitive information exchange). However, not all  financial information exchanges (e.g., Receipt Account Trial Balance and  Ledgers) include such key information assurance characteristics as  confidentiality, integrity, and nonrepudiation. Without specifying such  information assurance characteristics for all relevant exchanges, DOD will  be limited in its ability to implement adequate security controls into the  systems that support these exchanges.", "The latest version continues to add new operational activities, which  describe actions performed in conducting DOD business operations (e.g.,  Deliver Property and Forces). These operational activities are important  because they are DOD\u2019s primary basis for determining if a system is being  defined in a way that is compliant with the BEA. However, key operational  activities are not yet included in the BEA. For example, Version 6.0 still  does not include the Foreign Military Sales operational activity, which  affects multiple DOD business missions and organizations. Without  including such important operational activities, programs do not have all  the information necessary for determining if they are compliant with  applicable constraints (e.g., data definitions and business rules).", "The latest version includes updates on the information that flows among  operational nodes (i.e., organizations, business operations, and system  elements). Information flows are important because they define what  information is needed and where and how the information moves to and  from operational entities. While Version 6.0 adds approximately 50 new  information exchanges (e.g., Approved Payment Request) among  business functions and approximately 15 data exchanges (e.g., Payment  Request for Goods) among system functions, it still contains information  exchanges (e.g., Accounts Payable Account) that are not attached or  linked to any operational nodes (or organizations). Further, this version\u2019s  information-related architecture products contain inconsistencies. For  example, information exchanges such as Final Contract or Order Costs  and Estimate at Completion are listed in the information exchange  integrated dictionary, but are not listed in the operational information  exchange product. As a result, DOD\u2019s ability to understand how  information is shared among operational entities, and subsequently  develop or modernize systems that can effectively share such information,  will be constrained.", "The latest version also depicts end-to-end business flows (e.g., Budget to  Report) with linkages to BEA business processes (e.g., Execute  Apportionment and Allocate Funds). However, BEA 6.0 does not include,  for each end-to-end business flow, a create, read, update, and delete  matrix that shows how the business processes and their associated  applications manage specific data objects (e.g., Approved  Apportionment). These matrices are important because they reveal  natural groupings of business activities and data objects, and thus are used  to identify business activities to be automated. Without this information,  DOD will be limited in its ability to develop a target architecture that  effectively integrates information and systems that support its business  activities.", "BTA officials recognize many of these issues and state that they will be  addressed as the BEA continues to evolve. In this regard, the Chief  Architect stated that the process for evolving the BEA is described in the  architecture\u2019s Concept of Operations. Specifically, it describes a process  that calls for business cases to justify proposed improvements that are  then prioritized and used to create a BEA plan for DBSMC approval.  However, the Concept of Operations has yet to be approved, and available  documentation does not demonstrate that this process is being followed.  Further, we have yet to receive an architecture plan or evidence of  DBSMC approval of such a plan. As we have previously reported and  recommended, BTA needs an enterprise architecture program  management plan that defines what the department\u2019s incremental  improvements to the architecture (and transition plan) will be, and how  and when they will be accomplished, including what (and when)  architecture and transition plan scope and content and architecture  compliance criteria will be added into which versions. BTA has not yet  developed such a plan. According to BTA officials, the department\u2019s next  steps are contingent upon ongoing discussions about how architecture  planning will be affected by the Deputy CMO\u2019s efforts to align the  department\u2019s various planning activities in its strategic management plan,  which is to be issued no later than July 1, 2009. These discussions will be  further complicated by the lack of clarity surrounding the Deputy CMO\u2019s  roles, responsibilities, and authorities and how the deputy will work with  other senior leaders across the department who have responsibility for  business operations.", "Beyond the above-discussed limitations, Version 6.0 also continues to  represent only the thin layer of corporate architectural policies,  capabilities, rules, and standards that apply DOD-wide (i.e., to all DOD  federation members). This means that Version 6.0 appropriately focuses  on addressing a limited set of enterprise-level (DOD-wide) priorities and  providing the overarching and common architectural context that the  distinct and substantially autonomous member (i.e., component)  architectures inherit. However, this also means that Version 6.0 does not  provide the total federated family of DOD parent and subsidiary  architectures for the business mission area."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Progress in Federating Its BEA Has Been Slow", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the need to address its component architecture challenges,  BTA released an update to its initial business mission area federation  strategy and road map in January 2008. Among other things, this strategy  was to address how the corporate BEA would be extended to the military  departments and defense agencies and how business services will be  identified and delivered across the business mission area. (See fig. 3 for a  conceptual representation of DOD\u2019s federated BEA.)", "In September 2006, DOD issued its initial business mission area federated  strategy and road map, which we reported lacked adequately defined tasks  needed to achieve the strategy\u2019s goals, such as addressing how strategy  execution will be governed, component architectures will be aligned with  the latest version of the BEA, and common applications and systems  across the department will be identified and reused. Accordingly, we  reiterated our prior recommendation for a BEA management plan, and  recommended that DOD ensure that this plan describes, at a minimum,  how the business mission area architecture federation would be governed;  how the business mission area federation strategy alignment with the DOD  architecture federation strategy would be achieved; how component  business architectures\u2019 alignment with incremental versions of the BEA  would be achieved; how shared services would be identified, exposed, and  subscribed to; and what milestones would be used to measure progress  and results.", "In January 2008, DOD issued an updated strategy, and in May 2008, we  reported that the update, along with the associated global information grid  strategy, partially addressed our recommendations. Specifically, we  reported that the strategies provided high-level roles and responsibilities  for federating the architecture and additional definition around the tasks  needed to achieve alignment among DOD and component architectures.  We also noted that the strategy for the business mission area provided for  conducting pilot programs across the components to demonstrate the  technical feasibility of architecture federation, and for using the lessons  learned from the pilots to improve and update the strategies.", "To their credit, BTA and other DOD entities, such as ASD(NII)/DOD CIO  and the Department of the Army, are collaboratively taking steps to  establish the foundation for implementing the strategy. For example, they  have    selected the Department of the Army\u2019s Defense Knowledge Online to be  BTA\u2019s federated enterprise portal, which is to be the point of access to  information about all DOD and component architectures, and is to allow  users to search and navigate through this information;   established and are using the DOD Architecture Registry System, which is  maintained by ASD(NII)/DOD CIO, as the repository to contain  architecture content;   conducted five pilots at three military departments and two defense  agencies to evaluate various aspects of architecture federation and  develop lessons learned about, for example, approaches for capturing and  managing architecture metadata (Air Force pilot), and enterprise search  and discovery methods (Navy pilot); and   developed guidance on identifying and registering business services and,  as of November 2008, identified and registered 25 business services, such  as a service that provides detailed information on each aircraft at the base  (e.g., an aircraft\u2019s mission capability and maintenance status), and a  service that allows aircraft maintenance data to be retrieved, created,  updated, and removed.", "According to officials from ASD(NII)/DOD CIO, which is responsible for  overall DOD architecture federation, the results of the pilots are being  used to determine future federation steps for all DOD mission areas. In  addition, BTA officials said that both BTA and ASD(NII)/DOD CIO are  defining a basic set of standard architecture models, including a common  vocabulary for using architecture information across DOD, to allow for  uniform representation of architecture content. Establishing such a  common framework is important because DOD\u2019s current lack of uniform  representation for enterprise architecture content, according to BTA and  ASD(NII)/DOD CIO officials, will limit the understanding and utility of the  federated architecture.", "Notwithstanding the above steps, BTA\u2019s strategy for federating the BEA  still does not contain sufficient detail to permit effective and efficient  execution and adequately address our recommendations. For example, the  business mission area\u2019s federation implementation road map only outlines  high-level, near-term milestones, such as milestones for developing a  governance charter for the DOD CIO Enterprise Guidance Board, which is  DOD\u2019s senior forum for guiding the development and approval of  enterprise-level guidance (including IT policy, architecture, and standards)  on enterprise architecture, and conducting a pilot with Defense  Knowledge Online to test an access control mechanism. It does not, for  example, specify tasks to be performed to achieve those milestones,  identify milestones or tasks beyond fiscal year 2010, or identify resources  needed to perform tasks (e.g., funding, staffing, tools, and training).  Further, the strategy does not describe how the various architecture  federation activities taking place across DOD come together over time to  achieve a federated BEA, including measurement of progress, results, and  the component architectures\u2019 alignment with the latest version of the BEA.  BTA and ASD(NII)/DOD CIO officials stated that these details have yet to  be described because of unresolved issues surrounding the Deputy CMO  and military department CMO positions.", "Moreover, DOD\u2019s federation efforts have yet to benefit from any  independent verification and validation (IV&V) assessments. As we  previously reported, such assessments are important to ensure the  completeness, consistency, understandability, and usability of the  federated family of architectures. Accordingly, we recommended that  DOD have its BEA IV&V contractor perform such assessments and  disclose the results in its annual report to Congress. However, DOD\u2019s  March 2009 annual report does not include this information. According to  BTA officials, from October 2007 through March 2009, BTA expended  approximately $3 million on BEA-related IV&V activities. However, these  activities have focused on the corporate BEA and not the entire federated  family of architectures. BTA officials also stated that future IV&V activities  are not currently focused on the federated family of architectures. They  added that they are engaged in discussions with ASD(NII)/DOD CIO on  how and who to best perform such assessments, given that the federated  BEA is a part of DOD\u2019s overall federated enterprise architecture, which is  led by ASD(NII)/DOD CIO.", "The challenges that the department faces in federating its BEA, and the  importance of disclosing to congressional defense committees the state of  its federation efforts, are amplified by the current state of the military  departments\u2019 enterprise architecture programs. Specifically, we recently  reported that none of the three military departments could demonstrate  through verifiable documentation that it had established all of the core  foundational commitments and capabilities needed to effectively manage  the development, maintenance, and implementation of an architecture,  which are outlined in our Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity  Framework. While the Air Force\u2019s architecture efforts are well ahead of  those of the Navy and Army, all three had yet to fully satisfy important  aspects of our framework. Examples of their architecture limitations are  discussed below:    None of the military departments had fully defined its \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d  architecture environments and associated transition plans. This is  important because without a full understanding of architecture-based  capability gaps, the departments would not have an adequate basis for  defining and sequencing their ongoing and planned business system  investments.", "None of the military departments had fully addressed security as part of its  respective \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d environments. This is important because  security is relevant and essential to every aspect of an organization\u2019s  operations, and therefore the nature and substance of institutionalized  security requirements, controls, and standards should be embedded  throughout the architecture, and reflected in each system investment.", "None of the military departments was using an IV&V agent to help ensure  the quality of its architecture products. IV&V is a proven means for  obtaining unbiased insight into such essential architecture qualities as  completeness, understandability, usability, and consistency.", "None of the military departments could demonstrate that its IT  investments were actually in compliance with its architecture. This is  relevant because the benefits from using an architecture, such as  improved information sharing, increased consolidation, enhanced  productivity, and lower costs, cannot be fully realized unless individual  investments are actually in compliance with, among other things,  architectural rules and standards.", "To address these limitations, we made recommendations aimed at  improving the management and content of these architectures. DOD  agreed with our recommendations. However, our recommendations have  yet to be fully implemented. Specifically, none of the military departments  provided documentation demonstrating that the above-cited limitations  have been addressed.

For example, it  includes specific time-phased milestones with status indicators (e.g., met,  on track, or deleted) for about 47 out of the 54 systems, and it includes  performance metrics (e.g., voucher payment time and integration test  progress) for about 26 of these. Further, the latest version of the E discusses progress made since March 2008 on business system  investments, as well as descriptions of planned near-term activities (e. g.,  next 12 months). However, previously identified limitations in the scope  and completeness of the latest version of the ETP remain. Examples of  improvements and remaining issues are su mmarized below.", "The ETP provides a range of information for some, but not all, business  system investments, such as 3 years of budget information for about 342  out of 645 systems (about 50 percent), 46 of which are linked to key  transformation objectives and priorities. However, the ETP does not yet  include system and budget information for all the business systems  identified in the department\u2019s IT systems repository. According to the ETP,  it does not include budget information for about half of the business  systems identified because the budget data for some of these systems  were not included in the fiscal year 2009 budget submission. Further,  according to BTA officials, the ETP continues to focus on tier 1 and 2  business systems. However, not all DOD components have developed  subordinate transition plans that would address all the business system  investments. For example, as we reported last year, the Navy and Army  have not yet developed subordinate transition plans. More specifically,  Navy officials stated that they are revising their enterprise architecture  development and governance approach and, according to draft Navy  enterprise architecture documentation associated with this approach, an  enterprise architecture transition plan will be developed. Further, as we  reported, the Air Force\u2019s transition plan is limited. For example, it is not  based on an analysis of the gap in capabilities between the department\u2019s  \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d environments. Collectively, this means that a complete  family of DOD and component transition plans does not exist. According  to the BTA official responsible for the ETP, BTA and the military  departments are currently discussing whether component-level plans  should be published separately from or incorporated into the corporate  ETP. This is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding how the  Deputy CMO will work with other senior leaders who have responsibility  for business operations, including the military department CMOs.", "The ETP continues to provide performance measures for some, but not all,  enterprise and component investments (i.e., programs), including key  milestones (e.g., initial operating capability) and status indicators.  However, the plan has yet to include other important information needed  to understand the sequencing of new systems becoming operational and  legacy systems being phased out. In particular, the planned investments  have not been sequenced based on a range of important factors cited in  federal guidance, such as technology opportunities, marketplace trends,  fiscal and budgetary constraints, institutional system development and  acquisition capabilities, new and legacy system dependencies and life  expectancies, and the projected value of competing investments. Rather,  the ETP continues to be largely based on a bottom-up process in which  ongoing programs have been compiled and categorized in the plan around  business enterprise priorities. For example, many of these investments are  dependent on Net-Centric Enterprise Services, and as such the plans and  milestones for each should reflect the incremental capability deployment  of these enterprise services.", "The ETP and the business mission area federation strategy describe the  department\u2019s approach to enterprise application integration, including  plans for using specific services and standards for integrating financial  application systems. Including such information in the ETP and  associated documentation will help to clarify relationships and  dependencies among legacy applications and systems and new or  modernized applications and systems. However, all systems needed to  achieve integration are not specified. For example, the ETP does not  identify all of the systems that must be integrated for each end-to-end  business flow (e.g., budget-to-report) to support activities that are cross- functional and cross-cutting across organizational boundaries.", "The ETP does not include all legacy systems that will not be part of the  target BEA and does not provide the schedule for terminating these legacy  systems, as required by the Act. For example, while the Navy Enterprise  Resource Planning program\u2019s August 2008 investment review board  documentation identifies 41 legacy systems, the ETP identifies only 25 of  these systems. In addition, the plan is missing information about some  legacy systems and modernization programs. Specifically, the plan does  not include termination dates for 40 out of 514 legacy systems. Including a  comprehensive and reliable list of legacy systems is important for the  department to have a meaningful and reliable basis for managing the  disposition of legacy systems and for sequencing the introduction of  modernized business operations and supporting systems.", "BTA officials said that a number of actions are envisioned to address the  above-cited areas and further improve the ETP, such as working with the  military departments and defense agencies to determine which systems  should be included in the corporate-level ETP and ensuring that the next  version of the ETP includes more information about dependencies among  systems. Until the ETP, or a federated family of such plans, either directly  or by reference includes relevant information on the full inventory of  investments across the department (and does so in a manner that reflects  consideration of the range of variables associated with a well-defined  transition plan, such as timing dependencies among investments and the  department\u2019s capability to manage them), it will not provide a sufficient  basis for sequencing the introduction of modernized systems.

For example,  the revised policies and guidance now require a team to assess the risks  associated with each Major Automated Information System and to share  the results with the program manager and component functional  sponsor, who in turn are to collaboratively report the risks to both the  IRB and the program\u2019s milestone decision authority prior to each  milestone decision.

However,  DOD\u2019s updated corporate-level policies and procedures are still missing  critical project- and portfolio-based investment man we previously recommended, as discussed below.", "Policies and procedures for instituting the investment board do not  address how all investments that are past the development/modernization  stage (i.e., in operations and maintenance) are to be governed. Given that  DOD invests billions of dollars annually in operating and maintaining  business systems, this is significant. For example, while the 2009 up date to  the IRB guidance now requires an annual review of all investme previously certified by IRBs, including those in operations and  maintenance, this review is not required for systems in operations and maintenance that were not previously certified by the IRBs. Our ITIMframework emphasizes that the corporate investment boards should  review important information about an investment, such as cost and  performance baselines, throughout the investment\u2019s life cycle. In addition,  while the department\u2019s investment process addresses how investme nt- related processes are to be coordinated with the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System and the Defense Acquisition System,  these processes do not apply to all business systems.

Specifically, while the revised 2009 IRB guida nce  states that the IRBs will consider cost, schedule, and benefit data in  making certification decisions, the guidance does not define how the  boards are to consider these factors. According to our ITIM guidance, a  structured selection method should provide investment boards, business units, and IT developers with a common understanding of the selection  process to be followed, including how cost, schedule, and benefit data are  to be used to compare and select projects. Furthermore, while DOD issued  an IRB roles and responsibilities policy in January 2009 that states that the  c ertification authorities will define the selection criteria for determining   whether an investment is to be an enterprisewide system or remain  component specific, those certification authorities have yet to do so.

Such visibility is important because DOD reports that only  346 system modernization efforts have been IRB certified and DBSMC  approved. This means that the vast majority of business systems are  reviewed and approved only within the component organizations. While  the January 2009 IRB roles and responsibilities policy requires that each  component submit an end-of-the-fiscal-year report listing those systems  that have been reviewed by the cognizant IRB, this report lacks important  project information.

Specifically, in its January 2009 update to  its IRB guidance, the department added a new type of review, called a  closeout annual review, to be performed when a business system  modernization has been completed. According to the guidance, this review  is to function as a postimplementation review for IRB-certified systems  and is to provide the IRBs with lessons learned and metrics about  completed investment efforts. However, the guidance does not address  how expected benefits were achieved.

Adequately documenting both the  policies and the associated procedures that provide predictable,  repeatable, and reliable investment selection and that control and govern  how an organization manages its IT investment portfolios reduces  investment risk of failure and provides the basis for rigor, discipline, and  repeatability in how investments are selected and controlled across the  entire organization.", "With respect to the military departments\u2019 investment management policies  and procedures, we recently reported that the Air Force and the Navy did  not have fully documented policies and procedures for overseeing the  management of business system investments and for developing and  managing complete business systems investment portfolios. To address  these areas, we made recommendations aimed at implementing our  framework\u2019s Stage 2 and 3 practices, and DOD partially agreed with these  recommendations. Under DOD\u2019s tiered accountability approach to  reviewing and approving business systems investments, in which  investment review begins at the component level and proceeds through a  hierarchy of review and approval authorities, depending on the size and  significance of the investment, it is vital that DOD components implement  these practices.

For example, the Air  Force\u2019s recently developed IT investment review guidance provides for the  review of all business systems, to include those in operations and  maintenance, and it defines the process by which its IRB will review these  systems. Further, the guidance specifies how business investments,  including those in operations and maintenance, are to be prioritized using  factors such as mission and strategic value and risk. The Air Force has  also addressed key practices associated with portfolio-level investment  management (Stage 3), such as creating and modifying IT portfolio  selection criteria and assigning responsibility for the development and  modification of IT portfolio selection criteria. Specifically, the guidance  describes the criteria to be used to make portfolio selection, assigns  responsibility for developing the criteria to an integrated working team,  and assigns responsibility for approval of the criteria to a senior working  group.", "However, the Air Force\u2019s recent investment review guidance is still  missing critical elements needed to effectively carry out essential  investment management activities. For example, the guidance does not yet  specify how the business investment management activities are  coordinated with other DOD management systems, such as the Joint  Capabilities Integration and Development System, the Defense Acquisition  System, and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution  process. Further, the guidance does not provide for sufficient oversight  and visibility into investment management activities. Specifically, while  the Air Force has predefined criteria for adherence to cost, schedule, and  performance milestones, and requires the development of corrective  actions when a system deviates from milestones, it does not have policies  and procedures that guide the implementation of these corrective actions  when program expectations are not met. Moreover, the Air Force has yet  to develop policies and procedures for maintaining investment portfolios.  According to the Air Force, such key practices will be addressed in future  revisions to its guidance.", "In contrast, the Navy has not made as much progress as the Air Force in  addressing either our project-level or portfolio-level recommendations.  For example, the Navy has yet to fully document policies and procedures  for overseeing the management of business system investments and for  developing and managing complete business systems investment  portfolios. Among other things, it does not have policies and procedures  that specify decision-making processes for program oversight and describe  how corrective actions should be taken when projects deviate from their  project management plans. According to the Navy, a policy for addressing  our recommendations has been drafted, but has yet to be approved.", "As discussed in our ITIM framework, adequately documenting both the  policies and associated procedures that govern how an organization  manages its IT projects and investment portfolios is important because  doing so provides the basis for rigor, discipline, and repeatability in how  investments are selected and controlled across the entire organization.

Further, while the  department has updated its strategy for federating the BEA, this strategy is  still missing important content and it has yet to be implemented.  Compounding this situation are recurring limitations in the scope and  completeness of the department\u2019s enterprise transition plan, as well as the  immaturity of the military department architecture programs, including  the completeness of their own transition plans. In addition, the corporate  and the military departments\u2019 approaches to business systems investment  management continue to lack the requisite structures and defined policies  and procedures to be considered effective investment selection, control,  and evaluation mechanisms. Finally, information used to support the  development of the transition plan and DOD\u2019s budget requests, as well as  to inform certification and annual reviews, is of questionable reliability.

Equally important is for the department to actually implement  its architecture and investment management controls in the years ahead  on each and every business system investment, and in doing so to ensure  that it has reliable information on each investment upon which to base  executive decision making.", "Our previous recommendations to the department have been aimed at  accomplishing these and other important activities related to its business  systems modernization. While not a guarantee, having an architecture- centric investment management approach, combined with the actual  implementation of other key system acquisition disciplines that are  reflected in our existing recommendations, can provide a recipe for the  business systems modernization program\u2019s removal from our high-risk list.  To the department\u2019s credit, it has agreed with these recommendations and  committed to implementing them. Moreover, over the previous several  years, it has made important progress in doing so, as prior reports have  recognized. However, the pace of the progress has slowed over the last  year as the roles, responsibilities, authorities, and relationships among  recently established executive positions that are integral to defining and  implementing these controls are worked out. In light of this, it is essential  that the DBSMC, which is chaired by the DOD CMO, resolve these  positional matters, as doing so is on the department\u2019s critical path for fully  establishing the full range of institutional management controls needed to  address its business systems modernization high-risk area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Because we have existing recommendations that address most of the  institutional management control weaknesses discussed in this report, we  reiterate these recommendations.", "In addition, to ensure that DOD continues to implement the full range of  institutional management controls needed to address its business systems  modernization high-risk area, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Deputy Secretary of Defense, as chair of the DBSMC  and as DOD\u2019s CMO, to resolve the issues surrounding the roles,  responsibilities, authorities, and relationships of the Deputy CMO and the  military department CMOs relative to the BEA and ETP federation and  business system investment management.", "Further, to ensure that business system investment reviews and related  certification and approval decisions, as well as annual budget submissions,  are based on complete and accurate information, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the appropriate DOD organizations to develop  and implement plans for reconciling and validating the completeness and  reliability of information in its DITPR and SNAP-IT system data  repositories, and to include information on the status of these efforts in  the department\u2019s fiscal year 2010 report in response to the Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, signed by the Assistant  Deputy Chief Management Officer and reprinted in appendix II, the  department stated that it has made important progress over the past year  on its business system modernization, adding that this progress partly  addresses our prior recommendations.

We  also interviewed BTA and ASD(NII)/DOD CIO officials to determine the  steps taken, planned, or under way to validate the accuracy of the  information in DITPR to be used by the review boards in making  certification and approval decisions. In addition, we analyzed selected   business system information contained in DITPR, such as system life cycle  start and end dates, to validate the reliability of the information.", "We did not independently validate the reliability of the cost and budget  figures provided by DOD because the specific amounts were not relevant  to our findings. We conducted this performance audit at DOD offices in  Arlington, Virginia, from January 2009 to May 2009, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact person named above, key contributors to this  report were Neelaxi Lakhmani (Assistant Director), Justin Booth, Michael  Holland, Anh Le, Emily Longcore, Lee McCracken, Christine San, Sylvia  Shanks, Jennifer Stavros-Turner, and Adam Vodraska."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
