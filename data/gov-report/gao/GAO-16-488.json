These efforts are intended to improve the system's performance, reliability, and communications as well as address obsolescence and sustainment issues. The figure below shows planned costs for ongoing efforts, near-term upgrades which begin fielding prior to fiscal year 2017, mid-term upgrades which begin fielding between fiscal years 2017 and 2021, and long-term upgrades\u2014including a long-term radar solution. Key among the mid-term efforts are major software upgrades called Post Deployment Build-8 (PDB-8) and PDB-8.1, which are intended to improve communications and system capabilities against threats. The Army plans to begin operational testing for PDB-8 and PDB-8.1 in fiscal years 2016 and 2019, respectively. These testing results will reveal the extent to which the near and mid-term upgrades work as intended.", "Although the Army estimated in 2013 that costs for Patriot upgrades would meet the threshold to be considered a major defense acquisition program (MDAP), the Army chose to incorporate the Patriot upgrade efforts into the existing Patriot program which made certain oversight mechanisms inapplicable. Further, it decided not to put a mechanism in place to track or report the upgrades' progress against initial cost, schedule, or performance estimates, similar to those generally required of MDAPs, which GAO considers essential for program oversight. Operational testing for PDB-8 and PDB-8.1 provides the Army with an opportunity to increase oversight.

This AOA is called the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense  (LTAMD) Capability AOA. We discuss the AOA in appendix II.", "To assess the Patriot system\u2019s current performance status, we reviewed  operational test reports and discussed the results with officials in the  Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and Army Test  and Evaluation Command. We also reviewed current Combatant  Command warfighter operational needs statements for Patriot system  upgrades and discussed their status and mitigation plans with Army  officials. To determine Patriot\u2019s upgrade plans, we analyzed detailed cost  data derived from program budgets, program schedules for testing and  fielding, and test and evaluation master plans, and discussed these plans  with Army and Patriot program officials. To determine the level of  oversight and accountability provided for the upgrades, we received  information from Army officials regarding how and why the upgrades were  executed under the existing Patriot program. We also reviewed prior  legislation and related reports since 2012 to understand Congress\u2019s  concerns on oversight and accountability.

Patriot is  deployed worldwide in defense of the United States and its allies\u2019 key  national interests, ground forces, and critical assets.", "A Patriot fire unit is made up of four basic components: (1) a ground- based radar to detect and track targets; (2) launchers; (3) interceptor  missiles; and (4) a command, control, and communication station. Patriot  fire units are organized to fight in groups known as battalions. Each  battalion is controlled by its own command and control station and can  manage up to six fire units, although a battalion is typically deployed with  four. For a notional configuration of a Patriot battalion, see figure 1.  Several battalions can be commanded by an Army brigade. Brigades are  also responsible for certifying that the equipment can be employed as  required and for training the battalions. The brigade manages battalion  personnel under its command, with the ability to transfer personnel  among battalions to fill personnel gaps as needed.", "The air and missile defense architecture consists of several systems  deployed together to provide a layered defense against various threats in  a range of battlespaces. Other air and missile defense systems can  contain, like Patriot, a sensor, a launcher, and a system-centric command  and control station. These systems\u2019 command and control stations can  share information with other air and missile defense systems or with other  joint systems through external communication links, as seen in figure 1.  The air and missile defense architecture includes systems designed to  counter threats at a low altitude\u2014such as rockets, artillery, and mortar\u2014 as well as systems designed to defeat high-altitude threats intercepted  above the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Patriot serves as the Army\u2019s primary  element deployed to intercept targets in this middle range of  battlespace\u2014above the range of rockets, artillery, and mortar, but within  the earth\u2019s atmosphere."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "To Address Evolving Threats and Related Capability Gaps, the Army Adopted a New Integrated Air and Missile Defense Architecture", "paragraphs": ["The Army has identified a number of air and missile defense  communication and performance capability gaps in its ability to address  evolving global threats. Over the last decade, adversaries have acquired  more robust, diverse, and complex threats. According to a 2010 Ballistic  Missile Defense Review Report, ballistic missiles are more technically  sophisticated, more proliferated, include more advanced  countermeasures, and continue to challenge U.S. ballistic missile defense  system capabilities. Cruise missiles have also become relatively simple  to develop, are cheaper than ballistic missiles or aircraft, and are easy to  export. Additionally, advanced electronic attacks, such as jamming or  spoofing, have become more widespread and easier to effectively  produce. Sophisticated enemies also have the ability to use a  combination of integrated attacks including electronic and cyber warfare,  a variety of inbound ballistic and cruise missiles, special operation forces,  and other methods to complicate the battlespace. The Army has identified  some high-priority air and missile defense gaps in its ability to respond to  the growing threats, as seen in table 1.", "The Army announced an Air and Missile Defense Strategy in 2012 to  address communication and performance capability gaps by integrating  its current air and missile defense system components (e.g. sensors and  launchers), including Patriot, under a central network and command and  control system and linking them with joint and potential coalition allies.  The Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) program is currently  developing the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) that plans to  connect Patriot radars and launchers into IBCS\u2019s central network and  command and control stations. By connecting these components directly  with IBCS, the Army intends to divest air and missile defense systems of  their system-specific command and control stations and allow them to  become network enabled sensors and launchers. See figure 2 below for  a notional representation of the future Integrated Air and Missile Defense  architecture.", "The Army intends for the integrated air and missile defense architecture  to address communication and performance capability gaps by allowing  IBCS to collect information from a variety of sensors, fuse that data into a  single battlespace picture, and use that information to engage targets.  Receiving sensor data from a range of sensors could enable longer- distance engagements and provide commanders with more decision time  to select the appropriate response, prevent fratricide, and allow any joint  sensor to pair with the best available launcher. In addition, by integrating  several individual sensors\u2019 data, IBCS could compare and resolve  conflicts within the individual systems\u2019 abilities to accurately classify,  identify, and discriminate potential threat objects to provide more accurate  data back to the systems. IBCS could also help mitigate the risk of  electronic attack since additional sensor data could help confirm where  targets are when individual radars are being jammed or spoofed. In  addition, because launchers would have access to additional sensor data,  they could see more of the battlespace and use that information to more  effectively engage threats. IBCS is intended to multiply the performance  capabilities of the individual sensors and launchers connected to its  network. Therefore, the capability of the networked architecture relies  upon the ability of Patriot, as well as other air and missile defense  systems, to connect with IBCS and provide the needed quality data for  enhanced performance capabilities. Similar endeavors to create a  system-of-systems architecture with an extensive communication and  information network have proved challenging for DOD in the past. For  example, prior work on the Army\u2019s Future Combat Systems, a multibillion  dollar development program originally consisting of 18 manned and  unmanned systems tied together by an extensive communications and  information network, faced rising costs and technical challenges that  eventually led to its cancellation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Is Conducting an Analysis of Alternatives for a Patriot Radar and Launcher", "paragraphs": ["In 2014, DOD provided guidance to the Army for conducting its LTAMD  analysis of alternatives (AOA) to explore options for an efficient and cost- effective long-term radar and launcher solution\u2014with considered  alternatives ranging from the current Patriot assets with modifications up  to total replacements\u2014that will be able to connect with IBCS and address  capability needs related to radar reliability, range, and 360-degree  surveillance. The AOA results will support a decision for a new radar  acquisition program, known as the LTAMD sensor, that will require a  significant long-term financial investment. Issues with the Patriot radar  have been raised in the past. For example, the Director of Operational  Test and Evaluation identified performance and reliability issues with the  current Patriot radar in its annual report since 2013. In addition, the  Army conducted a business case analysis in 2013 and found that  upgrades to the Patriot radar could result in operations and support  savings, performance improvements, and reliability enhancements. An  AOA is a key first step in the acquisition process, intended to assess  alternative solutions for addressing a validated need. AOAs are generally  performed or updated to support key acquisition decision points.

For  example, the process of upgrading all of the legacy Patriot battalions to  IBCS-integrated radars and launchers is an 8-year process that officials  expect to begin in fiscal year 2017 and complete in fiscal year 2025. The  legacy Patriot system components need ongoing obsolescence and  sustainment improvements to improve reliability and availability, remain  affordable, and be compatible with the different versions of operational  Patriot battalions during that time. In addition, the program intends to  continue obsolescence and sustainment investments to maintain  readiness, improve reliability, and lower sustainment costs to support  deployed forces with legacy radars until the legacy radar is fully replaced.  Officials estimate that a new radar development could begin fielding in the  fiscal year 2028 time frame with tactical fielding completing within 7 years.  However, these plans are still preliminary and the milestone approval  process is still underway. Lastly, obsolescence and sustainment  improvements support legacy versions of Patriot systems, which foreign  military partners continue to buy and operate.

The software is supported  by a new modern processor in the command and control station. This  new processor provides Patriot with the ability to process more complex  algorithms that improve the system\u2019s capabilities against advanced  threats. It also provides a platform for future capability improvements.  Lastly, a launcher upgrade allows the system to launch and support use  of the new Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment  Enhancement (MSE) missile. The PAC-3 MSE, budgeted for and  managed under a separate acquisition program, was fielded in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2016 and is an upgrade to the predecessor PAC-3  missile by providing better lethality and a longer range\u2014flying  approximately 50 percent higher in altitude and 100 percent farther  downrange.", "While the system has made improvements, operational testing revealed  that the system requires significant upgrades to the radar and software to  bring the system up to the level of capabilities required. Operational  testing is a field test of a system or item under realistic operational  conditions with users who represent those expected to operate and  maintain the system when it is fielded or deployed. The Army conducted a  type of operational test called a limited user test in 2012 to evaluate the  Patriot system with PDB-7 software, the modern command and control  processor, and the PAC-3 MSE with the launcher upgrade against  requirements defined in the program\u2019s capability development and  production documents. The Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation\u2019s (DOT&E) report on the results of the limited user test is  classified, but it generally found that Patriot\u2019s performance improved  against some threats compared to prior versions but had degradations in  system effectiveness against other threats. An unclassified summary of  Patriot performance shortfalls, as identified by DOT&E and the Army, is  shown in table 2. Some of the performance shortfalls can be attributed to  the radar\u2019s limited sensing abilities. While the PAC-3 MSE missile has an  expanded battlespace over the PAC-3 missile, the radar is not able to  sense and support the full range and capabilities of PAC-3 MSE. In  addition, since experiencing fratricides during Operation Iraqi Freedom in  2003, the program has been working on upgrades to the system\u2019s ability  to more accurately classify, identify, and discriminate threat objects.  While significant enhancements have been made since that time, the  program requires additional capabilities to meet requirements. The risk of  these performance shortfalls, left unaddressed, range from erroneous  engagements and missile wastage to mission failure or fratricide.", "In addition, DOT&E\u2019s limited user test report found that the Patriot system  as a whole did not meet the reliability requirement, but would have if the  Patriot radar had achieved its reliability goal. The metric for determining  reliability is an average of the number of hours between critical failures  that place the system out of service and into a state of repair. Although  the system is required to run at least 20 hours on average between  critical failures, during the limited user test, the Patriot fire unit fell short by  demonstrating an average time of around 11 hours. More than 70 percent  of the critical mission failures during the test were experienced by the  radar. Had the radar achieved its requirement of at least 38 hours, the fire  unit would have exceeded the 20 hour requirement.

While  developmental testing thus far has been successful, the results of  operational test and evaluation will reveal the extent to which many of the  upgrades work as intended to address some of Patriot\u2019s diverse capability  needs.", "For example, operational testing for PDB-8 will evaluate how well the  software and hardware upgrades address the previously identified  performance shortfalls from PDB-7\u2014including issues with the radar\u2019s  reliability. In addition, the test will also evaluate the effectiveness and  efficiency of training aids and devices that are being procured to address  warfighter needs. Operational testing for PDB-8.1 is planned to evaluate  how well PDB-8.1 software capability upgrades effectively address  remaining system performance needs. According to Army Test and  Evaluation Command officials, upgrades that have not yet begun  production, like the global positioning anti-jamming hardware upgrade  and the radar anti-jamming upgrade, have not yet been incorporated into  testing plans.", "However, near- and mid-term upgrades aren\u2019t expected to fully address  all of the Patriot capability needs, which will require long-term upgrade  solutions.

In addition,  currently planned software upgrades are intended to provide capabilities  to help address tactical ballistic missile threats and electronic attacks, but  additional long-term software\u2014and potential additional hardware\u2014 investments are needed to continue improving capabilities against the  evolving threat, which continues to create new gaps in the system\u2019s  capabilities.", "Operational testing results could identify unexpected performance  shortfalls in the near and mid-term upgrades that require additional  development. In the case of PDB-7, for example, operational test results  identified unexpected performance shortfalls in system reliability that  required additional development in the latest near and mid-term upgrades  to address.

Therefore, the Army would have to start  with one battalion and complete the testing with a second battalion\u2014 which would add an extra 6 to 9 months to train the second battalion on  how to use the new equipment. After completing the United States / North  Atlantic Treaty Organization mission in Turkey, the Army was able to  adjust its Patriot unit rotation schedule which enabled the Army to assign  a battalion to support Patriot modernization testing.

To address this, the Army revised the training  certification progression so that high priority training is completed before  deployment, and less important training can occur after deployment.  However, to prepare for the transition to IBCS, the warfighter requires  additional training on how to effectively operate the equipment under an  airspace complicated with data from multiple sensors.

The Army has spent approximately  $1.1 billion since 2013 to develop and procure Patriot upgrades and has  requested another $1.8 billion, which includes funding for a long-term  radar solution, over the next five years. A modernization program of this  magnitude and complexity demands high-level oversight to ensure that  the upgrades are completed on time, within planned cost, and that they  provide the intended capabilities. In the long term, the Patriot system will  no longer be Patriot as we know it but will be broken down into its major  components\u2014a radar, launcher, and a missile\u2014integrated with Army\u2019s  Integrated Air and Missile Defense System of Systems. Of the three  remaining components, the Army has already defined the missile as a  separate major defense acquisition program and currently plans to do the  same for the LTAMD sensor solution, which accounts for $364 million of  the requested $1.8 billion over the next five years. Continuing to  separately manage and track progress for these components should help  provide Congress with the oversight and accountability it needs to make  important investment decisions.

We compared the processes outlined  in the LTAMD AOA guidance documents to GAO best practices because  the LTAMD AOA report was not available at the time of our review.", "The LTAMD AOA guidance documents provide the AOA study team with  a high-level roadmap for how to conduct the LTAMD AOA by outlining  processes to identify and select the alternatives, metrics, models, and  scenarios for use throughout the AOA process. While we cannot make  conclusions about the final AOA report until it is finalized and released, by  comparing the processes described in the LTAMD AOA guidance  documents to the 22 GAO best practices, we can make conclusions on  the quality of the processes used to develop it. If the processes are of  high quality, then the AOA study team has a good roadmap, which, if  followed, could produce a high-quality, reliable AOA. Based on our  analysis, the LTAMD AOA process described in its guidance met or  substantially met the criteria to be considered well-documented,  comprehensive, unbiased, and credible.", "While we found that the LTAMD AOA guidance documents met or  substantially met 18 of the 22 best practices GAO established for the  AOA process to be considered reliable, our review also found that  contrary to GAO best practices, the final AOA report will not select a  preferred solution. Specifically, the LTAMD AOA guidance did not instruct  the study team to assign relative importance to the criteria that are used  to compare the options or to select a preferred solution for a modernized  radar and launcher as part of the final AOA report. According to CAPE  officials involved in the LTAMD AOA efforts, the purpose of this AOA is to  provide an analytic comparison of the options based on the criteria but to  then allow external decisionmakers to determine the relative importance  of each criterion and derive their own preferred solution. CAPE\u2019s position  is that GAO\u2019s best practice of assigning relative importance to criteria is  not appropriate for strategic investment decisions such as this. In  contrast, GAO best practices recommend that solutions be compared  based on pre-established criteria that reflect the relative importance of the  criteria because not reflecting its relative importance up front can  oversimply results and potentially mask important information leading to  an uninformed decision. In addition, GAO best practices state that a  preferred alternative should be identified and a rationale for that decision  be included as part of an AOA report. While a recommended solution in  the AOA report does not have to be binding, without one, decisionmakers  outside of the AOA process may misinterpret the analysis within the AOA  report and potentially come to a biased decision."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s 22 Best Practices for the AOA Process: Background and Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In October 2015, GAO identified 22 best practices to provide a framework  for conducting an AOA and help ensure that entities consistently and  reliably select a preferred solution that best meets mission needs.

These characteristics evaluate  whether the AOA process is well-documented, comprehensive, unbiased,  and credible.  \u201cWell-documented\u201d means that the AOA process is thoroughly  described in a single document, including all source data, has clearly  detailed methodologies, calculations and results, and that selection  criteria are explained.  \u201cComprehensive\u201d means that the AOA process ensures that the  mission need is defined in a way to allow for a robust set of  alternatives, that no alternatives are omitted, and that each alternative  is examined thoroughly for the project\u2019s entire life-cycle.  \u201cUnbiased\u201d means that the AOA process does not have a  predisposition toward one alternative or another; it is based on  traceable and verifiable information.  \u201cCredible\u201d means that the AOA process thoroughly discusses the  limitations of the analyses resulting from the uncertainty that  surrounds both the data and the assumptions for each alternative.", "Table 10 provides an explanation of how individual best practices are  grouped under each characteristic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LTAMD AOA Guidance Results", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the DOD\u2019s LTAMD AOA guidance documents met or  substantially met the four characteristics of a high-quality and reliable  AOA process.

We scored the 22 best practices using a five-point system as follows:  \u201cmet\u201d means the LTAMD AOA guidance documentation demonstrated  that it completely met the best practice; \u201csubstantially met\u201d means that it  met a large portion of the best practice; \u201cpartially met\u201d means that it met  about half of the best practice; \u201cminimally met\u201d means that it met a small  portion of the best practice; and \u201cdid not meet\u201d means that it did not meet  the best practice.
