However, according to Federal Reserve data, from 2008 to 2012, total annual Reserve Bank coin management costs increased by 69 percent and at individual Reserve Banks increased at rates ranging from 36 percent to 116 percent. The Federal Reserve's current strategic plan calls for using financial resources efficiently and effectively and monitoring costs to improve cost-effectiveness. However, the agency does not monitor coin management costs by each Reserve Bank--instead focusing on combined national coin and note costs--thus missing potential opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of coin-related operations across Reserve Banks.", "In managing the circulating coin inventory, the Federal Reserve followed two of five key practices GAO identified and partially followed three. For example, the Federal Reserve follows the key practice of collaboration because it has established multiple mechanisms for sharing information related to coin inventory management with partner entities. The Federal Reserve has developed some performance metrics in the form of upper and lower national coin inventory targets. However, it has not developed other goals or metrics related to coin supply-chain management. One key practice is for agencies to identify goals, establish performance metrics, and measure progress toward those goals. Establishing goals and metrics, such as those related to coin management costs, could aid the Federal Reserve in using information and resources to identify additional efficiencies.", "To collect information on potential changes in the demand for currency (coins and notes), the Federal Reserve has conducted studies and outreach, including developing a long-term strategic framework beginning in 2010 to consider changes in demand and implications for operations. While the magnitude of potential changes in the demand for currency is inherently uncertain, the Federal Reserve anticipates a gradual decline in currency use, and officials reported such changes could likely be accommodated by the current system. While Federal Reserve studies and data indicate electronic payments have increased over time, currency usage has remained strong. For example, from 2009 to 2012, the value of currency in circulation rose about 26 percent.", "Starting in 2007, the Federal Reserve took actions to overcome barriers to circulation of the $1 coin, such as holding regular meetings with depository institution representatives to gather feedback about demand for $1 coins. The Federal Reserve manages the $1 coin inventory as it does for all other coin denominations--overseeing distribution and ensuring sufficient supply is available to meet demand nationwide. Reserve Banks currently hold approximately $1.4 billion in $1 coins, an amount that, according to the Federal Reserve, is sufficient to meet demand for more than 40 years.

Unlike the Board, the  Reserve Banks are not federal agencies. Each Reserve Bank is a  federally-chartered corporation with a board of directors. Unlike federal  agencies funded through congressional appropriations, the Board and  Reserve Banks are self-funded entities that engage in a variety of  activities that generate revenue, such as earnings from lending to  financial institutions. The Federal Reserve deducts its costs from these  revenues and transfers the remaining amount to the General Fund of the  U.S. Treasury (General Fund). In 2012, the Federal Reserve transferred  $88.4 billion to the General Fund.

Since 2009,  Reserve Bank inventories for pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters have  decreased due in part to the centralized program. In particular, from 2008  through 2012, the combined inventory for pennies, nickels, dimes, and  quarters decreased 43 percent. (See fig. 3.) CPO officials have  attributed these decreases in inventory and coin orders to the 2009  introduction of CPO management of the coin inventory but other factors  may have also contributed to the decrease, such as the 2007\u20132009  financial crisis and recession, which may have affected the public\u2019s  demand for coins.", "As part of the centralized approach to inventory management, in 2009,  CPO established national upper and lower inventory targets for pennies,  nickels, dimes, and quarters to track and measure the coin inventory.  CPO officials noted that these targets help meet their primary goal in  managing the nation\u2019s coin inventory: ensuring a sufficient supply of all  coin denominations to meet the public\u2019s demand. The upper national  inventory target serves as a signal for CPO to reduce future coin orders  from the U.S. Mint to avoid the risk of approaching coin-storage capacity  limits and the lower national inventory target serves as a signal to CPO  that there is a need to increase future coin orders to avoid shortages.  According to CPO officials, they view falling below the lower targets as  more problematic than exceeding the higher targets because the lower  targets are designed to guard against the more serious risk of not having  enough coin to meet demand. We analyzed national inventory targets  from 2009 to 2012 and found that in most cases the national inventory  targets were met. However, inventory exceeded the upper inventory  targets in 2009 for nickels and quarters; in 2010 for nickels, dimes, and  quarters; and in 2011 for quarters. In addition, the national inventory for  pennies was 7 percent below the lower targets in 2012.

Given that  the coin supply at each location differs depending on that location\u2019s  typical volume of coin payments and receipts, each Reserve Bank office  and coin terminal is required to hold a minimum 2 weeks of \u201cpayable   Prior to  days\u201d and a maximum 3 weeks of payable days in inventory. 2009, there were no required inventory levels for distribution locations  and coin shortages and excesses occurred in specific locations. Since  CPO has centralized the management Reserve Banks\u2019 coin inventory,  coin terminal operators we spoke with said coin shortages are less  common and that they are better able to manage their inventory and  provide depository institutions with the denominations they need to fulfill  public demand.", "In managing the coin inventory, CPO determines if coins should be  transferred from an area with more coins than needed to fulfill current and  future demand or if additional coins should be ordered from the U.S. Mint.  (See fig. 4.) To make this determination, CPO uses a proprietary  inventory management system that collects data on inventory, receipts,  and payments from the approximately 200 coin distribution locations and  forecasts expected changes in coin demand for each location. Before  transferring coins from one region to another, CPO considers whether a  region\u2019s future demand is expected to change and considers typical  seasonal shifts in coin demand and local market factors such as coin- recycling operations that could affect the flow of coins. These transfers,  known as interbank transfers, according to CPO officials, are the only  direct coin transportation cost to Reserve Banks because armored  carriers provide local coin transportation and delivery of new coins is  provided by the U.S. Mint. Coins are also transferred between Reserve  Bank offices and coin terminals within a region when distribution locations  need additional coin supply or have excess coin inventory. For example,  coins could be moved via interbank transfer from Reserve Bank offices in  Seattle or Minneapolis to support distribution locations in Helena,  Montana, and coins could be transferred among three distribution  locations in Helena, a Reserve Bank of Minneapolis office, and two coin  terminals. If there is an insufficient supply of coins to meet demand and  transferring coins would not be cost effective, CPO orders new coins from  the U.S. Mint.", "CPO orders new coins each month from the U.S. Mint based on its 2- month rolling forecast of expected demand, as shown above in figure 4.  CPO provides a monthly order to the U.S. Mint about 2 months prior to  expected delivery (e.g., CPO submits the August order in June), and to  help the U.S. Mint prepare for potential future orders, CPO provides  estimates of projected demand and new coin orders for up to the next 12  months. After submitting orders to the U.S. Mint, CPO may increase an  order or defer shipments to later months based on updated information. In  part to respond to these changes, each month the U.S. Mint produces a  safety stock of coins. If this stock is not applied to the current order, it is  used to fill future orders.expected demand, CPO determines which Reserve Bank will receive new  coins, and then Reserve Banks determine which offices and coin  terminals will receive them.

(See fig. 5.)  According to CPO officials, the 2009 introduction of centralized coin  management led to the reduction in coin inventories and the more recent  increases in coin orders reflect a return to a more normal ordering pattern  that is closely aligned with payments to circulation and receipts from  circulation. However, other factors may have also contributed to  decreased new coin orders in 2009, such as the 2007-2009 financial  crisis and recession, which may have affected the public\u2019s demand for  coins.", "In 2011, on behalf of Reserve Banks, CPO developed and negotiated a  contract with coin terminal operators, which standardized procedures and  internal controls for the storage and handling of coins across all Reserve  Bank districts. Prior to this contract, each Reserve Bank negotiated its  own contract with coin terminal operators that operated in its district. We  spoke with 5 of the 15 coin terminal operators, and they reported  satisfaction and efficiency gains with the standardized contract and  CPO\u2019s centralized management. For example, one coin terminal operator  told us that the Federal Reserve\u2019s centralized approach allows coin  terminal operators to manage their business proactively rather than  reactively. Among other things, the contract requires coin terminals to use  FedLine to order new coins and track changes to Reserve Bank coin  inventory held by the coin terminal.

Therefore, the lower  inventory target guards against a coin shortage if a disruption prevented  circulating coin payments from depository institutions. In addition, risk  management for the circulating coin inventory is built into the Federal  Reserve\u2019s overall risk management and contingency protocols.

However, CPO has not  established additional management goals or metrics to measure other  aspects of its management such as costs because, as discussed earlier,  CPO\u2019s primary goal is to ensure a sufficient supply of all coin  denominations are available to meet the public\u2019s demand. Federal  agencies have been required to develop performance goals and measure  and report on their progress in achieving these goals since the  Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was enacted in  1993.has chosen to voluntarily comply with the spirit of the act. In addition, our  previous work on managing results has shown that agencies should  identify goals and establish a suite of performance metrics to determine   Although the Federal Reserve is not covered by GPRA, the Board  whether they are meeting those goals. We have identified customer  satisfaction, efficiency, and costs, among others, as performance metrics  that can be used to measure an agency\u2019s progress towards its goals.  Moreover, costs are among the common performance measures used in  supply chain management. The Australian, Austrian, and Canadian mint  and central bank officials we interviewed have established multiple  performance goals and metrics for their coin inventory management.  For example, the Royal Australian Mint and its commercial bank partners  have established targets to reduce coin holdings that will result in  reducing the cost of freight and other related coin expenses. Further, the  Royal Australian Mint tracks and monitors coin management costs to  ensure that they are progressing towards their targets.", "We found that the Federal Reserve partially follows the key practice of  forecasting demand because it forecasts future coin demand and uses  this information to make decisions, but does not systematically track the  accuracy of its monthly forecasts compared to the final coin orders. As  discussed previously, CPO has a process in place to forecast demand by  tracking current inventory, payments, and receipts and using this  information to calculate expected future demand. These forecasts are  then used to plan and manage the circulating coin inventory, including  decisions on coin transfers and new orders. CPO officials told us they  review their annual forecasts, and have found their forecasts for  payments and receipts are within 10 percent of actual orders for pennies,  nickels, dimes, and quarters. However, CPO has taken minimal steps to  assess monthly forecast accuracy. CPO officials told us that they compare their initial coin orders to net pay, but do not track the accuracy  of their monthly forecasts because seasonal shifts in coin demand make  reviewing annual trends more useful for their purposes. Our analysis of  initial monthly CPO coin orders and actual U.S. Mint coin shipments from  2009 through 2012 indicates that initial orders were consistently less than  the final orders (i.e., U.S. Mint shipments of new coin). APICS\u2014an  operations management industry association that offers professional  certifications\u2014recommends that forecasting results must be continuously  monitored and a mechanism should be in place to revise forecasting  models as needed and that if the forecast consistently exhibits a bias, the  forecast should be adjusted to match the actual demand. According to  the Logistics Management Institute, accurate forecasts result in effective  and efficient inventories, whereas inaccurate forecasts often cause  inventory excesses and shortfalls. In addition, inventory management  experts told us that accurate forecasts would make the Federal Reserve  better able to respond to changing trends in coin demand, as discussed  later in this report. Taking additional steps to assess forecast accuracy  could help CPO identify the factors influencing forecast accuracy and  then adjust forecasts to improve accuracy.", "Although CPO has multiple systems that provide information from across  the supply chain, we found that it partially follows the practice of system  optimization because this information is not currently used to better  understand some additional aspects of its coin management activities to  optimize the efficiency of the circulating coin inventory. As discussed  earlier, CPO has access to information and resources from across the  circulating coin supply chain. This access includes information on actual  and forecasted coin demand and Reserve Bank coin management costs,  as well as information from stakeholders, such as new coin delivery  information from the U.S. Mint. In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken  some steps to identify areas where they could gain incremental efficiency  improvements such as the centralized management of the coin inventory  and note-processing efficiencies, which we discuss later.", "However, CPO could improve its use of information and resources to  identify and implement efficiencies within the supply chain by using the  range of information available to establish and track performance metrics  to measure progress. For example, the U.S. Mint\u2019s monthly production of  new coins could be more efficient with improvements to the accuracy of  initial new coin orders. Currently, the U.S. Mint produces a safety stock, in  part, to ensure it is able to produce enough coins to fulfill CPO\u2019s final,  adjusted order. More accurate monthly forecasts and coin orders could  lessen the need for the U.S. Mint to produce safety stock, and thus help  to optimize the efficiency of the supply chain. In addition, if CPO used its  information on Reserve Bank coin management costs and its knowledge  of coin management operations across the 12 Reserve Banks, it could  help to identify factors that have contributed to varying coin-management  costs at individual Reserve Banks and opportunities for cost savings that  could limit rising costs. Better information related to forecast accuracy and  costs could also aid CPO in using its information and resources to identify  inefficiencies and support system optimization. Further, optimizing U.S.  Mint and individual Reserve Bank operations could potentially contribute  to reducing U.S. Mint or Federal Reserve costs related to circulating  coins, a reduction that could potentially increase the amount of money  returned to the General Fund."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Demand for Currency Expected to Decline Gradually in the Near Term, but a Variety of Factors Make Predicting Longer- Term Change Difficult", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Changes in Demand for Currency", "paragraphs": ["To collect data and information on potential changes in the demand for  currency, the Federal Reserve has conducted studies and outreach with  groups such as depository institutions and merchants, and found a  general consensus that the use of currency may decline slightly in the  near term. According to the Federal Reserve, this expectation is due, in  part, to an increase in alternative payment options. Federal Reserve  officials we met with described how interrelated factors make it difficult to  predict long-term (i.e., 5 to 10 years) currency demand. The factors the  Federal Reserve identified as influencing currency demand and the  mechanisms used to supply that demand include the relative costs and  benefits of currency versus other forms of payment, the level of economic  activity and other economic conditions, technological change, and  regulations and policies. Federal Reserve officials explained that how  these factors will play out in the years ahead is unknown, and therefore  the magnitude of the change in demand for currency is uncertain.", "According to many agency officials, stakeholders, and foreign  government officials we spoke to, while there may be changes in the use  of various types of payments in the coming years, the effect on currency  demand is likely a gradual decline. Thus far, Federal Reserve officials  noted that their research indicates that the amount of currency in  circulation continues to rise and currency usage is currently steady.  Federal Reserve studies and data also indicate electronic payment  options have increased over time. For example, in a 2010 study, the  Federal Reserve reported that the number of non-currency payments\u2014 including credit card and debit card payments, among others\u2014increased  4.6 percent per year from 2006 to 2009. Since 2006, the debit card has  surpassed the check as the most used non-currency payment method,  with the number of debit card transactions increasing 14.8 percent per  year from 2006 to 2009. Over the same period, check volume decreased  7.1 percent per year. Many stakeholders noted that even with changes in  non-currency payments, the effect on currency demand is likely to be  gradual. For example, BEP officials stated that the increasing use of  electronic payments has not had a major impact on demand for currency.  Further, these officials said demand for currency may even increase and  that growing use of electronic and mobile payments will likely affect  checks more than currency. Royal Australian Mint officials also stated that  while the use of electronic payment methods is expected to increase as  new technologies emerge, how fast and when such a change will occur is  unclear.", "While data on credit card usage and electronic transactions are available,  the volume of currency transactions is difficult to measure. Specifically,  other data sources cannot be used to determine what portion of the  currency in circulation is being used for transactions\u2014for example, some  currency in circulation are stored, as opposed to being deposited or used  for commerce. As the use of non-currency payment methods has  increased, the quantity of notes in the economy has also grown.  According to Federal Reserve data, the number of transactional notes  (i.e., $1s, $5s, $10s, and $20s) in circulation has increased steadily from  approximately 19.6 billion pieces in 2009 to 21.8 billion pieces in 2012.  During this period, the value of currency in circulation rose approximately  26 percent. (See fig. 7.) Coin terminal operators noted that there will be a  continued need and demand for coins and notes, particularly because  there will always be some portion of the population who will only use  currency, such as individuals without bank accounts, or \u201cthe unbanked.\u201d", "Federal Reserve officials expect that their current procedures and  approach to managing the coin and note inventory\u2014including their  forecasting and monitoring of the coin inventory targets discussed  previously\u2014will allow the agency to accommodate gradual shifts in  demand. For example, to respond to increasing or decreasing demand for  coins and notes, CPO can decrease or increase coin orders from the U.S.  Mint and the Board can decrease or increase note orders from BEP.", "Specifically, in 2012 the Federal Reserve assessed how notes received  from circulation are processed and determined that current operations  can handle a significant change in volume\u2014either an increase or a  decrease\u2014without significant change to the operating model and staffing  levels. Nonetheless, according to the officials, CPO is continually working  to identify ways to streamline its processes to be more flexible and  adaptable to changes. In addition, CPO and the Reserve Banks have  established risk management plans and procedures to address the  effects associated with a short-term, unexpected change in coin and note  demand\u2014such as from a natural disaster.", "Other experts and foreign officials agree that well-managed currency  systems are capable of handling major trend-based changes. According  to inventory management experts we consulted, a key to effectively  managing a supply chain is dependable forecasts. Effective forecasts  would take both trends and cyclical demand changes into account.  Therefore, combining forecasts with continual tracking of demand and  inventory levels should allow the Federal Reserve to be able to adapt to  any major trend-based changes in coin and note demand. As discussed  earlier, this makes accurate forecasting by the Federal Reserve even  more important. Royal Australian Mint officials also stated that by  routinely monitoring activities such as coin trades and transfers between  and among institutions, any changes in these or other measures would  give officials insight on specific ways in which demand was changing,  which would ultimately allow for adjustments in the volume of coins being  circulated, responding to public demand.", "While Federal Reserve officials we met with indicated their current  processes should enable them to adapt to gradual changes in coin and  note demand, a significant and unexpected change could affect the  management of the coin and note inventories. According to Federal  Reserve officials and some coin terminal operators we met with, the  elimination of the $1 note for the $1 coin would be the type of event that  could significantly affect demand for a specific coin denomination, and it  would have implications for the overall management of both the coin and  note inventory. For example, Federal Reserve officials stated that  replacing the $1 note with the $1 coin would likely require increases in  coin vault space and manpower as well as improvements in coin  authentication technologies. CPO officials also said that if a large decline  in coin usage occurs, they would adapt their management of the inventory  in response. For example, if demand for coins were to decrease  suddenly, leaving too many coins in circulation, the Federal Reserve  would first stop ordering new coins from the U.S. Mint, and would then  focus on storing the excess coin inventory. Coin attrition would reduce  this inventory over time, and CPO officials anticipate that they would have  sufficient storage capacity available to accommodate the excess coins.  CPO officials told us that inventory levels would need to be well in excess  of the existing targets before they would have an effect on storage  capacity and related costs. Further, if public demand for coins decreased  substantially, additional storage could be needed to accommodate and  store the coins returned by depository institutions to the Reserve Banks.  Coin terminal operators also did not expect a decrease in coin demand  significant enough to exceed their storage capacity.", "In 2010, CPO began to develop a long-term strategic framework to  consider potential changes to currency demand over the next 5 to 10  years and how this change could affect CPO\u2019s operations. According to  Federal Reserve officials, while the future is inherently uncertain, this  framework is an internally focused effort to help them share information,  refine internal operations, and monitor trends. The Federal Reserve has  not established deadlines for completing this effort, but CPO officials said  they continue to share what they are learning from data and other  research, and they continue to assess current coin distribution and note- processing operations. The following activities are components of these  efforts:", "Engaging system stakeholders. As an initial step, CPO officials  interviewed stakeholders such as depository institutions, armored  carriers, equipment vendors, merchants, and alternative payment  providers to collect information and perspectives on potential changes  in currency demand. Groups such as the Customer Advisory Council  and the Cash Advisory Group also continue to serve as a mechanism  for the CPO to coordinate and collect data and information on  currency activity nationwide.", "Examining internal operations for coin distribution and note  processing. CPO officials have sought to increase the efficiency of  coin-distribution and note-processing operations to better position the  agency to adapt to future changes in demand. For example, the  Federal Reserve enhanced its note sensor technology in 2010,  improving the efficiency of note processing operations by nearly 10  percent, according to CPO officials. CPO officials told us that they  continue to look for other areas to incrementally improve and add  additional flexibility in their operations. Incremental improvements  such as those related to note processing activities could contribute to  supply-chain system optimization, as discussed earlier.", "Conducting research. The Federal Reserve continues to conduct  research and analysis related to Reserve Bank operations. For  example, one Reserve Bank is conducting the most recent in a series  of triennial payment studies, which it expects to complete later this  year, to determine the current volume and composition of electronic  and check payments, reporting trends in these payments since 2009.  As part of a broader effort to look at trends in various payment types,  another Reserve Bank is examining the detailed spending habits of a  selection of consumers, who were asked to document their  transactions and payment decisions over a period of time in a  shopping \u201cdiary.\u201d Because, as previously noted, determining how  much of the currency in circulation is being used for transactions is  difficult\u2014this type of study can help officials better understand  currency use in the United States. The diary study is expected to be  completed and published later this year, and CPO officials told us they  plan to assess and incorporate relevant findings into their currency  management operations.", "Australian, Austrian, and Canadian officials we interviewed are also  exploring the potential impact of alternative payment technologies and  continue to analyze past trends and to collect new data to inform these  research efforts. For example, Austrian and Canadian officials have also  conducted diary studies to better understand individuals\u2019 use of various  payment options.

According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2013 Annual Report to  Congress, this inventory level is sufficient to meet the demand for $1  coins for more than 40 years assuming a continuation of the current level  of demand. Federal Reserve officials told us the annual net demand for  $1 coins was approximately $51 million per year from 2010 through 2012.  Inventory increased steadily with the issuance of the Presidential Coin  series beginning in 2007, but has leveled off since the 2011 Treasury  decision to cease production of new $1 coins for circulation (see fig. 8).  In addition, $1 coin payments to depository institutions have declined  from $804 million in 2007 to $245 million in 2012, while receipts from  depository institutions generally increased until 2012. In 2012, because  there was less public demand for $1 coins than were in circulation,  Reserve Banks received more $1 coins back than they paid out, as  indicated by net pay in figure 8.", "According to Reserve Bank officials, depository institution  representatives, coin terminal operators, and vending machine industry  representatives we met with, $1 coins are readily available to the public  throughout the country. Most of the officials and representatives told us  that they do not have problems obtaining $1 coins or supplying them to  their customers, but emphasized that there is low public demand for these  coins. For example, Reserve Bank officials in the Cash Advisory Group  said that $1 coins are available at their locations nationwide and that they  are able to fill customers\u2019 orders as needed. Depository institution  representatives on the Customer Advisory Council told us their depository  institutions routinely fill $1 coin orders for organizations with standing  orders\u2014such as transit agencies or vending machine companies\u2014but  that requests from the general public are rare. A Federal Reserve coin  terminal we visited also had an inventory of $1 coins, and officials there  told us that while they generally receive $1 coin deposits, withdrawals are  rare. In contrast, representatives from the Dollar Coin Alliance said that  there is limited commercial and public access to the $1 coin and that  some alliance members have had difficulty obtaining the coins from  depository institutions. According to these representatives, the Federal  Reserve\u2019s treatment of $1 coins\u2014in particular, a limited ordering period  for new $1 coins featuring a specific president\u2014has hampered successful  circulation.

The Presidential $1 Coin Act requires Treasury and the  Federal Reserve to identify, analyze, and overcome barriers to the \u201crobust  circulation\u201d of $1 coins, including improved methods of distribution and  circulation, and improved public education and awareness campaigns.  Beginning in 2007, the Federal Reserve met regularly with depository  institution representatives to gather feedback about demand for $1 coins  and identify potential barriers to circulation. In its 2007 Annual Report to  Congress on the Presidential $1 Coin Program\u2014a statutorily required  annual report\u2014the Federal Reserve outlined actions it had taken to  eliminate identified barriers, including developing $1 coin distribution  plans, establishing a special ordering period for new coins along with  special packaging and order sizes, and communications with industry and  other federal agencies.conducted national and local outreach with coin user groups to gather  input and help plan for the introduction of the new coins. According to  Federal Reserve officials, most efforts began in 2007 and continued until  the 2011 Treasury decision to cease production of the $1 coin for  circulation.", "In addition, the Federal Reserve and U.S. Mint  While the Federal Reserve took steps to overcome barriers to the  circulation of the $1 coin to meet existing demand, according to Federal  Reserve officials, it can do little else given the $1 coin is no longer  produced for circulation and the agency\u2019s statutory responsibilities focus  on ensuring $1 coins are available to meet demand, not on taking steps  to change demand. The Federal Reserve\u2019s 2007 Annual Report to  Congress reported that the U.S. Mint and stakeholder feedback identified  the co-circulation of the $1 coin with the $1 note as the most significant  barrier to improved circulation of the $1 coin. In addition, many depository  institutions, coin terminal operators, experts, and foreign officials we met  with identified the $1 note as a barrier to the increased circulation of the  $1 coin and mentioned that eliminating the $1 note would increase  demand for the $1 coin. However, neither the 2007 Annual Report nor  subsequent annual reports identified the $1 note as a barrier to the $1  coin. According to Federal Reserve Legal Division\u2019s attorneys, they do  not consider the $1 note to be a barrier because they do not view co- circulation as limiting the circulation of the $1 coin. Rather, Federal  Reserve officials noted the $1 note is an alternative to the $1 coin that the  public freely chooses\u2014that is, their view is that the $1 coin is fully  available to the public and its circulation is thus at the level that the public  demands. According to Federal Reserve officials, the Federal Reserve\u2019s  authority does not extend to promotion, and therefore the agency is not  likely to take unilateral action to promote wider circulation of the $1 coin. If  this is the case, congressional actions would likely be the only feasible  action that could replace the $1 note with the $1 coin.", "Consistent with the actions of other countries, we have previously  recommended that the Congress replace the $1 note with a $1 coin due  to the financial benefit the government would receive from the  replacement. As we found in our prior work, other countries that have  replaced a low-denomination note with a coin, such as Canada and the  United Kingdom, stopped producing the note. Officials in these  countries noted this step was essential to the success of their transition to  the coin and that, with no alternative to the note, public resistance  dissipated within a few years. Australian and Canadian Mint officials also  explained that they took steps in advance of the issuance of their $1 coins  to facilitate public adoption. For example, Royal Canadian Mint officials  said that public outreach, stakeholder collaboration, and removing the $1  note from circulation were key elements of a successful transition to the  $1 coin in Canada.", "In its 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the Federal Reserve stated that  stakeholders and depository institution representatives reported through  their routine meetings that the $1 coins continue to be easy to order and  that its communications about the program have been effective, but that  transactional demand for $1 coins has not increased since the start of the  program and overall demand continues to come primarily from collectors.  Federal Reserve officials told us they continue to discuss the $1 coin as  necessary with groups such as the Customer Advisory Council, but that  they do not intend to take any additional actions.

To  identify actions taken to identify, analyze, and overcome barriers to the  circulation of the $1 coin, we reviewed the Federal Reserve\u2019s Annual  Reports to Congress on the Presidential $1 Coin Program for 2007  through 2013 and interviewed Federal Reserve officials. In addition, we  interviewed selected foreign government officials from Australia, Austria,  and Canada to identify examples of actions taken to promote low  denomination coins and to enhance the circulation of these coins in other  countries. We also analyzed Federal Reserve data on $1 coin inventories,  U.S. Mint orders, payments, and receipts from 2007 through 2012.", "We assessed the reliability of data used in this report by (1) performing  electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3)  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 through October  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

National upper and  lower inventory targets are reviewed and updated annually. In 2013, the  upper national inventory targets were set based on the average peak  Reserve Bank coin inventory from 2009 to 2012, and the lower national  targets were set based on the 10 consecutive days from 2009 to 2012  with the most coin payments to depository institutions.

(See fig. 13.) For example, in December  2012, the Federal Reserve paid about $479 million in coins to depository  institutions (payments) and received about $452 million in coins from the  depository institutions (receipts); this difference between payments and  receipts is also referred to as net pay.", "Net pay is the difference between coins paid to depository institutions and  coins received from depository institutions over a given period of time.  Net pay greater than zero (positive) indicates that the Federal Reserve  paid more coins to depository institutions than it received from depository  institutions during that period (e.g., month or year). In addition, positive  net pay indicates that additional coins\u2014coins transferred from areas with  negative net pay or new coins\u2014are needed to meet demand. CPO uses  national data on net pay, inventory, and expected changes to demand to  make inventory management decisions such as where to transfer coin  within and between Reserve Bank districts. When coin payments to  depository institutions are greater than coin receipts from depository  institutions, CPO orders new coins or uses circulated inventory to meet  demand. Figures 14 through 17 present annual data for net pay,  inventory, and new coin orders for quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies  from 2009 through 2012.", "To manage the circulating coin inventory, Reserve Banks incur coin  management costs and interbank transfer costs. The Reserve Banks\u2019  coin management costs include direct costs and support costs. (See fig.  18.) Direct costs are generally personnel costs such as salaries and  benefits and support costs include utilities, protection, facilities,  information technology, and other local and national support functions.  From 2009 through 2012, direct costs represented about 30 percent and  support costs represented about 70 percent of total coin management  costs. Interbank transfers are shipments of coins from one Reserve Bank  office region to another to ensure demand is met.

To assess the  Federal Reserve\u2019s management of the circulating coin inventory we  identified five key supply-chain management practices: collaboration, risk  management, performance metrics, forecasting demand, and system  optimization. Establishing, documenting, and following these practices  and their supporting characteristics contributes to a more effective  inventory management system. In addition, these supply-chain  management practices are interrelated\u2014as activities in one area may  have implications in another\u2014and can be used to achieve efficiency  improvements and cost savings. For example, collaborative working  relationships can improve risk management practices because  information related to disruptions and actions to minimize or mitigate  disruptions are more easily shared across the system.", "To assess elements of the five key supply-chain management practices,  we selected 14 supporting characteristics based on their relevance to  coin inventory management. Based on our review, we determined  whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of the circulating coin  inventory followed or substantially followed, partially followed, or  minimally or not followed each supporting characteristic. Our assessment  of the characteristics served as the basis for our overall assessment as to  whether each key practice was followed or substantially followed, partially  followed, or minimally or not followed. For example, if we found  supporting evidence that two of the three characteristics of a practice  were substantially followed but no evidence to support that the third  characteristic was followed we would determine that the key practice was  partially followed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Federal Reserve", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Lorelei St. James, (202) 512-2834 or stjamesl@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Teresa Spisak, Assistant  Director; Amy Abramowitz; Douglas Anderson; Patrick Dudley; Lawrance  Evans, Jr.; David Hooper; Delwen Jones; Sara Ann Moessbauer; Colleen  Moffatt Kimer; Constance Ify Onyiah; Josh Ormond; Jennifer Schwartz;  and Maria Wallace made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
