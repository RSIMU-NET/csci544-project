Fraud risks include risks that firms would misrepresent their program eligibility and potentially receive  contract awards for which they do not qualify. We identified internal  control-related deficiencies in the HUBZone program. For example, in  February 2015 we identified problems with the mechanisms that SBA  used to certify and monitor firms and that SBA was not following its policy  of recertifying firms every 3 years (a certified firm can participate in the  program as long as it remains eligible and is recertified).

Congress  subsequently expanded the criteria for HUBZones to add former military  bases, counties in difficult development areas outside the continental  United States, and certain areas affected by disasters. According to SBA  officials, 5,306 firms were HUBZone certified as of July 1, 2018. As of that  date, there were 20,154 HUBZone qualified census tracts, 834 HUBZone  qualified non-metropolitan counties, 125 HUBZone base realignment and  closure areas, 593 HUBZone Native American lands (Indian lands), and  95 HUBZone qualified disaster areas (87 qualified disaster census tracts  and 8 qualified disaster non-metropolitan counties).", "The HUBZone program provides certified small businesses located in  designated areas with contracting opportunities in the form of set-asides,  sole-source awards, and price-evaluation preferences.

A sole-source award is  a federal contract awarded, or proposed for award, without competition.  Also, in any full and open competition for a federal contract, the HUBZone  price evaluation preference allows the price that a HUBZone firm offers to  be deemed lower than the price of another offeror (if the HUBZone firm\u2019s  offer is not more than 10 percent higher than the other offer and the other  offeror is not a small business concern)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUBZone Certification and Recertification Processes and Related GAO Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To be certified to participate in the HUBZone program, a firm must meet  the following criteria: when combined with its affiliates, be small by SBA size be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, or  owned by an Indian Tribal Government, Alaska Native  Corporation, Community Development Corporation, or small  agricultural cooperative; have its principal office\u2014the location where the greatest number  of employees perform their work\u2014in a HUBZone; and have at least 35 percent of its employees reside in a HUBZone.", "In a 2008 report, we found that SBA had relied on information that firms  entered into an online application system called the HUBZone Certification Tracking System to indicate they met the size, ownership,  location, and employee residence standards.

Instead, the agency relied on  firms\u2019 attestations of continued eligibility. According to SBA officials at  the time, they did not believe they needed to request supporting  documentation from recertifying firms because all firms in the program  had undergone a full document review. We noted that SBA could apply a  risk-based approach to its recertification process to review and verify information from firms that appeared to pose the most risk to the program.  We concluded that recertification essentially remained a self-certification  process. We recommended that SBA reassess its recertification process  and add additional controls, such as developing criteria and guidance on  using a risk-based approach to requesting and verifying firm information.

However,  we also found that documents were missing, illegible, or did not  corroborate the information claimed regarding employees\u2019 residency for 9  of 12 firms that we reviewed. We focused on the document review  process for the principal office location and the employee residency  requirements because, according to SBA\u2019s March 2017 guidance for the  certification and recertification processes, firms must corroborate their  compliance with these requirements at both certification and  recertification. In addition, SBA officials told us that the document review  process is essentially the same for firms seeking certification as it is for  firms seeing recertification.

The  firm did not provide any supporting documentation because it did not  meet the threshold in the new recertification criteria to require a document  review. SBA officials said this likely resulted from a display error in the  online system. SBA officials said that they did not contact the recertifying  firm because the firm was not required to submit corroborating  documentation. However, without confirmation of the correct total number  of employees, SBA analysts would not be able to determine the firm\u2019s  compliance with the employee residency requirement (35 percent living in  a HUBZone) and therefore would not be able to determine the firm\u2019s  eligibility to continue HUBZone participation.", "SBA officials explained how they handled incomplete information  provided by firms by describing other procedures that analysts followed in  these cases. For example, if any employee\u2019s address did not match  across the firm\u2019s employee list, the employee\u2019s identification, or the  HUBZone map, the analyst reviewing the firm\u2019s application would request  clarification and enter the address from the identification into the current  HUBZone map. Or if the address could not be plotted, the analyst would  presume the employee lived in a HUBZone if the broader geographic  area on their identification (such as zip code) was clearly in a HUBZone.", "SBA officials said this approach is useful for applications from firms in  Puerto Rico, because of difficulties with mapping addresses in the  territory. SBA officials also said that if a firm did not provide  documentation for an employee or SBA could not verify it, but the firm  clearly met the 35 percent resident requirement, the analyst would not  follow up with additional documentation requests and not count that  employee as a HUBZone resident.", "However, these procedures are not documented in SBA\u2019s internal written  policies for certifying HUBZone firms and analysts did not document their  use of these procedures in the case files we reviewed. Specifically, the  policy manuals do not include certain procedures SBA officials explained  to us they used for the document review process, such as assumptions of  eligibility for addresses located in a broader geographic area that is  clearly a HUBZone.
