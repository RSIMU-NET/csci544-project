Explosives accounted for 4  million tons of the total 2.6 billion tons of hazardous materials (hazmat)  transported in the U.S. by land, air, and water in 2012. Explosives are  used in a variety of industries, including the mining, oil and gas, and  aerospace industries. Federal regulations require that explosives be  classified before being transported. Classifications denote the relative risk  posed by the explosive and dictate transportation requirements, such as  by which modes the explosive can travel. For example, only specific  classifications of explosives, which are determined to pose lower risks,  are permitted to travel by aircraft.

Hazmat regulations are coordinated with international standards  and generally govern the labeling, packaging, and transportation of  hazmat in commerce. Explosives are one of nine classes of hazmat. In  order to be transported, explosives must be assigned a classification. The  classification, which includes a number that denotes the risk level of the  explosive (from most to least hazardous), dictates associated  transportation requirements, such as by which transportation modes the  explosives can travel and how they are packaged. For example, class  1.1 explosives, which pose a mass explosion hazard, cannot travel by  aircraft but can travel by truck. Meanwhile, certain class 1.4 explosives,  which pose a minor explosion hazard, that meet specific requirements  can travel by aircraft or U.S. Postal Service. Classifications also include  \u201ccompatibility groups\u201d that denote which explosives can be transported  together. For example, the regulations do not allow blasting detonators,  which are used to trigger an explosive device, to be transported in the  same truck as primary explosive substances.", "Unlike some other classes of hazmat that can be self-classified (meaning  the shipper classifies the material), in order to be classified, explosives  must be first examined by one of six PHMSA-approved third party test  labs. The explosives manufacturer, which ultimately submits an  application to PHMSA for classification, first selects and hires one of the  test labs and makes a sample of the explosive available to the test lab for  examination. The test lab uses international standards to test the material  and to recommend a classification. PHMSA then reviews the  manufacturer\u2019s application, including the test lab\u2019s report and  recommended classification, and approves a classification for the  explosive (see fig. 1).", "In 2010 and 2014, the DOT OIG reported weaknesses in PHMSA\u2019s  management and oversight of the approvals process. For example, in  2010, the DOT OIG raised questions about the effectiveness of PHMSA\u2019s  oversight and found that PHMSA had not inspected any of the test labs in  10 years and that test labs did not always submit annual reports as  required. In 2014, the DOT OIG reported that PHMSA had addressed  these issues. However, the 2014 report found PHMSA evaluation forms  missing for many explosives classification reviews, a situation that DOT  OIG noted was an internal control weakness. As a result, the DOT OIG  recommended PHMSA require the use of evaluation forms to document  its review of explosive classification applications.

In response  to the DOT OIG\u2019s findings of oversight weaknesses from 2010, PHMSA  strengthened its activities to approve and monitor test labs. Specifically,  to ensure that test lab examiners meet the requirements specified in  regulation, PHMSA established an approval process that includes  interviewing examiners and reviewing test lab and examiner qualifications  and recertifying test labs every 5 years through an on-site inspection.  PHMSA officials stated that in addition to ensuring compliance with  regulations, an important goal of PHMSA\u2019s oversight of test labs is to  promote consistency across test labs. PHMSA officials stated that efforts  to promote consistency are particularly important given turnover\u2014half of  test labs were approved in 2012 or later.

However, PHMSA officials told us they give  test labs flexibility in how to apply these requirements on a case-by-case  basis when testing new explosives to recommend classifications. PHMSA  officials told us that granting this flexibility allows test labs to use their  expertise and professional judgment. For example, PHMSA officials noted  examiners can deviate from the proscribed tests in the test manual if they  justify their reasoning for doing so based on their expertise, and officials  at one test lab stated that, given the variation in the specific attributes of  different new explosives, such flexibility can improve their ability to  effectively test a new explosive. However, PHMSA and some test lab  officials also stated that this flexible approach can lead to inconsistencies  across test labs, such as a test lab examiner being unaware of a common  deviation from the proscribed test or similar types of explosives being  subject to different tests. For example, one examiner reported learning of  an \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that test labs can use alternative tests in cases where  multiple samples of the explosive cannot be destroyed due to costs, such  as for large and expensive explosives.

Two of  the six test labs we spoke to reported facing pressure from manufacturers  on how to conduct tests or which classification to recommend. A third test  lab also stated that manufacturers often aim to have their explosive  classified as class 1.4 since, as mentioned previously, such explosives  can be transported by aircraft. One manufacturer noted that having an  explosive classified as a 1.4 to travel by aircraft makes the product more  competitive since air travel is the fastest option to get the product to an  overseas customer. PHMSA officials stated that they are checking for  multiple things in their technical reviews, and that in addition to ensuring  that explosives are classified correctly, these technical reviews also help  PHMSA to improve test labs\u2019 performance.

PHMSA officials also  noted that technical reviewers may give some applications by more  recently approved test labs or examiners a closer look to develop a  \u201ccomfort level\u201d with their testing procedures, which can slow the review.  Similarly, officials noted there has been turnover among PHMSA\u2019s  technical reviewers, which can slow the process since the second-level  technical reviewer provides guidance and feedback to the first-level  reviewers as part of their training. PHMSA officials also noted that they  began emphasizing the process step of completing an evaluation form for  each application in response to DOT OIG\u2019s 2014 report, which affected  application review times.", "Other stakeholders we spoke with had varying views on PHMSA\u2019s review  process.

Specifically, four of the five  manufacturers and an explosives industry association said PHMSA\u2019s  review takes too long, while one manufacturer noted that turnaround  times have recently improved. For example, three manufacturers told  us that in their experience PHMSA\u2019s review often takes up to 6  months. Manufacturers and the association stated that PHMSA\u2019s  review process delays manufacturers\u2019 ability to get a return on  investments made in developing a new explosive.", "Opaque: Some manufacturers noted that PHMSA\u2019s review process is  opaque, leaving the manufacturer unsure of their application\u2019s status.  In particular, four of the five selected manufacturers and an explosives  manufacturing industry association we spoke to stated that PHMSA  could better communicate where applications are in the review  process. Manufacturers and the explosives industry association stated  that the uncertainty surrounding PHMSA\u2019s review process creates  business planning uncertainties, such as when to allocate staff and  resources to manufacturing and sales.", "Furthermore, some manufacturers and the manufacturers\u2019 association  questioned the value of what they see as an overly time-consuming and  opaque process and suggested that PHMSA should place more trust in  the test lab results to reduce the amount of time PHMSA takes to review  applications. For example, one manufacturer noted that PHMSA\u2019s review  adds little value since, in the manufacturer\u2019s experience, PHMSA rarely  changes a classification from the one recommended by the test lab. This  manufacturer noted that PHMSA\u2019s efforts would be best suited to  overseeing the test labs rather than reviewing applications and that the  test lab should have the final determination on the classification.", "In contrast to some manufacturers\u2019 views, other stakeholders, including  carrier associations and test lab examiners, were supportive of PHMSA\u2019s  oversight role, including the review and approval of test labs\u2019 classification  recommendations. One air carrier association stated that PHMSA\u2019s  oversight is critical given what the association believes to be the test labs\u2019  potential conflict of interest since test labs are paid by manufacturers and  since explosives, if misclassified, could pose a major risk during air  transport. The carrier associations we spoke to that represent air, rail, and  trucking modes noted that PHMSA\u2019s oversight is effective insofar as  explosives are classified correctly and incidents are rare. Specifically,  according to PHMSA data, PHMSA receives about 16,000 hazmat  incident reports each year, and of that number, an average of about 35  per year involved explosives between 2005 and 2015. A total of 388  such incidents occurred during that time period. Over the same time  period, excluding fireworks, only two incidents involving explosives  resulted in injuries, but no such incidents resulted in fatalities. In addition,  all of the six test labs we spoke with were generally supportive of  PHMSA\u2019s oversight role. For example, one test lab noted that PHMSA\u2019s  review is important for liability protection for the test labs, and expressed  discomfort at the notion of test labs becoming responsible for assigning  approvals without PHMSA\u2019s review, noting that while such a change  could speed the approval process, it could also decrease quality and  consistency across test labs.", "Recently, PHMSA has taken some steps to respond to manufacturers\u2019  concerns about the uncertainty and lack of transparency of the process.   PHMSA established an internal goal of 120 days for average application  processing times and, since the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, has  posted quarterly average application processing times on its website. For  the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, PHMSA reported the average was  99 days. In addition, in a February 2016 memo on reforming the  explosive classification approval review process, PHMSA noted that to  increase transparency, it had increased the information provided to  manufacturers in its online status reports so that manufacturers could  have better visibility into where each application is in the process.

To increase  outreach, as described above, PHMSA increased the amount of  information about applications online. PHMSA also described several  efforts that align with the goals of streamlining the regulatory system and  enhancing risk management. For example, in the memo, PHMSA stated it  would immediately begin a one-level technical review for certain  applications, including explosives classified as 1.1. Although these  explosives pose the greatest risk of mass explosion, PHMSA officials  stated that the review is relatively low risk since these explosives have  the most stringent packaging and transportation requirements. To be  classified as 1.1, the explosive must meet the standard of being stable  and not forbidden from transport but does not need to undergo further  testing and scrutiny that would be required to determine whether an  explosive could be classified at a lower risk that, for example, might allow  it to go on an aircraft. In the reform memo, PHMSA also indicated that it  would continue to look for future opportunities for streamlining. In  particular, PHMSA said it would look for (1) other types of applications  where a streamlined one-level technical review is appropriate and (2)  specific types of explosive approvals that could be standardized in the  regulations, which could allow for self-classification, meaning the  manufacturer could determine the classification.

For example, while, as described  above, PHMSA identified several factors, such as an application\u2019s quality  and complexity of the application and the explosive device, that can result  in a longer application review time, PHMSA did not discuss or provide  documentation considering how an improved information system could  allow it to better track and analyze these issues. Similarly, while PHMSA  officials stated that test labs\u2019 quality and experience could affect the  length of its review, PHMSA officials have not developed data fields that  could highlight such information in applications and be incorporated into  the new system, potentially improving PHMSA\u2019s ability to analyze the  quality and consistency both across test labs and the reviewers. This  could help the agency target efforts to streamline its process. Finally, as  mentioned previously, PHMSA has recently identified reforms such as a  one-level technical review and proposed standardization for certain types  of explosives, and has noted that it would like to explore new areas for  these opportunities. Without defining the necessary data elements to  capture during the classification application review process, PHMSA may  be unable to analyze the effects of previous reform efforts or identify  opportunities for further reform. Without a systematically developed plan,  PHMSA may miss opportunities to create an information system that  allows PHMSA to better meet the expectations of both external  stakeholders, such as manufacturers, and internal stakeholders\u2014i.e.,  PHMSA officials themselves."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although PHMSA has taken steps to strengthen its oversight of the  explosives classification process that align with its strategic goals,  PHMSA\u2019s ability to be responsive to stakeholder concerns and to  overcome challenges may be limited without a more systematic approach  to improvements in two areas: guidance to test labs and information  systems. Without systematically determining what guidance would most  benefit test labs and how to best communicate this guidance to test labs,  PHMSA\u2019s efforts to support increased consistency among test labs and  respond to test labs\u2019 desire for clearer guidance in certain areas may fall  short. Similarly, without developing a data plan that clearly defines what  information PHMSA most needs to meet its various objectives, the  effectiveness of PHMSA\u2019s data improvement efforts to meet the  expectations of internal and external users may be reduced. In contrast, a  carefully developed and implemented data plan could potentially help  PHMSA respond to manufacturers\u2019 concerns about the timeliness of  PHMSA\u2019s review process and mitigate PHMSA\u2019s challenges related to  limited staff resources while also helping it meet its goals related to  outreach, transparency, and developing a risk-based approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve PHMSA\u2019s oversight of the explosives classification process,  the Secretary of Transportation should direct the PHMSA Administrator to  take the following two actions:  1.
