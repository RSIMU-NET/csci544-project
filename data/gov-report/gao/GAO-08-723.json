In addition, GAO found wide geographic variation in the percentage of MUAs that lacked a health center site in both years. Most of the 2007 nationwide decline in the number of MUAs that lacked a site occurred in the South census region, in large part, because half of all awards made in 2007 for new health center sites were granted to the South census region. GAO also found that HRSA lacks readily available data on the services provided at individual health center sites. HRSA oversees training and TA cooperative agreement recipients, but its oversight is limited in key respects and it does not always provide clear feedback to unsuccessful grant applicants. HRSA oversees recipients using a number of methods, including regular communications, review of cooperative agreement applications, and comprehensive on-site reviews. However, the agency's oversight is limited because it lacks standardized performance measures to assess the performance of the cooperative agreement recipients and it is unlikely to meet its policy goal of conducting comprehensive on-site reviews of these recipients every 3 to 5 years. The lack of standardized performance measures limits HRSA's ability to effectively evaluate cooperative agreement recipients' activities that support the Health Center Program's goals with comparable measures. In addition, without timely comprehensive on-site reviews, HRSA does not have up-to-date comprehensive information on the performance of these recipients in supporting the Health Center Program. HRSA officials stated that they are in the process of developing standardized performance measures. Moreover, more than a third of the written feedback HRSA sent to unsuccessful Health Center Program grant applicants in fiscal years 2005 and 2007 contained unclear statements. The lack of clarity in this written feedback may undermine its usefulness rather than enhance the ability of applicants to successfully compete for grants in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Health centers in the federal Health Center Program provide  comprehensive primary health care services\u2014preventive, diagnostic,  treatment, and emergency services as well as referrals to specialty care\u2014 to federally designated medically underserved populations (MUP) or those  individuals residing in federally designated medically underserved areas  (MUA). To fulfill the Health Center Program\u2019s mission of increasing  access to primary health care services for the medically underserved, the  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)\u2014the agency within  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers  the Health Center Program\u2014provides grants to health centers. These  grants, along with other federal benefits available to health center grantees  through the Health Center Program, are an important part of successful  health center operations and viability. In 2006, Health Center Program  grants made up about 20 percent of all health center grantees\u2019 revenues. A  health center grantee may provide services at one or more delivery sites\u2014 known as health center sites. Not all health center sites are required to  provide the full range of comprehensive primary care services; some  health center sites may provide only limited services, such as dental and  mental health services. In 2006, approximately 1,000 health center grantees  operated more than 6,000 health center sites while serving more than   15 million people.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2002, HRSA significantly expanded the Health  Center Program under a 5-year effort\u2014the President\u2019s Health Centers  Initiative\u2014to increase access to comprehensive primary care services for  underserved populations, including those in MUAs. Under the initiative,  HRSA set a goal of awarding 630 grants to open new health center sites\u2014 such grants are known as new access point grants\u2014and 570 grants to  expand services at existing health center sites by the end of fiscal year  2006. New access point grants fund one or more new health center sites  operated by either new or existing health center grantees. In July 2005, we  reported challenges HRSA encountered during this expansion of the  Health Center Program. In particular, we found that HRSA\u2019s process for  awarding new access point grants might not sufficiently target  communities with the greatest need for services, though we concluded  that changes HRSA had made to its grant award process could help the  agency appropriately consider community need when distributing federal  resources. We also reported that HRSA lacked reliable information on the  number and location of the sites where health centers provide care, and  we recommended that HRSA collect this information. In response to our  recommendation, HRSA took steps to improve its data collection efforts in  2006 to more reliably account for the number and location of health center  sites funded under the Health Center Program.", "By the end of fiscal year 2007, HRSA had achieved its grant goals under the  original President\u2019s Health Centers Initiative and launched a second  nationwide effort, the High Poverty County Presidential Initiative. In fiscal  year 2007, HRSA held two new access point competitions, one focused on  opening new health center sites in up to 200 HRSA-selected counties that  lacked a health center site\u2014part of the High Poverty County Presidential  Initiative\u2014and one that was an open competition.", "To assist potential health center grantees in applying for new access point  grants, HRSA provides funds to national, regional, and state organizations  to promote Health Center Program grant opportunities and help applicants  secure funding. This funding mechanism is known as a training and  technical assistance (TA) cooperative agreement. For fiscal year 2007,  HRSA awarded nearly $53 million in cooperative agreements to national  organizations\u2014specifically, those that assist broadly with health center  operations as well as expand access to health care for underserved  populations\u2014and regional and state primary care associations (PCA),  organizations that also support health centers and other safety net  providers in increasing access to primary care services. HRSA also assists  potential grantees by providing written feedback to applicants that apply  for, but are not awarded, HRSA grants through the Health Center Program.  This written feedback\u2014known as summary statements\u2014characterizes the  strengths and weaknesses of the applications. The summary statements  are intended to help unsuccessful applicants improve the quality\u2014and  therefore success\u2014of future grant applications. The summary statements  are prepared by objective review committees selected by HRSA to  evaluate health center grant applications.

In this report, we examine (1) for 2006, the extent to which  MUAs lacked health center sites and the services provided by each site in  an MUA; (2) how new access point grants awarded in 2007 changed the  extent to which MUAs lacked health center sites; and (3) HRSA\u2019s oversight  of cooperative agreement recipients\u2019 assistance to new access point  applicants and feedback the agency provides to unsuccessful applicants.", "To examine the extent to which MUAs lacked health center sites  nationwide and the services provided by each site in 2006, we interviewed  HRSA officials and obtained health center site data from HRSA\u2019s uniform  data system (UDS). The UDS provided the zip code location of health  center sites as of December 31, 2006. We also obtained from HRSA data  on the geographic location of MUAs designated for 2006. We linked the  location of the MUAs to their associated zip codes using a geographic  crosswalk file based on U.S. Census Bureau data.

We limited our analysis to health center sites operated by  grantees that received community health center funding\u2014the type of  funding that requires sites to provide services to all residents of the service  area regardless of their ability to pay. In addition, because HRSA takes  into account the location of federally qualified health center look-alike  sites\u2014facilities that operate like health center sites but do not receive  HRSA funding\u2014when deciding where to award new access point grants,  we obtained from HRSA the location of health center look-alike sites in  2006 and compared them with the location of MUAs.", "To examine how new access point grants awarded in 2007 changed the  extent to which MUAs lacked health center sites nationwide, we obtained  from HRSA the applications submitted for the new access point  competitions held in fiscal year 2007 and the list of funded applicants for  these competitions. We reviewed the applications to determine the zip  code location of proposed new health center sites, that is, sites for which  the applicants requested funding, and the list of funded applicants to  determine the location of the new health center sites for which grants  were awarded in 2007. We also obtained from HRSA data on the location  of MUAs in 2007. We then compared the location of proposed and funded  new health center sites in 2007 with the location of MUAs in 2007. As  with the 2006 analysis, we limited our review to health center sites  operated by grantees that requested community health center funding\u2014 the type of funding that requires sites to provide services to all residents of  the service area regardless of their ability to pay.

Specifically, we  interviewed representatives of the eight national organizations that target  assistance to new access point applicants and a judgmental sample of 10  geographically diverse state PCAs. We reviewed copies of the  organizations\u2019 notices of grant awards, work plans (documents detailing  health center training and technical assistance activities), and semiannual  and annual progress reports submitted to HRSA. We examined  documents obtained from HRSA relating to its review of these cooperative  agreement recipients\u2019 fiscal year 2007 annual noncompeting continuation  applications and periodic comprehensive on-site reviews conducted by  HRSA. To evaluate HRSA\u2019s feedback to unsuccessful applicants, we  obtained from HRSA the summary statements that were issued to  unsuccessful applicants in connection with each of the three new access  point grant competitions held in fiscal years 2005 and 2007. We selected a  random sample of 30 percent of the summary statements based on  application score. This resulted in a sample of 69 summary statements out  of the universe of 230 sent to unsuccessful applicants. The results of our  analysis are generalizable to this universe.

For cooperative agreement  recipients\u2019 work plans, recipients propose training and technical  assistance activities in response to HRSA\u2019s cooperative agreement  application guidance, in which the agency provides general guidelines and  goals for the provision of training and technical assistance to health center  grant applicants.

Without standardized performance  measures, HRSA cannot effectively assess the performance of its  cooperative agreement recipients with respect to the training and  technical assistance they provide to support Health Center Program goals.  For example, HRSA does not require that all training and TA cooperative  agreement recipients be held to a performance measure that would report  the number of successful applicants each cooperative agreement recipient  helped develop in underserved communities, including MUAs.  Standardized performance measures could help HRSA identify how to  better focus its resources to help strengthen the performance of  cooperative agreement recipients.", "HRSA officials told us that they are developing performance measures for  the agency\u2019s cooperative agreement recipients, which they plan to  implement beginning with the next competitive funding announcement,  scheduled for fiscal year 2009.

This support can include helping potential applicants apply for  health center grants, identifying underserved areas and populations across  the country, and helping HRSA increase access to primary care services  for underserved populations.", "As part of the comprehensive on-site reviews, HRSA officials consult with  the relevant project officer, examine the scope of the activities  cooperative agreement recipients have described in their work plans and  reported in their progress reports, and develop performance measures in  collaboration with the recipient. Similar to the performance measures in  cooperative agreement recipients\u2019 work plans, the performance measures  used during comprehensive on-site reviews are also individually tailored  and vary by recipient. For example, during these reviews, some recipients  are assessed using performance measures that include the number of  training and technical assistance hours the recipients provided; other  recipients are assessed using measures that include the number of  applicants that were funded after receiving technical assistance from the  recipient or the percentage of the state\u2019s uninsured population that is  served by health center sites in the Health Center Program.", "After an assessment, HRSA asks the recipient to develop an action plan. In  these action plans, the reviewing HRSA officials may recommend  additional activities to improve the performance of the specific measures  they had identified during the review. For example, if the agency  concludes that a cooperative agreement recipient needs to increase the  percentage of the state\u2019s uninsured population served by health center  sites in the Health Center Program, it may recommend that the recipient  pursue strategies to develop a statewide health professional recruitment  program and identify other funding sources to improve its ability to  increase access to primary care for underserved people.", "Although HRSA\u2019s stated policy is to conduct on-site comprehensive  reviews of cooperative agreement recipients every 3 to 5 years, HRSA is  unlikely to meet this goal for its training and TA cooperative recipients  that target assistance to new access point applicants. In the 4 years since  HRSA implemented its policy for these reviews in 2004, the agency has  evaluated only about 20 percent of cooperative agreement recipients that  provide training and technical assistance to grant applicants. HRSA  officials told us that they have limited resources each year with which to  fund the reviews. However, without these reviews, HRSA does not have a  means of obtaining comprehensive information on the performance of  cooperative agreement recipients in supporting the Health Center  Program, including information on ways the recipients could improve the  assistance they provide to new access point applicants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA Provided Unclear Written Feedback to More Than a Third of Unsuccessful Applicants", "paragraphs": ["More than a third of summary statements sent to unsuccessful applicants  from new access point grant competitions held in fiscal years 2005 and  2007 contained unclear feedback. Based on our analysis of 69 summary  statements, we found that 38 percent contained unclear feedback  associated with at least one of the eight evaluative criteria, while   13 percent contained unclear feedback in more than one criterion. We  defined feedback as unclear when, in regard to a particular criterion, a  characteristic of the application was noted as both a strength and a  weakness without a detailed explanation supporting each conclusion. We  found that 26 summary statements contained unclear feedback. We found  41 distinct examples of unclear feedback in the summary statements. (See  table 5.) HRSA\u2019s stated purpose in providing summary statements to  unsuccessful applicants is to improve the quality of future grant  applications. However, if the feedback HRSA provides in these statements  is unclear, it may undermine the usefulness of the feedback for applicants  and their ability to successfully compete for new access point grants.", "Based on our analysis, the largest number of examples of unclear  feedback was found in the need criterion, in which applications are  evaluated on the description of the service area, communities, target  population\u2014including the number served, encounter information, and  barriers-\u2014and the health care environment. For example, one summary  statement indicated that the application clearly demonstrated and  provided a compelling case for the significant health access problems for  the underserved target population.

One summary statement indicated  that the application detailed a comprehensive plan for health care services  to be provided directly by the applicant or through its established linkages  with other providers, including a description of procedures for follow-up  on referrals or services with external providers. The summary statement  also indicated that the application did not provide a clear plan of health  service delivery, including accountability among and between all  subcontractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Awarding new access point grants is central to HRSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to  increase access to primary health care services in MUAs. From 2006 to  2007, HRSA\u2019s recent new access point awards achieved modest success in  reducing the percentage of MUAs nationwide that lacked a health center  site. However, in 2007, 43 percent of MUAs continue to lack a health  center site, and the new access point awards made in 2007 had little  impact on the wide variation among census regions and states in the  percentage of MUAs lacking a health center site. The relatively small effect  of the 2007 awards on geographic variation may be explained, in part,  because the South census region received a greater number of awards  than other regions, even though the South was not the region with the  highest percentage of MUAs lacking a health center site in 2006.", "HRSA awards new access point grants to open new health center sites,  thus increasing access to primary health care services for underserved  populations in needy areas, including MUAs. However, HRSA\u2019s ability to  target these awards and place new health center sites in locations where  they are most needed is limited because HRSA does not collect and  maintain readily available information on the services provided at  individual health center sites. Having readily available information on the  services provided at each site is important for HRSA\u2019s effective  consideration of need when distributing federal resources for new health  center sites because each health center site may not provide the full range  of comprehensive primary care services. This information can also help  HRSA assess any potential overlap of services provided by health center  sites in MUAs.", "HRSA could improve the number and quality of grant applications it  receives\u2014and thereby broaden its potential pool of applicants\u2014by better  monitoring the performance of cooperative agreement recipients that  assist applicants and by ensuring that the feedback unsuccessful  applicants receive is clear. However, limitations in HRSA\u2019s oversight of the  training and TA cooperative agreement recipients hamper the agency\u2019s  ability to identify recipients most in need of assistance. Because HRSA  does not have standardized performance measures for these recipients\u2014 either for their work plan activities or for the comprehensive on-site  reviews\u2014the agency cannot assess recipients\u2019 performance using  comparable measures and determine the extent to which they support the  overall goals of the Health Center Program. One standardized performance  measure that could help HRSA evaluate the success of cooperative  agreement recipients that assist new access point applicants is the number  of successful grant applicants each cooperative agreement recipient  develops; this standardized performance measure could assist HRSA in  determining where to focus its resources to strengthen the performance of  cooperative agreement recipients.", "HRSA\u2019s allocation of available resources has made it unlikely that it will  meet its goal of conducting comprehensive on-site reviews of each  cooperative agreement recipient every 3 to 5 years. Without these reviews,  HRSA does not have comprehensive information on the effectiveness of  training and TA cooperative agreement recipients in supporting the Health  Center Program, including ways in which they could improve their efforts  to help grant applicants. Given the agency\u2019s concern regarding available  resources for its comprehensive on-site reviews, developing and  implementing standardized performance measures for training and TA  cooperative agreement recipients could assist HRSA in determining the  cost-effectiveness of its current comprehensive on-site review policy and  where to focus its limited resources.", "HRSA could potentially improve its pool of future applicants by increasing  the extent to which it provides clear feedback to unsuccessful applicants  on the strengths and weaknesses of their applications. HRSA intends for  these summary statements to be used by applicants to improve the quality  of future grant applications. However, the unclear feedback HRSA has  provided to some unsuccessful applicants in fiscal years 2005 and 2007  does not provide those applicants with clear information that could help  them improve their future applications.

(HHS\u2019s comments are reprinted in  app. III.) HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  as appropriate.", "HHS said its most significant concern was with our focus on MUAs and the  exclusion of MUPs from the scope of our report. In our analysis, we  included the health center sites of 90 percent of all Health Center Program  grantees. We excluded from our review sites that were associated with the  remaining 10 percent of grantees that received HRSA funding to serve  specific MUPs only because they are not required to serve all residents of  the service area. Given our research objective to determine the location  of health center sites that provide services to residents of an MUA, we  excluded these specific MUPs and informed HRSA of our focus on health  center sites and MUAs. We agree with HHS\u2019s comment that it could be  beneficial to have information on the number of grants awarded to  programs serving both MUAs and MUPs generally to fully assess the  coverage of health center sites.", "HHS also commented that our methodology did not account for the  proximity of potential health center sites located outside the boundary of  an MUA. While we did not explicitly account for the proximity of potential  health center sites located outside an MUA, we did include the entire area  of all zip codes associated with an MUA. As a result, the geographic  boundary of an MUA in our analysis may be larger than that defined by  HRSA, so our methodology erred on the side of overestimating the number  of MUAs that contained a health center site.", "With regard to our reporting on the percentage of MUAs that lacked a  health center site, HHS stated that this indicator may be of limited utility,  because not all programs serving MUAs and MUPs are comparable to each  other due to differences in size, geographic location, and specific  demographic characteristics. Specifically, HHS commented that our  analysis presumed that the presence of one health center site was  sufficient to serve an MUA. In our work, we did not examine whether  MUAs were sufficiently served because this was beyond the scope of our  work. Moreover, since HRSA does not maintain site-specific information  on services provided and each site does not provide the same services, we  could not assess whether an MUA was sufficiently served. HHS also noted  that a health center site may not be the appropriate solution for some  small population MUAs; however, we believe it is reasonable to expect  that residents of an MUA\u2014regardless of its size, geographic location, and  specific demographic characteristics\u2014have access to the full range of  primary care services.", "With regard to our first recommendation that HRSA collect and maintain  site-specific data on the services provided at each health center site, HHS  acknowledged that site-specific information would be helpful for many  purposes, but it said collecting this information would place a significant  burden on grantees and raise the program\u2019s administrative expenses. We  believe that having site-specific information on services provided would  help HRSA better measure access to comprehensive primary health care  services in MUAs when considering the placement of new health center  sites and facilitate the agency\u2019s ability to evaluate service area overlap in  MUAs.", "HHS concurred with our three other recommendations. With regard to our  second recommendation, HHS stated that HRSA will include standardized  performance measures with its fiscal year 2009 competitive application  cycle for state PCAs and that HRSA plans to develop such measures for  the national training and TA cooperative agreement recipients in future  funding opportunities. With regard to our third recommendation, HHS  commented that HRSA has developed a 5-year schedule for reviewing all  state PCA grantees. HHS also stated that HRSA is examining ways to  better target onsite reviews for national training and TA cooperative  agreement recipients that would most benefit from such a review.
