Today, dependency on public assistance has dropped to a fraction of its Depression-era levels, and poverty rates among the elderly are now lower than for the population as a whole. At the same time, Social Security has become the single largest source of retirement income for more than 90 percent of persons aged 65 and older. Automatic adjustments were introduced in 1972 to reflect increases in the cost of living. Other program changes gradually increased social security coverage to larger portions of the workforce and extended eligibility to family members and disabled workers. Other benefit programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicare, and Medicaid, have also been added over the years. With regard to measuring income adequacy, various measures help examine different aspects of this concept, but no single measure can provide a complete picture. For various subgroups of beneficiaries that have lower lifetime earnings, poverty rates have also declined. Although the Social Security benefit formula favors lower lifetime earners, their lower earnings and work histories can leave them with incomes below the poverty level when they retire or become disabled. The outlook for future Social Security benefit levels and income adequacy depend on how the program's long-term financing imbalance is addressed, as well as on the measures used. GAO concludes that reductions in promised benefits and increases in program revenues will be needed to restore the program's long-term solvency and sustainability.

Today, dependency on public assistance has dropped to a fraction of its depression-era levels, and poverty rates among the elderly are now lower than for the population as a whole. At the same time, Social Security has become the single largest source of retirement income and provides income for over 90 percent of those 65 and older. However, in the future, Social Security\u2019s role could change.  Reductions in promised benefits and/or increases in program revenues will be needed to restore the long-term solvency and sustainability of the program. Within the program\u2019s current structure, possible benefit changes might include changes to the benefit formula or reductions in cost-of-living increases, among other options; revenue increases might include increases in payroll taxes or transfers from the Treasury\u2019s general fund. The various approaches to restoring solvency and sustainability will have different effects on benefit levels.", "To gain a better understanding of how Social Security benefits help ensure adequate income, you asked us to address: (1) how concern over income adequacy has shaped the Social Security program; (2) what measures help to examine income adequacy; (3) how income adequacy has changed over time, especially for different groups of beneficiaries; and (4) under the current system, how Social Security benefit levels and adequacy might change in the future.", "To assess how concern over income adequacy has shaped Social Security, we examined the legislative history, reviewed the applicable literature, and interviewed key individuals familiar with the program\u2019s history. To identify measures that help examine income adequacy, we reviewed literature and interviewed experts. (See app. I and II.) To examine historical adequacy trends, we analyzed published government data on historical income and benefits, examined benefits for illustrative workers, and examined detailed data for the current population. To illustrate the range of potential future benefit levels under the current system, we developed and used alternative benchmark policies that achieve 75-year solvency either by only increasing payroll taxes or by only reducing promised benefits. Our tax-increase-only benchmark uses a one-time permanent increase in payroll taxes beginning in 2002, though any policy that achieved solvency only by increasing taxes would have identical effects on adequacy. Our benefit-reduction-only benchmarks gradually phase in reductions from 2005 to 2035; the reductions are accomplished by changing the parameters of the benefit formula in various ways to achieve either proportional or progressive reductions. (See app. III.)  As we agreed, we did not examine any reforms that would restructure the current system, for example by creating a new system of individual accounts. Also, we did not report on any measures of individual equity, which measure the relationship between contributions and benefits, such as rates of return. Any of our benchmarks would have effects on individual equity as well as income adequacy.  With our benchmarks, we used two models to simulate benefit levels for future populations of beneficiaries, using the 2001 Social Security Trustees\u2019 intermediate assumptions.  At our request, the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Office of Policy applied our benchmark policies to its Model of Income in the Near-Term (MINT); and under contract to us, the Policy Simulation Group applied our benchmark policies to its GEMINI model. Both models are designed to examine a representative sample of future beneficiaries. (See app. IV.) We conducted our review from March through November 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title II of the Social Security Act, as amended, establishes the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program, which is generally known as Social Security. It provides cash benefits to retired and disabled workers and their dependents and survivors. Workers become eligible when they have enough years of earnings covered under Social Security; they and their employers pay payroll taxes on those covered earnings. In 1999, about 96 percent of all U.S. jobs are covered , and over 40 million people received $386 billion in benefits, which averaged about $800 per month or $9600 per year. The benefit formula takes into account the lifetime history of earnings and replaces a higher percentage of earnings for lower earners than for higher earners.", "In contrast, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income support to eligible aged and disabled persons regardless of their earnings history. Funds for SSI benefits come from general revenues, not payroll taxes. Persons with income or assets that exceed certain thresholds are not eligible for SSI. In 2001, the maximum federal SSI monthly benefit is $531 for an individual and $796 for a couple and is reduced to reflect receipt of other income, including OASDI benefits. In December 1999, over 6.5 million people received federally-administered SSI benefits; of these about 6.3 million received a federal benefit and about 2.4 million received an SSI state supplemental benefit.  In December 1999, the average monthly federal benefit was $342; the average monthly federally-administered state supplement was $111.", "Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance benefits are generally provided automatically and free of premiums to persons aged 65 or older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits.  Similarly, individuals who have been entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability benefits for at least 24 months are entitled to such benefits.  In addition, Supplementary Medical Insurance benefits are available on a voluntary basis with a monthly premium to cover doctors\u2019 services, tests, and a variety of over medical services.  In 1999, Medicare paid a total of $210 billion in benefits and covered nearly 40 million enrollees. According to current estimates, the Hospital Insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2029.", "Medicare beneficiaries and others who have low incomes and limited resources may also receive help from the Medicaid program.  In 1998, Medicaid made $142 billion in payments for medical services for 41 million recipients, of which about 4 million were aged 65 or older and 6.6 million were disabled.  Average payments were about $10,200 for the aged and $9,100 for the disabled.  Roughly $32 billion was paid for nursing facilities.", "According to the OASDI Trustees\u2019 2001 intermediate, or best-estimate, assumptions, Social Security\u2019s cash flow is expected to turn negative in 2016. In addition, all of the accumulated Treasury obligations held by the trust funds are expected to be exhausted by 2038. Social Security\u2019s long- term financing shortfall stems primarily from the fact that people are living longer while having fewer children. As a result, the ratio of workers paying into the system to beneficiaries has been falling and is projected to decline from 3.3 today to about 2 by 2030.", "To address the program\u2019s long-term financing shortfall, a variety of proposals have been offered. In choosing among proposals, we have suggested that policymakers should consider three basic criteria: the extent to which the proposal achieves sustainable solvency and how the proposal would affect the economy and the federal budget; the balance struck between the twin goals of individual equity (rates of return on individual contributions) and income adequacy (level and certainty of benefits); and   how readily such changes could be implemented, administered, and explained to the public.", "Moreover, as we have said, reform proposals should be evaluated as packages that strike a balance among individual reform elements and important interactive effects. Overall evaluation of each proposal depends on the weight individual policymakers place on each criterion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Social Security Has Focused on Reducing Dependency From its Inception", "paragraphs": ["From its inception, Social Security was intended to help reduce the extent of dependency on public assistance programs. As it has evolved, the program\u2019s design has reflected that objective. Over time, that objective has come to be stated more broadly as helping ensure adequate incomes. While the Congress has never explicitly defined what constitutes an adequate level of benefits, it stated as early as 1939 that its objective was to \u201cafford more adequate protection.\u201d However, individual savings and other resources were also expected to play a significant role."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social Security Intended to Insure Against Lost Wages", "paragraphs": ["In response to the grave economic problems of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Committee on Economic Security in 1934 to study the economic insecurity that individuals faced and to make recommendations on how to address it. The committee\u2019s recommendations became the basis of the Social Security Act of 1935, which created several programs to meet the needs of different population groups, including the aged. Two programs specifically addressed the aged population\u2014Title I\u2019s Old-Age Assistance (OAA) program and Title II\u2019s Old- Age Insurance (OAI) program. OAA benefits, administered by the states with both state and federal funds, were intended to provide immediate cash income for millions of elderly persons without sufficient income for a decent subsistence. OAI benefits, administered by the federal government and funded by equal contributions from both employees and employers, were designed for younger workers to build up their rights to annuities in old age gradually. In effect, the contributions would purchase insurance to protect workers against lost wages when they became too old to work.", "In debating the creation of OAI, proponents made a variety of arguments in its favor and mentioned several objectives that it would serve. Of these, helping reduce dependency on public assistance was arguably the most fundamental. The Congress was clearly concerned that an increasing number of people were becoming dependent upon the public for their well-being; Social Security would eventually provide benefits that workers and their employers would pay for. Other objectives that were discussed in the debate included stimulating the economy by providing cash income that people would spend and opening up jobs for younger workers by freeing older workers to retire.", "Implicitly, the Congress designed Social Security benefits with a focus on replacing lost wages. The original formula computed benefits as a percentage of lifetime wages covered under the program in a way that favored lower earners, reflecting a special concern for their benefit levels. Social Security\u2019s framers had targets in mind for benefit levels, but these targets did not appear to be based on any type of scientific research or data analysis. While the Congress made no assertions concerning whether the resulting benefits would be adequate, Senate and House reports stated respectively that under Social Security it would be possible to provide \u201cmore than reasonable subsistence\u201d and \u201cnot merely subsistence but some of the comforts of life.\u201d  The House report also noted that the \u201cbenefits provided for workers who have been employed during substantially all their working life will probably be considerably larger than any Federal-aided State pensions could be.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Program Changes Have Been Related to Income Adequacy", "paragraphs": ["As time passed, the Social Security program grew and evolved. Even before the first monthly benefits were paid in 1940, the Congress enacted amendments in 1939 to \u201cafford more adequate protection to more of our people,\u201d as House and Senate committee reports put it. Changes to benefit levels, coverage of earnings, and eligibility are especially relevant to the program\u2019s adequacy goals. In addition, the introduction of new programs addressed specific needs, such as covering health care costs, promoting retirement saving, and promoting and protecting employer-sponsored pensions.", "Changes to monthly benefit levels came in different forms at different times. From 1939 until 1950, there were no changes to the benefit formula, and benefit levels, after adjusting for inflation, fell as a result. The 1948 Trustees\u2019 Report expressed concern that inflation was diminishing the adequacy of Social Security benefits and presented a chart showing the decline in inflation-adjusted benefit levels. The 1950 amendments to the Social Security Act increased benefit levels substantially. Then, until 1972, periodic amendments made various ad hoc adjustments to benefit levels. Economic prosperity, along with actuarial methods that often left the Trust Funds with substantial surpluses, facilitated gradual growth of Social Security benefit levels through these ad hoc adjustments.", "In light of the steady growth of benefit levels, the 1972 amendments instituted automatic adjustments to constrain the growth of benefits as well as to ensure that they kept pace with inflation. Parameters of the benefit formula were automatically adjusted to reflect inflation, and the adjustments affected levels of benefits for both existing and new beneficiaries. However, wages grew more slowly and prices grew more quickly in the 1970s than they had historically. As a result, initial benefit levels grew faster than intended. The program\u2019s first benefit reductions in 1977 attempted to correct for those unintended consequences of the 1972 amendments, and the resulting pattern of increasing and then declining benefit levels has become known as the \u201cnotch.\u201d In the process, the benefit formula was redesigned so that initial benefits would generally increase with wages for each new group of beneficiaries. As individuals aged, annual cost-of-living adjustments would then increase benefits to keep pace with inflation. In effect, the new formula\u2019s design would generally replace pre-retirement wages for similar individuals at a consistent rate across age groups. Implicitly, this episode illustrates the focus of the Congress on replacing wages and also identifies benefit levels that the Congress considered higher than they intended. The only other significant benefit reductions came in 1983 when the Congress delayed cost-of-living adjustments primarily to address short-term financing problems and gradually increased the retirement age to address long-term financing problems.", "In addition, a variety of other types of program changes had effects on the extent to which the program helped ensure income adequacy. As amendments extended Social Security coverage to more jobs, more workers would eventually receive benefits. Initially, Social Security only covered the roughly 60 percent of workers in \u201ccommerce and industry\u201d whose wages could most easily be taxed and tracked. As the program matured, coverage was gradually extended to new groups of workers, such as farm workers, domestic workers, self-employed workers, and some federal and state government workers. Today, Social Security covers about 96 percent of all U.S. jobs .", "Moreover, various amendments extended eligibility to more types of beneficiaries. Under the 1935 act, only some retired workers were to receive benefits. The 1939 amendments extended benefit eligibility to wives, widows, children, and dependent parents age 65 and older. The 1956 amendments extended eligibility to disabled workers, and the 1958 amendments extended eligibility to their dependents. In addition, the 1956 and 1961 amendments extended eligibility to women and men, respectively, at age 62 for retired workers, spouses, and widow(er)s, though worker and spouse benefits taken before the full retirement age were reduced to take account of the longer period over which they would be paid.", "Outside Social Security, other legislation also addressed income adequacy in various ways. Other benefit programs were created and changed to help ensure adequate incomes. In 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were created to alleviate the historically increasing strains on incomes from paying for health care. In 1972, Title XVI\u2019s Supplemental Security Income replaced Title I\u2019s Old-Age Assistance.", "Moreover, as both House and Senate reports noted in 1939, \u201cindividual savings and other resources must continue to be the chief reliance for security.\u201d Over the years, the Congress has enacted legislation to promote employer-sponsored pensions and make them more secure. The Congress has also enacted legislation to promote individual retirement savings and encourage greater work-force participation by the aged and disabled."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "No Single Measure Gives Complete Picture of Income Adequacy", "paragraphs": ["Various measures have been developed to examine different aspects of income adequacy, but no single measure offers a complete picture. A universally accepted definition of \u201cincome adequacy\u201d does not exist; focusing on a single measure would implicitly endorse the concept of adequacy it measures while dismissing other concepts. Several examples of three broad types of measures illustrate the range of relevant measures. Each measure has characteristics that reflect different outlooks on the issue, including how it is calculated, how it accounts for different types of households, how it accounts for geographic variations, and how it is updated over time.  In addition, for any type of measurement, what types of income are counted presents a key issue.", "The first type of measure includes variations of dependency rates. Dependency rates speak to Social Security\u2019s fundamental objective of reducing dependence on public assistance programs, such as SSI or state and local general assistance programs. Some sources have reported dependency rates over the years that reflect a wide variety of sources of income support while other sources report rates that only reflect federal income support programs. For example, as cited by congressional reports, the dependency rate of over 50 percent of the elderly in the 1930s reflected dependence on family members and private charities as well as public assistance. Moreover, public assistance includes a variety of federal, state, and local programs in addition to OAA and SSI. As a result of the extensive effort required to identify all sources of support, the most readily available annual dependency rate data reflects only dependency on OAA and SSI. Accounting for different types of households, geographic variations, and changes over time are not critical concerns in calculating the rates because the rates simply measure whether individuals or households receive public assistance, wherever they are, and whatever the eligibility criteria happen to be. However, the issues of geography and eligibility do raise questions about how to interpret the rates because benefit standards and eligibility provisions for public assistance programs have varied considerably by location and over time.", "The second type of measure includes rates that express the percentage of the population that has incomes below a given adequacy standard. For example, the poverty rate shows the percentage of individuals whose household income falls below the official poverty thresholds, which attempt to specify an income that would afford a minimal standard of living. Different thresholds apply for different types and sizes of households but are the same for every location in the country. The official poverty thresholds were originally developed in 1963 and were built upon a government family food plan. Initially, the thresholds were updated to reflect the change in the cost of the food plan, but since 1969, they have been updated annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  In 1969, the Bureau of the Budget established the thresholds as the official definition of poverty for statistical use in all executive departments.", "The poverty threshold is only one of many adequacy standards that have been developed over the years.  Moreover, various government programs and descriptive statistics use different percentages of the poverty threshold, for example, 125 or 150 percent of poverty in determining benefits or eligibility. Some standards focus on determining the income level needed for a moderate subsistence, not merely a minimal one. The bases of the various standards include government-developed family budgets, expenditure data, income data, and even public opinion polls. The various adequacy standards have also used different approaches to capture household and geographic variations and to reflect changes over time.  A variety of studies have evaluated the poverty threshold and explored possible changes to it.  (See app. II.)", "The third type of measure, the replacement rate, speaks to Social Security\u2019s objective of replacing lost wages, which is implicit in the program\u2019s benefit formula. In contrast to other types of measures, it focuses on whether retirement income is sufficient to maintain the standard of living a given household enjoyed before retirement, not just meet some socially defined standard of adequacy. Generally, it is calculated as the ratio of retirement income in the first year of retirement to household income in the year immediately preceding retirement.However, the actual experience of a given household could easily involve phased-in retirement or situations where one spouse retires while the other continues to work. Such irregularities present problems in interpreting replacement rates for actual households. Still, these rates can be useful for demonstrating the effects of program changes by focusing on illustrative workers with standardized work experiences. With replacement rates, geographic variations and updating the measure over time are not relevant issues because the household\u2019s own experience is the basis for the measure regardless of location or year.", "All of these types of measures depend significantly on what types of income are counted.  Some dependency rates look only at specific sources of public assistance, while others attempt to reflect all types of public assistance and some even try to reflect dependency of private charities and family members.  In the case of poverty rates, one criticism has been that before-tax income is compared with thresholds based on after-tax income.  In the case of replacement rates, researchers have noted that the measures of retirement and pre-retirement incomes should be consistent, especially with respect to before- or after-tax status.  Finally, a wide range of noncash benefit programs, notably Medicare and Medicaid, also support the standards of living of their beneficiaries though such benefits are not always reflected in measures of income adequacy.  For example, replacement rates typically only consider cash income before and after retirement.  Also, noncash benefits are not included as income in determining poverty status, and the living costs they support are not explicitly reflected in the poverty threshold against which income is compared.  In particular, considerable debate surrounds how to treat medical care needs and resources in measuring adequacy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adequacy of Beneficiaries\u2019 Total Income Has Generally Increased Over Time", "paragraphs": ["The adequacy of income for the elderly has generally increased since the 1930s, according to various measures. For example, dependence on public assistance has fallen, as have poverty rates for the elderly. The largest changes occurred in the first few decades of the program\u2019s history; improvements in the past 20 years have slowed or even stopped, depending on the measure used. At the same time, Social Security has become the most important source of income for the elderly and disabled.

Meanwhile, receipt of Social Security benefits among the elderly has grown significantly from less than 1 percent to over 90 percent. (See fig. 1.) A 1938 Social Security Bulletin reported a dependency rate of 65 percent, which included assistance to those who were totally or partially dependent on friends and relatives. Among the elderly, OASDI beneficiaries outnumbered OAA beneficiaries for the first time between 1950 and 1955 and, by 1960, a majority received Social Security benefits.", "Since 1980, roughly 90 percent of the elderly have received benefits. The rapid increase in the percentage receiving benefits and the eventual leveling off illustrates the natural maturing of the Social Security system. When monthly benefits were first paid in 1940, only those just turning 65 received benefits; older individuals were not eligible. As each year passed, one additional age group was added to the beneficiary rolls, and more individuals from the earlier, ineligible age groups died.", "Poverty rates for the elderly have also declined, from 35 percent in 1959 to about 10 percent in 1999.

Other sources of retirement income have also grown. Periods of economic prosperity have contributed to the growth of all sources of retirement income.", "Social Security\u2019s benefit levels have generally increased over the years. Replacement rates for illustrative workers with steady lifetime earnings histories show how changes in the benefit formula have affected benefit levels because using such workers holds other factors equal that might also have an effect. (See fig. 4.) For example, using illustrative workers filters out the effects of changes in the covered population or changes in work and retirement patterns. The declining replacement rates during the early years reflect that no benefit increases were enacted until 1950; fig. 4 also shows a sharp increase in replacement rates that coincides with the 1950 amendments. From 1950 until the early 1970s, replacement rates fluctuated noticeably more from year to year than over other periods; this pattern reflects the ad hoc nature of benefit increases over that period. The rapid increases in the 1970s and the rapid decline in the early 1980s reflects the effects of the notch and efforts to correct it. The smoother pattern that appears since that time reflects the automatic indexing of benefits as enacted in 1977. While there have been many changes in the program for many reasons at different points in time, the replacement rates experienced by today\u2019s new retirees are notably consistent with the levels that Social Security\u2019s designers envisioned for a fully mature system over 60 years ago.", "At the same time that benefit levels have increased, so has the share of elderly receiving benefits. This is also true of employer-sponsored pensions, earnings, and income from saved assets. Like figure 1, figure 5 shows that the percentage of the elderly receiving Social Security benefits has increased as dependence on public assistance has declined. Figure 5 also shows that Social Security provides income to more elderly households than any other source of retirement income, although other sources have also increased in importance. The percentage of the elderly who receive income from employer pensions increased from 5 percent in 1937 to 43 percent in 1998. The percentage receiving income from saved assets increased from about 15 percent to over 60 percent. The percentage receiving earned income increased from 1937 to 1962 but dropped from 1962 to 1998.  In addition to sources of cash income, noncash benefit programs that did not exist in the 1930s now play a major role in supporting the standards of living of Social Security beneficiaries.  For example, Medicare is available to all Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 and older and all disabled beneficiaries after 24 months, among others.", "In addition to providing some income to nearly all elderly persons, Social Security is the largest source of income for most. In 1998, Social Security provided more than 50 percent of total income for 63 percent of aged beneficiaries, and it was the only source of income for about 18 percent of aged beneficiaries. Still, other sources of retirement income largely determine who will have the highest retirement incomes. Elderly households with the highest levels of income tend to have substantial income from employer pensions, earnings from employment, and saved assets, while those with the lowest incomes do not. For example, in 1996, 18 percent of all aged beneficiary units without earnings from employment were poor as compared with only 2 percent who received earnings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subgroups With Lower Lifetime Earnings Remain Vulnerable", "paragraphs": ["Income adequacy has also improved substantially for specific subgroups of beneficiaries, such as the very old (85+ years of age), minorities, women, singles, widows, and the disabled. However, even with those improvements, significant levels of poverty remain. This fact largely reflects that lifetime earnings and access to other sources of retirement income tend to be lower among such groups. Social Security is a major component of retirement income for these sub-populations. For example, in 1998, when we exclude Social Security income from total income, 67 percent of unmarried women aged 85 and over have income that falls below the poverty line.", "As figure 6 shows, poverty rates are higher than average for older age groups, for women, for minorities, and those living alone. Those individuals in older age groups are less likely to have pension benefits or income from saved assets. Women also experience high rates of poverty as compared to men.

Minorities such as Hispanics and blacks experience higher levels of poverty than their white counterparts, as do unmarried women and women living alone.", "Percent of elderly households with income below poverty Poverty rates also vary by living situation. In 1999, elderly persons living alone were more likely to be poor (14 percent of men and 20 percent of women) than married couple families (6 percent). Of the 1.8 million elderly poor who lived alone in 1999, about 1.5 million were women. Aged African-Americans and Hispanics females living alone are most at risk for living in poverty. In 1999, almost 58 percent of aged Hispanic females living alone were in poverty, while 44 percent of aged African-American females were in poverty.", "Individuals who fall into more than one group with higher poverty rates are especially at risk of poverty.

In contrast, 21 percent of white females aged 65 to 74 were poor, and poverty rates for the male counterparts for each category were either less or there were too few cases available to make an assessment.", "Social Security provides an important source of income for the disabled. In 1999, disabled workers made up 11 percent of all OASDI beneficiaries. As with the elderly, Social Security is a major component (38 percent) of family income for disabled worker families. Also, 48 percent of disabled worker families get half of their income or more from Social Security, while 6 percent have no other income.

Fifteen percent of disabled beneficiaries were white, 31 percent were black, and 26 percent were Hispanic. Only 12 percent of the disabled who lived with relatives lived in poverty, compared with 35 percent who did not.

To illustrate the range of possible outcomes, we developed benchmark policy scenarios that either only increase taxes or only reduce benefits. Even without new benefit reductions, our analysis shows that replacement rates could decrease as the program\u2019s full retirement age gradually continues to increase under current law, depending on the retirement decisions of future retirees. However, even with those reductions, our analysis shows that the adequacy of retirement income would improve markedly using one adequacy standard but change very little using another. Future benefit levels will also depend on the extent and nature of any benefit reductions. More progressive approaches to benefit reductions would result in greater adequacy for lower-earning beneficiaries. In turn, adequacy for various subgroups of beneficiaries would depend in turn on the earnings levels typical of those subgroups.

These benchmarks used the program\u2019s current benefit structure and the 2001 OASDI Trustees\u2019 intermediate, or best-estimate, assumptions. The benefit reductions are phased in between 2005 and 2035 to strike a balance between the size of the incremental reductions each year and the size of the ultimate reduction. At our request, SSA actuaries scored our benchmark policies and determined the parameters for each that would achieve 75-year solvency. Table 1 summarizes our benchmark policy scenarios. For our benefit reduction scenarios, the actuaries determined these parameters assuming that disabled and survivor benefits would be reduced on the same basis as retired worker and dependent benefits. If disabled and survivor benefits were not reduced at all, reductions in other benefits would be deeper than shown in this analysis.

We examined adequacy measures for illustrative workers with different steady lifetime earnings histories, for the entire beneficiary population, and also for different subgroups. To look at representative samples for the beneficiary population and subgroups, we used both SSA\u2019s MINT model and the Policy Simulation Group\u2019s GEMINI model. The MINT model allows us to look at total retirement income in 2020 across different age groups and races while the GEMINI model allows us to focus on specific birth cohorts reaching age 62 in various years, which we selected to look at long-term trends. As with any such simulation models, these models simulate income using a combination of historical data from small samples of the population and a variety of assumptions about future trends. At their best, such models can only provide very rough estimates of future incomes.

Figure 7 shows future replacement rates under our tax- increase-only benchmark for a range of illustrative retired workers. The full retirement age is the age at which full benefits are paid and historically has been age 65. Under current law, the full retirement age is gradually increasing, beginning with retirees born in 1938, and will reach 67 for those born in 1960 or later. For workers who retire at a given age, an increase in the full retirement age reduces monthly benefits because the actuarial reduction for early retirement increases. For example, for workers who will face a full retirement age of 67 and retire early at 65, monthly benefits will be reduced actuarially by 13.3 percent while their benefits would not have been reduced at all if the full retirement age had been kept at 65. Moreover, the 13.3 percent reduction applies to such workers equally at all earnings levels. As a result, increasing the full retirement age from 65 to 67 implies that replacement rates for illustrative low earners would decline from 57 to 49 percent while for illustrative high earners they would decline from 35 to 30 percent.

Using our tax-increase-only benchmark policy, we calculated the percentage of retired workers with Social Security benefits that fall below two different adequacy standards\u2014the official poverty threshold and one- half median income. The official poverty threshold is adjusted each year to reflect inflation. In contrast, our simulation assumes that the one-half median income threshold will grow at the same rate as Social Security\u2019s Average Wage Index, since wages are the largest component of family income. Figure 8 shows that the percentage of retired workers with benefits below the poverty threshold drops dramatically over time while the percentage with benefits below one-half median income changes very little. The difference in these percentage measures simply reflects differences in the assumptions underlying each adequacy standard. Since initial Social Security benefits are designed to increase with wages, and wages are assumed to grow faster than prices, benefit levels will grow faster than an adequacy standard that grows only by prices. In contrast, benefits will grow at roughly the same rate as a standard that grows by wages.

Also, the figure shows that percentage of workers with benefits below the poverty threshold would be slightly higher in our simulations for those retiring in 2032 rather than 2017. This reflects primarily that the benefit reductions in our benchmarks are more fully phased in for the 2032 group. The declines in the percentages from the 2032 to 2047 retirement years largely reflects the effects of the disparity between growth in wages and prices, as illustrated earlier; since the benefit reductions are fully phased in by 2035, the last two age groups experience nearly the same benefit reductions.", "Percent of cohort with Social Security benefits below poverty 1955 (2017)", "1970 (2032)", "1985 (2047)", "Birth year (age 62 year)", "The differences in adequacy estimates across benefit-reduction scenarios reflect how different benefit reduction approaches will have different effects on workers with different earnings.

Figure 10 illustrates how different benefit reduction approaches would produce benefit reductions that would vary by benefit levels.

The so-called \u201climited-proportional\u201d benefit-reduction benchmark would be even more progressive than the progressive benefit- reduction benchmark because a portion of benefits below a certain level are protected from any reductions while reductions above that level are proportional.

In this case, we present our analysis using SSA\u2019s MINT model because it allows us to examine different races. However, these estimates for the year 2020 reflect benefit reductions that are not fully phased in as well as benefits for beneficiaries from many birth cohorts who will be subject to various levels of the phased-in benefit reductions.

Several factors relating to multiple sources of income have contributed to this risk, and many of these factors can be expected to have similar effects in the future. As people get older, they may spend down their retirement savings, especially as health and long- term-care costs mount up, and they are less likely to work. Also, they are more likely to be widowed. For a couple receiving one retired worker benefit and one spouse benefit, the household\u2019s Social Security benefits would fall by 33 percent when either is widowed. For a couple in which both spouses receive retired worker benefits on their own earnings records, household benefits could fall by as much as 50 percent when either is widowed. In addition, widows might lose employer-sponsored pension benefits, which would happen if their spouse elected a self-only annuity instead of a joint-and-survivor annuity.

While many have noted the importance that Social Security plays in helping ensure adequate incomes for its beneficiaries, the Congress has never explicitly defined the term \u201cadequacy.\u201d  In the end, setting benefit levels to address the adequacy issue will always be, as it has always been, a policy decision for the Congress. Still, income adequacy is only one of several criteria to consider in an overall evaluation of comprehensive Social Security reform proposals. Specifically, income adequacy should be balanced against individual equity, or the extent to which benefits are proportional to contributions.  Other criteria include the extent to which proposals achieve sustainable solvency, how they would affect the economy and the federal budget, and how readily changes could be implemented, administered, and explained to the public.", "Current demographic trends confront us with a reality that cannot be ignored. If people will be living longer, then maintaining today\u2019s levels of monthly benefits for all beneficiaries would require either more revenues, from whatever sources, or would require that workers wait longer to collect them. The other alternative of reducing monthly benefits would tend to diminish income adequacy for beneficiaries. However, our analysis shows that more progressive approaches to reducing monthly benefits would have a smaller effect on poverty rates, for example, than less progressive approaches. Also, reductions that protect benefits for survivors, disabled workers, and the very old would help minimize reductions to income adequacy, though they would place other beneficiaries at greater risk of poverty.", "More broadly, the choices the Congress will make to restore Social Security\u2019s long-term solvency and sustainability will critically determine the distributional effects of the program, both within and across generations. In turn, those distributional effects will determine how well Social Security continues to help ensure income adequacy across the population.", "As our analysis has also shown, the effects of some reform options parallel those of benefit reductions made through the benefit formula, and those parallels provide insights into the distributional effects of those reform options. For example, if workers were to retire at a given age, an increase in Social Security\u2019s full retirement age results in a reduction in monthly benefits; moreover, that benefit reduction would be a proportional, not a progressive reduction. Another example would be indexing the benefit formula to prices instead of wages. Such a revision would also be a proportional reduction, in effect, because all earnings levels would be treated the same under such an approach. In addition, holding all else equal, such an approach would implicitly result in future poverty rates that would be close to today\u2019s rates instead of falling as they would with the current benefit formula.", "Therefore, in finding ways to restore Social Security\u2019s long-term solvency and sustainability, the Congress will address a key question, whether explicitly or implicitly: What purpose does it want Social Security to serve in the future? to minimize the need for means-tested public assistance programs; to minimize poverty; using what standard of poverty; to replace pre-retirement earnings; to maintain a certain standard of living; or to preserve purchasing power?", "The answer to this question will help identify which measures of income adequacy are most relevant to examine.  It will also help focus how options for reform should be shaped and evaluated.  Our analysis has illustrated how the future outlook depends on both the measures used and the shape of reform.  While the Congress must ultimately define Social Security\u2019s purpose, our analysis provides tools that inform its deliberations.", "Still, changes to benefit levels would typically only be part of a larger reform package, and Social Security is only one part of a much larger picture. As we have said in the past, reform proposals should be evaluated as packages that strike a balance among their component parts. Furthermore, Social Security is only one source of income and only one of several programs that help support the standard of living of our retired and disabled populations. All sources of income and all of these programs should be considered together in confronting the demographic challenges we face.  For example, changes to Social Security could potentially affect SSI benefits, employer-sponsored pensions, retirement savings, and the work and retirement patterns of older workers.  Such interactions should actively be considered.  Moreover, several programs provide noncash benefits that also play a major role in sustaining standards of living for their beneficiaries.", "Importantly, examining the adequacy of cash income alone would ignore the major role of noncash benefits and the needs they help support.

The HEW study stated that other than food there were no other commonly accepted standards of need. In addition, it noted that the amount of money a family spends on food was only an approximation of a family\u2019s food needs. The report also stated that the multiplier that was applied to the food costs was a rough measure of nonfood requirements.", "According to two federally sponsored studies, some of the limitations of the current poverty thresholds relate directly to their inability to reflect changes in living standards. The poverty thresholds are an absolute measure in which the mix of goods and services the thresholds represent has not been changed for nearly 40 years and, therefore, are not consistent with prevailing American standards of living. Although the current poverty thresholds are updated by price changes as reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as indicated in these two studies, the items that are updated reflect a mid-20th century mix in terms of quality and quantity of goods and services.", "The current poverty thresholds do not reflect how the proportion of income dedicated to food has changed with rising living standards, according to a 1995 study panel of Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Science (NAS). A research study illustrates how living standards based on food rise over time\u2014as the population becomes more prosperous, on average, it devotes a smaller proportion to food expenditures and larger proportions to nonfood expenditures. The study recalculated the poverty thresholds using USDA\u2019s 1965 Household Survey to determine the portion of family income dedicated to food purchases and USDA\u2019s 1975 Thrifty Food Plan to approximate the cost of food. The thresholds re-estimated for 1977 were about 40 percent higher for the 1- person households and about 20 percent higher for 4-person families. A recent study estimated that the poverty thresholds for 4-person families would have been 68 percent higher in 1987 if they had been recalculated with methodology similar to that used to develop the current poverty thresholds.", "The 1976 HEW study and the 1995 NAS study panel noted that, although the current poverty thresholds are updated by changes in prices paid by consumers, they do not change with the standard of living. The 1995 NAS study panel said that the thresholds do not incorporate changes in total consumption that include spending on luxuries, as well as necessities, or declines in the standard of living. The 1976 HEW study noted, however, that the current poverty thresholds were updated using a relative means\u2014 changes in prices\u2014using the CPI. However, the developer of the current poverty thresholds voiced concern about updating the thresholds with the CPI. She noted the uncertainty about the appropriateness of the CPI as a measure of price changes for the poor. She doubted that one price index could capture how families at different income levels adjust their spending to accommodate to price changes. For example, poor families may react to a 10 percent increase in the price of utilities by reducing expenses in other essential consumption areas; whereas wealthy families would have more options and could address the increase in a different manner.", "Another limitation of the current poverty thresholds identified by the 1995 NAS study panel is that the thresholds do not account for the fact that working families pay taxes on their earnings and families on public assistance do not pay taxes on the cash assistance they receive. According to the NAS panel, this occurs because the determination of whether or not a family is poor is based on a comparison of before-tax income with thresholds based on after-tax income. This comparison ignores the fact that payment of taxes lowers disposable income. As a result, the comparison of before-tax income with the current poverty thresholds can make it appear as if low-income working families are better off than poor families receiving public assistance. The NAS study panel indicated that this limitation might affect the manner in which policymakers view the poverty population. For example, because of the comparison of before-tax income with an after-tax poverty measure, the adverse effects of tax policy changes for low-income working families are not captured in the resulting poverty statistics.", "The NAS panel identified another limitation of the current poverty thresholds in that the value of noncash benefits, such as housing subsidies, are not included as income in the determination of poverty status. According to the panel, the extent of poverty among the recipients of such benefits is overstated and the efficacy of government income-support measures is understated because the current poverty thresholds do not take into account the receipt of noncash public benefits.", "According to the developer of the current poverty thresholds, the thresholds are inappropriately applied to all types of families. The developer stated that a major limitation of the thresholds was the failure to differentiate between a social minimum appropriate for a worker and his family and a more stringent standard appropriate for a family dependent on public assistance. She indicated that the same standard was inappropriately applied to both types of families.", "Furthermore, the developer and the NAS study panel said the current poverty thresholds inability to address needs that are specific to families with different living situations was a limitation. The NAS panel stated that the thresholds do not accurately portray the relative poverty status of working families with childcare expenses and those without such expenses. The developer also voiced concern about the tradeoffs that families make and cited the limitation of the thresholds to address, for example, how higher expenditures in health care affect other areas of family living.

The 1995 NAS study panel also noted the behavior the measure would demonstrate during recessions and economic upturns and said it would be hard to explain and justify changes in the measure that are not simply a reflection of price changes.

The later that taxes are increased, the higher the ultimate tax rate needed to achieve solvency, and in turn the higher the tax burden on later taxpayers and lower on earlier taxpayers. We consider this policy to be plausible because it would involve less than a 1 percentage point increase on employers and employees each.
