BOP first issued pepper spray to employees in high security prisons in August 2012 and to medium, low, and administrative security prisons in subsequent years. Officials estimated that a canister of pepper spray costs $7 to $14. However, the total cost to purchase pepper spray and train employees on its use is not readily available because purchases are tracked at the prison level, and pepper spray training costs are commingled with other training costs.", "BOP determined that it would not issue pepper spray to minimum security prisons. BOP headquarters officials stated that this decision was made because inmates at such prisons are usually nonviolent offenders, among other reasons. However, GAO's analysis of BOP data found 47 reported incidents that included assaults on staff and other inmates across BOP's seven minimum security prisons in 2018. In addition, 56 of 73 officials GAO interviewed said pepper spray should be expanded to minimum security prisons. BOP officials stated they were not aware of an analysis of incident data or other information to support its decision but said that the decision remains appropriate. However, by analyzing available data on incidents that have occurred at minimum security prisons, BOP could better inform its decision on whether to issue pepper spray to employees at minimum security prisons.", "BOP officials rated the following factors as having the most significant impact on BOP employee safety, as shown in the figure below.

Pepper spray  may be used to (1) incapacitate or disable disruptive, assaultive, or armed  inmates or others posing a threat to the safety of others, or posing a  threat to prison security and good order; and (2) prevent serious property  damage. In 2018, BOP issued a policy requiring pepper spray to be  issued to all staff working in high, medium, low, and administrative  security prisons.", "In March 2016, the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of  2015 was enacted and, among other things, includes a provision for GAO  to evaluate the effectiveness of issuing pepper spray to officers and  employees in BOP prisons that are not minimum or low security prisons;  evaluate the advisability of issuing pepper spray to officers and  employees in BOP minimum and low security prisons and the cost to do  so; and suggest ways to improve the safety of officers and employees in  BOP prisons. In this report, we address the following questions:  1.  What is known about the effectiveness and cost of issuing pepper  spray in BOP\u2019s high, medium, low, and administrative security  prisons?  2.  What is BOP\u2019s position on expanding the issuance of pepper spray to  minimum security prisons, and what level of support did the agency  use to arrive at this decision?  3.

We  selected these prisons to visit based on their missions, co-location of  multiple security levels, and participation in BOP\u2019s pilot study on pepper  spray that was conducted from August 2012 through December 2013. We  visited a total of one high, two medium, one low, three minimum, and two  administrative security level prisons. During our site visits to these nine  prisons, we interviewed 90 BOP employees from a range of roles,  including wardens and executive staff, union officials, correctional  officers, and medical or health care staff within the prisons. In addition,  we toured the prisons and observed corrections activities to better  understand the working environment. Our observations and discussions  with officials during our site visits are not generalizable, but they provided  valuable insight into the effectiveness of pepper spray, whether pepper  spray should be issued to minimum security prisons, and factors  impacting the safety of BOP employees in prisons.", "To describe what is known about the effectiveness and cost of issuing  pepper spray in high, medium, low, and administrative security prisons,  we reviewed BOP\u2019s policy on the issuance of pepper spray to officers and  employees in high, medium, low, and administrative security prisons, as  well as reports and other documentation regarding the use and  effectiveness of pepper spray in federal prisons. We also reviewed BOP\u2019s  pepper spray guidance and the results of BOP\u2019s pilot study on pepper  spray. Additionally, we reviewed BOP data from incident reports involving  pepper spray use in federal prisons from 2016 through 2018.

We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of  describing the characteristics of BOP prisons, the number and kinds of  incidents, and the reported impact of the use of pepper spray on incident  containment times and BOP employee injuries.", "We also interviewed BOP headquarters officials; wardens and their  executive staff; correctional officers; union officials; and medical or health- care staff, among others, about the effectiveness of pepper spray.  Additionally, we analyzed fiscal years 2017 through 2019 BOP budget  data, where available, on the costs of pepper spray and related training.  We chose the time frames for the incident reports and cost data because  it allowed us to obtain information about the use of pepper spray before  and after the enactment of the Eric Williams Correctional Officer  Protection Act of 2015.", "To respond to our inquiry on the cost of pepper spray and its related  training, BOP headquarters officials sent out a data call to each of its 122  prisons. According to BOP headquarters officials, all prisons submitted  cost data. However, we found the data to be of undetermined reliability.  Specifically, we were not able to independently validate data provided by  BOP on the costs of pepper spray and related training. This information is  recorded by 122 individual prisons at the local level, and some of the  pepper spray related training costs are commingled with broader training  costs. Further, according to BOP budget officials, individual prisons may  capture the cost of pepper spray and related training differently. Finally,  we interviewed BOP internal affairs officials about inappropriate use of  force incidents that involved pepper spray. We analyzed documentation  of incidents to determine how they were adjudicated.", "To describe BOP\u2019s position on expanding the issuance of pepper spray to  minimum security prisons, and assess the level of support BOP used to  arrive at this decision, we reviewed BOP\u2019s existing policy regarding  issuing pepper spray to officers and employees at minimum security  prisons. We also assessed BOP\u2019s decision on not issuing pepper spray to  minimum security prisons against BOP policy and Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. Further, we analyzed data from  BOP\u2019s TRUINTEL database for calendar year 2018 on the number of  incidents at minimum security prisons. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for capturing information on incidents. Additionally, we  interviewed BOP officials at headquarters and at the prison level\u2014 including wardens and their executive staff, correctional officers, union  officials, and health-care staff, among others who work in the prisons\u2014to  obtain their perspectives about issuing pepper spray to employees at  minimum security prisons.", "To determine what challenges, if any, from the perspective of BOP  officials, affect the safety of BOP employees, and what steps, if any, BOP  has taken to address them, we interviewed a total of 90 BOP  employees\u2014four BOP headquarters officials; 18 wardens and their  executive staff; 10 union officials; and 58 other officials, including  correctional officers and health-care staff. Specifically, we interviewed  BOP headquarters officials, wardens and their executive staff, and union  officials about 15 selected factors that may affect the safety of BOP  employees and officers in prisons. We asked these officials to rate  whether each factor had a significant, moderate, slight, or no impact on  the safety of BOP employees.

BOP  found that pepper spray was effective in helping to reduce containment  time\u2014the amount of time it takes to bring an incident under control\u2014and  injury rates. Specifically,  containment time of incidents decreased from an average of 4.3  minutes when pepper spray was not used to 2.7 minutes when it was  used. This is a reduction of 1.6 minutes in containment time; pepper spray was used mostly in incidents involving two or more  inmates, such as fights and assaults. When pepper spray was used,  the rate at which staff received no injury increased by 9 percent  compared to when pepper spray was not used. Further, the rate at  which staff received minor and moderate injury declined by 60 and 76  percent, respectively, compared to when pepper spray was not used;  and  the inmate injury rate rose slightly, by 2.6 percent, primarily in minor  injuries when pepper spray was used; however, BOP concluded this  change was not statistically significant.", "All 90 of the BOP employees we spoke with from United States  Penitentiary Atlanta, Federal Correctional Complex Coleman, and Federal  Medical Center Devens indicated that pepper spray has been effective in  enhancing safety as well as deterring incidents. Generally, these  employees noted that pepper spray (1) reduces staff injuries because  staff do not have to physically engage with inmates as often to break up  incidents, (2) strongly deters incidents from occurring, and (3) allows  employees to break up incidents more quickly than if they did not have  pepper spray. Pepper spray is not as effective for a small percentage of  inmates, such as those with mental illness or those who are under the  influence of drugs or alcohol, according to some BOP employees.", "According to BOP data, in 2018, pepper spray was used in 1,680  incidents as follows: 993 incidents in high security prisons; 557 incidents  in medium security prisons; 22 incidents in low security prisons; and 108  incidents in administrative security prisons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Allegations of Inappropriate Use of Pepper Spray Have Been Resolved, while Others Remain Under Investigation", "paragraphs": ["Officials from BOP\u2019s Office for Internal Affairs stated that 179 allegations  of inappropriate use of force incidents that involved pepper spray were  reported from August 2012 through September 2018.

Canisters of pepper spray have a shelf-life of approximately 5 years  and, according to a BOP headquarters official, are purchased in bulk. As  a result, pepper spray does not necessarily need to be purchased on an  annual basis. According to BOP officials, each BOP prison contracts with  its own supplier rather than using a national contract across all of BOP.  BOP headquarters officials told us that pepper spray costs vary across  vendors and locations, among other factors. Each BOP prison is  responsible for recording and tracking its own budget data on the cost of  procuring, training, and issuing BOP employees pepper spray.

Corrections officer understaffing  refers to the staffing level\u2014usually measured by the inmate-to-staff  ratio\u2014being too low to adequately prevent violence and maintain a safe  prison. Among the BOP headquarters officials, wardens and their  executive staff, and union officials we interviewed, two underlying reasons  generally cited for understaffing conditions were hiring freezes and  difficulty recruiting new correctional officers due to low starting salaries.  According to the BOP Director\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary  Committee in November 2019, building adequate staffing at BOP prisons  is one of her highest priorities. The Director stated that BOP established 10-percent recruitment, relocation, and retention  incentives for hard-to-fill positions; established a higher entry pay scale for experienced new correctional established a 5-percent nationwide retention incentive for retirement- used 3,000 temporary positions to help ensure seamless succession  planning by avoiding the lag to hire someone to fill a position.", "We issued a report in December 2017 on BOP\u2019s use of retention  incentives. At that time, we found that BOP had taken steps to determine  workforce needs and how to fill those needs but had not strategically  planned for and evaluated its use of retention incentives. We  recommended that BOP include in its strategic human capital operating  plan (1) human capital goals; and (2) strategies on how human capital  flexibilities, including retention incentives, will be used to achieve these  goals. We also recommended that BOP evaluate the effectiveness of its  use of retention incentives to determine whether the incentives have  helped achieve BOP\u2019s human capital goals or if adjustments in retention  incentives are needed. DOJ concurred, and BOP implemented our first  recommendation by drafting a human capital plan with goals and  strategies for how retention incentives could be used to meet those goals.  To implement our second recommendation, BOP conducted an analysis  of its use of retention incentives and their effect on retaining BOP  employees.", "Disruptive inmate behavior due to illegal drugs. According to BOP  officials, some inmates obtain illegal synthetic drugs by mail. These drugs are sprayed onto inmate mail and other documents before being sent to  the inmate in prison. Inmates burn the mail to get high off of the synthetic  drug. In addition to the threat to the inmate population posed by inmates  who are behaving under the influence of the drugs, entry of these drugs  can expose staff\u2014including those handling the mail\u2014-to hazardous  chemicals. In an effort to stop illegal drugs from entering prisons by this  method, according to BOP officials we spoke with and the BOP Director  in her November 2019 testimony, some prisons are photocopying mail  before it is delivered to inmates. For example, officials at one prison we  visited told us they photocopy inmates\u2019 mail. Further, a BOP headquarters  official stated that BOP is piloting various mail-scanning technologies  aimed at reducing the number of drugs entering prisons.", "Inmates\u2019 use of unauthorized communication devices. According to  BOP officials and the BOP Director\u2019s testimony, inmates\u2019 possession of  cell phones is a major problem. BOP officials stated that, in an effort to  stop the unauthorized use of cell phones, some prison officials are using  specialized equipment to detect cell phone usage and are exploring  options to use cell phone jammers. We reported in September 2011 that  BOP and selected state officials told us that cell phones were a major  security concern because they allow inmates to hold unmonitored  conversations, for example, to sell drugs or harass individuals. We  recommended that BOP\u2019s Director formulate evaluation plans for cell  phone detection technology to aid decision-making, require BOP staff to  use these plans, and enhance regional collaboration with states.
