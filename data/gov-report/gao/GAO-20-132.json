Separately, VA Office of the Inspector General\u2019s Office of Contract  Review officials told us of a 2010 working group formed to collaboratively  discuss revisions to GSA\u2019s regulations, which included representatives  from GSA, NAC, the VA Office of the Inspector General, and others.

However, NAC officials noted instances  where collaboration is still limited. For example, GSA did not provide NAC  officials with advance notice about the publication of a final rule  establishing changes to GSA\u2019s FSS regulations that were relevant to  NAC\u2019s administration of its FSS program. NAC discovered the final rule  had gone into effect after it was published, independent of any  communication from GSA. NAC officials stated they would like to have  additional opportunities for input on GSA regulations that affect the VA  FSS program.", "Our prior work has found that clearly defining roles and responsibilities is  a key practice for cross-agency collaboration. Without a clear and  shared understanding of their respective responsibilities, and processes  to ensure they share tools and practices, NAC will not have the  opportunity to learn from GSA\u2019s experience or have timely input on GSA  actions that affect the VA FSS program.", "GSA and VA are also missing a document\u2014namely, GSA\u2019s updated  delegation of authority to VA\u2014that could guide their collaboration efforts.  This delegation should state what authority is granted to VA, and cite the  limitations on that authority. We found a January 2008 Federal Register  notice mentioned a 2004 update to the delegation, but the GSA Director  of Policy for the Federal Acquisition Service was unable to locate or  provide this update. VA was also unable to locate a copy of the 2004  update. Instead, GSA and VA gave us a number of documents, including  memorandums and other communications that spanned from the 1960s  to the 1990s. The documents were fragmented and outdated. Further,  many of these older documents referred to outdated laws, regulations, or  organizations, raising questions about their current applicability.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that the  roles of those responsible for carrying out programs should be clearly  outlined in policy, and GAO has also reported that written guidance and  agreements on collaboration are key features of successful cross-agency  collaboration. The lack of current documentation related to GSA\u2019s  delegation to VA, alongside the limitations in NAC and GSA  communication, undermine a firm foundation on which to build  collaboration.

During these rotations,  these chiefs were dual-hatted as they maintained responsibility for their  primary job role. The Associate Executive Director of the NAC stated that  he was reluctant to make long-term, strategic policy decisions while the  FSS Director position was vacant.", "In late 2017 and late 2018, respectively, NAC permanently filled these  two FSS program positions. However, by then, broader changes had  taken place within VA contracting that affected the VA FSS program:  namely, the Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that before VA may contract  with a non-veteran-owned business, VA must apply the \u201cVA Rule of Two,\u201d  including instances when VA makes purchases through FSS. Also in late  2016, VA launched the MSPV-NG program, which offers items similar to  those items offered on two VA schedules. Figure 8 provides a timeline of  these FSS leadership vacancies and events.", "Although both of these leadership positions have since been filled, the  effect of the gaps is still evident in some cases. According to NAC FSS  officials, hiring to fill open FSS contracting staff positions was slowed by  the leadership gaps, which added to workload pressures; more contract  offers were received than completed in fiscal years 2015 and 2016,  creating a backlog. Contracting staff workload is a VA-wide issue we  previously identified, and is one of the areas of concern we cited in  adding VA Acquisition Management to GAO\u2019s High Risk List in 2019. In  late 2018, the FSS Director sought approval for 10 additional contracting  staff; 9 of these positions were filled in July 2019.

About 2,300 of these  modifications were executed to add new items to existing contracts. For  these, NAC met the timeliness goal only 54 percent of the time.

NAC officials told us that tracking  vendor offers and associated documents from email is cumbersome and  time consuming because they have to sort through several separate  vendor email messages to splice together vendor offer submissions, due  to file size limitations.", "The inefficient offer intake process also led to delays in assigning offers to  contracting staff. NAC did not always assign offers to contracting staff  immediately after vendor submission, delaying the start of work. Our  review of 26 selected VA FSS contract files identified 10 instances where  NAC took more than 20 days after receipt to assign the offer to  contracting staff. NAC officials told us that these delays were caused by  both the non-automated offer-intake process as well as the team chiefs\u2019  lack of time to assign these offers to contracting staff for their review.  According to the FSS Director, in mid-2018 he created a team lead for  each NAC schedule team to assign offers to contracting staff and monitor  these offers to better ensure timeliness.

This system  includes automated system checks to ensure documentation is complete  before it is submitted by vendors. Once offers are submitted, supervisors  in GSA FSS offices review offers in the system and assign them to  contracting staff for review. We have not evaluated whether the eOffer  system increases efficiency or reduces errors in submitted offers, but,  according to GSA officials, eOffer achieves efficiency and accuracy due  to the automated checks that will not let vendors submit an incomplete  offer package.", "NAC contracting staff told us that they could benefit from a more efficient  system to accept offers from vendors. In late 2018, NAC and GSA  discussed the possibility of adopting GSA\u2019s eOffer online system, as well  as its companion eMod, which is used to process modifications. In  November 2018, GSA\u2019s estimate to add VA to the system was about $9  million for the first year, and nearly $8 million annually thereafter, which,  according to NAC\u2019s FSS Director, is cost-prohibitive. GSA officials told us  that to determine this cost, they compared the number of NAC FSS  contracts to the number of GSA FSS contracts, and apportioned 10  percent of the overall system development and operation cost to VA.  Despite the cost of GSA\u2019s systems, if VA does not address limitations in  its own manual offer-intake process, such as implementing a system that  can provide automated checks for completeness, delays in assigning  offers to contracting staff will continue. Further, FSS contracting staff will  continue to spend additional resources and time to gather and complete  offer documentation before they can determine whether to award the  contract.", "We also reviewed NAC\u2019s website and found that guidance for vendors  was fragmented.

As we reported in November 2017, for  over a decade, VA\u2019s medical centers used VHA\u2019s legacy MSPV program  to order medical supplies\u2014many of which were purchased using NAC\u2019s  FSS program. When VHA transitioned to its MSPV-NG program in late  2016, it significantly narrowed the catalog to 6,000 items, and VHA  contracting officials told us that they modified the contracting approach in  March 2018 to have the prime vendor supply the items directly, separate  from FSS. At the outset, VHA set goals for the MSPV-NG program,  including standardization of requirements for supply items and cost  avoidance by leveraging VA\u2019s substantial buying power. However, the  MSPV-NG program recently revised its goals from focusing on  standardization to increasing the number of catalog items available for  medical centers\u2019 use\u2014the catalog contains more than 20,000 items as of  September 2019.", "We compared the MSPV-NG catalog to the VA Medical Equipment and  Supplies schedule to determine whether they offered similar products,  and found overlap.

Also, in March  2019, NAC FSS leadership provided analysis to the MSPV-NG program  office showing that 41 percent of items that the MSPV-NG program  planned to include in an update of the MSPV catalog were already  available under VA FSS contracts. This duplication could result in  inefficiencies whereby different sets of contracting staff within the FSS  and MSPV-NG programs award, modify, and manage contracts for the  same or similar medical supplies for VA medical center use.", "The MSPV-NG program office is currently developing the next iteration of  the program, called MSPV 2.0, which it plans to roll out in February 2021.  In April of 2019, a senior VHA procurement official announced at a vendor  forum that the VA FSS program would be used as a source for its MSPV  2.0 supply catalog. However, in June of 2019, MSPV-NG program  officials and VHA procurement leadership told us they decided against  using FSS for this purpose and provided several reasons for this decision.  First, these officials stated that FSS was not comprehensive enough to  fulfill the MSPV 2.0 catalog; as noted above, FSS could provide about 40  percent of needed items. These officials also stated that the effort needed  to create new FSS contracts or add new items to existing VA FSS  contracts to fulfill the remaining 60 percent of the required MSPV 2.0  catalog would be too time consuming. Further, these officials also stated  that there were not enough veteran-owned small businesses that offer  items on VA FSS to support the MSPV 2.0 requirements. They stated this  could result in extra time and resources to solicit both within FSS and the  open market to ensure that they meet the VA Rule of Two. NAC FSS  leaders told us that they communicated their willingness to support the  MSPV 2.0 program by offering to work with vendors to quickly add the  needed items; however, the MSPV-NG program office did not involve  them in their final decision not to use FSS as a source for the MSPV 2.0  program.", "VA procurement leaders have informally discussed the future of the FSS  program, according to a senior VHA procurement official.

While this finding stemmed from our  review of VA\u2019s MSPV-NG program and was related to the  recommendation that VA develop an overarching strategy for this  program, the same applies for VA\u2019s FSS program in that VA does not  have a strategic approach for its procurement of medical supplies through  these two programs.

We interviewed VA officials from NAC, the  Office of Acquisition and Logistics, the Strategic Acquisition Center, and  VHA regarding the relationship between MSPV-NG and the FSS  program. We analyzed policies related to these programs that affect  management and use of VA FSS, and interviewed VA officials about their  impact. We also reviewed documents and interviews with MSPV program  office staff from an ongoing GAO review of the MSPV program. We used  information obtained from an ongoing GAO review as well as published  GAO reports on VA\u2019s MSPV-NG program. Finally, we reviewed  documents, including VA\u2019s 2018-2024 Strategic Plan and VHA supply  chain modernization plans.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2018 to January  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
