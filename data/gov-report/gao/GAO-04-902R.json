According to the President, the United States intends to help Iraq achieve democracy and freedom and has a vital national interest in the success of free institutions in Iraq. As of April 30, 2004, billions of dollars in grants, loans, assets, and revenues from various sources have been made available or pledged to the reconstruction of Iraq. The United States, along with its coalition partners and various international organizations and donors, has embarked on a significant effort to rebuild Iraq following multiple wars and decades of neglect by the former regime. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), established in May 2003, was the U.N.-recognized coalition authority led by the United States and the United Kingdom that was responsible for the temporary governance of Iraq. Specifically, the CPA wasresponsible for overseeing, directing, and coordinating the reconstruction effort. On June 28, 2004, the CPA transferred power to a sovereign Iraqi interim government, and the CPA officially dissolved. To pave the way for this transfer, the CPA helped the Iraq Governing Council develop the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period in March 2004. The transitional law provides a framework for governance of Iraq while a permanent government is formed. In June 2004, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 provided international support to advance this process, stating that, by June 30, CPA will cease to exist and Iraq will reassert full sovereignty. Resolution 1546 also endorsed the formation of a fully sovereign Iraqi interim government; endorsed a timetable for elections and the drafting of an Iraqi constitution; and decided that the United Nations, at the Iraq government's request, would play a leading role in establishing a permanent government. Resolution 1546 further noted the presence of the multinational force in Iraq and authorized it to take all necessary measures to contribute to security and stability in Iraq, in accordance with letters annexed to the resolution. Such letters provide, in part, that the multinational force and the Iraqi government will work in partnership to reach agreement on security and olicy issues, including policy on sensitive offensive operations. Resolution 1546 stated that the Security Council will review the mandate of the multinational force in 12 months or earlier if requested by the government of Iraq and that it will terminate the mandate if requested by the government of Iraq. As part of our broad effort to monitor Iraq reconstruction, which we undertook at the request of Congress, this report provides information on the status of the issues we have been monitoring, as well as key questions that will assist Congres in its oversight responsibilities. Specifically, this report focuses on issues associated with (1) resources, (2) security, (3) governance, and (4) essential services.

Resource needs are expected to continue after the transfer of power to a sovereign Iraqi interim government. Of the funds available, the United States obligated about $8 billion of the available $24 billion in U.S. funds. The CPA obligated about $15.5 billion of the nearly $21 billion in available Iraqi funds. The international community pledged nearly $14 billion. In December 2003, the CPA put into effect an Iraqi-led process to coordinate reconstruction efforts. An October 2003 U.N./World Bank assessment noted that Iraq's ability to absorb resources as the country gains sovereignty and decision-making authority will be one of the most significant challenges to reconstruction. The security situation in Iraq has deteriorated since June 2003, with significant increases in attacks against the coalition and coalition partners. The increase in attacks has had a negative impact on military operations and the work of international civilian organizations in Iraq. As part of the effort to provide stability, the coalition plans to transfer security responsibilities from the multinational force to Iraqi security forces and to dissolve Iraqi militias operating outside the central government's control. During the escalation of violence that occurred during April 2004, these security forces collapsed in several locations. However, key elements of the CPA's transition and reintegration process remain to be finalized. With U.S. and others' assistance, Iraqis have taken control of government institutions at the national and subnational levels. National ministries are providing some services to citizens as their facilities are being rebuilt, reforms are being introduced, and their staffs trained. According to the head of the now-dissolved CPA, all ministries were under Iraqi authority as of the transfer of power on June 28, 2004. However, the security situation hinders the ability of the ministries to provide needed services and maintain daily operations. To reform the rule of law, ongoing efforts have begun to establish a functioning independent judiciary, although courts are not at their pre-war capacity. However, efforts to rebuild Iraq's judicial system and restore the rule of law face multiple challenges. U.S. officials said that rehabilitating and reforming Iraq's judicial system will likely take years. The Coalition considers reconstruction of the power sector critical to reviving Iraq's economy, supporting essential infrastructure, improving daily well-being, and gaining local support for the coalition presence in Iraq. The CPA set a goal of 6,000 megawatts of generating capacity by June 30, 2004, in anticipation of the higher demand for power during the summer months. As part of the overall effort to achieve this goal, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has undertaken $1.4 billion in work under the Restore Iraqi Electricity (RIE) program. As of late May, the Corps anticipated that 59 of the 66 RIE projects expected to help meet the goal would be completed by June 30. However, electrical service in the country as a whole has not shown a marked improvement over the immediate postwar levels of May 2003 and has worsened in some governorates. RIE contractors report numerous instances of project delays due to difficulties in getting employees and materials safely to project sites. Further, the security environment continues to affect the cost of rebuilding the power sector."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Rebuilding Iraq is a U.S. national security and foreign policy priority.

Of the funds available, the United States obligated about $8  billion of the available $24 billion in U.S. funds.  The CPA obligated about $15.5 billion of  the nearly $21 billion in available Iraqi funds.  These funds were used to support ministry  operations and expenses; the restoration of essential services, such as power, oil, and  water; and humanitarian and other human services, including the importation of liquid  petroleum gas and food.  The international community pledged nearly $14 billion.  In  December 2003, the CPA put into effect an Iraqi-led process to coordinate reconstruction  efforts.  However, the capability to track the total amount of bilateral assistance flowing  into Iraq and to identify sectors that do not receive assistance is still under development.   An October 2003 U.N./World Bank assessment noted that Iraq\u2019s ability to absorb  resources as the country gains sovereignty and decision-making authority will be one of  the most significant challenges to reconstruction.  The CPA faced a number of challenges  in identifying, obtaining, and organizing the human resources required to help stabilize  and reconstruct Iraq. The CPA\u2019s staffing requirements also changed over time as the  mission evolved from a reconstruction and humanitarian effort to the temporary  administration of the Iraq government.  The CPA was dependent on personnel from  multiple sources and generally operated with about one-third fewer staff than it required.   After the transition, the U.S. Mission in Baghdad and its temporarily established Iraq  Reconstruction Management Office are likely to continue to draw upon staff from  multiple sources.", "Security: Trends and Issues  The security situation in Iraq has deteriorated since June 2003, with significant increases  in attacks against the coalition and coalition partners. Anti-coalition attacks have  generally become more sophisticated, widespread, and effective.  In May 2004, the  Secretary of Defense and the Commander of the U.S. Central Command projected that  the level of violence could continue to increase as Iraq moves to elect a transitional  government.  The increase in attacks has had a negative impact on military operations  and the work of international civilian organizations in Iraq.  The United States decided to  maintain a force level of about 138,000 troops at least until the end of 2005, rather than  drawing down to 105,000 troops by May 2004, as DOD had announced in late 2003.  The  United Nations, numerous nongovernmental organizations, and a range of civilian  contractors have reduced their presence or completely shut down operations.  As part of  the effort to provide stability, the coalition plans to transfer security responsibilities from  the multinational force to Iraqi security forces and to dissolve Iraqi militias operating  outside the central government\u2019s control.  As of June 2004, Iraq had security forces  numbering about 220,000, including the Iraqi Police, Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, and Iraqi  Armed Forces.  During the escalation of violence that occurred during April 2004, these  security forces collapsed in several locations.  As of June 2004, efforts to disband Iraq\u2019s  militias have produced formal agreements between the CPA and nine major political  parties that possess militias. However, key elements of the CPA\u2019s transition and  reintegration process remain to be finalized.", "Governance: Reforming and Rebuilding Iraq\u2019s Government With U.S. and others\u2019 assistance, Iraqis have taken control of government institutions at  the national and subnational levels.  National ministries are providing some services to  citizens as their facilities are being rebuilt, reforms are being introduced, and their staffs  trained.  According to the head of the now-dissolved CPA, all ministries were under Iraqi  authority as of the transfer of power on June 28, 2004.  However, the security situation  hinders the ability of the ministries to provide needed services and maintain daily  operations.  To reform the rule of law, ongoing efforts have begun to establish a  functioning independent judiciary, although courts are not at their pre-war capacity.  As  of June 2004, the CPA had completed a review of all Iraqi judges, took steps to reform  Iraq\u2019s legal code, and issued orders to restore judicial independence.  However, efforts to  rebuild Iraq\u2019s judicial system and restore the rule of law face multiple challenges,  including providing adequate security for judges and other court personnel, some of  whom have been assassinated; ensuring the independence of the court system so that it  operates without influence from the executive branch of the government; and providing  adequate training for judges and attorneys. U.S. officials said that rehabilitating and  reforming Iraq\u2019s judicial system will likely take years.", "Essential Services: Restore Iraqi Electricity The Coalition considers reconstruction of the power sector critical to reviving Iraq\u2019s  economy, supporting essential infrastructure, improving daily well-being, and gaining  local support for the coalition presence in Iraq.  The CPA set a goal of 6,000 megawatts of  generating capacity by June 30, 2004, in anticipation of the higher demand for power  during the summer months.  As part of the overall effort to achieve this goal, the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has undertaken $1.4 billion in work under the Restore  Iraqi Electricity (RIE) program.  As of late May, the Corps anticipated that 59 of the 66  RIE projects expected to help meet the goal would be completed by June 30.  However,  even if the 6,000-megawatt goal is met, generating capacity will fall short of the estimated  summer peak demand of 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts.  Some improvements have been made  in restoring electricity; for example, Iraq\u2019s daily peak generation capacity increased from  about 3,400 megawatts on September 25, 2003, to about 4,200 megawatts on June 1, 2004.   However, electrical service in the country as a whole has not shown a marked  improvement over the immediate postwar levels of May 2003 and has worsened in some  governorates.  For example, in May 2003, 7 of Iraq\u2019s 18 governorates had 16 or more  hours of electricity a day, but as of late May 2004, only one governorate in northern Iraq  was at that level.  RIE contractors report numerous instances of project delays due to  difficulties in getting employees and materials safely to project sites.  Further, the  security environment continues to affect the cost of rebuilding the power sector.   Preliminary estimates of security-related costs for one RIE contractor are almost 18  percent of total costs.  The possibility that electrical capacity will not meet the peak  summer demand raises concerns about the ability of the coalition to support power- dependent infrastructure, improve Iraq\u2019s economy, and promote stability in Iraq.", "The United States, along with its coalition partners and various international  organizations and donors, has undertaken a challenging and costly effort to stabilize and  rebuild Iraq.  Several key challenges will affect the political transition, the pace and cost  of reconstruction, and the type of assistance provided by the international community.   These include the unstable security environment, the evolving capacity of the Iraqi  institutions to govern and secure the country, the availability and coordination of  international assistance, and the need for adequate oversight.  Given the instability and  uncertainty in Iraq, there are also questions about what options and contingency plans  are being developed to address these ongoing and future challenges.  The following  enclosures elaborate on the progress made as of June 2004 in key aspects of the  stabilization and rebuilding effort.  We also provide key questions for Congress to  consider as it assesses progress and provides oversight of reconstruction efforts.", "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation We provided drafts of this report to the Coalition Provisional Authority; the Departments  of Defense, State, Justice, and Treasury; and the U.S. Agency for International  Development.

We modified  the report to increase the emphasis on the challenges that Iraq faces in reforming its  judicial system and added additional information CPA provided.  CPA also commented  on enclosure VI (Iraqi security forces), stating that delays in providing equipment to Iraqi  security forces were caused by a range of factors, and not just contracting problems.  In  commenting on our description of the Iraqi police force\u2019s response to insurgent activity  in April, CPA noted that the Iraqi police were not intended to combat insurgents, but did  stand up to them in some locations.

According to CPA officials, preliminary plans called for a continued ministry advisory team, a headquarters support group, military and police training teams, and governance teams. A May 11, 2004, National Security Presidential Directive stated that the U.S. Mission in Baghdad and its temporarily established Iraq Reconstruction Management Office will assume those authorities and responsibilities that will continue after the termination of the CPA.

In May  2003, CPA replaced ORHA when it became the temporary authority  governing Iraq during the period of transitional administration.", "The initial staffing process for the reconstruction effort was not always well  coordinated between Washington and Baghdad.  CPA officials stated that,  prior to the CPA\u2019s establishment, the requirements for staff were identified  and personnel were recruited in an ad hoc manner.  For example, U.S.  officials from the CPA and the State Department stated that, due to the  independent recruiting of staff by some detailees in Baghdad, agency  personnel authorities were unaware of personnel who went to Iraq after the  initial deployment in March 2003.  Further, officials from the State  Department responsible for staffing personnel to Iraq stated that they  ultimately sent a representative to Baghdad to physically account for all  State Department personnel present in the country.  According to a CPA  official, by July 2003, the process for identifying personnel requirements  was centralized in Baghdad under the guidance of the CPA administrator.", "In addition, the CPA had generally operated with about one-third of its  direct positions vacant.  U.S. and CPA officials most frequently cited the  hardship of the posting and the budgetary implications as the reasons for  this situation.  The hardship of the posting has affected some civilian  agencies\u2019 abilities to meet their staffing requirements.  The security situation  in Iraq has also made it difficult to attract and retain personnel.  For  example, USAID officials cited the security situation as a reason for the  early return of some staff and the difficulty in filling direct-hire positions in  Iraq.  Further, State Department officials stated that some qualified agency  personnel who had volunteered to go to Iraq were unable to meet the  required medical standards.  Another dimension of the hardship of the  posting is the limitations of family accompaniment.  Beginning in November  2003, the CPA requested that all personnel serve a minimum of 6 months.   According to USAID officials, in some cases this required Foreign Service  personnel to relocate family members from their previous posts to the  United States.  State Department officials also cited family relocation issues  and travel plans as reasons for delays in providing personnel to Iraq.", "State Department officials stated that they had no difficulty in recruiting  volunteers for positions in Iraq, attributing this largely to Secretary Powell\u2019s  support for the mission, incentive packages, and the department\u2019s efforts to  ensure that those who served in Iraq were not disadvantaged. Other  agencies, such as USAID and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, while also  relying on volunteers, stated that they were constrained in their ability to  meet staffing requirements.  USAID and Army Corps of Engineers officials  said that prior downsizing had left their agencies with a smaller pool of  personnel from which to draw.  Additionally, some requirements that the  CPA attempted to meet were beyond the capability of the agency tasked.  For example, according to Department of Justice officials, the department  was requested to provide three international law litigators to the CPA but  had only three such personnel.  To meet the requirement, Justice provided  one litigator to the CPA.", "In addition, providing personnel on a nonreimbursable basis to the CPA  creates an unbudgeted expense to the supplying agency.  Replacing  detailees creates additional costs for the agencies that their budgets may  not be able to sustain.  Further, detailing of staff not only creates gaps in the  supplying agency but increases the workload of those remaining.  According  to State Department officials, this burden could not be sustained beyond 6  to 12 months.", "To counter these challenges, the CPA and executive branch agencies have  relied on a number of mechanisms to support the staffing effort, including  the use of special hiring authorities, temporary tours of duty (60 to 180  days), and incentive packages.  The CPA had relied on a special hiring  authority under 5 USC 3161 to obtain temporary civilian employees.   Personnel obtained under this authority constituted about 20 percent of  CPA staff.  The passage of the emergency supplemental in November 2003  provided a specific budget to the CPA.  According to a CPA official, this  budget imposed a funding limit on CPA\u2019s ability to hire personnel under the  3161 authority.  In addition, agencies used temporary tours of duty to supply  personnel to the CPA due to the hardship of the posting.  Agencies also used  incentive packages to compensate civilian personnel, which included  danger-pay allowances and hardship differential payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In late May 2004, the President said there is likely to be more violence in Iraq after the transfer of power.

It has led to an increase in U.S. force  levels and to a decrease in freedom of movement for international civilians  working to rebuild Iraq and assist in its political transition.", "United States and United Kingdom Increased Troop Levels as Other  Coalition Members Reduced Them As a result of the increase in violence during April 2004, the United States  and the United Kingdom decided to increase their overall force levels in the  country.  The United States decided to maintain a force level of about  138,000 troops until at least the end of 2005, keeping about 33,000 more  troops in Iraq as of May 2004 than the 105,000 troops originally planned.  On  May 24, 2004, the President said that if military commanders determine that  they need more troops to fulfill the mission, he would send them.  The  following week, the United Kingdom announced that it would send an  additional 370 troops to southern Iraq in response to the increased violence,  bringing its total troop contribution to the multinational force to about 8,900  military personnel.  This figure includes 170 engineering personnel who  would deploy for 3 months to help fortify U.K. military bases and facilities  in Iraq against the increased threat of mortar and rocket attacks.", "In mid-April 2004, the new government of Spain announced that it would  withdraw its 1,300 troops from Iraq.

Shortly thereafter, Honduras and the  Dominican Republic announced they would also withdraw their national  contingents from the multinational force.", "During April 2004, the United States redeployed forces from Baghdad and  northern areas of Iraq to cities in the south that had come under the control  of a radical Shi\u2019a militia.  The United States did so because Iraqi security  forces and at least one contingent of the multinational force would not or  could not fight the insurgents.  For example, according to a CPA official,  Iraqi police in the cities of Karbala, Najaf, and Kut collapsed in April when a  radical Shi\u2019a militia overran the cities and took control of police stations.   Moreover, according to a USAID report, after heavy fighting in the city of  Kut, a non-U.S. contingent of the multinational force withdrew from the city  as the militia overran it.", "International Civilian Organizations Have Reduced Operations in Iraq and  Have Faced Increased Security Requirements  The deteriorating security situation has also adversely affected the  operations of civilian organizations in Iraq.

Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that  the efforts overall have been scaled back.", "In general, international civilian staff have had increasingly little contact  with the Iraqi people, and Iraqi staff working for the coalition, including  interpreters, have been increasingly threatened for cooperating with foreign  organizations.  Many important reconstruction efforts had to at least  temporarily cease operation.  Civilian organizations that continue to operate  in the country face increased security measures for their personnel and  compounds in the country.  The following examples show the effect of the  security situation on the operations of the CPA and supporting U.S.  agencies, reconstruction contractors, international organizations, and  nongovernmental aid organizations.", "Due to the unsafe security environment, the CPA and its supporting U.S.  agencies have had difficulty staffing their operations, opening offices  throughout the country, and providing protection for U.S. civilian  personnel as they travel around the country.  U.S. agencies, particularly  USAID, had difficulty in attracting and retaining personnel because of  security concerns.  In addition, according to a CPA official, as the  security situation worsened during 2003, the CPA abandoned plans to  fully staff offices throughout Iraq to assist in Iraq\u2019s political transition  and reconstruction and instead established a much smaller field  presence.  Further, the CPA established stringent security measures that  U.S. government staff had to follow in traveling outside the Green Zone,  the coalition\u2019s \u201csafe area\u201d in Baghdad, thereby making it difficult for  them to move around the country.  In late February 2004, the  Department of Homeland Security decided to stop sending teams of  customs investigators to assist CPA.  They could no longer do their jobs  because it had become too dangerous for them to move around the  country.  CPA officials also stated that they were concerned about the  safety of their Iraqi employees, particularly their interpreters, as  insurgents had increasingly targeted them for cooperating with the  coalition.", "In an April 17, 2004, document, the CPA administrator stated that lack of  security is the key obstacle to reaching reconstruction objectives.   Referring to the entire reconstruction program, the administrator stated  that a worsened security situation would mean that projects would take  longer to complete and that the kinds of projects undertaken and their  costs would change to an unknown extent.  Our review of selected  electricity projects showed that the security situation delayed the  implementation of key projects, thereby contributing to the CPA not  meeting its objective of providing 6,000 megawatts of electrical  generating capacity to the Iraqi people by its original goal of June 1,  2004.

As of late May  2004, the United Nations had not allowed most of its international  personnel to return to Iraq.   Although Iraqi staff continued some U.N.  programs, the United Nations had to scale down or delay both ongoing  activities and new initiatives.  The United Nations sent three separate  assessment teams to Iraq during the first half of 2004 to assist Iraqis in  assessing options for forming an interim government and in preparing  for national elections.  The dangerous security situation forced these  teams to restrict their travel around Iraq during the first half of 2004,  thereby limiting their interaction with Iraqis during important political  discussions about the country\u2019s future.", "In discussions during the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004,  nongovernmental organization representatives stated that the  deteriorating security situation has forced numerous nongovernmental  aid organizations to reduce or shut down operations in Iraq.  In response  to the dangerous security environment, many nongovernmental  organizations and contractors that we interviewed have hired private  security to provide protection for their staff and compounds.
