HUD considers this amount to be slightly higher because it treats as \"leveraged\" both (1) HOPE VI grant funds competitively awarded for the demolition of public housing units and (2) other public housing capital funds that the housing authorities would receive even in the absence of the revitalization grants. Our analysis of the mixed-finance proposals HUD approved through fiscal year 2001 indicates that, when low-income housing tax credit funding is included, 79 percent of the budgeted funds are from federal sources. The remainder of budgeted funds are from nonfederal sources, including private sources and state and local governments. Housing authorities that have received revitalization grants expect to leverage $295 million in additional funds for community and supportive services and have budgeted a total of about $714 million in HOPE VI revitalization grant funds and leveraged funds for community and supportive services. Leveraging for community and supportive services increased dramatically after 1997, when HUD instituted incentives to encourage this practice--from 22 percent in FY 1997 to 59 percent in FY 2001. Housing authorities have complied with HUD's total development cost policy when developing public housing units at HOPE VI sites. However, housing authorities have often budgeted additional funds that are not subject to the funding limits in the policy. HUD's policy applies only to the use of public housing funds, and it excludes some costs from counting against the limits. Although HUD has been required to report leveraging and cost information to Congress annually since 1998, it has not done so. Section 535 of the act requires HUD to submit an annual report to Congress on the HOPE VI program. This annual report is to include the cost of public housing units revitalized under the program and the amount and type of financial assistance provided under and in conjunction with the program. HUD has not issued these required annual reports to Congress. However, in June 2002, HUD submitted a report to the House and Senate appropriation committees as directed by House Conference Report 107-272. This report includes some of the information required in the annual report, such as the extent of leveraging. However, neither HUD's most recent budget justification nor its most recent performance and accountability report contains detailed information on the amount of leveraged funds or the cost of public housing units revitalized under the HOPE VI program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For years, some of the nation\u2019s public housing sites have exemplified urban decay and substandard living conditions. In an effort to address these longstanding problems in a new way, the Congress, in October 1992, established the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program, commonly known as HOPE VI, provides grants to public housing authorities to replace severely distressed public housing units with attractive, economically viable communities that often combine public housing with other affordable or market-priced housing units (see fig. 1). Through fiscal year 2001, the Congress appropriated almost $5 billion for the HOPE VI program, and HUD used the majority of this funding to award 165 revitalization grants to 98 public housing authorities.", "To increase the number of affordable housing units developed at HOPE VI sites, HUD encouraged housing authorities to use their HOPE VI grants to attract, or leverage, funding from other sources, including other federal, state, local, and private-sector sources. In our July 1998 report on the program, we found that financial leveraging had increased over time and that this trend was expected to continue. Housing authorities that received revitalization grants in fiscal years 1993 through 2001 estimate that they will be able to obtain an additional $9 billion in public and private funds for their HOPE VI sites. Projects funded with a combination of public and private funds are known as mixed-finance projects.", "The HOPE VI program is also intended to improve the lives of public housing residents through community and supportive services, such as childcare, transportation, job training, job placement and retention services, and parenting classes. Although HUD, as required by law, limits the portion of HOPE VI grant funds that grantees may spend for these services, it encourages housing authorities to leverage additional funds that are not subject to HUD\u2019s limits.", "As required by the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Act), HUD adopted a revised total development cost policy in 1999. This policy, as specified by the Act, limits the amount of public housing funds, including HOPE VI funds, that housing authorities may spend to construct a public housing unit. This per-unit limit, which does not apply to leveraged funds, is equal to an amount that HUD has determined is adequate to develop a unit of good and sound quality. The Act also requires HUD to report annually to the Congress on the costs of public housing units revitalized at HOPE VI sites.", "You requested that we comprehensively review the HOPE VI program. Because of the scope of the request, we agreed with your office to provide the information in a series of reports. This first report focuses on the financing of HOPE VI developments. Specifically, as agreed with your office, we describe the extent to which grantees have (1) leveraged funds from other sources, particularly other federal sources; (2) leveraged funds specifically for community and supportive services; and (3) complied with HUD\u2019s funding limits for developing public housing units and budgeted additional funds not subject to these limits. Because the Act requires HUD to report HOPE VI cost information to the Congress, we also discuss the extent to which HUD has complied with this requirement.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed funding information from HUD\u2019s HOPE VI reporting system. This system contains information on all the revitalization grants awarded through fiscal year 2001, including projected budgets and funding sources. To assess the reliability of this projected funding data, we reviewed information about the system and performed electronic testing to detect obvious errors in completeness and reasonableness. We also reviewed all the mixed-finance proposals approved through fiscal year 2001. (Grantees submit mixed- finance proposals, which include information on the sources and uses of funds, when they are ready to proceed with a mixed-finance phase of development.) In addition, we interviewed the HUD headquarters officials responsible for administering the program. We performed our work from November 2001 through September 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In 1992, the Commission reported that approximately 86,000, or 6 percent, of the nation\u2019s public housing units were severely distressed. According to the Commission, these units qualified as severely distressed because of their physical deterioration and uninhabitable living conditions; high levels of poverty; inadequate and fragmented services; institutional abandonment; and location in neighborhoods often as blighted as the sites themselves. Although the Commission did not identify specific locations as severely distressed, it recommended that funds be made available to address distressed conditions, and that these funds be added to the amounts traditionally appropriated for modernizing public housing. The Commission also encouraged the development of supportive services for residents in distressed housing developments.", "In response to the Commission\u2019s report, Congress established the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program, more commonly known as HOPE VI, at HUD. By providing funds for a combination of capital improvements and community and supportive services, the program seeks to (1) improve the living environment for public housing residents of severely distressed public housing through the demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or replacement of obsolete public housing; (2) revitalize sites on which such public housing is located, and contribute to the improvement of the surrounding neighborhood; (3) provide housing that will avoid or decrease the concentration of very low-income families; and (4) build sustainable communities. To achieve these objectives, the program provides demolition and revitalization grants to public housing authorities (PHA). Demolition grants fund the demolition of distressed public housing, the relocation of residents affected by the demolition, and the implementation of supportive services for permanently relocated residents. Revitalization grants fund, among other things, the capital costs of major rehabilitation, new construction, and other physical improvements; demolition of severely distressed housing; and community and supportive service programs for residents, including those relocated as a result of revitalization efforts. Through fiscal year 2001, HUD had awarded 177 demolition grants totaling approximately $293 million and 165 revitalization grants totaling about $4.5 billion.", "According to HUD, HOPE VI started as an embellished modernization program but has evolved into a comprehensive and complex transformation in how housing authorities provide affordable housing to low-income families. A significant stage in that evolution was the issuance of the Mixed-Finance Rule in 1996. Under this rule, for the first time PHAs were allowed to use public housing funds designated for capital improvements, including HOPE VI funds, to leverage other public and private investment to develop public housing units. The rule also permitted PHAs to provide public housing capital funds to a third party so that the third party could develop public housing units. The third party would then own the resulting public housing units and could receive capital or operating assistance for the units from HUD through the PHA. HUD emphasizes that this mixed-finance approach to public housing development is the single most important development tool currently available to PHAs. The approach encourages the formation of new public and private partnerships to ensure the long-term sustainability of the public housing development and surrounding community. The mixed- finance approach can produce developments that include both public housing and nonpublic housing units, such as low-income housing tax credit units or market rate units.", "Mixed-finance HOPE VI projects are often undertaken in development phases. A housing authority may not begin a phase to be financed with a combination of public and private funds until it has submitted, and HUD has approved, a mixed-finance proposal for that phase. The mixed-finance proposal presents the fundamental information that HUD needs to evaluate a mixed-finance phase. For example, it contains basic descriptive information such as the number and types of units planned, the development schedule, the sources and uses of funding, and the operating budget for the phase. Because of the time that is needed to plan HOPE VI projects and develop specific proposals, most of the proposals that HUD approved through fiscal year 2001 were funded with revitalization grants awarded several years earlier.", "PHAs with revitalization grants can use a variety of other public and private funds to develop their HOPE VI sites. Public funding can come from federal, state, and local sources. For example, PHAs can use federal resources HUD has already awarded for capital improvements at public housing developments. These capital funds can be used for a variety of purposes, including the development, financing, and modernization of public housing and the replacement of obsolete utility systems and dwelling equipment. PHAs can also use funds raised through federal low- income housing tax credits. Under this program, states are authorized to allocate federal tax credits as an incentive to the private sector to develop rental housing for low-income households. After the state allocates tax credits to developers, the developers typically offer the credits to private investors. The private investors use the tax credits to offset taxes otherwise owed on their tax returns. The money private investors pay for the credits is paid into the projects as equity financing. In addition, PHAs may obtain some of the funding needed for infrastructure and public improvements from state and local governments. Private sources can include private mortgage financing and financial or in-kind contributions from nonprofit organizations. See appendix II for more information on the types of funds that may be invested at HOPE VI sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Authorities Are Leveraging Additional Funds", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis of HUD data, housing authorities expect to leverage, for every dollar received in HOPE VI revitalization grants awarded through fiscal year 2001, an additional $1.85 in funds from other sources.

Also, HUD data indicate that, of the total funds that housing authorities with revitalization grants have budgeted for their HOPE VI sites, 46 percent come from federal sources. However, this percentage does not include funds that grantees receive through low- income housing tax credits, which are a direct cost to the federal government.

In total, $964 million in public housing funds have been budgeted for HOPE VI sites. The $964 million includes capital funds and $150 million in HOPE VI demolition grant funds. Grantees would have received the capital funds regardless of whether they received a HOPE VI revitalization grant, and the demolition grants are another category of HOPE VI funds. When the $964 million in public housing funds are not included as leveraged funds, the overall projected leveraging per HOPE VI dollar is reduced from $2.07 to $1.85.", "Even when public housing funds are excluded from leveraged funds, our analysis of HUD data shows that leveraging has increased over the life of the HOPE VI program. According to HUD\u2019s HOPE VI reporting system, housing authorities that received a revitalization grant in fiscal year 1993 expected to raise an additional $0.58 (excluding public housing funds) for every HOPE VI grant dollar awarded to them. By fiscal year 2001, housing authorities expected to augment every HOPE VI revitalization grant dollar awarded to them with an additional $2.63 from other sources (excluding public housing funds). Though mixed-finance development was not an official option for housing authorities until 1996, housing authorities were permitted, prior to 1996, to use a mix of public funds to redevelop distressed public housing sites. According to HUD officials, the amounts leveraged by housing authorities should increase over time, as potential investors become more familiar with the HOPE VI program and housing authorities become more sophisticated in seeking and securing other sources of funds.

However, tax credits represent forgone federal income and, therefore, are a direct cost to the federal government. Our reports have consistently described low-income housing tax credits as federal housing assistance.", "Because housing authorities do not have to report individually each source included in the nonfederal funding category, we could not use the data in HUD\u2019s HOPE VI reporting system to determine the specific amounts raised through low-income housing tax credits. In order to distinguish low- income housing tax credit funds from nonfederal funds, we examined 85 mixed-finance proposals that HUD had approved through the end of fiscal year 2001.

All of the notices since 1999 have included incentives that encourage housing authorities to leverage additional funds for supportive services. There is no cap on the amount of leveraged funds that housing authorities can spend on supportive services. Housing authorities are encouraged to obtain in-kind, financial, and other types of resources necessary to carry out and sustain supportive service activities from organizations such as local Boards of Education, public libraries, private foundations, nonprofit organizations, faith-based organizations, and economic development agencies.

Specifically, while 22 percent of the total funds budgeted for supportive services by fiscal year 1997 grantees consisted of leveraged funds, 59 percent of the total funds budgeted by fiscal year 2001 grantees consisted of leveraged funds. This increase may be attributable, in part, to the fact that, starting in fiscal year 1998, HUD began to consider the leveraging of additional resources (for physical improvements and supportive services) as one of its criteria for evaluating grant applications.
