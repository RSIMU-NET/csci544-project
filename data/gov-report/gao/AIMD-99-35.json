It does this by (1) enforcing the laws governing the flow of goods and persons across the borders of the United States and (2) assessing and collecting duties, taxes, and fees on imported merchandise. During fiscal year 1997, Customs collected $22.1 billion in revenue at more than 300 ports of entry and reported that it processed nearly 450 million passengers who entered the United States during the year.", "To accomplish its mission, Customs is organized into six lines of business\u2014trade compliance, outbound, passenger, finance, human resources, and investigations. Each business area is described below.", "Trade compliance includes enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the importation of goods into the United States. To do so, Customs (1) works with the trade community to promote understanding of applicable laws and regulations, (2) selectively examines cargo to ensure that only eligible goods enter the country, (3) reviews documentation associated with cargo entries to ensure that they are properly valued and classified, (4) collects billions of dollars annually in duties, taxes, and fees associated with imported cargo, (5) assesses fines and penalties for noncompliance with trade laws and regulations, (6) seizes and accounts for illegal cargo, and (7) manages the collection of these moneys to ensure that all trade-related debts due to Customs are paid and properly accounted for.", "Outbound includes Customs enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the movement of merchandise and conveyances from the United States. To do so, Customs (1) selectively inspects cargo at U.S. ports to guard against the exportation of illegal goods, such as protected technologies, stolen vehicles, and illegal currency, (2) collects, disseminates, and uses intelligence to identify high-risk cargo and passengers, (3) seizes and accounts for illegal cargo, (4) assesses and collects fines and penalties associated with the exportation of illegal cargo, and (5) physically examines baggage and cargo at airport facilities for explosive and nuclear materials. In addition, the outbound business includes collecting and disseminating trade data within the federal government. Accurate trade data are crucial to establishing accurate trade statistics on which to base trade policy decisions and negotiate trade agreements with other countries. By the year 2000, Customs estimates that exports will be valued at $1.2 trillion, compared to a reported $696 million in 1994.", "Passenger includes processing all passengers and crew of arriving and departing (1) air and sea conveyances and (2) land vehicles and pedestrians. In fiscal year 1997, Customs reported it processed nearly 450 million travelers and, by the year 2000, expects almost 500 million passengers to arrive in the United States annually. Many of Customs\u2019 passenger activities focus on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and are coordinated with other federal agencies, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Activities include targeting high-risk passengers, which requires timely and accurate information, and physically inspecting selected passengers, baggage, and vehicles to determine compliance with laws and regulations.", "Finance includes asset and revenue management activities. Asset management consists of activities to (1) formulate Customs\u2019 budget, (2) properly allocate and distribute funds, and (3) acquire, manage, and account for personnel, goods, and services. Revenue management encompasses all Customs activities to identify and establish amounts owed Customs, collect these amounts, and accurately report the status of revenue from all sources. Sources of revenue include duties, fees, taxes, other user fees, and forfeited currency and property. The revenue management activities interrelate closely with the revenue collection activities in the trade compliance, outbound, and passenger business areas.", "Human resources is responsible for filling positions, providing employee benefits and services, training employees, facilitating workforce effectiveness, and processing personnel actions for Customs\u2019 18,000 employees and managers. Investigations includes activities to detect and eliminate narcotics and money laundering operations. Customs works with other agencies and foreign governments to reduce drug-related activity by interdicting (seizing and destroying) narcotics, investigating organizations involved in drug smuggling, and deterring smuggling efforts through various other methods. Customs also develops and provides information to the trade and carrier communities to assist them in their efforts to prevent smuggling organizations from using cargo containers and commercial conveyances to introduce narcotics into the United States.", "To carry out its responsibilities, Customs relies on information systems and processes to assist its staff in (1) documenting, inspecting, and accounting for the movement and disposition of imported goods and (2) collecting and accounting for the related revenues. Customs expects its reliance on information systems to increase as a result of its burgeoning workload. For 1995 through 2001, Customs estimates that the annual volume of import trade between the United States and other countries will increase from $761 billion to $1.1 trillion. This will result in Customs processing an estimated increase of 7.5 million commercial entries\u2014from 13.1 million to 20.6 million annually\u2014during the same period. Recent trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have also increased the number and complexity of trade provisions that Customs must enforce.", "Customs recognizes that its ability to process the growing volume of imports while improving compliance with trade laws depends heavily on successfully modernizing its trade compliance process and its supporting automated systems. To speed the processing of imports and improve compliance with trade laws, the Congress enacted legislation that eliminated certain legislatively mandated paper requirements and required Customs to establish the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP). The legislation also specified certain functions that NCAP must provide, including giving members of the trade community the capability to electronically file import entries at remote locations and enabling Customs to electronically process \u201cdrawback\u201d claims. In response to the legislation, Customs began in 1994 to modernize the information systems that support operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Projects: A Brief Description", "paragraphs": ["Customs has several projects underway to develop and acquire new software and evolve (i.e., maintain) existing software to support its six business areas.

In 1994, Customs began to develop ACE to replace its existing automated import system, the Automated Commercial System (ACS). ACE is intended to provide an integrated, automated information system for collecting, disseminating, and analyzing import-related data and ensuring the proper collection and allocation of revenues, totaling about $19 billion annually. According to Customs, ACE is planned to automate critical functions that the Congress specified when it established NCAP.", "Customs reported that it spent $47.8 million on ACE as of the end of fiscal year 1997. In November 1997, Customs estimated it would cost $1.05 billion to develop, operate, and maintain ACE over the 15 years from fiscal year 1994 through fiscal year 2008. Customs plans to deploy ACE to more than 300 ports that handle commercial cargo imports.", "Customs plans to develop and deploy ACE in multiple phases. According to Customs, the first phase, known as NCAP, is an ACE prototype. Customs currently plans to deploy NCAP in four releases. The first release was deployed for field evaluation at three locations in May 1998, and the fourth is scheduled for 1999. Customs, however, has not adhered to previous NCAP deployment schedules. Specifically, implementation of the NCAP prototype slipped from January 1997 to August 1997 and then again to a series of four releases beginning in October 1997, with the fourth release starting in June 1998.", "Customs also has several other projects underway to modify or enhance existing systems that support its six business areas. For example, in fiscal year 1998, Customs planned to spend about $3.7 million to enhance its Automated Export System (AES), which supports the outbound business area and is designed to improve Customs\u2019 collection and reporting of export statistics and to enforce export regulations.

Customs and Census officials estimate that they spent approximately $12.9 million to develop and implement AES from fiscal year 1992 to 1997. These costs included, among other things, expenses for contractors, travel, and training.

Responsibility for this phase rests with senior management.", "Diagnosing phase: During this phase, the SEPG appraises the current level of software process maturity to establish a baseline of the organization\u2019s process capability, and identifies any ongoing process improvement initiatives. The SEPG then uses the baseline to identify weaknesses and target process improvement activities. It also compares these targeted activities with any ongoing process improvement activities and reconciles any differences. Responsibility for this phase rests primarily with line managers and practitioners.", "Establishing phase: During this phase, the SEPG prioritizes the software process improvement activities and develops strategies for pursuing them. It then develops a process improvement action plan that details the activities and strategies and includes measurable goals for the activities and metrics for monitoring progress against the goals. Also during this phase, the resources needed to implement the plan are committed and training is provided for SEPG\u2019s technical working groups, who will be responsible for developing and testing new or improved processes. Responsibility for this phase resides primarily with line managers and practitioners.", "Acting phase: In this phase, the work groups create and evaluate new and improved processes. Evaluation of the processes is based on pilot tests that are formally planned and executed. If the pilots are successful, the work groups develop plans for organization-wide adoption and institutionalization, and once approved, execute them. Responsibility for this phase resides primarily with line managers and practitioners.", "Leveraging phase: During this phase, results and lessons learned from earlier phases are assessed and applied, as appropriate, to enhance the process improvement program\u2019s structure and plans. Responsibility for this phase rests primarily with senior management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Does Not Currently Have a Software Process Improvement Program", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, Customs initiated some limited software process improvement activities. Specifically, it hired a contractor to develop a process improvement plan, which was completed in September 1996. According to the plan, Customs was to reach CMM level 2 process maturity (the repeatable level) by 1998 and CMM level 3 (the defined level) by 2002. Customs began limited implementation of the plan in May of 1997, when it established process improvement teams for two KPAs\u2014software project planning and project tracking and oversight. Generally, the teams were tasked with defining, implementing, and maintaining CMM-based processes for their respective KPAs. Customs did not staff or fund any other KPA improvement activities at this time. In August 1997, Customs discontinued all process improvement activities. Customs officials stated that this decision was based on the need to focus staff and resources on the agency\u2019s Year 2000 conversion program.", "Currently, Customs does not have a software development process improvement program, and it has not taken steps to initiate one. Although it has assigned two people part-time to process improvement, it has not assigned organizational responsibility and authority, established a program management structure, developed a plan of action, and committed resources needed (trained staff and funding) to execute the plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Customs does not have an effective software development process improvement program.

However, its software development processes are ad hoc and sometimes chaotic, and are not repeatable even on a project-by-project basis. As a result, Customs\u2019 success or failure in developing software depends largely on specific individuals, rather than on well-defined and disciplined software management practices. This greatly reduces the probability that its software projects, whether new developments or maintenance of existing software, will consistently perform as intended and be delivered on schedule and within budget. For Customs software projects to mature beyond this initial level, the agency must implement basic management controls and instill self-discipline in its software projects.", "Customs acknowledges the importance of software process maturity and the need to improve its software development processes. However, it does not have a program for improving its software development processes and has not begun to establish one. Until it does, Customs has no assurance that its large investment in software development and maintenance will produce systems that perform needed functions, on time, and within budget."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that, after ensuring that its mission-critical systems are Year 2000 compliant but before investing in major software development efforts like ACE, the Commissioner of Customs direct the Chief Information Officer to assign responsibility and authority for software development process develop and implement a formal plan for software development process improvement that is based on the software capability evaluation results contained in this report and specifies measurable goals and time frames, prioritizes initiatives, estimates resource requirements (trained staff and funding) and defines a process improvement management structure; ensure that every new software development effort in Customs adopts processes that satisfy at least SW-CMM level 2 requirements; and ensure that process improvement activities are initiated for all ongoing essential software maintenance projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments on a draft of this report, Customs acknowledged the importance of software process improvement and maturity. Also, it agreed with GAO\u2019s overall findings, including that Customs\u2019 software development processes have not attained SW-CMM level 2 maturity.", "To address these weaknesses, Customs stated that it has taken the first step toward implementing our recommendations by assigning responsibility and authority for software process improvement as part of a reorganization of its Office of Information and Technology, which Customs stated will be implemented in early 1999. Customs further stated that once the reorganization is implemented, a formal software process improvement program will be established, and that this program will include definition of an action plan, commitment of resources, and specification of goals for achieving CMM levels 2 and 3. According to Customs, these improvement activities are in their early stages. When they are successfully implemented, they should address many of our recommendations.", "Customs also stated that because its legacy systems are aging and need to be enhanced and replaced, software process improvement must occur in parallel with continued software development investments. History has shown that attempting to modernize without first instituting disciplined software processes has been a characteristic of failed modernization programs. Until it implements disciplined software processes (i.e., at least level 2 process maturity), Customs cannot prudently manage major system investments, such as ACE with an estimated life cycle cost exceeding $1 billion.", "Customs\u2019 comments also included a request to meet with us to discuss system-specific KPA practice strength and weakness determinations. We met prior to requesting comments on a draft of this report and then again on January 12, 1999, to discuss SEI\u2019s SW-CMM requirements and the basis for our determinations.
