By December 1994, nearly 450,000 people with HIV had been reported to have progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and more than 270,000 had been reported to have died of the disease. Currently, only one federal program provides funds specifically for medical and support services to individuals with AIDS and HIV.

Per-case funding should only differ to the extent that costs and fiscal capacities do.

In the context of our equity criteria, this approach assumes that the number of people currently living with AIDS can be estimated by using the cumulative number of AIDS cases reported since 1981. About 66 percent of these AIDS cases are no longer living, however, and the likelihood of death increases substantially the longer one has AIDS. As a result, this measure would direct funds more to where the epidemic occurred initially rather than to where it appeared more recently.", "The second approach\u2014AIDS cases less reported deaths\u2014subtracts each state\u2019s and EMA\u2019s total reported deaths from their total reported AIDS cases for the 10 most recent years.

Our interviews with experts and our review of the literature indicated that this estimate would be biased because AIDS-related deaths are more extensively and quickly reported in some states and EMAs than in others, and this results in measurement errors. Furthermore, since funds are based on the number of people living with AIDS, those states and EMAs that underreport AIDS-related deaths would be rewarded, while others with more reliable reporting would, in effect, be penalized. Many of the experts we interviewed expressed concerns that this method could introduce incentives to purposely underreport deaths. Consequently, states and EMAs might delay or not even report these deaths, which could lead to another bias to the caseload measure and result in less reliable information on the lifespans of people with the disease.", "The third approach that we considered uses the number of AIDS cases reported in the most recent 2 years to estimate the number of living AIDS cases. This is the caseload measure currently used in the title II formula, and it appears to reasonably estimate the number of living cases. However, because this measure consists of cases from a narrow time frame, we believe it could be too sensitive to sudden caseload changes and disrupt the continuity of funding over time. Also, the expected lifespans for people with AIDS could increase over time. If this occurs in the future, the cases reported in a 2-year interval may not accurately reflect the number of people living with the disease.", "The final approach\u2014weighted AIDS cases\u2014is a proxy measure of living AIDS cases. This approach estimates the number of AIDS cases living in an EMA or state on the basis of on the number of AIDS cases reported to CDC for each of the most recent 10 years and national average survival rates since a case was first reported. Specifically, the number of AIDS cases that an EMA or a state had reported for each of these 10 years would be weighted by the national percentage of cases estimated to be living as of the first day of the most recent year of that period. These percentages would be estimated from national data on the number of people reported to have AIDS during a 10-year period who had not been reported to have died of the disease.", "Table I.1 shows the cumulative survival rates for each of 10 years as of fiscal year 1992.

Unlike the cumulative AIDS cases measure, it has been adjusted to account for people with AIDS who are no longer living and thus better reflects the intended service population. In contrast to the second approach, this one averages out differences in reporting mortality and avoids incentives to underreport deaths. Specifically, since the algorithm for estimating living cases would be based on national data, any uniqueness in how states and EMAs report mortality would not affect the amount of funds that they would receive.
