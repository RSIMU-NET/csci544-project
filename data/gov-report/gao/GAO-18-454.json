This management approach creates constant churn as program baselines must continually re-align with budget realities instead of budgets being formulated to support program baselines. Further, Coast Guard officials said the CIP reflects the highest priorities of the department\u2014such as the Offshore Patrol Cutter, which is the Coast Guard's highest priority\u2014and that trade-off decisions are made as part of the annual budget process. However, the effects of these decisions, such as which acquisitions would take on more risk so others can be prioritized and adequately funded, are not communicated in the CIP to key decision makers, because including such information is not statutorily required. Over the years, this approach has left the Coast Guard with a build up\u2014or bow wave\u2014of near-term unfunded acquisitions, negatively affecting recapitalization efforts and limiting the effectiveness of long-term planning. Including the effects of these trade-offs in the CIP would align with GAO's cost estimating best practices. Until it does so, the Coast Guard limits its ability to manage its acquisition portfolio in the long-term, beyond the time covered in the 5-year CIP.", "In response to a September 2012 GAO recommendation, the Coast Guard updated the Executive Oversight Council's (EOC)\u2014a cross-directorate group that oversees major acquisition programs\u2014charter in 2014 to require annual reviews of the acquisition portfolio collectively. However, EOC officials said that these annual reviews never occurred, and GAO found that the annual review requirement was removed from the charter in 2017. Thus, the Coast Guard is without a senior-level group charged to collectively review and ensure affordability of its acquisition portfolio. The Office of Management and Budget's Capital Programming Guide states that a senior-level executive committee should be responsible for reviewing the agency's entire asset portfolio and for making decisions on the proper composition of assets needed to achieve strategic goals within budget constraints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the annual CIPs reflect acquisition trade-off decisions and their effects, and that the EOC review the overall acquisition portfolio and its affordability annually.

These assets are intended to conduct missions that range  from illegal drug and migrant interdiction to search and rescue operations.  For more than 15 years, we have reported extensively on the Coast  Guard\u2019s portfolio of major acquisition programs and its risks and  uncertainties. In our prior work, we found shortcomings in the Coast  Guard\u2019s acquisition planning practices, such as its reliance on the annual  budget process to plan major acquisitions without a thorough plan to  ensure the affordability of the entire acquisition portfolio.

We analyzed the Coast Guard\u2019s 5-year Capital  Investment Plans (CIP) that supported the budget requests for fiscal  years 2014 through 2018 to determine how the Coast Guard has  managed the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. We compared Coast  Guard practices for managing affordability and long-term planning with  best practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide  and prior GAO reports. We also reviewed a range of acquisition  programs based on if they were already major acquisition programs  (programs with a life-cycle cost estimate greater than or equal to $300  million or a total acquisition cost greater than or equal to $100 million) by  definition, the programs were part of our 2014 review, or they are likely to  be major acquisition programs that will require significant funding in the  near future. We reviewed charters for the Coast Guard\u2019s various cross  directorate groups that help oversee Coast Guard acquisitions to identify  responsibilities and membership, and conducted interviews with officials  from these bodies to better understand their portfolio oversight activities.

We have made several recommendations in  these reports. For example, in September 2012, we found a mismatch  between resources needed to support all approved major acquisition  program baselines and expected funding levels. This resulted in the  Coast Guard requesting funding for programs as a part of its annual  budget process below the levels identified in programs\u2019 life-cycle cost  estimates, resulting in a bow wave of future funding requirements. At  the time, DHS and the Coast Guard acknowledged this resource  challenge, but we found they had not developed a clear strategy for  moving forward. At that time, DHS officials stated that funding variability  results in inevitable trade-off decisions being made on an annual basis.  We recommended that the Coast Guard conduct a comprehensive  portfolio review to develop revised baselines that reflect acquisition  priorities as well as realistic funding scenarios. DHS concurred with our  recommendation. Since 2014, the Coast Guard has undertaken efforts to  address this issue, but, as of October 2017, we found these efforts have  not led to the significant trade-off decisions needed to improve the  affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio.", "Additionally, in September 2012, we found that the Coast Guard had  established an acquisition governance framework and that the Executive  Oversight Council was well positioned to receive information from other  cross-directorate groups in order to manage the acquisition portfolio.  However, while the Executive Oversight Council had been active in  overseeing individual programs, it had not met to oversee the portfolio  collectively. Officials told us at that time that the portfolio oversight was  done through the annual budget process. We found this approach to  managing portfolio affordability was ineffective and facilitated immediate  trade-offs, and did not provide the best environment to make decisions in  developing a balanced long-term portfolio. We recommended that the  Coast Guard identify the Executive Oversight Council as the governing  body to oversee the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition enterprise with a portfolio  management approach. In addition, this council should supplement  individual program reviews with acquisition portfolio-wide reviews to make  performance and affordability trade-off decisions that will help ensure the  Coast Guard is acquiring a balanced portfolio to meet mission needs.  DHS concurred and the Coast Guard updated the Executive Oversight  Council\u2019s charter in 2014 to require the group to annually oversee the  acquisitions collectively as a balanced long-term and affordable portfolio.", "Similarly, in June 2014, we found that the Coast Guard had repeatedly  delayed and reduced its capabilities through its annual budget process  and did not know the extent to which it would meet mission needs and  achieve desired results. We reported that this was because the Coast  Guard did not have a long-term fleet modernization plan that identified all  acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next 20 years within  available resources. We recommended that the Coast Guard develop a  20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to  maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to  build the identified assets. We recommended this plan consider trade-offs  in cases where the fiscal resources needed to execute the plan are not  consistent with annual budgets. DHS concurred, but, according to Coast  Guard officials, the plan has yet to be approved.", "In addition to reporting on the Coast Guard\u2019s management of its  acquisition portfolio, we have also issued several reports on how it  oversees depot-level maintenance funding. For example, in July 2012, we  found that the Coast Guard\u2019s depot-level maintenance cost-estimating  process did not fully reflect best practices. We recommended that the  Coast Guard conform its estimated depot-level maintenance expenditures  with cost-estimating best practices. DHS concurred; however, it raised  several points that we found could limit the implementation of the  recommendation. DHS stated, for example, that cost-estimating best  practices are most applicable for new acquisitions. As our report noted,  our cost-estimating best practices guide is intended to be applicable to  programs and assets in all stages of their life cycles, including  maintenance and support.", "Additionally, in March 2017, we found that the cost estimates were not  adjusted or updated over the course of an asset\u2019s service life, leading to a  large discrepancy between expected and actual annual depot-level  maintenance expenditures. We recommended that the Coast Guard  periodically update standard support levels, which are annual estimates  for depot-level maintenance over the course of an asset\u2019s life cycle, to  account for actual expenditures.

As such, we found that  the Coast Guard continues to face the same programmatic risks that  annual CIP-based planning perpetuates, similar to what we have been  reporting since 2011. To address funding constraints, the Coast Guard  has been in a reactive mode by making prioritization decisions through  the annual budget process without identifying how trade-off decisions  made in the current budget cycle will affect the future of the acquisition  portfolio. As a result of this planning process, and as we found in 2012  and in this current review, the Coast Guard has continued to defer  planned acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational  capability gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations.  Moreover, the Coast Guard has not conducted portfolio-wide oversight  through its cross-directorate groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard CIP-based Planning Has Shortcomings That Limit Its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["The 5-year CIP is the Coast Guard\u2019s key acquisition portfolio planning  tool. However, since 2011, we have reported on shortcomings that limit its  effectiveness. As required by statute, the Coast Guard prepares a 5-year  CIP that is required to be updated and submitted annually with the  administration\u2019s budget request. This 5-year CIP provides information  on the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year and the following 4  fiscal years. Coast Guard officials told us the 5-year CIP is the starting  point for developing the acquisition, construction, and improvements  budget for a given year, which funds asset acquisitions as well as major  sustainment projects and infrastructure investments. Officials also  indicated that operational commanders provide input for the budget, as do  senior Coast Guard officials for operations, resources, and others who  have a role within its resource governance construct.", "As we have previously found, the Coast Guard\u2019s 5-year CIPs continue to  demonstrate a pattern of certain planning practices, to include: not identifying priorities or trade-offs between acquisition programs  and not showing the effect of current decisions on the overall  affordability of the acquisition portfolio; projecting funding levels for the current budget year that do not reflect  the full extent of the Coast Guard\u2019s projected acquisition needs; and projecting funding levels for future years that frequently surpass the  average funding amounts requested by the Coast Guard in recent  years.", "These shortcomings limit the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to manage the  affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Coast Guard officials said the CIP  reflects the highest priorities of the department within the given top  funding level and that prioritization and trade-off decisions are made as  part of the annual budget cycle. However, these decisions, and the  resulting impacts on affected programs, are not articulated in the CIPs.  While the Coast Guard is not required under statute to identify the effects  of trade-off decisions in the CIP, failing to show which acquisitions would  take on more risk so other acquisitions can be prioritized and adequately  funded within budget parameters also makes it difficult for Congress and  other stakeholders, such as DHS and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), to understand other options the Coast Guard considered.  GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that comparative  analyses showing facts and supporting details among competing  alternatives, such as budget priorities, should consider trade-offs needed  to identify solutions and manage risk. Our past work has also  highlighted other best practices for portfolio management, such as  demonstrating comprehensive knowledge of the portfolio, including  needs, gaps, and how to address those gaps; prioritizing investments  through alignment of requirements, acquisition, and budget processes;  and use of long-term planning.", "As we found in September 2012, the Coast Guard\u2019s approach of relying  on the annual budget process to manage portfolio affordability does not  provide the best basis for making decisions to develop a more balanced  and affordable portfolio in the long-term. In June 2014, we also found  that there is no evidence that short-term budget decisions will result in a  good long-term strategy, and the Coast Guard\u2019s annual budget-driven  trade-off approach creates constant churn as program baselines must  continually re-align with budget realities instead of budgets being  formulated to support program baselines. This results in trade-off  decisions between capability and cost being pushed into the future. For  example, the Coast Guard has a stated requirement for three medium  icebreakers and three heavy icebreakers, and has initiated an acquisition  program for heavy icebreakers. Assets acquired under this program will  replace the Coast Guard\u2019s only operating heavy icebreaker\u2014the Polar  Star\u2014which is well past the end of its original design service life. The  Coast Guard currently plans to have the three heavy icebreakers  delivered in 2023, 2025, and 2026. Additionally, the Coast Guard  operates one medium icebreaker, the Healy, which has an expected end  of service life in 2029. Despite the requirement for three medium  icebreakers, Coast Guard officials said they are not currently assessing  acquisition of the medium polar icebreakers because they are focusing on  the heavy icebreaker acquisition and plan to assess the costs and  benefits of acquiring medium polar icebreakers at a later time.", "This planning approach can also lead to delayed capabilities and program  risks, as the 5-year CIP does not prioritize acquisition programs in its  projections for the 5-year period. We found in 2017 that both acquisition  needs\u2014as articulated in program baselines\u2014as well as the 5-year CIP\u2019s  funding projections frequently surpass the average requested funding  amounts in recent years. Similarly, in this review, we found this to be the  case in the 5-year CIP covering fiscal years 2018 through 2022.", "Congressional appropriations for Coast Guard acquisition, construction,  and improvements in fiscal years 2013 through 2018 exceeded the Coast  Guard\u2019s requests. Explanatory materials on the annual appropriations  acts for these fiscal years indicated, among other things, that funding was  provided above requested amounts for procurement of one HC-130J  aircraft each year. The House Committee on Appropriations report  accompanying the Homeland Security appropriations bill for 2018 noted  that the Secretary is expected to include adequate funding in the fiscal  year 2019 budget request to normalize the recapitalization of the HC-130  fleet. Recent annual appropriations acts also direct the use of funds to  contract for three National Security Cutters that were not a part of the  program of record for the fleet of these cutters.", "Absent any additional funding appropriated by Congress above Coast  Guard requests, the acquisition portfolio put forth in the fiscal year 2018  CIP will not be affordable by fiscal year 2019 based on average recent  budget requests.

However, the  fiscal year 2018 through 2022 CIP, dated October 2017, does not reflect  this need for any year in its 5-year budget window. By not providing  comprehensive information in the CIP on the acquisitions needed to  perform its missions as well as the trade-offs necessary at different  funding levels, the Coast Guard is not providing decision makers,  including those in Congress, information to help decide which programs  are the highest priority and which funding increases may or may not be  consistent with the Coast Guard\u2019s programs of record, as approved by  DHS.

At that  time, we found that program cost increases were consuming significant  amounts of funding, and the Coast Guard was further from fielding its  planned fleet than it was in 2009, in terms of the fiscal resources needed  to finish those programs\u2014or the remaining investment required. Since  2014, program costs have generally been stable and, from 2014 to 2018,  the Coast Guard reduced the remaining investment required to complete  those acquisitions by $4.9 billion or 24 percent (see table 3).", "However, while the Coast Guard has reduced the remaining investment  required to complete its acquisition portfolio, there is little room for  additional major acquisitions based on recent budget requests. For  example, the National Security Cutter and Fast Response Cutter\u2014two of  the Coast Guard\u2019s most expensive acquisitions programs\u2014both  experienced delays and were not delivered as originally scheduled. As a  result, these delays stretched its acquisition budget longer than intended.  Going forward, our analysis indicated that once the Coast Guard begins  funding construction of Offshore Patrol Cutters\u2014another major  acquisition program critical in replacing vessels well past their service  lives\u2014that program is expected to consume a significant portion of the  Coast Guard\u2019s planned acquisition, construction, and improvements  budget between 2018 and 2032, also raising uncertainties in how the  Coast Guard will be able to fund other priorities.", "According to the previous Commandant of the Coast Guard, the Offshore  Patrol Cutter is the Coast Guard\u2019s top priority and, as such, the Coast  Guard will prioritize its budget requests for the Offshore Patrol Cutter  before other assets, potentially limiting funds requested for other  acquisition programs. This approach will limit the portfolio for the  foreseeable future and affect other new programs, such as the Heavy  Polar Icebreaker and Waterways Commerce Cutter. These two programs  represent critical needs for the Coast Guard, as the legacy assets they  are intended to replace are well past their designed service lives, but  there are limited resources for them if acquisition of the current portfolio is  to be completed as scheduled.", "The polar icebreaker program has an estimated total acquisition cost  of more than $3 billion and, according to the Coast Guard, is needed  to alleviate a potential icebreaking mission capability gap. Heavy  icebreakers are needed, as Coast Guard officials also indicated, to  provide year-round access to the Polar Regions, including the  clearance of a navigable channel for access to the National Science  Foundation\u2019s McMurdo Research Station on Ross Island, Antarctica  as well as to facilitate other national security interests in polar waters.  DHS approved the icebreaker program for entry into the obtain phase  of the acquisition process in March 2018. The Coast Guard\u2014in  partnership with the Navy\u2014is expected to award a contract for design  and construction of up to 3 heavy polar icebreakers by June 2019,  and plans for the first icebreaker to be delivered by the end of fiscal  year 2023. We recently reported on this program in April 2018 and  have an ongoing review that is expected to be completed by summer  2018.", "DHS recently approved a new program, known as the Waterways  Commerce Cutter program, to recapitalize aging vessels such as its  fleet of 35 Inland Tenders (river, buoy, and construction tenders). The  assets in the current fleet continue to age beyond their expected  service lives and the Waterways Commerce Cutter program is  currently in the analyze/select phase of the acquisition process. Coast  Guard officials said they are still determining how many new vessels  are needed to provide capabilities similar to the current fleet of  vessels that replace or relocate river buoys and builds fixed aids to  navigational marine structures. A life-cycle cost estimate has not yet  been developed for this program, but, according to Coast Guard  officials, the preliminary rough order of magnitude estimate for total  acquisition cost is $1.1 billion.", "As we reported in July 2017, the Coast Guard has no method in place to  capture the effects of deferred acquisitions on its future portfolio. The  lack of a long-term plan, as discussed earlier, and determining priorities  and making trade-off decisions based on the annual budget have put the  Coast Guard in a reactive planning mode each year. We found that this  type of reactive planning and the Coast Guard\u2019s constrained budget  environment have created a bow wave of near-term unfunded  acquisitions, negatively affecting future acquisition efforts and potentially  affecting future operations. This bow wave consists of new acquisition  programs and recapitalization efforts, as well as high-cost maintenance  projects that use the acquisition construction and improvements account,  which continue to put pressure on available resources. These projects  include some that are not currently identified in the acquisition portfolio.  For instance, the Coast Guard\u2019s 87-foot patrol boats are forecast to  require recapitalization beginning in 2023. Additionally, the ocean-going  175-foot coastal buoy tenders\u2014not included in the Waterways Commerce  Cutter program\u2014are past the point in their service lives when a midlife  maintenance availability would normally have been conducted.  However, we found that the Coast Guard has historically operated  vessels well past their expected end of service life, and it will likely need  to do so with these assets given limited available acquisition funding.", "Furthermore, the Coast Guard has identified more than $1.5 billion in  shore infrastructure projects, which are paid for with funding from the  acquisition, construction, and improvements account that it has not been  able to address, primarily due to lack of funding, among other reasons.  Some of these projects are detailed in an unfunded priorities list the  Coast Guard submitted to congressional committees in July 2017  pursuant to statutory requirements. Among the projects identified are  recapitalization for waterfront facilities damaged in hurricanes; major  acquisition systems infrastructure associated with homeporting the ninth  National Security Cutter; and a number of pier replacements, building  construction, and navigational aid realignment projects in several  locations.

However, during  our current review, we found that the Coast Guard revised the council\u2019s  charter in June 2017, removing this responsibility. According to Executive  Oversight Council officials, this responsibility was removed from the 2017  charter because the council did not conduct these annual reviews.  Instead, Executive Oversight Council officials indicated that the council  facilitates a balanced and affordable portfolio of acquisition programs  through the individual program-level reviews.

The Systems  Integration Team\u2019s responsibilities outlined in its current charter include  addressing issues tasked by the Executive Oversight Council chair,  reporting to the council on cross-programmatic issues, and providing  recommendations to the council.

In the case of the Coast Guard, only the Executive  Oversight Council has representation at the senior-level executive level  and has the responsibility for oversight of its major acquisition programs.

These dry docks were  originally planned to last between 2-1/2 months and 4 months. These  extensions also compressed the amount of time that the crew had to  prepare for its annual mission to Antarctica, which, according to members  of the Polar Star crew, placed a large stress on the crew, risked the  quality of work, and reduced or eliminated the crews\u2019 planned rest and  personal preparation for their roughly 4-month deployment. Based on our  analysis, these delays and extensions are likely to continue as the cutter  ages. According to Coast Guard officials, the Polar Star\u2019s SLEP work will  be conducted during the annual dry dock periods by adding an additional  1 or 2 months to the annual dry docks. However, if the work is unable to  be completed during this time frame, it could force the Coast Guard to  miss its commitment to conduct the annual Antarctica mission.

However, this estimate may be unrealistic based on  assumptions the Coast Guard used, such as that it would continue to use  parts from the Coast Guard\u2019s other heavy polar icebreaker, the Polar Sea,  which has been inactive since 2010.

The  cutters have several systems that are no longer manufactured, and in  many cases the original manufacturer no longer makes parts for the  systems, such as the generators, fire pumps, and main diesel engines. In  order to sustain the 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters until the  Offshore Patrol Cutters\u2014replacements for the Medium Endurance  Cutters\u2014are delivered, the Coast Guard is planning to conduct a SLEP.

However, the mission capable rating of 69.4 percent  in 2017 is above the maximum target\u201461 percent\u2014which means the  Coast Guard is operating the cutters more than planned. This could be  troublesome since the percentage of time above the 61 percent target is  time that is allocated to depot-level maintenance, meaning these cutters  are not spending as much time as planned in maintenance. In May 2016,  we found that deferring maintenance can lead to declining ship conditions  and longer maintenance periods that can reduce a ship\u2019s operational  availability.", "The Coast Guard is also evaluating how long the 270-foot Medium  Endurance Cutters should remain in service. According to Coast Guard  officials, this decision is at least partially dependent on the delivery of the  Offshore Patrol Cutters\u2014specifically the shipbuilder\u2019s ability to deliver 2  cutters per year, which is expected to start in fiscal year 2024 with the 4th  and 5th cutters. Officials stated that the Coast Guard does not plan to  operate any Medium Endurance Cutters once all 25 Offshore Patrol  Cutters are operational, yet the fiscal year 2018 through 2022 CIP report  indicates that 7 of the 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters will still be in  service when all 25 Offshore Patrol Cutters are delivered and operational.  Officials said this is a contingency plan in case not all Offshore Patrol  Cutters are delivered on time. As we found in June 2017, the Coast  Guard completed refurbishment work on the 210-foot and 270-foot  Medium Endurance Cutters in 2014, but this was not intended to extend  the cutters\u2019 service lives.

In  addition, based on the fiscal year 2018 through 2022 CIP, we found that  the Coast Guard plans for the cutter to operate for an additional 23 years  (until 2029) without any major sustainment work to extend its service life.  While it is not unusual for the Coast Guard to operate cutters for longer  than originally planned, the acquisition schedule for fielding the Offshore  Patrol Cutters will result in some of the Medium Endurance Cutters being  expected to operate up to 30 years beyond their original design service  lives when they are removed from service.", "In the February 2017 Sustainability Assessment of the 210-foot Medium  Endurance Cutters, the Coast Guard rated 5 of the 14 cutters as a high  risk for sustainability, which reflects either a poor material condition or  high maintenance costs. Additionally, the most recent material condition  assessments for the Medium Endurance Cutters, which were completed  in 2015, found that the:", "210-foot Medium Endurance Cutters cannot be expected to meet  operational requirements using the normal depot-level maintenance  funding levels due to the time required to complete maintenance and  the increased maintenance costs in recent years; and mission effectiveness of the 270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters will  continue to degrade without a near-continuous recapitalization of  older sub-systems.", "Further, according to the fiscal year 2018 through 2022 CIP, the Coast  Guard is planning to operate some of the Medium Endurance Cutters for  about the same period of time as other Medium Endurance Cutters that  will undergo the SLEP project. This raises questions as to how those  cutters that do not go through the SLEP will continue operating until their  planned decommissioned date, which in some cases is the same time  period as those cutters undergoing the SLEP. As shown in figure 9, the  210-foot Medium Endurance Cutter Alert will be decommissioned in 2030  and will not undergo a SLEP, while the 270-foot Medium Endurance  Cutter Bear will also be decommissioned in 2030 and could undergo the  SLEP. In July 2012, we found that as assets age beyond their design  service lives, they can negatively affect the Coast Guard\u2019s operational  capacity to meet mission requirements as the cutters require more  maintenance.

The assessments noted that there is the likelihood  that maintenance will be deferred, postponed, or modified to  accommodate this funding shortfall and that the cutters could degrade at  an increasing rate if additional funding is not identified. According to  Coast Guard guidance, once the cost to maintain or repair equipment is in  excess of 50 percent of a cutter\u2019s annual standard support level, it is  considered to have zero years of remaining service life. The 210-foot and  270-foot Medium Endurance Cutters and Inland Tenders exceeded this  threshold each year from 2010 to 2017 and the Polar Star exceeded this  threshold in 2016. This indicates that, although the legacy cutters we  reviewed continue to perform missions, the Coast Guard is accepting a  significant level of risk based on the cutters\u2019 increased depot-level  maintenance expenditures, and that these cutters could experience  catastrophic failures.
