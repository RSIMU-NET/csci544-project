This report updates the information contained in the 2002 report by providing information on (1) the methods agencies use to determine the portion of their annual appropriations related to combating terrorism, and (2) the status of recommendations from GAO's 2002 report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Seven of 34 agencies that reported receiving funding related to combating terrorism activities to OMB used different methodologies to estimate the portion of their authorized funding that supports such activities. These 7 agencies account for about 90 percent of the total fiscal year 2006 budget request that the 34 agencies estimate relate to combating terrorism. All of these methods involve some level of professional judgment. Agencies stated this process is managed through OMB oversight and supervisory review. OMB staff said they do not review the overseas component of combating terrorism funding data since they are no longer required to report it. As a result, Congress does not receive OMB-reviewed data on the entirety of counterterrorism funding. Three recommendations from GAO's 2002 report have not been implemented. The first recommendation requests that OMB include agencies' obligation data in its annual reporting of funding data on combating terrorism. OMB staff continue to cite the effort required to produce such data but said they might consider reporting obligation information for a targeted set of accounts. Without obligation data, it is difficult for Congress to know (1) how much funding from prior years is still available to potentially reduce new spending requests, (2) whether the rate of spending for a program is slower than anticipated, or (3) what the size of the program is for a particular year and over time. The second recommendation was for OMB to direct relevant departments to develop or enhance combating terrorism performance goals and measures and include such measures in the governmentwide plan. Three of the seven agencies told us that OMB had not directed them to develop performance measures or enhance such measures for combating terrorism activities. However, four of the seven agencies had developed such measures. OMB staff said they are working with agencies to improve performance measurement of government programs related to combating terrorism. The development of such measures would assist Congress in determining whether funding increases have improved performance results. The third recommendation calls for the inclusion of national-level and federal governmentwide combating terrorism performance measures in supplements to existing strategies and their future revisions. There have been no supplements or revisions to the existing strategies that include governmentwide or national-level combating terrorism measures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Administration and  Congress have increased funding in support of combating terrorism both  at home and abroad. According to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), combating terrorism includes efforts to secure the homeland (that  is, homeland security activities to detect, deter, protect against, and, if  needed, respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the United States)  and those to combat terrorism overseas (those activities occurring outside  the United States and its territories), excluding direct military action.  Between fiscal years 2002 and 2005, funding attributed to homeland  security activities increased 39 percent, from $33 billion in fiscal year 2002  to $46 billion for fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006, the President  requested nearly $50 billion for activities associated with homeland  security. In addition, Congress appropriated funding that agencies also  attributed to overseas combating terrorism activities. However, OMB is no  longer required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding data.", "In response to the September 11 attacks and the resulting emphasis placed  on combating terrorism, Congress took legislative action to revise  reporting requirements related to federal funding for combating terrorism  activities. Under section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the  President\u2019s annual budget is required to include an analysis of homeland  security funding. This analysis is to be organized by budget function (i.e.,  functions that cover 17 areas of the government such as agriculture and  health), agency, and initiative area. According to OMB staff responsible for  preparing this analysis on behalf of the President, OMB adopted the six  critical mission areas captured in the National Strategy for Homeland  Security\u2014Intelligence and Warning, Border and Transportation Security,  Domestic Counterterrorism, Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key  Assets, Defending against Catastrophic Threats, and Emergency  Preparedness and Response\u2014to represent initiative areas in its analysis.  (See app. II for a detailed description of each critical mission area). This  funding analysis appears in the Analytical Perspectives, which  accompanies the President\u2019s budget and provides information on  requested funding levels related to homeland security. Much of the  funding for combating terrorism activities is embedded within  appropriation accounts that finance programs that are not primarily  homeland security or overseas combating terrorism related. This makes it  difficult to identify activities and track funding without such an analysis.  For example, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) receives the majority of its  appropriations through its Operating Expenses Account. This funding  supports the USCG\u2019s operations both for combating terrorism activities  such as securing ports, waterways, and the coast and for non-combating  terrorism activities such as ice-breaking operations to facilitate navigation  through waterways. Because combating terrorism funding is embedded  within appropriation accounts, agencies provide OMB with information on  the portion of funding that is attributable to combating terrorism  activities\u2014both homeland security and overseas combating terrorism.  OMB then uses this information to report funding information on  homeland security activities in the Analytical Perspectives.", "In November 2002, we reported on the difficulty the executive branch  faced in identifying and tracking combating terrorism funding and other  challenges associated with reporting such data to Congress. Among these  other challenges was the difficulty the executive branch faced in  measuring the effective use of funds for combating terrorism since clearly  defined federal and national performance objectives and measures for  assessing programs\u2019 progress had not been established. This report  updates the information contained in our 2002 report by responding to the  following questions:  1.  How do agencies determine what portion of their annual  appropriations relates to combating terrorism?  2.  What is the status of the recommendations from our 2002 report?", "In addition, we also identified patterns and trends in funding for  combating terrorism activities for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 as well as  the President\u2019s budget request for fiscal year 2006. This information is  discussed in appendix I. Further, we examined how section 889 of the  Homeland Security Act of 2002 affected the reporting of funding data and  the challenges OMB continues to face in tracking activities\u2014specific lines  of work\u2014related to combating terrorism and ensuring the transparency of  related funding data. The impact of section 889 on the reporting of funding  data and the challenges OMB continues to face in tracking activities is  discussed in appendix III. Finally, we reviewed combating terrorism  activities that were funded through 34 budgetary accounts to determine  whether the activities were consistent with OMB\u2019s definitions of homeland  security and overseas combating terrorism as defined in OMB Circular   No. A-11. The information on combating terrorism activities funded  through these 34 accounts is included in appendix IV.", "To address our objectives, we met with staff from OMB and with officials  from 7 agencies that conduct a range of combating terrorism activities\u2014 the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE),  Homeland Security (DHS), and Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers (USACE) and the General Services Administration (GSA). To  reflect a range of funding levels, we selected these agencies from   33 agencies and the District of Columbia that reported receiving funding  related to combating terrorism activities to OMB. The 7 agencies we  selected account for about 90 percent of the total fiscal year 2006 budget  request that the 33 agencies and the District of Columbia estimate relate to  combating terrorism. Because we obtained information from a  nonprobability sample of 7 agencies and their directorates and offices with  combating terrorism responsibilities, the information we obtained cannot  be generalized to all agencies with combating terrorism responsibilities.  We reviewed activities in 34 budgetary accounts for the agencies in our  review to determine whether the activities were consistent with OMB\u2019s  definitions of homeland security and overseas combating terrorism as  defined in OMB Circular No. A-11. We selected accounts with the most  funding for combating terrorism at each agency as well as some accounts  with smaller amounts. By reviewing the activities in these 34 accounts, we  reviewed at least 70 percent of each agency\u2019s estimated gross budget  authority related to combating terrorism activities as reported in the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request. Although we initially selected  budgetary accounts to review at DOD, we did not review these accounts  because neither DOD nor OMB maintains information on activities  conducted by DOD to combat terrorism at the account level. For  illustrative purposes, we have included a description of some of these  accounts as well as the activities funded through each account and the  related budget authority in appendix IV. We also analyzed combating  terrorism data from the database used to prepare the Budget of the United  States for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. To ensure that the database we  received was consistent with published sources, we conducted electronic  data testing and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "We conducted our work from January 2005 through November 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Appendix V contains more detailed information on our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (NDAA for  FY 1998), as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 1999 (NDAA for FY 1999) required OMB to issue both a classified and  an unclassified report on funding to combat terrorism. Under the NDAA  reporting requirements, OMB\u2019s annual report addressed funding for  combating terrorism without differentiating between homeland security  and overseas activities. However, in its 2002 unclassified report, OMB,  for the first time, explicitly distinguished between overseas combating  terrorism activities coordinated by the National Security Council and  homeland security activities coordinated by the President\u2019s Office of  Homeland Security.", "Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 repealed the NDAA  reporting requirements in favor of new reporting requirements. In  particular, section 889 required the President\u2019s budget to include an  analysis of \u201chomeland security funding,\u201d which it defined by reference to  OMB\u2019s 2002 report as activities to detect, deter, protect against, and if  needed, respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the United States.  OMB\u2019s definition of homeland security activities included activities that  the agency had not previously treated as combating terrorism.", "The 2003 annual report on combating terrorism was the last combating  terrorism report issued under the NDAA reporting requirements. OMB\u2019s  next report to Congress was published as part of the President\u2019s fiscal year  2005 budget, which was issued in February 2004 and reflected the changes  called for in that act for the first time. In its final 2003 unclassified annual  report on combating terrorism, OMB categorized the government\u2019s  homeland security activities into the six critical mission areas discussed in  the National Strategy for Homeland Security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Agencies Use Different Methodologies to Estimate How Much of the Budget Supports Combating Terrorism Activities", "paragraphs": ["The seven agencies we contacted use different methods to estimate the  portion of their authorized funding that supports combating terrorism  activities. Although OMB provides guidance to agencies, it does not  prescribe a specific methodology for how agencies should determine the  portion of their budget authority that relates to combating terrorism  activities. One agency we contacted\u2014DOD\u2014reported that OMB  determines how much of DOD\u2019s funding relates to combating terrorism.  While OMB staff said that they expect most executive agencies to provide  them with funding data related to combating terrorism activities, they said  that they make these determinations for DOD. DOD officials said that they  enter budget data into OMB\u2019s central database and then OMB staff review  the data and extract information that they find consistent with OMB\u2019s  definition of combating terrorism.", "Six of the other seven agencies we reviewed developed their own  methodologies using guidance, such as OMB Circular No. A-11, which  includes definitions for combating terrorism activities and instructions for  submitting information on funding data related to combating terrorism  activities to OMB.  Because these methodologies involve estimations,  some level of professional judgment is inherent throughout the process.  To implement these methodologies, agencies first identify their combating  terrorism activities and then estimate their related funding levels. (See  app. VI for guidance agencies most commonly use to identify combating  terrorism activities.)", "Officials from two of these six agencies\u2014GSA and DHS\u2014reported that  they used methods involving formulas to determine their funding levels  that are related to combating terrorism. Officials from GSA told us that  they use a formula-driven methodology for estimating its budget authority  for the portion of Real Property Activities within its Federal Buildings  Fund that relate to homeland security activities. To derive this  methodology, GSA officials from its Office of Budget said GSA consulted  with OMB and reviewed all activities conducted under the Federal  Buildings Fund, looked at historical trends related to homeland security  activities associated with the fund, and applied their professional  judgment. Figure 1 illustrates GSA\u2019s methodology and demonstrates how  the agency applied its methodology in estimating its fiscal year 2006  budget authority for the portion of Real Property Activities within its  Federal Buildings Fund that relate to homeland security activities.", "Officials from DHS\u2019s component offices with whom we met\u2014Customs and  Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, the Office  of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP),  the Transportation Security Administration, USCG, the United States  Secret Service (USSS), and the Science and Technology Directorate\u2014told  us that they also derived formula-driven methodologies for determining  their homeland security funding levels. For example, officials from USSS  said that they derived a quantitative methodology for determining the  portion of their appropriation for Operating Expenses that relates to  homeland security. They said that to develop this methodology, USSS  reviewed all of its programs, activities, and related staff hours conducted  under its two missions\u2014Protective Services and Investigative Services\u2014 to determine those activities that related to homeland security. See figure  2 for the USSS methodology.", "USSS officials told us that they discussed their methodology with OMB  and received OMB\u2019s approval to implement it. USSS officials told us that  they have been using this methodology to estimate the portion of their  operating expenses budget authority related to homeland security since  2003.", "The other four agencies\u2014DOE, USDA, USACE, and DOJ\u2014reported having  methodologies in place to determine their funding levels for combating  terrorism activities that are less formula driven. For example, using the  definitions contained in OMB Circular No. A-11, a DOE official told us that  DOE personnel review the agency\u2019s programs and activities to determine  which are related to homeland security or overseas combating terrorism.  Then, a DOE official consults with OMB to determine whether OMB would  like the agency to make any revisions to the activities it has designated as  combating terrorism. Once DOE finalizes its determination that an activity  is categorized as a combating terrorism activity, 100 percent of that  activity\u2019s budget authority is attributed to combating terrorism.  Additionally, officials from the component offices in USDA we met with\u2014 the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the  Agricultural Research Service (ARS)\u2014told us that they used qualitative  methods for determining their homeland security funding levels. For  example, APHIS officials said that they developed a set of six questions to  determine whether their activities relate to homeland security. In  reviewing these activities, APHIS officials told us that if any of the  questions in figure 3 apply, they will consider the activity related to  homeland security, and then 100 percent of that activity\u2019s budget authority  will be attributed to homeland security.", "In addition to estimating funding levels for combating terrorism activities,  OMB also requires agencies to align their homeland security activities with  the critical mission areas in the National Strategy for Homeland Security.  Officials at four of the six agencies we visited that estimate their  combating terrorism funding levels said that they used their professional  judgment to determine which critical mission area best aligns with their  homeland security activities by comparing those activities with the  definitions of the national strategy\u2019s critical mission areas.", "As previously discussed, to estimate funding levels, agencies first identify  their combating terrorism activities. Officials at two of the six agencies we  contacted said that activities with multiple or dual purposes pose a  particular challenge to them when determining their combating terrorism  activities because they must apply professional judgment to determine  which purpose to emphasize. As a result, determining funding levels for  combating terrorism activities and aligning homeland security activities to  critical mission areas cannot be precise. For example, as previously noted,  GSA officials told us that they conduct upgrades to buildings\u2019 fire alarm  enhancement systems that could be used to alert employees to a fire.  However, these officials also said the same system could also be used to  alert employees to stay in the building in the event of a terrorist attack.  Consequently, GSA cannot definitively categorize its fire alarm  enhancement systems as a homeland security activity because the efforts  within this activity are not exclusively related to homeland security. DHS  officials also reported facing similar challenges. For example, SLGCP has  multi-use grants that could be used for both combating terrorism and  other goals. SLGCP staff cited the fact that the chemical protection suits  provided under the Firefighter Assistance Grant program could be used in  the field for a fuel spill or for a terrorist incident such as a dirty bomb.  Consequently, DHS believes the process of categorizing combating  terrorism activities is an estimation exercise, for which the department\u2019s  staff must apply their professional judgment.", "Furthermore, agency officials at three agencies we visited said that an  additional challenge in determining whether an activity should be  considered a combating terrorism activity involves interpreting OMB\u2019s  combating terrorism definitions. For example, a DOE official told us that it  can be problematic to categorize activities that are associated with the  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program such as efforts to assist the  Russians in converting surplus plutonium into fuel for commercial  reactors. After its conversion, this material is no longer suitable for use in  a nuclear weapon. Although the argument could be made that the  program\u2019s eventual effect may be to take potential ammunition away from  future terrorists, the amount spent in Russia for the conversion to fuel of  already well protected materials is not reported as combating terrorism.  DOE cites this as one example of the fact that the decision of whether an  activity is considered combating terrorism or non-combating terrorism is a  judgment call based on interpretation of the definition.", "Agencies in our review manage the process of estimating funding levels for  combating terrorism activities through OMB oversight and supervisory  review. According to OMB, the responsibility of ensuring that homeland  security activities are properly categorized is a joint effort made by OMB  and the agencies involved. For their part, OMB staff perform reviews of  activities determined to be related to homeland security to ensure that  they are in accordance with the homeland security definition. OMB staff  told us that there is no written guidance for such a review. Instead, OMB  staff rely on the definition in OMB Circular No. A-11 and their judgment to  decide if the activity has been reasonably categorized.", "OMB staff said that they currently do not review agency estimates of  funding data for overseas combating terrorism activities because OMB is  no longer required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding  data. Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 repealed the  NDAA reporting requirements in favor of new reporting requirements. The  section 889 reporting requirement applies only to homeland security  activities, not overseas activities related to combating terrorism.  Although OMB still collects overseas combating terrorism funding data,  OMB staff said that they have not reviewed or validated this information  since fiscal year 2003. As a result, the overseas combating terrorism data  for fiscal years 2004\u20132006 has not received the same level of scrutiny as  the homeland security data. Similarly, without any future legislative  action, OMB does not plan to review or validate future funding estimates  related to overseas combating terrorism activities. As a result, Congress  does not receive reports on both the homeland security and overseas  combating terrorism portions of combating terrorism funding.", "In addition to reviewing homeland security data, OMB also reports taking  steps to ensure that agencies have properly aligned their homeland  security activities with the six critical mission areas outlined in the  National Strategy for Homeland Security. OMB staff told us that  annually, they examine the activities agencies aligned with each critical  mission area to ensure consistency across all federal agencies and  determine if the activities have been properly aligned based on the  definitions of the critical mission areas in the National Strategy for  Homeland Security. Such alignments can help inform congressional  decision makers about the amount of funding that has been allocated to  any one critical mission area.", "In addition to undertaking the previously mentioned reviews, each year  since 2002, OMB has provided agencies with an opportunity to make  changes to the activities they report as homeland security. In fiscal year  2005, OMB formalized this process by asking agencies to complete a form  outlining the agency\u2019s proposed changes prior to official submission of  annual budget requests. OMB staff said that OMB\u2019s examiners use the  definition for homeland security in its Circular No. A-11 to review each  agency\u2019s request, and then the examiners discuss the agencies\u2019 request  with staff from OMB\u2019s Homeland Security Branch, as well as the agency to  decide if the activity has been reasonably categorized.", "Officials at all six of the agencies we contacted who make their own  determinations of funding related to combating terrorism reported having  controls in place to help ensure that the agency\u2019s combating terrorism  activities are appropriately identified and categorized as either homeland  security or overseas combating terrorism. For example, DHS officials said  that DHS budget desk officers within the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s Budget  Division review activities its components recommend as combating  terrorism and check for activities that may have been categorized  incorrectly. Then, another budget desk officer, within the same division,  reviews the data for unusual fluctuations or trends. If necessary, the  budget desk officer and component representatives are to contact OMB to  resolve any potential disagreements. After agencies submit information to  OMB, OMB program examiners review the data and approve the activities  or request the agencies to make revisions according to their instruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Three Recommendations Could Provide Additional Information for Budget Decisions and Understanding of Performance", "paragraphs": ["OMB has not implemented three recommendations from our 2002 report  that would have and still could provide OMB and Congress with additional  information for making budget decisions and help them understand  performance results. In our 2002 report, we recommended that OMB  require agencies to provide information on obligations in the database  used by OMB to produce the President\u2019s annual budget request\u2014and that  OMB should include obligations as reported in this database in its annual  report on combating terrorism. We made this recommendation to help  Congress obtain information on spending that supports the President\u2019s  annual budget request related to combating terrorism activities and to  provide decision makers with insights as to whether programs are being  run according to plans established by their budget projections. Without  including obligation data in the Analytical Perspectives, along with funding  levels authorized by Congress for agencies\u2019 homeland security activities, it  is difficult for decision makers to know (1) how much funding from prior  years is still available to potentially reduce new spending requests,   (2) whether the rate of spending for a program is slower than anticipated,  or (3) what the level of effort (i.e., size of the program) is for a particular  year as well as for a program over time.", "OMB staff told us that OMB has not substantially changed its position on  this recommendation since we published our 2002 report. OMB staff  continue to cite the effort required to produce such data. While OMB staff  acknowledged that OMB examiners use obligation data in assessing the  appropriateness of agency budget requests overall, they have felt that  budget authority data provide the most insight into combating terrorism  programs and facilitate follow up on areas of concern. OMB staff also said  that including obligation information in its funding analysis is not  necessary because at the end of the fiscal year, most agencies with  homeland security activities have already obligated the majority of their  budget authority. However, OMB staff also said that they might consider  reporting obligation information for a targeted set of accounts that receive  multiyear funding and might carry balances for homeland security  programs from year to year, unlike the majority of accounts that receive  funding with only 1 year of availability. A conservative analysis suggests  that unobligated balances associated with funding for homeland security  activities for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 could be between $2 billion  and $3.4 billion. Although it would be important to understand how  agencies plan to use these balances, information on what funding is  unobligated\u2014and in which accounts\u2014is potentially useful for  congressional deliberations on the President\u2019s budget request. We  recognize that collecting these data would create an additional workload  for both OMB and agency budget officials, but we continue to believe that  such an effort is warranted for congressional oversight because of the high  priority placed on combating terrorism. Therefore, we continue to believe  that our prior recommendation on this issue from our 2002 report is  relevant and should be implemented.", "Similarly, implementation of our 2002 recommendation that OMB direct  relevant departments to develop or enhance combating terrorism  performance goals and measures and include such measures in the  governmentwide plan would assist in determining whether funding  increases have improved performance results.", "Although three of the seven agencies in our review told us that OMB did  not direct them to develop performance measures for combating  terrorism, OMB staff said that they are working with agencies on the  development of combating terrorism performance measures at the agency  level, primarily with DHS. OMB staff also said that they have not yet taken  any action to prepare measures on a governmentwide basis. Additionally,  OMB has not yet prepared a governmentwide plan that could include such  measures related to combating terrorism. OMB staff said that the  Homeland Security Council\u2014which provides advice to the President on  homeland security issues\u2014DHS, and OMB are coordinating and planning  for the future development of governmentwide performance measures  related to combating terrorism. However, OMB staff said that they have  not yet established a timeline for developing such measures.", "Implementation of our 2002 recommendation to include national-level and  federal governmentwide combating terrorism performance measures as a  supplement to existing strategies and their future revisions would help to  assess and improve preparedness at the federal and national levels. As  previously discussed, federal governmentwide performance measures  related to combating terrorism have not yet been developed. Moreover,  there have been no supplements or revisions to the existing national  strategies that include federal governmentwide or national-level  combating terrorism performance goals and measures. Without goals and  measures from the federal and national levels, it is difficult to organize a  coordinated and effective combating terrorism effort. Because numerous  agencies are responsible for combating terrorism, federal governmentwide  performance planning could better facilitate the integration of federal and  national activities to achieve federal goals in that they could provide a  cohesive perspective on the goals of the federal government. Furthermore,  without governmentwide combating terrorism goals and measures, the  Administration does not have an effective means of articulating to  Congress or the American people the governmentwide accomplishments  related to combating terrorism.", "While OMB has not yet developed governmentwide performance goals and  measures, OMB established a formal assessment tool for the budget  formulation process in fiscal year 2002\u2014the Program Assessment Rating  Tool to help measure program performance. However, OMB has not yet  completed all PART reviews for programs that relate to combating  terrorism activities, or done a crosscutting combating terrorism or  homeland security PART review that could address the appropriateness of  performance measures in the larger context. In our recommendation from  an earlier report, we stated that targeting PART could help focus decision  makers\u2019 attention on the most pressing policy and program issues.  Furthermore, we recommended that such an approach could facilitate the  use of PART assessments to review the relative contributions of similar  programs to common or crosscutting goals and outcomes.", "It is critical that the federal government, as the steward of the taxpayers\u2019  money, ensure that such funds are managed to maximize results.", "Governmentwide combating terrorism performance measures that support  the national strategies would allow the Administration and Congress to  more effectively assess the federal government\u2019s progress in combating  terrorism initiatives, and better determine how effectively the government  is using valuable resources. Furthermore, they would provide a more  effective means of holding agencies accountable for achieving results.", "Notwithstanding a lack of progress in developing governmentwide  performance measures, some agencies have performance goals and  measures that reflect priorities for combating terrorism. Performance  measures can provide information on many things, such as outputs, which  provide the number of activities, and outcomes, which demonstrate  achievement of intended results. Four of the seven agencies we  contacted\u2014DHS, DOE, USDA, and DOJ\u2014 developed performance  measures for combating terrorism activities as part of their efforts under  the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). An  example of a DOE output performance measure, designed to help achieve  its goal of protecting National Nuclear Security Administration personnel,  facilities, and nuclear weapons is as follows: \u201cReplace, upgrade, re-certify  15 percent of emergency response equipment by 2009.\u201d", "To help DHS evaluate its efforts related to preventing entry of  unauthorized individuals and those that pose a threat to the nation, DHS  created the following performance measure: \u201cDetermine the percentage of  foreign nationals entering the United States who have biometric and  biographic information on file prior to entry, including the foreign  nationals who are referred for further inspection actions and with  fraudulent documents identified.\u201d This is an output-related performance  measure that provides information about the number of foreign nationals  who enter the country requiring further inspection.", "Under GPRA, virtually every executive agency is required to develop  strategic plans covering a period of at least 5 years forward from the fiscal  year in which it is submitted and to update those plans at least every   3 years. Under this act, strategic plans are the starting point for agencies to  set annual performance goals and to measure program performance in  achieving those goals. Although GPRA does not specifically require  executive agencies to develop strategic plans related to combating  terrorism, DOD has initiated efforts to develop strategic plans that  incorporate performance measures for combating terrorism. In response  to our previous recommendation that DOD develop a framework for the  antiterrorism program that would provide the department with a vehicle to  guide resource allocations and measure the results of improvement  efforts, DOD developed an Antiterrorism Strategic Plan. This  preliminary framework includes, among other things, a collective effort to  defend against, respond to, and mitigate terrorist attacks aimed at DOD  personnel. According to DOD officials, the strategic goals established in  DOD\u2019s Antiterrorism Strategic Plan directly align with OMB\u2019s definitions of  homeland security and overseas combating terrorism. One of DOD\u2019s  strategic goals is to conduct effective antiterrorism training and execute  realistic antiterrorism exercises. DOD officials reported that they intend to  collect antiterrorism performance data from all DOD components and plan  to issue the first performance report on antiterrorism in the second  quarter of fiscal year 2006. While we have not yet fully evaluated the  effectiveness of this framework or plan, such efforts represent important  steps taken by an agency to develop performance measures and,  consequently, a results-oriented management framework specifically  related to combating terrorism activities.", "Currently, because governmentwide performance measures have not been  developed, the executive branch does not have a means to effectively  measure and link resources expended and performance achieved related  to combating terrorism efforts on a governmentwide basis. Without a clear  understanding of this linkage, the executive branch and Congress may be  missing opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency to ensure the  best use of taxpayer funds. Therefore, we continue to believe that our  prior recommendations on this issue from our 2002 report are important  and should be implemented.", "In our 2002 report, we also made recommendations to OMB concerning an  analysis of duplication of effort related to combating terrorism activities  and the timely reporting of information to support congressional budget  deliberations. Our November 2002 report was issued concurrently with the  enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which repealed OMB\u2019s  prior reporting requirements, including the duplication analysis, and  accelerated the timeline for OMB to report funding data on homeland  security activities. The status of these recommendations is discussed  further in appendix VII."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the recent emphasis on and significance of combating terrorism,  Congress should have the best available funding information to assist in its  oversight role. Since the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,  OMB has not been required to report on overseas combating terrorism  data. Moreover, OMB staff said that funding data for overseas combating  terrorism activities do not receive the same level of scrutiny as funding  data for homeland security activities. Thus, the quality of the overseas  combating terrorism data may degrade over time.

Although  fiscal year 2001 may seem like the logical starting point, fiscal year 2002  was the first full year in which decision making was informed by the  terrorist attacks in the United States. Moreover, to make information  comparable for the President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request, the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) restructured fiscal years 2002 and 2003  budget data to reflect changes that occurred with the creation of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003. This made fiscal year  2002 the earliest year that OMB\u2019s MAX database captured funding for  combating terrorism that is, for the most part, in the current agency,  bureau, and account structure. In addition, OMB for the first time  required agencies to identify funding for homeland security and overseas  combating terrorism separately from other funding in an account. Finally,  fiscal year 2002 marked the earliest year in which OMB presented  information organized according to the National Strategy for Homeland  Security\u2019s six critical mission areas in its Annual Report to Congress on  Combating Terrorism (September 2003).", "The information for homeland security and overseas combating terrorism  (OCT) is shown separately in the following tables. Tables 1 to 3 provide  information on homeland security at progressively finer levels of detail.  However, none of these tables, or tables 4 and 5 include funding in fiscal  years 2004 and 2005 for DHS\u2019 Project BioShield. OMB asserts that  including this information can distort year-over-year comparisons. The  Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004 provided $5.6 billion for  this project to develop and procure tools to address public health  consequences of terrorism. Pursuant to that act, specific amounts became  available in fiscal year 2004 ($0.9 billion) and in fiscal year 2005   ($2.5 billion). Tables 4 and 5 display how OMB and agencies characterize  funding according to the six critical mission areas for homeland security.", "Unlike the appropriations account structure, which is based in law,  mission area categories and activities can be modified to meet changing  needs. OMB has stated that \u201cthe Administration may refine definitions or  mission area estimates over time based on additional analysis or changes  in the way specific activities are characterized, aggregated, or  disaggregated.\u201d Tables 6 and 7 provide unpublished OMB data on OCT.  According to OMB officials, they continue to collect these data from  agencies, but do not review agency information since OMB is no longer  required to report on overseas combating terrorism funding or activities.", "All comparisons or trends are for fiscal years 2002 through 2005.

The department\u2019s average annual funding has  been $22.1 billion, or about 54 percent of the total amount available  annually from fiscal years 2002 through 2005.

OMB then reviewed  and validated these amounts\u2014along with funding associated with  homeland security activities\u2014and published them in its annual report on  combating terrorism. However, the Homeland Security Act of 2002  required that only funding related to homeland security activities be  reported. Thus, while OMB continues to collect information on funding  associated with overseas combating terrorism activities, it reported that  the overseas combating terrorism data for fiscal years 2004 through 2006  have not been reviewed or validated.

Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  repealed the NDAA reporting requirements in favor of new reporting  requirements. In particular, section 889 required the President\u2019s budget to  include an analysis of \u201chomeland security funding,\u201d which it defined by  reference to OMB\u2019s 2002 report as activities to detect, deter, protect  against, and if needed, respond to terrorist attacks occurring within the  United States. OMB's definition of homeland security activities included  activities that the agency had not previously treated as combating  terrorism. Under section 889, OMB is required to report only on funding  for homeland security by agency, budget function (i.e., functions that  cover 17 areas of the government such as agriculture and health), and  initiative areas. OMB staff said that although they do not report on  funding related to overseas combating terrorism data, they still collect it as  part of the annual budget. Because there is no longer a requirement to  report on overseas combating terrorism funding data, OMB staff said that  they are not reviewing the information that agencies provide to them. In  addition, the definition of overseas combating terrorism activities in OMB  Circular No. A-11 has not changed since 2003. As a result, OMB staff said  that data on overseas combating terrorism funding data are not necessarily  valid and could be misleading.", "In response to section 889\u2019s changes, OMB began showing homeland  security funding data by agency, by budget function, by account, and by  each of the six critical mission areas established in the National Strategy  for Homeland Security in the Analytical Perspectives of the President\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 budget. OMB also included narrative descriptions of major  activities and the administration\u2019s priorities in this section of the  Analytical Perspectives. To present funding data for homeland security  activities by critical mission area, OMB included a table for each critical  mission area displaying budget authority for 3 fiscal years (prior year,  current year, and budget year request).", "Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act also required OMB to include  the most recent risk assessment and summary of homeland security needs  in each initiative area in the President\u2019s annual budget. OMB\u2019s prior  reporting requirements required that OMB report on the amounts  expended by executive agencies on combating terrorism activities, as well  as the specific programs and activities for which funds were expended,  while section 889 explicitly mandates a risk assessment and summary of  resource needs in each initiative area. According to OMB staff, OMB does  not have the expertise or the staff to conduct separate risk assessments,  and it relies on the risk assessments of each individual agency to  determine areas of high risk in order to meet this requirement.", "In addition, section 889 required that OMB include in the President\u2019s  annual budget an estimate of the user fees collected by the federal  government to help offset expenses related to homeland security  activities, such as the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s passenger  security fees, which are added to airline passengers\u2019 ticket costs. To meet  this requirement, OMB included a table for users\u2019 fees by major cabinet- level department displaying the related budget authority in the Analytical  Perspectives that accompanied the President\u2019s fiscal years 2005 and 2006  budgets.", "Finally, section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 accelerated the  timeline for reporting funding data by requiring OMB to report funding  data in the President\u2019s budget, which must be submitted to Congress by  the first Monday in February. Under its previous reporting requirement,  OMB was required to issue a separate stand-alone report on combating  terrorism to Congress by March 1 of each year. OMB complied with the  new timeline for the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 President\u2019s budget.", "Despite these changes, OMB staff report still facing challenges in tracking  activities related to combating terrorism funding data and ensuring the  transparency of related funding data. OMB staff said that the creation of  DHS helped minimize the difficulties they face in ensuring the  transparency of related funding data and tracking activities related to  combating terrorism, since the creation of DHS resulted in approximately  60 percent of homeland security funding being merged into funding for  one agency at the time DHS became operational. Although OMB is no  longer required to report on funding data related to overseas combating  terrorism activities, OMB staff said that many of the difficulties cited in  our 2002 report still apply and that they will most likely always face these  challenges. For example, OMB staff reported that they are still challenged  by the large number of agencies involved in combating terrorism activities.  To obtain information needed to fulfill its reporting requirements related  to funding data, OMB has to interact with 32 other agencies and the  District of Columbia that have responsibilities to combat terrorism in  addition to DHS. OMB staff also said that it will always require significant  effort to identify funding for combating terrorism activities, since such  funding is often subsumed in budget accounts that provide funding for  other activities. In addition, OMB staff also stated that they were  challenged in tracking funding related to combating terrorism, given the  wide variety of missions represented, including intelligence, law  enforcement, health services, and environmental protection, as well as the  global nature of missions for combating terrorism. However, OMB staff  told us that they have worked diligently to identify homeland security  activities by monitoring agency reviews of homeland security spending  and developing an annual crosscut review, which identifies projects with  common themes across agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: A Summary of Selected Accounts with Combating Terrorism Activities", "paragraphs": ["Hundreds of budget accounts include activities related to combating  terrorism.

In addition, we met  with 7 agencies, including 12 directorates, offices, or bureaus at those  agencies that reported receiving funding for combating terrorism  activities. The seven agencies we contacted are the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the United States Army  Corps of Engineers, the Department of Justice, the Department of Energy,  the General Services Administration, and the United Stated Department of  Agriculture.", "To reflect a range of funding levels, we selected these agencies from 33  agencies and the District of Columbia that reported receiving funding  related to combating terrorism activities to OMB. We selected DHS and  DOD because they account for 73 percent of the gross budget authority  enacted for homeland security activities for fiscal year 2005, and DOD and  DOE because they account for 69 percent of the gross budget authority  enacted for overseas combating terrorism activities for fiscal year 2005.  We also selected four agencies: two agencies from a list of those with the  most fiscal year 2005 budget dollars related to combating terrorism  activities\u2014USDA and DOJ\u2014and two agencies from a list of those with the  least enacted budget authority related to combating terrorism activities\u2014 GSA and USACE\u2014to ensure we included agencies in our review that had a  range of combating terrorism funding. Because the selection we used was  a nonprobability sample, the information we obtained from these 7  agencies is not generalizable to all agencies with similar funding for  combating terrorism activities.", "We used a random sample number generator to select USDA, DOJ, GSA,  and USACE from the two categories we established, that is, agencies that  were moderately funded and those that were minimally funded. We  excluded DOD, DHS, and DOE when performing the random number  generation, since we had already included them in our selection. (We also  excluded the Postal Service because it did not estimate receiving any  funding to combat terrorism activities in fiscal year 2006 and 10 other  agencies that each received less than 0.1 percent of combating terrorism  dollars\u2014to ensure that our analysis included the more significant of the  minimally funded agencies).", "Within the seven agencies, we selected directorates or offices that  received the most funding for combating terrorism activities. These  included the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the  Agricultural Research Service, within USDA; Customs and Border  Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Information  Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, the Office of State and  Local Government Coordination and Preparedness, the Transportation  Security Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the United States  Secret Service, and the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS; the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation of DOJ.", "We also reviewed the activities contained in 34 budgetary accounts\u2014 separate financial reporting units for which all transactions within the  budget are recorded\u2014for these agencies designated as related to  combating terrorism. We selected accounts with the most combating  terrorism funding at each agency as well as some accounts with smaller  amounts to ensure we covered a range of funding. On the basis of our  selection, we reviewed at least 70 percent of each agency\u2019s estimated gross  budget authority related to combating terrorism activities as reported in  the President\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget request. While we initially selected  an additional 23 budgetary accounts to review at DOD, we did not review  these accounts because DOD does not enter its combating terrorism  activities\u2014specific lines of work\u2014into OMB\u2019s Homeland Security and  Overseas Combating Terrorism database. Although OMB computed the  portion of budget authority DOD receives to combat terrorism and aligned  DOD\u2019s budget authority related to homeland security with the six critical  mission areas, OMB staff said that they did not enter information on  activities conducted by DOD to combat terrorism. Thus, we did not have  any activity level-information to review for DOD for the accounts we  selected.", "We interviewed agency officials at the seven agencies included in our  review and OMB to determine how they identified, categorized, and  tracked homeland security and overseas combating terrorism activities  and estimated the portion of their budget authority that relates to such  activities. To supplement interviews with agency budget officials, we also  reviewed relevant budget documentation from each agency and asked  agency budget officials to describe procedures the agency had in place to  ensure that their funding levels were developed in accordance with OMB\u2019s  guidelines and definitions.", "To identify the status of recommendations from our November 2002  report, we met with OMB and attempted to meet with National Security  Council (NSC) officials to document what actions have been taken to  implement our recommendations and the reasons they did or did not  implement them. Additionally, we reviewed the National Strategy for  Combating Terrorism, the National Strategy for Homeland Security, and  the National Security Strategy of the United States and conducted a  literature search to determine if any updates or supplements had been  written that included governmentwide performance goals and measures.  We also interviewed agency officials at the seven agencies included in our  review and reviewed their performance plans to determine whether these  plans included performance goals and measures that reflected their  combating terrorism activities. To determine the status of  recommendations made in our 2002 report regarding an analysis of  duplication of effort related to combating terrorism activities in annual  reporting on funding data associated with such activities and to report this  information in a timely manner to support congressional budget decisions,  we met with OMB to determine what actions have been taken to  implement our recommendations and the reasons it did or did not  implement them. We also reviewed the Analytical Perspectives  accompanying the President\u2019s fiscal years 2005 and 2006 budgets to  determine whether or not OMB included funding data information on  combating terrorism and whether this information was issued in a timely  manner.", "In addition to pursuing our two main objectives, we also identified funding  patterns and trends for overseas combating terrorism activities and for  homeland security activities between fiscal year 2002 and what is  proposed for fiscal year 2006. We extracted, summarized, and analyzed  combating terrorism data from the database used to prepare the Budget of  the United States for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. To ensure that the  database we received was consistent with published sources, we  conducted electronic data testing and determined that the data was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We also analyzed the effects of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 on  reporting requirements for funding data related to combating terrorism  activities since our 2002 report by reviewing the act and comparing it with  prior reporting requirements under the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 1998 as amended by the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.

Officials at all five of these agencies  said they use OMB Circular No. A-11, which includes definitions for  homeland security and overseas combating terrorism activities, and  instructions for submitting information on funding data related to  homeland security and overseas combating terrorism to OMB. In addition,  officials from four of the seven agencies in our review reported that they  consulted with OMB to determine which of their agency\u2019s activities are  related to combating terrorism.", "Three of the seven agencies we contacted\u2014DHS, USDA, and the United  States Army Corps of Engineers\u2014have developed additional guidance,  which provides details specific to each agency to help determine  combating terrorism activities. For example, to supplement OMB Circular  A-11 guidance, DHS established an internal directive, Planning,  Programming, Budgeting and Execution, which helps establish policy,  procedures, and responsibilities relative to the planning, programming,  budgeting, and execution process at DHS. The objective of the directive is  to articulate DHS\u2019s goals, objectives, and priorities while guiding the  development of the department\u2019s budget request and establishing  parameters and guidelines for implementing and executing the current  budget.", "Furthermore, officials in four of DHS\u2019s components told us that they refer  to information included in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to determine  which of their activities relate to homeland security. For example, section  888 of the Homeland Security Act designated 5 of the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s  11 missions as homeland security and the remaining 6 as non-homeland  security. Similarly, Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  (IAIP) officials at DHS stated that they categorized all of their activities as  related to homeland security, since section 201 of the Homeland Security  Act of 2002 only authorized IAIP to conduct activities related to homeland  security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Status of 2002 Recommendations Related to Duplication of Effort and Timely Reporting of Funding Data", "paragraphs": ["This appendix discusses the status of recommendations made in our 2002  report for the Office of Management and Budget to (1) include an analysis  of duplication of effort related to combating terrorism activities in its  annual reporting of funding data associated with such activities and   (2) report this information in a timely manner to support congressional  budget decisions.", "To improve the usefulness of OMB\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on  Combating Terrorism, we recommended that OMB include, as required by  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, an analysis of  areas where overlap in programs could result in unnecessary duplication  of effort. We also recommended that OMB publish the report by the  required annual March 1 deadline to provide information in time for  congressional budget deliberations.", "Although OMB has not implemented our recommendation that it include  an analysis of unnecessary duplication of effort in its annual combating  terrorism report, this requirement no longer exists. Our November 2002  report was issued concurrently with the enactment of the Homeland  Security Act of 2002. Section 889 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  repealed OMB\u2019s prior reporting requirements, including the duplication  analysis.", "OMB staff stated that they did not include an analysis of duplication in any  of the agency\u2019s prior reports primarily because they perform an analysis of  homeland security initiatives and related resource needs across all federal  agencies as part of the annual budget preparation process, and that they  take action to address duplication prior to the publication of the  President\u2019s budget. Therefore, OMB staff said that they believe any issue  of duplication is addressed in the President\u2019s budget, specifically through  his recommendations related to funding needs.", "Our recommendation that OMB improve the usefulness of its Annual  Report to Congress on Combating Terrorism by publishing the report by  the then-required March 1 annual deadline was also superseded by section  889 of the Homeland Security Act. This section requires that OMB report  on funding data for homeland security activities in the President\u2019s budget.  Because the President must submit his budget by the first Monday in  February, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 accelerated the timeline for  reporting funding data on homeland security activities.
