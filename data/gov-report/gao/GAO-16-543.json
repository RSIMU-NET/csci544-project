This occurred because Industrial Operations performed less work (i.e., earned less revenue) than orders accepted due to staff reductions of more than 5,000 over the 2-year period for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 caused by budgetary uncertainty and the across-the-board spending reductions referred to as sequestration. GAO also determined that the Army did not correctly calculate the allowable carryover amounts for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 as specified by the Department of Defense (DOD) Financial Management Regulation because the Army did not use the most recent data available to perform the calculations. Based on GAO's calculations, Industrial Operations exceeded the allowable amounts by $44 million less in fiscal year 2013 and $27 million more in fiscal year 2014 than reported.", "Industrial Operations' actual adjusted carryover also significantly exceeded budgeted adjusted carryover from fiscal years 2013 through 2015. While its budgeted adjusted carryover would have been under the allowable amount by $174 million and $1.2 billion for fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively, and over the allowable amount by $186 million for fiscal year 2015, the actual adjusted carryover amount exceeded the allowable amounts all 3 fiscal years because Industrial Operations (1) accepted more new orders than budgeted and (2) performed less work (earned less revenue) than budgeted.", "To address budget concerns, the Army has implemented actions intended to improve budget information. However, Industrial Operations has not been able to provide reliable budget information on carryover to decision makers from fiscal years 2013 through 2015.", "GAO identified four key drivers for large Industrial Operations carryover balances: (1) work was scheduled to carry over at the end of the fiscal year as part of the normal course of business, (2) work on crash-damaged aircraft was difficult to predict and required nonstandard repairs that necessitated long lead time parts to perform the work, (3) work did not have a well-defined scope of work for repairing the assets, and (4) parts were not available to perform work. The Army is taking actions to reduce carryover. One of those actions is to develop a regulation that consolidates and updates guidance for Industrial Operations. However, this regulation has not yet been completed, issued, and implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD improve the budgeting and management for carryover by establishing procedures for correctly calculating the allowable carryover, improving budget estimates on carryover, and addressing in its draft regulation scope of work and parts issues that affect carryover.

Ordnance services include  manufacturing, renovating, and demilitarizing munitions and components.  From fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015, the annual dollar amount  of new orders to perform this work ranged from $4.5 billion to $5.4 billion.  Many of these military assets and munitions were used to support the  Army\u2019s efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "When Army Industrial Operations (referred to as Industrial Operations in  this report) work has been ordered and funded (obligated) by customers  (such as the military services) but has not been completed by the end of a  fiscal year, it is referred to as carryover. The Department of Defense  (DOD) Financial Management Regulation establishes the formula to be  used for calculating and determining the amount of carryover allowed at  the end of each fiscal year, which is based in part on the amount of new  orders from customers. The congressional defense committees have  recognized that some carryover is appropriate to facilitate a smooth flow  of work during the transition from one fiscal year to the next. However,  past congressional defense committee reports have noted that the level  of carryover in military service working capital funds may be more than is  needed. Too much carryover could result in the working capital fund  receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the  work until well into the next fiscal year or later. Further, excessive  amounts of carryover may result in future appropriations or budget  requests being subject to reductions by DOD and the congressional  defense committees during the budget review process. For example,  according to the explanatory statement accompanying DOD\u2019s fiscal year  2013 appropriations, congressional conferees agreed to reduce Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fiscal year 2013 operation and  maintenance appropriations by a total of $332.3 million because of  concerns about excess carryover.", "You asked us to review issues related to Industrial Operations carryover.

We analyzed carryover since fiscal year 2013  because we previously reported on Industrial Operations carryover from  fiscal years 2006 through 2012. We met with responsible officials from  the Army to determine the reasons for any variances between (1) actual  carryover and the allowable amount of carryover and (2) budgeted and  actual carryover. We also met with these officials to discuss actions the  Army was taking to improve budgeting and management of carryover,  including the reduction of actual carryover amounts. Further, we identified  and analyzed any adjustments made by the Army that increased the  allowable carryover amounts or reduced the amount of actual carryover.  We reviewed DOD\u2019s guidance for granting exceptions to the carryover  policy and discussed any exceptions with officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Army headquarters to  obtain explanations for the exceptions.", "To address the third objective, we met with responsible officials from  Army headquarters, Army Materiel Command, and Army depots to  identify contributing factors that led to carryover. We focused on carryover  balances for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 to identify current issues  contributing to carryover. We also performed walk-throughs of four Army  depot maintenance operations to observe the work being performed and  discussed with officials the causes for workload carrying over from one  fiscal year to the next. Further, to corroborate the information provided by  Army officials, we obtained and analyzed a total of 80 customer orders  consisting of the 40 orders that had the largest dollar amounts of  carryover at the end of each of fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Carryover  amounts associated with these orders represented 31 percent of the total  carryover each year collectively at the four Army depots we visited for  fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We also interviewed officials and obtained  documentation on the actions the Army is taking to better manage and  reduce carryover.", "We obtained the financial and logistical data in this report from official  budget documents and the Army\u2019s logistical system.

Operating under the working capital fund concept, Industrial Operations is  intended to (1) generate sufficient resources to cover the full costs of its  operations and (2) operate on a break-even basis over time. Customers,  such as the Army, use appropriated funds (typically operation and  maintenance or procurement appropriations) to finance orders placed  with Industrial Operations. When an Industrial Operations activity accepts  a customer order, the amount of the order is obligated on the customer\u2019s  records. Upon accepting the order, the Industrial Operations activity can  start work on the order, such as beginning the work and ordering the  material or parts needed to perform the work.", "Industrial Operations provides the Army an in-house industrial capability  to (1) conduct depot-level maintenance, repair, and upgrade; (2) produce  munitions and large-caliber weapons; and (3) store, maintain, and  demilitarize material for DOD. Industrial Operations comprises 13  government-owned and government-operated activities, each with unique  core competencies: five maintenance depots (Anniston, Alabama; Corpus  Christi, Texas; Letterkenny, Pennsylvania; Red River, Texas; and  Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania), three arsenals (Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Rock  Island, Illinois; and Watervliet, New York), two munitions production  facilities (Crane, Indiana, and McAlester, Oklahoma), and three storage  sites (Blue Grass, Kentucky; Sierra, California; and Tooele, Utah).

Industrial Operations activities report under the  direct command and control of the Army\u2019s Life Cycle Management  Commands (LCMC), with each activity aligned in accordance with the  nature of its mission. For example, the work performed at Anniston and  Red River is aligned with the Army\u2019s Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command LCMC mission of developing, acquiring, fielding, and  sustaining ground systems, such as the Mine Resistant Ambush  Protected vehicles and Abrams tank. The work performed at Letterkenny  and Corpus Christi is aligned with the Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile  Command LCMC mission of developing, acquiring, fielding, and  sustaining aviation, missile, and unmanned vehicle systems, such as the  Patriot missile and Black Hawk helicopter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Carryover and Its Use", "paragraphs": ["When Industrial Operations work has been ordered and funded  (obligated) by customers but has not been completed at the end of a  fiscal year, it is referred to as carryover.

For example, if customers do not place orders  at the beginning of the fiscal year because of uncertainty about their full- year appropriations, carryover is necessary to ensure that Industrial  Operations\u2019 activities (1) have enough work to continue operations into  the new fiscal year and (2) retain the appropriate number of personnel  with sufficient skill sets to perform depot maintenance work. Too little  carryover could result in inefficient use of resources with some personnel  not having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the  other hand, too much carryover could result in the working capital fund  accepting orders from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the  work until well into the next fiscal year or later. Further, excessive  amounts of carryover may result in future appropriations or budget  requests being subject to reductions by DOD and the congressional  defense committees during the budget review process.

For  example, customer orders financed with a specific appropriation total  $100. If the outlay rate for this appropriation is 60 percent, then the  working capital fund activity group is allowed to carry over $40 (i.e., $100  -  = $40). The DOD carryover policy further provides  that for orders funded with non-procurement appropriations, work on the  current fiscal year\u2019s orders is expected to be completed by the end of the  following fiscal year.

The  guidance directed the Army components to immediately freeze hiring  of civilian personnel with the exception of those for mission-critical  activities, terminate the employment of temporary employees  consistent with mission requirements, consider the possibility of  furloughs, review contract workforce levels for potential adjustment in  accordance with critical mission requirements, and cancel third and  fourth quarter depot maintenance orders and contracts that did not  directly support units deployed to a theater of operations or another  Army priority.", "Consistent with direction from DOD and the Army, Industrial Operations  implemented a hiring freeze of civilian employees, restricted overtime,  terminated temporary employees consistent with mission requirements,  and furloughed civilian employees a total of 6 days in fiscal year 2013.  Further, because the fiscal year 2013 full-year DOD appropriations act  was not passed by Congress until midway through fiscal year 2013, some  orders for work at the Industrial Operations activities that DOD customers  likely would have submitted earlier in the year had there been a budget  passed were not submitted until late in fiscal year 2013. According to  Army headquarters officials, the combination of the personnel reductions,  hiring freeze, overtime restrictions, furloughs, and late receipt of orders  resulted in the Industrial Operations activities earning over $1 billion less  revenue than planned in fiscal year 2013. These actions resulted in  Industrial Operations carryover exceeding the allowable amount by   $195 million in fiscal year 2013. The manpower restrictions imposed on  Industrial Operations in fiscal year 2013 continued to negatively affect  carryover in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Army headquarters officials  stated that Industrial Operations decided not to rehire the employees  released in fiscal year 2013 as the long-term resource outlook indicated  that Industrial Operations\u2019 workload would continue to decline in the  future and it would not have been economical to rehire thousands of  personnel solely to reduce carryover in a declining workload environment.

GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that a key factor in helping  agencies achieve their missions and program results is to implement  appropriate internal controls to help ensure that management\u2019s directives  are carried out. One such control activity would be to develop policies  and procedures to help ensure agency adherence to budget development  and execution requirements. Since the Army did not have documented  procedures for calculating the allowable carryover that is used in its  budget submissions to Congress, the outlay rates used for the fiscal  years 2013 and 2014 allowable carryover calculations were not based  upon the current outlay rates available at the time the budgets were  prepared.

Army officials stated that in  many cases Industrial Operations customers weighed their expected  requirements against their projected funding levels and provided  conservative new order estimates since the operational and fiscal  environment had been so volatile over the past decade. If the Army  includes workload in its new order estimates that does not materialize, a  depot is at risk of incurring unplanned financial loss because the depot is  allocating its overhead costs over less work than planned. These losses  may lead the depots to increase their rates for repairing assets. If funding  availability is higher than the customer originally anticipated or if  operational decisions lead to changes in requirements or priorities,  unplanned workload may materialize at the depots resulting in additional  carryover.", "Furthermore, the mix of customer orders (workload) tends to change  during the year of execution from what was previously estimated because  of operational decisions and changing customer requirements that can  increase the carryover at fiscal year-end. For example, Army  headquarters officials stated that if a customer told a depot to expect a  $10 million order to repair High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles,  but instead sends an order for $10 million to repair trucks, revenue would  most likely be delayed thus increasing carryover.

Additionally, the acquisition community was directed to notify the Army  LCMCs of plans to execute depot maintenance requirements no later  than the end of the first quarter in the year of execution.", "The above actions are positive and have the potential for improving future  budgeted carryover information. However, despite these efforts, which  have been under way since at least 2012, the Army\u2019s budgeted carryover  information has continued to differ from actual carryover information by  hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Since Industrial Operations\u2019  budgets are based on input from its customers, it is important that  Industrial Operations continue to work with its customers to take steps to  reduce the differences between budgeted and actual orders in developing  future budgeted estimates. Reliable budget estimates on carryover are  critical because decision makers use this information when reviewing  Industrial Operations\u2019 budgets. As discussed earlier, actual new orders  have consistently exceeded budgeted new orders for at least a 10-year  period. Internal control standards state that for an entity to run and control  its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely information.  This includes budget information on new orders, revenue, and carryover.  Also, internal control standards state that program managers need both  operational and financial data to determine whether they are meeting their  agencies\u2019 strategic and annual performance plans and meeting their  goals for accountability for effective and efficient use of resources.  Further, financial information is needed for both internal and external  uses. This includes providing reliable budgeted carryover information to  DOD and Congress annually.

Actions to address the first driver are  not necessary because this work was planned to carry over at the end of  the fiscal year as part of the normal business process, and any actions to  address the second driver, crash-damaged aircraft, are limited because of  the unique and unpredictable nature of this type of damage and needed  repairs.

As discussed earlier in the report, some carryover is to be  expected and is appropriate at the end of the fiscal year in order for the  Industrial Operations depots to operate efficiently and effectively by  maintaining a steady flow of work. Without sufficient carryover, Industrial  Operations depot officials stated that the depots could not (1) ensure that  enough funded work would be available to continue operations in the next  fiscal year and (2) retain the appropriate number of personnel with  sufficient skill sets to perform depot maintenance work. Adequate  carryover is particularly important when DOD operates under a continuing  resolution, under which Industrial Operations customers do not know their  full-year funding levels at the beginning of the fiscal year. This, in turn,  may cause the Industrial Operations depots to operate for several months  into the next fiscal year relying mostly on funded work from prior fiscal  year orders (i.e., carryover) to continue operations because customers  may limit the amount of new orders they place at the beginning of the  fiscal year in light of budget uncertainties.

When the depots   (1) have to develop the engineering drawings or (2) do not have a  complete and accurate bill of material and must identify the parts needed  to perform the repair work, actual performance of work is delayed and  thus carryover increases. In those instances, the dollar amount of  carryover is directly affected by the dollar size of the order(s) received  from customers for this work. If the dollar amount of the order is small and  is for the repair of a small number of assets, as generally is the case for  orders for work performed on prototype assets, the dollar amount of the  carryover will be small. On the other hand, if the dollar amount of the  order is large and is for the repair of a large number of assets, as  generally is the case for orders on full production assets, the dollar  amount of carryover will be large. For the 19 orders that we reviewed that  had a scope of work problem, 14 had order and carryover amounts  greater than $10 million each. The following example describes work  performed on Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAP) that  contributed to carryover because of the lack of a well-defined scope of  work.", "In March and July 2012, Letterkenny Army Depot accepted two  production orders totaling $254 million to convert 392 MRAPs to  Route Clearance Vehicles. By the end of fiscal year 2014, the  orders were amended a combined 11 times to decrease vehicle  quantities to 284 and funding to $213 million. Because the depot did  not have a technical data package for the vehicles, it had to develop  approximately 427 engineering drawings to perform the work. Further,  work was delayed on the two orders for about 2 fiscal years because  the depot experienced problems designing the prototype vehicles,  reaching agreement with its customer on the new design, and  performing tests on the prototype vehicles. The final technical data  package for converting the vehicles and the development of the  statement of work and bill of materials on the two orders were delayed  until the new design was agreed upon and the prototype vehicles  were tested. Final approval of the engineering drawings occurred in  March 2014, and the depot started work on the two production orders  in April 2014. Even though the depot started work on the vehicles in  fiscal year 2014, none of the vehicles could be completed by the end  of the fiscal year because of the lack of parts needed to finish them.  The depot carried over about $162 million on these orders into fiscal  year 2015.", "By January 2015, the depot was consistently meeting its production  schedule of 18 to 22 Route Clearance Vehicles per month. However,  in August 2015, production halted with 36 vehicles remaining because  of the lack of 56 parts needed to continue the production line. As a  result, the depot released 53 contractor personnel working on the  vehicles. The depot carried over $25.8 million on these orders into  fiscal year 2016.

However, if DLA or Army Supply  Management is unable to provide the parts, the Industrial Operations  activities may use other methods to obtain the parts, such as obtaining  parts from other assets (e.g., vehicles or engines), manufacturing the  parts, or purchasing the parts using its local procurement authority. If the  Industrial Operations activities manufacture the parts, they must have the  raw material to perform the work and obtain the specifications for the  parts to be made. While these methods allow work to continue, obtaining  the needed parts this way is generally inefficient. The following two  examples illustrate how parts shortages contributed to carryover.", "In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, Red River Army Depot received 8  orders totaling $173 million to repair 1,152 Army MRAP All-Terrain  Vehicles (MATV). The MATV work was a new requirement for this  depot. Time limitations caused by the customers\u2019 need for immediate  production prevented the upfront planning necessary for establishing  an efficient repair process at the beginning of the program. Because  the scope of work was to inspect and repair each MATV as needed,  the parts requirement for each vehicle was varied and prevented the  depot from accurately forecasting all parts requirements at the time  the work was started on a vehicle. While the depot was performing the  repair work, it was addressing issues such as identifying and ordering  the parts it needed for the repairs. In some cases, because of  inaccurate technical data, the depot ordered the wrong parts and had  to return those parts, perform additional analysis to identify the correct  parts, and then order those parts. Furthermore, the depot could not  always obtain the material and parts it needed to make repairs in a  timely manner. For example, some Army MATVs had damage to the  material that lines the floor and sidewalls of the vehicle that provides  additional protection for the warfighter inside the vehicle. However,  the depot could not obtain the material it needed to make these  repairs in a timely manner. As a result of parts and material  shortages, at the end of fiscal year 2015, Red River Army Depot had  completed only 240 of the 1,152 Army MATV vehicles ordered by  customers on these 8 orders. In addition, the depot assembled  another 419 vehicles, but the vehicles were missing parts and  material needed to produce complete vehicles that complied with the  scope of work. At the end of fiscal year 2014, the depot carried over  $113 million of the $120 million of MATV orders it accepted. At the  end of fiscal year 2015, the depot carried over $50 million of the   $173 million of orders.", "In fiscal year 2012, Anniston Army Depot accepted an order for   $14 million to repair and overhaul 12 Armored Vehicle Launched  Bridges. The Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge is a tracked vehicle  that carries a folding metal bridge and allows armored or infantry units  to cross rivers, ravines, and other obstacles when no bridge is  conveniently located. Because the launcher configuration for the  folding metal bridge was old and considered obsolete, the Army  developed a new configuration to the hydraulic and electrical system  to increase its lifespan and sustain readiness. In order to perform the  repair and overhaul for the new configuration, the depot needed to  install hydraulic electrical upgrade kits. Each kit is made up of about  220 parts, including hoses, clamps, bushings, pipes, tubes, and  wiring. According to depot officials, these kits were not available  through the DOD supply system, and therefore the depot had to  obtain the parts and assemble the kits piece by piece. Further, the  depot had problems obtaining several of these parts from different  vendors in a timely manner. As a result, the amount of carryover at  the end of fiscal year 2015 was $13.9 million on this $14 million fiscal  year 2012 order.", "Parts were not always available to perform the work because the DOD  supply system did not maintain sufficient parts in the right mix to meet  demand. Without the DOD supply system maintaining the right mix and  sufficient quantities of spare parts, Industrial Operations activities cannot  complete their funded workload timely and efficiently. Supply chain  management has been a long-standing problem for DOD. In January  2009, we reported the Army had accumulated billions of dollars in excess  spare parts inventory against current requirements for some items and  substantial inventory deficiencies in other items. The Army inventory did  not align with the current requirements at the time because of (1) a lack of  cost-efficiency metrics and goals and (2) inaccurate demand forecasting.  We reported that without accurate and timely demand data, managers  cannot ensure that their purchasing decisions will result in inventory  levels that are sized to minimize DOD\u2019s investment needed to support  requirements. The Army acknowledged that it faced challenges in its  forecasting procedures and began taking steps to address them.  However, our April 2015 report on defense inventory and our current  review shows that DOD, including the Army, has not fully resolved its  ineffective and inefficient inventory management practices. As a result,  since 1990 we have continued to identify DOD supply chain management  as a high-risk area in part because of ineffective and inefficient  management practices and procedures, weaknesses in accurately  forecasting the demand for spare parts, and other supply chain  challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Has Actions Under Way to Help Reduce Carryover, but Problems Persist with a Lack of a Well-Defined Scope of Work and Parts Shortages", "paragraphs": ["The Army has three key actions under way to address problems related  to scope of work and parts shortages that we identified in our analysis of  80 orders.

These  meetings provide the Army a forum for better identifying carryover issues  and developing plans to mitigate the problems. For example, beginning in  fiscal year 2012, the Army began holding weekly meetings called the  Organic Industrial Base Review that provide information on the status of  Industrial Operations carryover, orders, and revenue. At the meetings,  the Army discusses production issues for specific workloads, such as  parts shortages, and strategies to reduce carryover.

Industrial Operations activities must ascertain whether the  activities have processes that define the scope of work and include  approved technical data, documented internal processes, and  capacity to complete the work.", "Assets. Industrial Operations activities must ascertain whether assets  needing repair will be available at the scheduled time for beginning  work at the activities.", "Requirements. Industrial Operations activities must ascertain  whether the workload accepted by the activities has a well-defined  scope of work.

According to an AMC official, the draft guidance is planned to be issued  during fiscal year 2016. The draft regulation provides guidance on the  scope of work and parts as well as coordination and communication  among both AMC and non-AMC stakeholders involved in Industrial  Operations depot activities. For example, the draft regulation states that  the work requirements and changes to the scope of work should be  documented and attached or referenced on the order, and that every  effort should be made to ensure that work specifications and changes are  clear and well documented, especially where new work requirements are  involved. The draft regulation also establishes procedures for managing  the currency and accuracy of production data, including applicable bills of  material, technical data packages, and other technical production data, in  coordination with program executive offices, program managers,  responsible engineering support activities, and depots.", "The Army\u2019s issuance and implementation of the draft AMC regulation has  the potential to help resolve scope of work and parts problems that we  identified during our review of orders. For example, the draft AMC  regulation would require a process similar to that the Army used on a  particular MRAP vehicle referred to as the MaxxPro, and this resulted in  the successful performance of work on this vehicle. Specifically, Red  River Army Depot officials stated that prior to the acceptance of full  production orders for the repair of the MaxxPro, the program underwent a  repair planning process in which there was upfront communication and  coordination among the stakeholders from three separate organizations:  the Red River Army Depot, the Tank-automotive and Armaments  Command, and the MaxxPro program manager. The coordinated team  provided expertise in several different functional areas, including  engineering, quality assurance, and supply management. The team\u2019s  objective was to develop the instruction documentation for this new  requirement that specified the work steps to be performed on the  MaxxPro and the identification of the parts needed to perform the repair  work, and to verify the execution of the process through the means of a  pilot program for this vehicle. Red River Army Depot officials stated that  the stakeholders worked closely together to develop a prototype vehicle,  which resulted in the development of a well-defined scope of work and  the list of parts needed to perform the repair work. Red River Army Depot  began work on the MaxxPro production order in fiscal year 2015 and  completed 105 MaxxPro vehicles in fiscal year 2015.

We focused on fiscal years 2014  and 2015 carryover balances to identify current issues contributing to  carryover. We also performed walk-throughs of four depot maintenance  operations to observe the work being performed and discussed with  officials the causes for workload carrying over from one fiscal year to the  next. Further, to corroborate the information provided by Army officials,  we obtained and analyzed a total of 80 customer orders consisting of the  40 orders that had the largest dollar amounts of carryover at the end of  each of fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Carryover amounts associated with  these orders represented 31 percent of the total carryover each year  collectively at the four Army depots we visited for fiscal years 2014 and  2015.
