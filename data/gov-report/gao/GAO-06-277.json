Bureau officials noted that the communications contract is currently on track. Still, changes in contract milestones--coupled with the Bureau's tight systems development schedule and interdependence of those systems--could affect the Bureau's ability to develop fully functional and sufficiently mature systems to be tested in concert with other operations during the 2008 Dress Rehearsal for the 2010 Census. Already, aspects of the Bureau's data dissemination system will not be assessed during the dress rehearsal because of changes to solicitation and contract award dates. To date, the Bureau has generally followed five selected leading practices for federal acquisition planning that we evaluated. For example, the Bureau has monitored the acquisition planning process for individual contracts, involved relevant stakeholders in the planning phase, and implemented certain actions to its business processes resulting from its reliance on contractors. However, as part of its strategic planning, the Bureau does not have a schedule for documenting what and when information needs to be provided to development teams to integrate all decennial systems. Additionally, in planning for its decennial acquisition workforce--which includes staff who award or manage contracts--the Bureau has not fully implemented key strategic workforce planning principles. For example, while the Bureau took steps at the division level to plan for its acquisition workforce, it does not assess or monitor at a high level gaps in the skills needed by its decennial acquisition workforce. The Bureau also has not identified the needs of the decennial acquisition workforce in its human capital management plan and did not involve all relevant acquisition workforce stakeholders in the development of this plan."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the 2010 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is making the most  extensive use of contractors in its history, turning to the private sector to  supply a number of different mission-critical functions and technologies.  These functions range from data capture and processing services to the  manufacture and support of hundreds of thousands of handheld mobile  computing devices that temporary census workers will use to locate  addresses and to collect and transmit data electronically. The Bureau  estimates that of the $11.3 billion it will cost to conduct the 2010 Census,  around $1.9 billion (nearly 17 percent) will be spent on its seven major  decennial contracts. More importantly, the success of these contracts will  largely determine whether the Bureau meets its goals to improve the  accuracy, reduce the risk, and contain the cost of the 2010 Census.", "Contractors can help address the challenges the Bureau faces as it plans  for and implements the 2010 Census. Because of various social and  demographic trends, the nation\u2019s population has become increasingly  difficult to count. Due to this and other challenges, the Bureau recognized  that it is not equipped to perform the needed tasks using its own staff and  capabilities and has been looking outside the agency to obtain the  expertise and services essential for a complete and accurate enumeration.", "That said, increased reliance on contractors also entails certain  management challenges. The Bureau\u2019s experiences in the 2000 Census\u2014 the first time the Bureau relied on contractors to perform a large number  of major decennial activities\u2014highlight the importance of a rigorous  acquisition planning process to help mitigate those challenges and better  ensure that contractors meet the Bureau\u2019s needs in an effective,  economical, and timely manner. For example, the Department of  Commerce (Commerce) Office of Inspector General raised questions  regarding the Bureau\u2019s ability to acquire critical systems and services.  Although these projects were ultimately successful in supporting the 2000  Census, the Inspector General concluded they were more costly than  necessary.", "In March 2006, we testified on the Bureau\u2019s acquisition and management of  two critical information technology systems that contractors are  developing for the 2010 Census. The two contracts\u2014Field Data Collection  Automation and the Decennial Response Integration System\u2014are two of  the seven major decennial acquisitions for the 2010 Census. We noted that,  while the project offices responsible for these two contracts have carried  out initial acquisition management activities, neither office has the full set  of capabilities they need to effectively manage the acquisitions. Until these  basic management activities are implemented, both projects face  increased risks of cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance  shortfalls.", "Because of the mission-critical role contractors will play in the 2010  Census, we reviewed the Bureau\u2019s acquisition planning process under the  Comptroller General\u2019s statutory authority. As agreed with your office, we  are providing this report to you because it contains information that will  be useful for your oversight responsibilities for the decennial census.  Specifically, our objectives were to (1) determine the status of the  Bureau\u2019s major contracts related to the 2010 Census, and (2) evaluate the  extent to which the Bureau is using selected leading practices to manage  its acquisition planning process for the decennial census.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed documents related to the seven  major 2010 Census acquisitions (as defined by Bureau officials)\u2014 including acquisition plans, strategic planning documents, requests for  proposals, finalized contracts, and budget requests to the Office of  Management and Budget\u2014and interviewed knowledgeable Bureau  officials responsible for contracting and acquisition planning.", "To evaluate the Bureau\u2019s use of leading acquisition planning practices, we  first reviewed (1) our own guidance, reports, and testimonies on the  acquisition function; and (2) external studies to identify leading  acquisition planning practices used in the federal government. From these,  we adapted five leading acquisition planning practices most relevant to the  Bureau\u2019s acquisition planning efforts for its major decennial contracts. We  then evaluated the extent to which the Bureau employed these leading  practices for its seven major decennial contracts by interviewing officials,  reviewing Bureau documents, and observing acquisition activities related  to these contracts. Appendix I provides additional information on our  scope and methodology. We conducted our work from July 2005 through  March 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "This report is the latest in a series of evaluations that we have issued on  the Bureau\u2019s preparations for the 2010 Census.

In  counting the nation\u2019s population, it is important for the Bureau to stay on  schedule, as the Secretary of Commerce is statutorily required to   (1) conduct the census on April 1 of the decennial year, (2) report the state  population counts to the President for purposes of congressional  apportionment by December 31 of the decennial year, and (3) send  population tabulations to the states for purposes of redistricting no later  than 1 year after the April 1 census date. To meet these mandated  reporting requirements, census activities need to take place at specific  times and in the proper sequence. As Census Day approaches, the  tolerance for any operational delays or changes becomes increasingly  small.", "Throughout its history, the Bureau has mostly relied on its in-house  capabilities to conduct the decennial census. However, the 2000 Census  marked the first time the Bureau relied on contractors to perform a large  number of major decennial activities. For example, the Bureau awarded a  data capture contract\u2014to scan more than 100 million questionnaires,  capture and read that data, and send the information to headquarters for  additional processing\u2014to TRW, and awarded the advertising firm of  Young & Rubicam a contract to develop an outreach and promotion  campaign.", "Although the contractors generally performed well, Commerce\u2019s Office of  Inspector General identified several shortcomings. For example,  incomplete quality assurance procedures for the Bureau\u2019s printing  contracts led to one contractor printing and mailing out approximately 20  million misaddressed letters informing households that the decennial  questionnaires would soon follow, resulting in unnecessary negative  publicity just weeks before the Bureau was to send out census forms.", "Further, the Inspector General found that the Bureau did not have  sufficient program management staff with the training and experience to  efficiently acquire systems and manage complex, high-dollar contracts. As  a result, the Bureau incurred higher costs than necessary. For example,  costs for the data capture system increased from a projected $49 million at  the time of contract award in 1997 to $238 million by the end of the  decennial because of continually changing and expanding requirements  late in the decade. The Commerce Office of Inspector General  recommended that for the 2010 Census, the Bureau would need a  sufficient number of highly skilled and properly trained personnel  dedicated to the planning and management of decennial contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Has Made Progress on Major Decennial Contracts, but Adherence to Contract Milestones Will Be Essential", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau has awarded three of its seven major decennial contracts on  time, and is working to accomplish contract milestones for these three and  preparing for the award of the remaining four contracts.

Harris is to correct in the Bureau\u2019s  geographic information system, called the Topologically Integrated  Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database, the location of  every street, boundary, and other map feature so that coordinates are  aligned with their true geographic locations. Our review of Bureau  documents indicates that Harris is meeting expected schedule and cost  targets for the MTAIP contract. According to Bureau documents, Harris  completed work for 75 counties in fiscal year 2003, as was planned for the  first year of production for the contract. Bureau documents also show that  in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, Harris was both on schedule and within  budget, completing 602 counties in 2004 and 623 counties in 2005.  Similarly, for the first 2 months of fiscal year 2006, Harris was also on  schedule and within budget. Bureau plans call for Harris to finish its work  for all remaining counties by the end of fiscal year 2008.", "The DRIS contract was awarded in October 2005 to Lockheed Martin and  is expected to cost more than $500 million. Bureau officials told us that  work on the DRIS contract is slightly behind schedule. The  implementation of the DRIS contract was pushed back by 60 to 90 days,  according to Bureau officials, because of a bid protest that was ultimately  withdrawn. Bureau officials told us they did not expect this change to  substantially affect the contractor\u2019s ability to complete the work as  planned. DRIS staff are working to adjust the schedule for the first few  months of the contract to accommodate the change.", "The Bureau awarded the FDCA contract to Harris for an estimated cost of  $600 million. Although the award date was consistent with its schedule,  the Bureau had revised the original award date for FDCA from late 2005 to  March 2006 to enable multiple offerors to develop and test prototypes of  the mobile computing device that will be used by enumerators during their  fieldwork. The Bureau held a 3-day field demonstration in January 2006 to  evaluate the prototype, and considered the results as part of the process  for selecting a contractor. Bureau officials with responsibility for FDCA  believe this strategy had multiple advantages. For example, they believe  the development of a prototype prior to contract award increases the  likelihood of having a working device in time for the first operation of the  2008 Dress Rehearsal.", "Of the four remaining contracts, the Bureau has also revised the original  award dates for two but expects to award the contracts for printing and  field office leasing according to its original schedule. The two contracts  for which the Bureau has pushed back the award dates are the DADS II  contract to replace the Bureau\u2019s data tabulation and dissemination system  and the 2010 Communications contract to advertise and promote the 2010  Census.", "The Bureau has twice changed the DADS II award date and contract  scope. It originally planned to establish a new Web-based system that  would serve as a single point for public access to all census data and  integrate many dissemination functions currently spread across multiple  Bureau organizations. The Bureau had planned to award that contract in  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. However, due to fiscal and resource  constraints, the Bureau decided against investing in this integrated  approach and opted instead to rely on contractors to enhance the DADS  system used for the 2000 Census. The Bureau planned to release a RFP for  DADS II on February 27, 2006, and to award the contract in August 2006.", "On March 8, 2006, however, the Bureau announced its plan to delay the  release of the RFP by 6 months to gain a clearer sense of budget priorities  before issuing a delegation of procurement authority. The Bureau also  changed its plan to acquire a contractor to maintain and enhance the  system used for the 2000 Census. In its draft RFP for the DADS II contract,  the Bureau noted that because the system used in 2000 was becoming  obsolete, it planned to revert back to its original plan to acquire an  integrated system. The Bureau currently estimates it will delay the award  of the DADS II contract from August to October of 2006.", "The Bureau had also originally planned to award the 2010  Communications contract in October 2006\u2014earlier in the decade than for  Census 2000, when the Bureau awarded its advertising contract in October  1997\u2014but has decided to do so at a later date because it is still researching  various approaches to the acquisition.

The decennial system is  comprised of many systems that must work in concert and rely on one  another. Because of these interdependencies, these various systems need  to stay on schedule during the development phase. For example, data  collected by the mobile computing devices supplied under the FDCA  contract need to be processed by the data capture system provided by the  DRIS contractor to be consistent with data from other sources, such as the  Internet or telephone.", "More broadly, the principal census-taking activities and systems need to  be sufficiently mature so they can be demonstrated in concert with one  another as part of the 2008 Dress Rehearsal.

We previously reported that during the 1998 Dress Rehearsal  for the 2000 Census, a number of new features were not test-ready; as a  result, the Bureau said it could not fully evaluate with any degree of  assurance how they would affect the census. These late design changes  and hastily developed untested systems resulted in additional costs to that  census.", "For the 2010 Census, changes to the acquisition milestones of both the  FDCA and DADS II contracts affected the testing programs for both of  those systems. For example, as the Commerce Office of Inspector General  concluded in a recent report, delaying FDCA time frames reduced the  amount of time after contract award to complete the remainder of the  work needed to prepare for, and begin, the dress rehearsal. Moreover,  pushing back the award date resulted in a missed opportunity for the  FDCA contractor to observe the real-time use of the mobile computing  devices for address canvassing in 2005 as part of the 2006 test. According  to the Inspector General, observations of the 2006 Test could have  provided the contractor with a level of understanding of key census-taking  operations that would have been difficult to obtain in any other fashion.", "Additionally, the DADS II system will not be developed in time to be fully  tested during the 2008 Dress Rehearsal, partly due to the delay in its  acquisition milestones. Moreover, because the Bureau moved the release  date for the RFP from February to August 2006 and plans to award the  contract in October 2006, the time frame the Bureau now has to prepare  for awarding the contract has been compressed from 6 to 2 months.

Linking  an organization\u2019s acquisition activities to specific program goals is  particularly important for the census, where various systems have to work  seamlessly and in the right sequence. For example, the National Academy  of Sciences reported that during the 2000 Census, weaknesses in the  Bureau\u2019s strategic planning for major systems developed by contractors  led to a patchwork of information systems that were costly, complex, and  high risk.", "For the 2010 Census, the Bureau has developed a strategic plan linking  some activities to be performed by contractors to the Bureau\u2019s program  goals. To enhance its planning process and improve systems efficiency, the  Bureau is developing a 2010 Census Architecture, which is a blueprint of  its business process, data, applications and interfaces, and the  technologies needed to efficiently conduct the census. This architecture  will also serve as the basis on which the Bureau and its contractors will  build systems necessary to complete the 2010 Census. The National  Academy of Sciences has endorsed the Bureau\u2019s development of the 2010  Census Architecture and noted that its full use has the potential to greatly  reduce risk in system development and enable the various information  subsystems of the census to communicate effectively with each other.", "Within this architecture, the Bureau has several documents that detail its  plans to produce a census that achieves its program goals for the  reengineered 2010 Census. Although these documents do not specifically  identify contracts, they do link activities that will be performed by  contractors to achieving specific program goals. For example, the 2010  Baseline Design specifies that automation and use of mobile computing  devices\u2014to be provided by the FDCA contractor\u2014will significantly  reduce the amount of paper used in the field. It will also cut down on the  large number of staff and the office space required to handle that paper,  thereby also reducing the cost of the census. Likewise, in a budget  document submitted to the Office of Management and Budget, the Bureau  also links contracted activities to decreased workload and costs.", "The Bureau is planning for the integration of DRIS, FDCA, DADS II, and its  other information technology systems. Successful systems integration  involves almost every aspect of the project and reaches from the very  beginning through the maintenance phase of a system\u2019s life cycle. To  facilitate this planning, the Bureau will use the 2010 Census Architecture  to coordinate technical planning for systems integration. As part of this  architecture, the Bureau has developed the Physical Architecture, which  specifically identifies which systems need to exchange data or interface  with one another. Contractors will be required to follow this document as  they develop interoperable systems. Bureau officials stated that they plan  to finalize the Physical Architecture by the spring of 2006.", "As the Bureau continues its testing and development for the 2010 Census,  it will be important for it to fully develop and carry out its plan to integrate  its decennial systems. The Bureau has taken the responsibility of  managing systems integration itself. Therefore, it needs to provide each  contractor with the information needed to enable the systems they  develop to work in concert with other decennial systems. Bureau officials  indicate that they intend to define these information needs after all major  information technology contracts have been awarded and will implement a  joint effort with the Bureau\u2019s contractors and in-house developers to  integrate its systems development schedules at that time.", "However, the Bureau has not yet established a schedule for defining this  information that needs to be shared with contractors or other census  teams for their development of decennial systems. To successfully provide  this information on schedule so as to ensure the successful integration of  decennial systems, the Bureau\u2014in its role as the systems integrator\u2014 should establish a schedule to define interfaces between all decennial  systems so that the interface information can be provided on a timely basis  to development teams. Consistent with the leading acquisition planning  practice of strategically planning for contracts, the successful integration  of decennial systems is a key factor in the Bureau\u2019s ability to meet its  internal milestones.

While the Bureau does not have a policy requiring such  plans to be completed prior to contract award, not having them in place  could limit the Bureau\u2019s ability to determine when performance deviates  from expectations and could increase the risk of delays in identifying  problems with the project and taking appropriate corrective actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Has So Far Involved Relevant Stakeholders in the Acquisition Planning Process", "paragraphs": ["In our previous work, we found that engaging relevant stakeholders and  empowering them to coordinate acquisition actions help agencies to better  define their needs and to identify, select, and manage providers of goods  and services.

An April 2005 Office of Management and  Budget policy letter to federal departments and agencies underscores the  importance of this type of planning by requiring high-level acquisition  officials to provide substantial input to their agency\u2019s human capital  strategic plans regarding the acquisition workforce.", "We have previously identified five key principles that strategic workforce  planning should address: (1) involving top management, employees, and  other stakeholders in developing and implementing the workforce plan;  (2) determining critical skills and competencies needed to achieve  programmatic results; (3) developing strategies tailored to address gaps in  critical skills and competencies; (4) building the capability needed to  address administrative, educational, and other requirements important to  support workforce strategies; and (5) monitoring and evaluating the  agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital goals.", "The Bureau has incorporated some key strategic workforce planning  principles in planning for its acquisition workforce, but primarily at a  division level. Divisions within the Bureau that have responsibility for  acquisition-related staff have independently implemented certain strategic  workforce planning actions, including working to determine the critical  skills and competencies needed to award and manage decennial contracts  and developing strategies to have adequate skilled staff in place in time for  the decennial. For example, as part of its workforce planning, the  Decennial Systems and Contracts Management Office retained a  contractor to conduct a study of what grades, competencies, and skills  were needed to effectively manage the DRIS contract. Bureau divisions are  also turning to formal training to enhance the capabilities of their staff.  For instance, the Decennial Management Division is requiring some of its  employees to take project management or contracting officer\u2019s technical  representative training. Likewise, the Decennial Systems and Contracts  Management Office has trained some of its staff in program management  as well as in the development of enterprise architecture.", "At an agencywide level, the Bureau has taken some initial steps to identify  the skills and competencies needed to manage contracts, but more could  be done. For example, in the Bureau\u2019s strategic human capital plan, the  Bureau acknowledges that project and contract management are among  the new skills required for its staff for the reengineering of the 2010  Census. To build the capacity to help staff obtain these and other skills,  the Bureau has established a Project Management Master\u2019s Certificate  Program and an Information Technology Master\u2019s Certificate Program, and  has developed competency guides as well. According to Commerce, these  certificate programs, initiated in 1998, are a way to develop the  management and leadership skills needed in mid-to-senior level career  employees to successfully oversee Bureau operations well beyond the  2010 Census.", "However, the Bureau still lacks an agencywide approach to strategically  planning for its acquisition workforce. First, as we previously noted, the  Bureau does not assess or monitor gaps in numbers by mission-critical  occupation at an agencywide level. Instead, it focuses on \u201cbuilding  infrastructure\u201d by recruiting and developing competencies. The Bureau  delegates decisions to line managers to fill vacancies, and believes there is  no need to assess workers by mission-critical categories. In not  performing this agencywide assessment, the Bureau cannot monitor its  mission-critical occupations related to acquisitions more closely and at a  higher level within the agency. As a result, it may not know overall if it has  the acquisition-related competencies it needs in place agencywide to be  prepared for conducting the 2010 Census as efficiently or effectively as  possible.", "Second, the Bureau has not identified the needs of its decennial  acquisition workforce in its agencywide human capital management, nor  has it developed a separate plan specific to the acquisition workforce that  identifies these needs. Further, according to Bureau officials in the  Acquisition Division, their input was not sought in the development of the  Bureau\u2019s existing human capital management plan.", "This lack of high-level attention to the decennial acquisition workforce in  the Bureau\u2019s strategic human capital planning process is notable,  especially in light of the Bureau\u2019s challenges of recruiting qualified  acquisition personnel. It will be important for the Bureau to address the  needs of its acquisition workforce in its agencywide human capital  management plan or a separate plan and to involve the Acquisition  Division in this planning effort. Taking these actions would help facilitate  a better alignment between the acquisition workforce and the demands  brought on by the Bureau\u2019s greater reliance on contractors for the  successful conduct of the 2010 Census."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As the 2010 Census approaches, the Bureau faces the challenge of  managing its extensive network of contractors to perform mission-critical  operations. The Bureau is well aware that early planning, testing, and  development will help facilitate a successful decennial census. Acquisition  planning plays a key role in that process and provides a road map the  Bureau can use to manage its contracts to increase the likelihood of timely  deliverables at reasonable cost.", "Overall, progress on the seven major decennial contracts is moving  forward. Still, as Census Day 2010 draws closer, it will become  increasingly difficult for the Bureau to make up any time lost to delays.  Already, aspects of the Bureau\u2019s DADS II system will not be assessed in  the dress rehearsal because of a change in the contract\u2019s acquisition  milestones, while changes to FDCA time frames have reduced the amount  of time the Bureau will have to complete the work needed to prepare for,  and begin the dress rehearsal.", "Further, to help the contractors stay on track, Bureau officials will need to  document a schedule for when information needs to be exchanged  between contractors and census teams working to develop these  interoperable systems for the 2010 Census. The Bureau also needs to pay  attention to strategically\u2014and at an agencywide level\u2014managing the  human capital planning for its acquisition workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help the Bureau improve the management of the 2010 Census, we  recommend that the Secretary of Commerce direct the Bureau to take the  following three actions:    Ensure that the key systems to be developed or provided by contractors  for the 2010 Census are fully functional and ready to be assessed in  concert with other operations as part of the 2008 Dress Rehearsal.", "Establish a schedule for the definition of interfaces between all decennial  systems so that these data can be provided on a timely basis to  development teams.", "Devote further attention to planning strategically for its decennial  acquisition workforce by (1) assessing, at a higher level within the agency,  whether it has the acquisition-related skills needed to conduct the 2010  Census by developing strategies to identify and address gaps, monitoring  and evaluating progress toward closing gaps, and adjusting strategies  accordingly; and (2) identifying the needs of the acquisition workforce in  its human capital management plan or another acquisition-specific  workforce plan and involving appropriate stakeholders in this planning  effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, Commerce neither agreed  nor disagreed with our recommendations. Commerce commented on  aspects of our principal findings and our third recommendation regarding  its planning for the decennial acquisition workforce. Its comments  included some technical corrections and suggestions where additional  context was needed, and we revised the report to reflect these comments  as appropriate. Commerce\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in  appendix II.", "Commerce did comment on our first principal finding concerning the  Bureau\u2019s readiness for the 2008 Dress Rehearsal. This finding led to our  first recommendation for the Bureau to ensure that its key systems are  fully functional and ready to be assessed in concert with other operations  during the dress rehearsal. Commerce noted that the Bureau provided  competitors for the FDCA contract information about the design,  requirements, and specifications for the 2006 Test in its RFP (we have now  added this information to our report). Commerce also noted that the  Bureau will be sharing preliminary results from the 2006 Test with  Harris\u2014the firm that was awarded the contract\u2014as soon as the results are  available. However, the Bureau did not specify when this might be.  Moreover, as we discussed in the report, the mobile computing devices  will need to be ready by April 2007, when the Bureau is to use them for the  address canvassing operation for the 2008 Dress Rehearsal. Consequently,  the contractor will have around a year, perhaps less, to study the results of  the 2006 Test; assess what worked and what improvements, if any, are  needed; and develop and test any solutions in time to be included in the  devices that will be used in 2007.", "For our second principal finding that the Bureau does not have a schedule  for defining what and when information needs to be provided to  development teams to better integrate the systems they develop,  Commerce did not comment on our recommendation for the Bureau to  develop such a schedule, but stated that it was not clear how the Bureau  could have had such a schedule prior to awarding the contracts.  Commerce further noted that the Bureau plans to implement a joint effort  with its contractors and in-house developers to integrate its development  schedules. Our report acknowledged that the Bureau intended to define  these information needs after it awards the major information technology  contracts. We believe that establishing a schedule defining the interfaces  between all decennial systems as soon as practical is critical because it  allows the Bureau to better manage the process and hold various  components accountable to a schedule and thus help ensure the  successful integration of decennial systems.", "In its comments related to our third finding and recommendation for the  Bureau to assess the decennial acquisition workforce at a higher level  within the agency, Commerce described the actions the Bureau is taking  consistent with this recommendation. For example, Commerce reported  that high-level Bureau officials will be regularly briefed on the status of  each decennial acquisition. Commerce also detailed the steps the Bureau  is taking with stakeholders to plan for the needs of the Bureau\u2019s  acquisition-related workforce as part of its human capital management  plan. Commerce noted that this plan includes input from managers who  represent each Bureau directorate.", "These are important first steps toward addressing our third  recommendation. While the Bureau has begun working closely with  stakeholders to plan for the decennial acquisition workforce as part of its  human capital management plan, it has not yet begun incorporating that  information into the plan. As we stated in our report, documenting its  decennial acquisition workforce needs in the Bureau\u2019s strategic human  capital plan would help facilitate a better alignment between the  acquisition workforce and the demands brought on by the Bureau\u2019s  greater reliance on contractors for the successful conduct of the 2010  Census.", "In addition, Commerce commented on information in our report that was  obtained from our March 2006 testimony and a 2002 Commerce Office of  Inspector General study. Specifically, our report notes that in March 2006,  we testified that neither the FDCA nor DRIS contract project offices had  the full set of capabilities they need to effectively manage those  acquisitions. Commerce commented that full project management offices  were not needed to carry out the Bureau\u2019s initial acquisitions and will be  staffed in time to effectively manage the contracts. As discussed in the  testimony and noted in our report, a full set of capabilities\u2014including the  institution of requirements management or risk management processes\u2014 are significant factors in successful systems acquisitions and development  programs. Having these capabilities in place will also improve the  likelihood of meeting cost and schedule estimates as well as performance  requirements. Regarding the Inspector General\u2019s study, we noted that the  Inspector General found that the cost of the data capture system for the  2000 Census increased almost fivefold by the end of that decennial cycle  because of continually changing and expanding requirements late in the  decade, and the Inspector General recommended that for 2010, the Bureau  would need a sufficient number of trained personnel dedicated to the  planning and management of decennial contracts. In its comments,  Commerce noted that the issue of changing and expanding requirements  must be addressed by program management, and that the Bureau, in its  preparations for the 2010 Census, is following practices for rigorous  requirements management.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Commerce,  Commerce Office of Inspector General, the Director of the U.S. Census  Bureau and other interested congressional committees.

To address our first objective, we reviewed documents related to  major 2010 Census acquisitions, including acquisition plans, requests for  proposals (RFP), finalized contracts, and budget requests to the Office of  Management and Budget. We also reviewed the Bureau\u2019s strategic  planning documents, such as its 2010 Census Management Plan, 2010  Census Architecture, and 2010 Baseline Design for Reengineering the  Decennial Census.", "Additionally, we interviewed Bureau officials about the status of and  future plans for the major contracts for the 2010 Census (as defined by  Bureau officials). Those officials include those from the Decennial  Management Division, which is responsible for implementing the  decennial census; the Decennial Systems and Contracts Management  Office, which manages selected system contracts supporting the decennial  census; and the Acquisition Division, which carries out acquisition  activities, including setting up and signing contracts, for other Bureau  offices. Further, we interviewed an official from the Decennial Information  Technology and Geographic Systems division.", "For the second objective, we identified selected leading acquisition  planning practices used in the federal government from a variety of  sources. Sources included our own guidance, reports, and testimonies on  the acquisition function as well as external works, such as the Capability  Maturity Model\u00ae Integration (CMMISM) model. The CMMISM model was  developed by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute,  recognized for its expertise in software and system processes. The CMMISM  model includes criteria to evaluate, improve, and manage system and  software development processes. We adapted these CMMISM criteria to  evaluate system and software development issues during acquisition  planning for the four information technology contracts (Field Data  Collection Automation, Decennial Response Integration System,  MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project, and Data Access and  Dissemination System II). From these, we selected five leading practices  based on the acquisition-related challenges the Bureau faced during  Census 2000. The five leading practices we selected focused on  management oversight of the Bureau\u2019s acquisition planning process, not  on the Bureau\u2019s acquisition strategy for specific contracts or compliance  with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Bureau followed these leading  practices, we reviewed relevant Bureau documents, such as acquisition  plans, strategic planning documents, RFPs, finalized contracts, and budget  requests to the Office of Management and Budget; observed some  acquisition-related events at the Bureau, including Bureau presentations  for potential bidders and contract monitoring meetings; and interviewed  knowledgeable Bureau officials about acquisition planning. We focused on  the Bureau\u2019s activities to date in planning for its major decennial  contracts. Because the Bureau is still planning most of these acquisitions,  our review presents findings about current status and plans as reported by  Bureau officials or as supported by Bureau documents.
