BOP is activating these institutions by staffing and equipping them and populating them with inmates.", "GAO was requested to review BOP's activation process of newly constructed and acquired institutions. GAO reviewed, among other things, (1) the extent to which BOP is activating institutions within estimated timeframes and has an activation policy or schedules that meet best practices, and (2) why DOJ purchased Thomson and how the purchase affected system wide costs. GAO reviewed BOP budget documents from fiscal years 2008 to 2015 and assessed schedules against GAO's Schedule Assessment Guide.

BOP is behind schedule, in part, because of challenges, such as staffing, posed by the locations of the activating institutions. According to BOP officials, delays in receiving congressionally directed activation funding can exacerbate these challenges (see fig.). None of the six institutions is fully activated, or at rated capacity, as they do not house the number of inmates they are designed to safely and securely house.", "BOP does not effectively communicate to Congress how the locations of new institutions may affect activation schedules. BOP officials said that when directed by Congress to investigate a location, they consider this as direction to focus on construction at that site. DOJ and BOP could more effectively manage activation timelines and costs by using the BOP annual budget justification to communicate to Congress the factors associated with certain locations that can delay activations, such as challenges hiring staff and placing inmates in institutions. Also, BOP officials said they review staffing data system-wide, but they have not prioritized an analysis of such data at the institution level. Analyzing staffing data on institutions in the activation process could help BOP assess its progress in staffing and tailoring effective mitigating strategies. Finally, BOP lacks a comprehensive activation policy to guide activations, as well as an activation schedule that reflects best practices, and it has largely relied on staff's past experience to complete ongoing activations. Developing and implementing a comprehensive policy and a schedule that reflects best practices, could better position BOP to meet its estimated timeframes and activation costs.", "DOJ purchased Thomson to help reduce crowding among inmates requiring high levels of security. Once it is fully populated, it will reduce BOP-wide crowding by 16 percent at the high-security level. Thomson will cost about $160 million annually to operate once fully activated, adding to BOP's system-wide costs.

According to DOJ, as of  July 2014, BOP-operated institutions are about 31 percent overcrowded,  which occurs when institutions house more inmates than they are  designed to hold. Moreover, according to BOP\u2019s most recent long-range  capacity plan included in DOJ\u2019s annual congressional budget justification  for BOP, the bureau projects annual inmate growth of between 2,500 and  3,000 or more from fiscal years 2015 through 2020. BOP is not  responsible for controlling the flow of inmates into the federal prison  system, as convicted felons are placed directly into BOP\u2019s custody and  care, but BOP is responsible for confining these inmates safely and  securely. As we reported in September 2012, this responsibility can be  challenging with a growing inmate population. In particular, we found that  crowding has negatively affected inmates housed in BOP institutions,  institutional staff, and the infrastructure of BOP facilities, and has  contributed to inmate misconduct, which affects staff and inmate security  and safety. In recognition of the difficulties crowding causes, DOJ\u2019s  Inspector General included detention and incarceration among DOJ\u2019s top  10 management and performance challenges department-wide for 2013,  and noted that the department has identified crowding as a material  weakness every year since 2006.", "BOP considers reducing crowding rates system-wide to be a strategic  goal and has spent over $1.3 billion on the construction and acquisition of  six new federal institutions to help alleviate crowding across the prison  system. Specifically, BOP constructed five federal prisons: (1) Federal  Correctional Institution (FCI) Aliceville in Alabama, (2) FCI Berlin in New  Hampshire, (3) FCI Hazelton in West Virginia, (4) FCI Mendota in  California, and (5) U.S. Penitentiary (USP) Yazoo City in Mississippi.

In addition to BOP, DOJ is also working to  address the growth in the prison population, and in 2013, launched its  Smart on Crime Initiative, which includes several efforts to modernize the  criminal justice system, including reprioritizing federal law enforcement  prosecutions to focus on the most serious cases. Additionally, over the  past 2 years, Members of Congress have introduced at least five bills to  date that seek to modify federal sentencing requirements in order to  reduce the length of incarceration of inmates convicted of nonviolent  drug-related offenses.", "In light of crowding conditions and BOP\u2019s recent construction of new  institutions and the acquisition of the Thomson Correctional Center, you  asked us to review BOP\u2019s activation process. Specifically, this report  addresses the following questions:  1.  To what extent has BOP activated the six institutions within estimated  time frames, and to what extent does BOP have an activation policy  or schedules that meet best practices?  2.  How has BOP covered the costs of maintaining the six institutions?  3.  How will the addition of each institution likely affect system-wide  crowding rates?  4.  Why did DOJ purchase the Thomson Correctional Center, and how, if  at all, will it affect costs?", "To determine whether BOP has activated the six institutions within  estimated time frames, we reviewed documents that accompany BOP\u2019s  annual congressional budget justifications, called budget exhibits, from  fiscal years 2008 through 2014 that include timelines for when BOP  expects to activate new institutions. We also analyzed data from the  Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) human resources database,  Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) Statistical Data Mart, for  fiscal years 2010 through 2013 to determine the extent to which staffing  challenges identified by institutions in the activation process affected  BOP\u2019s ability to meet estimated time frames related to activation.  Further, we reviewed legislation enacted from relevant fiscal years,  specifically fiscal years 1999 through 2006, and associated reports to  identify the process through which specific institution locations are  identified, as well as BOP\u2019s assessments of proposed locations for new  institutions. Additionally, we evaluated the extent to which BOP\u2019s  schedule documents used for completing activation for each institution  complied with and reflected best practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Schedule  Assessment Guide. We also interviewed agency officials on the  challenges, if any, institutions face related to activation and the actions  BOP has taken to mitigate the effects of those challenges.", "To determine how BOP has covered the costs of maintaining the six  institutions while waiting for congressional direction on activation funding,  we reviewed BOP\u2019s annual congressional budget justifications from fiscal  years 2008 through 2015. We also reviewed BOP\u2019s annual spend plans,  which DOJ or its components develop after receiving an appropriation, for  fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to identify congressionally directed  activation funding. Further, we analyzed data on actual obligations BOP  made from fiscal years 2010, or the first year BOP made activation- related obligations for those six institutions, through March 2014 to fund  and activate the six institutions to determine the total cost of new  institution activations. We also reviewed program statements, which are  BOP\u2019s formal policies and procedures, related to using appropriated  funds for building projects.", "To determine how each new institution will likely affect system-wide  crowding rates, we evaluated BOP\u2019s long-range capacity plan that  accompanied BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2015 congressional budget justification.  That plan includes BOP\u2019s estimates of the future inmate population and  crowding rates through fiscal year 2020, and assumes that all six  institutions in our review will be fully populated, or fully activated, by fiscal  year 2016. We then used data in that plan to calculate estimated  crowding rates\u2014assuming the new institutions were not fully activated by  fiscal year 2016 (e.g., did not provide any beds)\u2014by subtracting the  number of beds the six institutions would otherwise have added to overall  capacity in that fiscal year. Our analysis compared crowding rates with  and without the addition of new beds provided by the six institutions and  examined the effect of that additional capacity across (1) all BOP  institutions, (2) respective security levels of each institution, and (3)  gender.", "To assess why DOJ purchased the Thomson Correctional Center in  2012, we reviewed BOP\u2019s congressional budget justifications and  accompanying budget exhibits that specifically requested funds for  Thomson from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; state of Illinois documents  on selling the Thomson Correctional Center to the federal government  that were produced in 2010; and relevant acquisition documents, such as  an environmental assessment and appraisals of the institution. We also  reviewed relevant statutes to understand the department\u2019s legal authority  to acquire the Thomson Correctional Center. To determine how, if at all,  the purchase of Thomson affected costs, we reviewed BOP\u2019s  Modernization and Repair Unfunded Priorities list from 2012, which was  the list available when DOJ purchased Thomson.

Additionally, BOP designates some of its institutions as administrative  institutions, which specifically serve inmates awaiting trial, or those with  intensive medical or mental health conditions, regardless of the level of  supervision these inmates require. As of June 2014, BOP owned and  operated seven stand-alone minimum-security institutions, 30 low- security institutions, 47 medium-security institutions, 16 high-security  institutions, 1 administrative maximum (ADX) institution that houses  inmates requiring the highest levels of security, and 19 administrative  institutions.

Additionally, we found that BOP\u2019s obligations for activating those  three institutions are similar to what BOP has spent in the past when  activating new institutions. Specifically, when adjusting for inflation, BOP  spent, on average, about $41,100 per bed for those institutions, and  spent, on average, about $40,600 per bed on the 21 institutions activated  from 1994 through 2000.", "To finance the additional $25 million of activation-related activities, BOP  officials told us they used S&E funds that are generally used to fund the  operation of all BOP institutions. Specifically, BOP officials told us that  BOP spends between $1 million and $4 million each year to maintain a  newly constructed or acquired institution while waiting for the  congressionally directed activation funding needed to complete the  activation process. This additional spending supports, among other  things, salaries of a core group of staff and the cost of utilities to maintain  institutions and keep them secure prior to receiving congressionally  directed activation funding. According to BOP officials, when BOP is  waiting for congressionally directed activation funding for a given  institution, BOP hires a facility manager to ensure that the building is  operating appropriately and covers costs associated with utilities, such as  electricity and water. For example, to maintain Administrative USP  Thomson while waiting for congressionally directed activation funding,  BOP obligated $1.3 million in fiscal year 2013, and, as of March 2014,  BOP has obligated about $440,700. Those costs included relocation  expenses, uniforms, and training for the maintenance staff; utilities; and  mechanical services for the institution, among other things. In addition,  BOP officials told us that BOP spent about $150,000 over 2 fiscal years to  fund a state of Illinois employee to maintain the institution while waiting  for BOP staff to be hired. Further, BOP spent about $10 million in utility  and personnel costs to maintain FCI Berlin for an additional 2 fiscal years  while BOP waited for congressionally directed activation funding to begin  activation. According to BOP officials, that additional funding covered the  salary expenses for 16 employees that the agency hired to maintain the  institution.

In fact, one of BOP\u2019s objectives in its strategic plan is to attract  and retain competent health care professionals using a range of  strategies, including recruitment and retention bonuses. Similarly, our  analysis of OPM data demonstrates that partially activated institutions  have had staff sever employment with BOP (see table 6). For instance,  each year more staff have separated from employment at FCI Mendota  than in the prior year, for a total of 40 employees\u2014about 21 percent of its  total hires\u2014from fiscal years 2010 through 2013. Additionally, according  to data provided by BOP from its personnel database for fiscal year  2014\u2014through July\u2014an additional 11 employees separated from FCI  Mendota."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Analysis of BOP\u2019s Schedules against Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["We determined that BOP\u2019s schedules for activating the six institutions in  our review are not reliable based on our assessment of whether those  schedules met best practices as outlined in our Schedule Assessment  Guide."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purpose and Scope of the Schedule Guide", "paragraphs": ["In May 2012, we issued GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide to provide  guidance to auditors in evaluating government programs. According to  that guide, the success of a program depends, in part, on having an  integrated and reliable master schedule that defines when and how long  work will occur and how each activity is related to the others. A schedule  is necessary for government programs for many reasons. The program  schedule provides not only a road map for systematic project execution,  but also the means by which to gauge progress, identify and resolve  potential problems, and promote accountability at all levels of the  program. A schedule provides a time sequence for the duration of a  program\u2019s activities and helps those involved understand both the dates  for major milestones and the activities that drive the schedule. A program  schedule is also a way to develop a budget that incorporates the time it  will take to complete phases of the project. Moreover, the schedule is an  essential basis for managing trade-offs among cost, schedule, and scope.  Among other things, scheduling allows program management to decide  between possible sequences of activities, determine the flexibility of the  schedule according to available resources, predict the consequences of  managerial action or inaction on events, and allocate contingency plans  to mitigate risks. Moreover, an integrated and reliable schedule can show  when major events are expected to occur as well as the completion dates  for all activities leading up to them, which can help determine if the  program\u2019s parameters are realistic and achievable.", "Our research has identified 10 best practices associated with effective  schedule estimating, which can be collapsed into four general  characteristics: well constructed, and credible.", "After reviewing documentation BOP submitted for its activation schedule  estimates and conducting interviews with BOP officials involved in  activations, we determined that the documents used as schedules by the  six activating institutions are not reliable. Collectively, the six BOP  institutions minimally met two of the four characteristics of a reliable  schedule and did not meet the remaining two characteristics, as  summarized in table 7. To arrive at this determination, we examined the  extent to which each of BOP\u2019s six activating institutions adhered to each  of the 10 best practices. We then assigned a corresponding score. We  took the average score for all six institutions, by best practice, and  collapsed the 10 best practices into the four characteristics to get an  average that reflected an overall assessment by schedule characteristic.", "As summarized above, BOP\u2019s six activating institutions minimally met two  of the four characteristics of a reliable schedule and did not meet the  remaining two characteristics. Each of the sections below provides  greater detail about where BOP\u2019s practices were deficient.", "Comprehensive. We reviewed the activation handbooks and staffing  timeline documents that each of the six institutions completed and  found that they minimally met the requirements for a comprehensive  schedule, as illustrated by table 8.", "To guide activation, BOP\u2019s Central Office provides each activating  institution with a standard activation handbook template and general  staffing timeline. With respect to the activation handbook template  provided to activating institutions, this document contains some elements  of a work breakdown structure, which is an important feature in a  comprehensive schedule. In particular, the activation handbook template  lists necessary tasks, organized by responsible departments or  contractors. However, the activation handbook template provides the  tasks, or activities, in the list in a general way, but none of the six  institutions tailored the tasks to meet their specific requirements, which  limits the bureau\u2019s ability to oversee all activation activities. Similarly, the  activation handbook template does not fully include all work associated  with each deliverable and does not identify the specific personnel within  the department responsible for each activity\u2014and none of the six  institutions modified the template to provide this information. For example,  the activation handbook template specifies that the Correctional Services  department is responsible for coordinating with on-site project staff to  evaluate all entrances, doors, locks, intercoms, cameras, and so forth.  However, it does not provide additional detail about what is required as  part of these evaluations, how these requirements might differ by  institution, which specific staff should be executing or overseeing these  activities, or what the costs associated with this activity might be. Two of  the six institutions adapted the activation handbook template to provide  detail on some resource costs associated with activation. In the case of  FCI Berlin, that institution\u2019s activation handbook included details on the  associated costs by department, such as Correctional Services, Food  Services, or Medical Services, and the materials those departments  would need to provide services to inmates, such as vaccines. However,  FCI Berlin\u2019s activation handbook did not provide sufficient information  about why the specific resources would be needed to keep the activation  on schedule and the impact of not having the resources. Finally, none of  the six institutions included any reference to project duration in its  respective modified activation handbook. For example, the activation  handbook template provided by BOP to activating institutions states that  the Case Management Coordinator is responsible for establishing transfer  arrangements for inmates and coordinating assignments for the transfers\u2019  work areas, but it does not provide an indication of how long the activity  may take to complete. Without information about the estimated length of  time required to complete each activity, management cannot accurately  identify the staffing resources required to complete it, assess the progress  of the activation process, or establish realistic dates for institution  activation.", "With respect to the general staffing timeline template BOP\u2019s Central  Office provides, this document roughly identifies when particular staff  resources are needed based on the anticipated activation date. For  example, the general staffing timeline template specifies that 7 months  prior to activation, the institution should hire the Warden, Executive  Assistant, and Secretary within the Executive Staff department. However,  the general staffing timeline template is based on the anticipated  activation date rather than based on the activities each of these  individuals would be doing\u2014and none of the six institutions made  modifications to elaborate on these activities. According to best practices  for comprehensive schedules, resources, such as staff, should be  assigned to particular activities in order to facilitate completion of these  activities.", "Because of these deficiencies, the information contained in each of the  six institutions\u2019 activation handbooks and staffing timelines does not  assist management in forecasting whether activities will be completed as  scheduled or as budgeted. Further, these documents do not allow insight  into the allocation of resources, increasing the likelihood that the  activation process will not be completed as anticipated and limiting BOP\u2019s  ability to ensure accountability for the total scope of work.", "Controlled. The activation handbooks and staffing timeline templates  that each of the six institutions modified minimally met the  requirements for a controlled schedule, as illustrated in table 9.", "Two of the activating institutions provided versions of BOP\u2019s activation  handbook and staffing timeline templates that contained some indication  that information on key dates and activities was updated at some point in  time by the activating institutions. However, those activation handbook  and staffing timeline templates modified by each institution did not  indicate whether they had been updated at regular intervals, or that they  reflected the actual status of the respective activations. For example, the  activation handbook and staffing timeline templates modified by officials  at FCI Aliceville that were used to guide that activation included  handwritten dates for when specific steps in the activation process were  expected to be completed, but these did not appear to be updated  systematically or include an indication of when or if those activities had  been completed. Further, none of the activating institutions\u2019 activation  handbooks or staffing timelines included the status of key milestone  dates, such as whether specific activities had been completed, or when  the activation should be completed. In addition, none of the activating  institutions used activation handbooks or staffing timelines that described  the critical risks that the institution faced in meeting its goals for activation  or contingencies if those risks were realized. As BOP officials have noted,  meeting scheduled dates for activation is often dependent on receiving  specific activation funding as planned, and, according to best practices for  a controlled schedule, such risks should be documented to ensure  reliability. Without regularly updating the schedule based on the current  status of the activation at each respective institution, BOP is limited in its  ability to monitor activation progress or make decisions on how to mitigate  risk or allocate resources for activating institutions.", "Well constructed. The activation handbooks and staffing timeline  documents that each of the six institutions modified did not meet the  requirements for a well-constructed schedule, as illustrated in table  10.", "The activation handbook and staffing timeline templates modified by  activating institutions did not always provide specific information  regarding start and finish dates, durations, or sequencing of activation- related activities. For example, BOP\u2019s general staffing timeline template  identifies the sequence in which staff should be hired, which is an  important feature of a well-constructed schedule, but there is no  sequencing of the activities listed in the activation handbook template. For  example, the general staffing timeline specifies that within the Facilities  department, the Communication Technician should be hired 7 months  prior to activation, while the Facility Manager and Electrician and others  should be hired 6 months prior to activation, but it does not provide  contingencies if predecessor positions cannot be filled \u201con time\u201d or  describe the effects, if any, of filling positions out of sequence. Aside from  staffing-related issues, the activation handbook template does not contain  information on the order in which any of the activation tasks should occur.  As a result, BOP does not have insight about the interdependencies  between activities or the way in which early delays in some activities  could affect activities later on as well as the overall activation completion  date. Additionally, without identifying linkages between activities, BOP  does not know the critical path of the activation process\u2014that is, which  activities can or cannot be delayed if the overall schedule is to be met.  This prevents the agency from providing Congress with reliable timeline  estimates or anticipated activation dates.", "Credible. The activation handbook and staffing timeline templates  that each of the six institutions modified did not meet the requirements  for a credible schedule, as illustrated in table 11.", "With respect to the best practice of vertically and horizontally aligning  activities, two institutions adapted BOP\u2019s activation handbook template to  insert targeted due dates for selected activities; however, neither  identified subset activities or linked overall activities in any specific order.  Without this vertical alignment, BOP is not positioned to ensure that  subactivities are on track for an overall activity\u2019s completion. Similarly,  without a clear sequencing of all activities, which is horizontal integration,  BOP also is limited in the extent to which it can monitor overall progress  toward activation. For risk assessment, neither the activation handbook  template nor the staffing timeline contains a schedule risk analysis. Such  an analysis typically focuses on key risks and how they affect the  schedule\u2019s activities. Without a schedule risk analysis, the likelihood of  the project\u2019s completion date or the activities or risks, such as funding  details, most likely to delay activation cannot be determined.", "The activation handbooks and general staffing timeline templates that  BOP has developed and institutions have modified during activation are  positive steps toward a baseline schedule that could be used to guide  future institution activations, because they provide some level of detail  regarding the activities required for activation. However, the activation  handbook and general staffing timeline contain only limited information  consistent with best practices and therefore cannot be used by  management to reliably measure, monitor, or report on performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact listed above, Joy Booth, Assistant Director;  Pedro Almoguera; Billy Commons; Adam Couvillion; Emily Gunn; and Jan  Montgomery made key contributions to this report.
