The Recovery Act is estimated to cost about $787 billion over the next several years, of which about $280 billion will be administered through states and localities. Funds made available under the Recovery Act are being distributed to states, localities, and other entities and individuals through a combination of grants and direct assistance. As Congress may know, the stated purposes of the Recovery Act are to: (1) preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery; (2) assist those most impacted by the recession; (3) provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health; (4) invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and (5) stabilize state and local government budgets, in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases. As described in GAO's March testimony, the Recovery Act specifies several roles for GAO including conducting bimonthly reviews of selected states' and localities' use of funds made available under the act. This statement today is based on our report being released today, Recovery Act: As Initial Implementation Unfolds in States and Localities, Continued Attention to Accountability Issues Is Essential, which is the first in a series of bimonthly reviews we will do on states' and localities' uses of Recovery Act funding and covers the actions taken under the Act through April 20, 2009.

Within these categories, the three largest programs are increased Medicaid Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) grant awards, funds for highway infrastructure investment, and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF). The funding notifications for Recovery Act funds for the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia (the District) have been approximately $24.2 billion for Medicaid FMAP on April 3, $26.7 billion for highways on March 2, and $32.6 billion for SFSF on April 2. Fifteen of the 16 states and the District have drawn down approximately $7.96 billion in increased FMAP grant awards for the period October 1, 2008 through April 1, 2009. The increased FMAP is for state expenditures for Medicaid services. The receipt of this increased FMAP may reduce the state share for their Medicaid programs. States have reported using funds made available as a result of the increased FMAP for a variety of purposes. For example, states and the District reported using these funds to maintain their current level of Medicaid eligibility and benefits, cover their increased Medicaid caseloads-which are primarily populations that are sensitive to economic downturns, including children and families, and to offset their state general fund deficits thereby avoiding layoffs and other measures detrimental to economic recovery. States are undertaking planning activities to identify projects, obtain approval at the state and federal level and move them to contracting and implementation. For the most part, states were focusing on construction and maintenance projects, such as road and bridge repairs. Before they can expend Recovery Act funds, states must reach agreement with the Department of Transportation on the specific projects; as of April 16, two of the 16 states had agreements covering more than 50 percent of their states' apportioned funds, and three states did not have agreement on any projects. While a few, including Mississippi and Iowa had already executed contracts, most of the 16 states were planning to solicit bids in April or May. Thus, states generally had not yet expended significant amounts of Recovery Act funds. The states and D.C. must apply to the Department of Education for SFSF funds. Education will award funds once it determines that an application contains key assurances and information on how the state will use the funds. As of April 20, applications from three states had met that determination- South Dakota, and two of GAO's sample states, California and Illinois. The applications from other states are being developed and submitted and have not yet been awarded. The states and the District report that SFSF funds will be used to hire and retain teachers, reduce the potential for layoffs, cover budget shortfalls, and restore funding cuts to programs. Planning continues for the use of Recovery Act funds. State activities indlude appointing Recovery Czars; establishing task forces and other entities, and developing public websites to solicit input and publicize selected projects. GAO found that the selected states and the District are taking various approaches to ensuring that internal controls manage risk up-front; they are assessing known risks and developing plans to address those risks. State auditors are also planning their work including conducting required single audits and testing compliance with federal requirements. Nearly half of the estimated spending programs in the Recovery Act will be administered by non-federal entities. State officials suggested opportunities to improve communication in several areas. Officials in nine of the 16 states and the District expressed concern about determining the jobs created and retained under the Recovery Act, as well as methodologies that can be used for estimation of each."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work examining the uses and  planning by selected states and localities for funds made available by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).

The federal  government matches state spending for Medicaid services according to a  formula based on each state\u2019s per capita income in relation to the national  average per capita income.  The amount of federal assistance states  receive for Medicaid service expenditures is known as the FMAP.", "Under the Recovery Act, states are eligible for an increased FMAP for  expenditures that states make in providing services to their Medicaid  populations.  The Recovery Act provides eligible states with an increased  FMAP for 27 months between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. On  February 25, 2009, CMS made increased FMAP grant awards to states, and  states may retroactively claim reimbursement for expenditures that  occurred prior to the effective date of the Recovery Act.  Generally, for  fiscal year 2009 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the increased  FMAP, which is calculated on a quarterly basis, provides for: (1) the  maintenance of states\u2019 prior year FMAPs; (2) a general across-the-board  increase of 6.2 percentage points in states\u2019 FMAPs; and (3) a further  increase to the FMAPs for those states that have a qualifying increase in  unemployment rates. For the first two quarters of 2009, the increases in  the FMAP for the 16 states and the District ranged from 7.09 percentage  points in Iowa to 11.59 percentage points in California, as shown in table 2.", "In our sample of 16 states and the District, officials from 15 states and the  District indicated that they had drawn down increased FMAP grant  awards, totaling $7.96 billion for the period of October 1, 2008 through  April 1, 2009\u201447 percent of their increased FMAP grant awards. In our  sample, the extent to which individual states and the District accessed  these funds varied widely, ranging from 0 percent in Colorado to about 66  percent in New Jersey. Nationally, the 50 states and several territories  combined have drawn down approximately $11 billion as of April 1, 2009,  which represents almost 46 percent of the increased FMAP grants  awarded for the first three quarters of federal fiscal year 2009 (table 3).", "In order for states to qualify for the increased FMAP available under the  Recovery Act, they must meet certain requirements. In particular    Maintenance of Eligibility: In order to qualify for the increased  FMAP, states generally may not apply eligibility standards,  methodologies, or procedures that are more restrictive than those in  effect under their state Medicaid programs on July 1, 2008.  In  guidance to states, CMS noted that examples of restrictions of  eligibility could include (1) the elimination of any eligibility groups  since July 1, 2008 or (2) changes in an eligibility determination or  redetermination process that is more stringent than what was in effect  on July 1, 2008. States that fail to initially satisfy the maintenance of  eligibility requirements have an opportunity to reinstate their eligibility  standards, methodologies, and procedures before July 1, 2009 and  become retroactively eligible for the increased FMAP.", "Compliance with Prompt Payment: Under federal law states are  required to pay claims from health practitioners promptly.  Under the  Recovery Act, states are prohibited from receiving the increased FMAP  for days during any period in which that state has failed to meet this  requirement.  Although the increased FMAP is not available for any  claims received from a practitioner on each day the state is not in  compliance with these prompt payment requirements, the state may  receive the regular FMAP for practitioner claims received on days of  non-compliance. CMS officials told us that states must attest that they  are in compliance with the prompt payment requirement, but that  enforcement is complicated due to differences across states in  methods used to track this information. CMS officials plan to issue  guidance on reporting compliance with the prompt payment  requirement and are currently gathering information from states on the  methods they use to determine compliance.", "Rainy Day Funds: States are not eligible for an increased FMAP if any  amounts attributable (either directly or indirectly) to the increased  FMAP are deposited or credited into any reserve or rainy day fund of  the state.", "Percentage Contributions from Political Subdivisions: In some  states, political subdivisions\u2014such as cities and counties\u2014may be  required to help finance the state\u2019s share of Medicaid spending. States  that have such financing arrangements are not eligible to receive the  increased FMAP if the percentage contributions required to be made  by a political subdivision are greater than what was in place on  September 30, 2008.", "In addition to meeting the above requirements, states that receive the  increased FMAP must submit a report to CMS no later than September 30,  2011 that describes how the increased FMAP funds were expended, in a  form and manner determined by CMS.  In guidance to states, CMS has  stated that further guidance will be developed for this reporting  requirement. CMS guidance to states also indicates that, for federal  reimbursement, increased FMAP funds must be drawn down separately,  tracked separately, and reported to CMS separately. Officials from several  states told us they require additional guidance from CMS on tracking  receipt of increased FMAP funds and on reporting on the use of these  funds.", "The increased FMAP available under the Recovery Act is for state  expenditures for Medicaid services.  However, the receipt of this  increased FMAP may reduce the state share for their Medicaid programs.  States have reported using these available funds for a variety of purposes.  In our sample, individual states and the District reported that they would  use the funds to maintain their current level of Medicaid eligibility and  benefits, cover their increased Medicaid caseloads\u2014which are primarily  populations that are sensitive to economic downturns, including children  and families, and to offset their state general fund deficits thereby avoiding  layoffs and other measures detrimental to economic recovery. Ten states  and the District reported using these funds to maintain program eligibility.  Nine states and the District reported using these funds to maintain  benefits. Specifically, Massachusetts reported that during a previous  financial downturn, the state limited the number of individuals eligible for  some services and reduced certain program benefits that were optional for  the state to cover. However, with the funds made available as a result of  the increased FMAP, the state did not have to make such reductions.", "Similarly, New Jersey reported that the state used these funds to eliminate  premiums for certain children in its State Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program, allowing it to retain coverage for children whose enrollment in  the program would otherwise have been terminated for non-payment of  premiums.", "Nine states and the District reported using these funds to cover increases  to their Medicaid caseloads, primarily to populations that are sensitive to  economic downturns, such as children and families. For example, New  Jersey indicated that these funds would help the state meet the increased  demand for Medicaid services. According to a New Jersey official, due to  significant job losses, the state\u2019s proposed 2010 budget would not have  accommodated all the applicants newly eligible for Medicaid and that the  funds available as a result of the increased FMAP have allowed the state to  maintain a \u201csafety net\u201d of coverage for uninsured and unemployed people.  Six states in our sample also reported that they used funds made available  as a result of the increased FMAP to comply with prompt payment  requirements. Specifically, Illinois reported that these funds will permit  the state to move from a 90-day payment cycle to a 30-day payment cycle  for all Medicaid providers. Three states also reported using these funds to  restore or to increase provider payment rates.", "In addition, 10 states and the District indicated that the funds made  available as a result of the increased FMAP would help offset deficits in  their general funds. Pennsylvania reported that because funding for its  Medicaid program is derived, in part, from state revenues, program  funding levels fluctuate as the economy rises and falls. However, the state  was able to use the funds made available to offset the effects of lower  state revenues. Arizona officials also reported that the state used funds  made available as a result of the increased FMAP to pay down some of its  debt and make payroll payments, thus allowing the state to avoid a serious  cash flow problem.", "In our sample, many states and the District indicated that they need  additional guidance from CMS regarding eligibility for the increased FMAP  funds. Specifically, 5 states raised concerns about whether certain  programmatic changes could jeopardize the state\u2019s eligibility for these  funds. For example, Texas officials indicated that guidance from CMS is  needed regarding whether certain programmatic changes being considered  by Texas, such as a possible extension of the program\u2019s eligibility period,  would affect the state\u2019s eligibility for increased FMAP funds. Similarly,  Massachusetts wanted clarification from CMS as to whether certain  changes in the timeframe for the state to conduct eligibility re- determinations would be considered a more restrictive standard. Four  states also reported that they wanted additional guidance from CMS  regarding policies related to the prompt payment requirements or changes  to the non-federal share of Medicaid expenditures. For example, California  officials noted that the state reduced Medicaid payments for in-home  support services, but that counties could voluntarily choose to increase  these payments without altering the cost sharing arrangements between  the counties and the state. The state wants clarification from CMS on  whether such an arrangement would be allowable in light of the Recovery  Act requirements regarding the percentage of contributions by political  subdivisions within a state toward the non-federal share of expenditures.", "In response to states\u2019 concerns regarding the need for guidance, CMS told  us that it is in the process of developing draft guidance on the prompt  payment provisions in the Recovery Act. One official noted that this  guidance will include defining the term practitioner, describing the types  of claims applicable under the provision, and addressing the principles  that are integral to determining a state\u2019s compliance with prompt payment  requirements. Additionally, CMS plans to have a reporting mechanism in  place through which states would report compliance under this provision.  With regard to Recovery Act requirements regarding political subdivisions,  CMS described their current activities for providing guidance to states.  Due to the variability of state operations, funding processes, and political  structures, CMS has been working with states on a case-by-case basis to  discuss particular issues associated with this provision and to address the  particular circumstances for each state.

Under this program, funds are  apportioned annually to each state department of transportation (or  equivalent) to construct and maintain roadways and bridges on the  federal-aid highway system.

States must follow the requirements for the existing program, and in  addition, the Recovery Act requires that the Governor must certify that the  state will maintain its current level of transportation spending, and the  governor or other appropriate chief executive must certify that the state or  local government to which funds have been made available has completed  all necessary legal reviews and determined that the projects are an  appropriate use of taxpayer funds.

Six submitted a \u201cconditional\u201d  certification, which means that the certification was subject to conditions  or assumptions, future legislative action, future revenues, or other  conditions.", "Recovery Act funding for highway infrastructure investment differs from  the usual practice in the Federal-Aid Highway Program in a few important  ways. Most significantly, for projects funded under the Recovery Act, the  federal share is 100 percent; typically projects require a state match of 20  percent while the federal share is typically 80 percent. Under the Recovery  Act, priority is also to be given to projects that are projected to be  completed within three years. In addition, within 120 days after the  apportionment by the Department of Transportation to the states (March  2, 2009), 50 percent of the apportioned funds must be obligated.  Any  amount of this 50 percent of apportioned funding that is not obligated may  be withdrawn by the Secretary of Transportation and redistributed to  other states that have obligated their funds in a timely manner.  Furthermore, one year after enactment, the Secretary will withdraw any  remaining unobligated funds and redistribute them based on states\u2019 need  and ability to obligate additional funds. These provisions are applicable  only to those funds apportioned to the state and not those funds required  by the Recovery Act to be suballocated to metropolitan, regional and local  organizations.", "Finally, states are required to give priority to projects that are located in  economically distressed areas as defined by the Public Works and  Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended. In March 2009, FHWA  directed its field offices to provide oversight and take appropriate action  to ensure that states gave adequate consideration to economically  distressed areas in selecting projects. Specifically, field offices were  directed to discuss this issue with the states and to document its review  and oversight of this process.", "States are undertaking planning activities to identify projects, obtain  approval at the state and federal level, and move projects to contracting  and implementation. However, because of the steps necessary before  implementation, states generally had not yet expended significant amounts  of Recovery Act Funds. States are required to reach agreement with DOT  on a list of projects. States will then request reimbursement from DOT as  the state makes payments to contactors working on approved projects.", "As of April 16, 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported that  nationally $6.4 billion of the $26.6 billion in Recovery Act highway  infrastructure investment funding provided to the states had been  obligated--meaning Transportation and the states had reached agreements  on projects worth this amount. As shown in Table 4 below, for the  locations that GAO reviewed, the extent to which the Department of  Transportation had obligated funds apportioned to the states and the  District ranged from 0 to 65 percent.  For two of the states, the  Department of Transportation had obligated over 50 percent of the states\u2019  apportioned funds, for 4 it had obligated 30 to 50 percent of the states\u2019  funds, for 9 states it had obligated under 30 percent of funds, and for three  it had not obligated any funds.", "While most states we visited had not yet expended significant funds, some  told us they were planning to solicit bids in April or May. Officials, also  stated that they planned to meet statutory deadlines for obligating the  highway funds. A few states had already executed contracts. As of April 1,  2009, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), for example,  had signed contracts for 10 projects totaling approximately $77 million.   These projects include the expansion of State Route 19 in eastern  Mississippi into a four-lane highway. This project fulfills part of MDOT\u2019s  1987 Four-Lane Highway Program which seeks to link every Mississippian  to a four-lane highway within 30 miles or 30 minutes. Similarly, as of April  15, 2009, the Iowa Department of Transportation had competitively  awarded 25 contracts valued at $168 million. Most often however, we  found that highway funds in the states and the District have not yet been  spent because highway projects were at earlier stages of planning,  approval, and competitive contracting. For example, in Florida, the  Department of Transportation (FDOT) plans to use the Recovery Act  funds to accelerate road construction programs in its preexisting 5-year  plan which will result in some projects being reprioritized and selected for  earlier completion. On April 15, 2009, the Florida Legislative Budget  Commission approved the Recovery Act-funded projects that FDOT had  submitted.", "For the most part, states were focusing their selection of Recovery Act- funded highway projects on construction and maintenance, rather than  planning and design, because they were seeking projects that would have  employment impacts and could be implemented quickly. These included  road repairs and resurfacing, bridge repairs and maintenance, safety  improvements, and road widening. For example, in Illinois, the  Department of Transportation is planning to spend a large share of its  estimated $655 million in Recovery Act funds  for highway and bridge  construction and maintenance projects in economically distressed areas,  those that are shovel-ready, and those that can be completed by February  2012. In Iowa, the contracts awarded have been for projects such as bridge  replacements and highway resurfacing\u2014shovel-ready projects that could  be initiated and completed quickly. Knowing that the Recovery Act would  include opportunities for highway investment, states told us they worked  in advance of the legislation to identify appropriate projects. For example,  in New York, the state DOT began planning to manage anticipated federal  stimulus money in November 2008.

The Recovery Act specifies that 81.8 percent (about $39.5 billion) is to be  distributed to states for support of elementary, secondary, and  postsecondary education, and early childhood education programs. The  remaining 18.2 percent of SFSF (about $8.8 billion) is available for basic  government services but may also be used for educational purposes. These  funds are to be distributed to states by formula, with 61 percent of the  state award based on the state\u2019s relative share of the population aged 5 to  24 and 39 percent based on the state\u2019s relative share of the total U.S.  population.

Since  applications from other states are now being developed and submitted,  they have not yet received their SFSF funds. The applications to Education  must contain certain assurances. For example, states must assure that, in  each of fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011, they will maintain state support  at fiscal year 2006 levels for elementary and secondary education and also  for public institutions of higher education (IHEs). However, the Secretary  of Education may waive maintenance of effort requirements if the state  demonstrates that it will commit an equal or greater percentage of state  revenues to education than in the previous applicable year. The state  application must also contain (1) assurances that the state is committed to  advancing education reform in increasing teacher effectiveness,  establishing state-wide education longitudinal data systems, and  improving the quality of state academic standards and assessments; (2)  baseline data that demonstrates the state\u2019s current status in each of the  education reform areas; and (3) a description of how the state intends to  use its stabilization allocation.", "Within two weeks of receipt of an approvable SFSF application, Education  will provide the state with 67 percent of its SFSF allocation.

In the second phase, Education intends to conduct a full  peer review of state applications before awarding the final allocations.", "After maintaining state support for education at fiscal year 2006 levels,  states are required to use the education portion of the SFSF to restore  state support to the greater of fiscal year 2008 or 2009 levels for  elementary and secondary education, public IHEs, and, if applicable, early  childhood education programs. States must distribute these funds to  school districts using the primary state education formula but maintain  discretion in how funds are allocated to public IHEs. If, after restoring  state support for education, additional funds remain, the state must  allocate those funds to school districts according to the Title I, Part A  funding formula. However, if a state\u2019s education stabilization fund  allocation is insufficient to restore state support for education, then a state  must allocate funds in proportion to the relative shortfall in state support  to public schools and IHEs. Education stabilization funds must be  allocated to school districts and public IHEs and cannot be retained at the  state level.", "Once stabilization funds are awarded to school districts and public IHEs,  they have considerable flexibility over how they use those funds. School  districts are allowed to use stabilization funds for any allowable purpose  under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), (commonly  known as the No Child Left Behind Act), the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, or the  Perkins Act, subject to some prohibitions on using funds for, among other  things, sports facilities and vehicles. In particular, because allowable uses  under the Impact Aid provisions of ESEA are broad, school districts have  discretion to use Recovery Act funding for things ranging from salaries of  teachers, administrators, and support staff to purchases of textbooks,  computers, and other equipment. The Recovery Act allows public IHEs to  use SFSF funds in such a way as to mitigate the need to raise tuition and  fees, as well as for the modernization, renovation, and repair of facilities,  subject to certain limitations. However, the Recovery Act prohibits public  IHEs from using stabilization funds for such things as increasing  endowments, modernizing, renovating, or repairing sports facilities, or  maintaining equipment. According to Education officials, there are no  maintenance of effort requirements placed on local school districts.  Consequently, as long as local districts use stabilization funds for  allowable purposes, they are free to reduce spending on education from  local-source funds, such as property tax revenues.", "States have broad discretion over how the $8.8 billion in SFSF funds  designated for basic government services are used. The Recovery Act  provides that these funds can be used for public safety and other  government services and that these services may include assistance for  education, as well as for modernization, renovation, and repairs of public  schools or IHEs, subject to certain requirements. Education\u2019s guidance  provides that the funds can also be used to cover state administrative  expenses related to the Recovery Act. However, the Act also places  several restrictions on the use of these funds. For example, these funds  cannot be used to pay for casinos (a general prohibition that applies to all  Recovery Act funds), financial assistance for students to attend private  schools, or construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of stadiums  or other sports facilities.", "States expected that SFSF uses by school districts and public IHEs would  include retaining current staff and spending on programmatic initiatives,  among other uses. Some states\u2019 fiscal condition could affect their ability to  meet maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements in order to receive SFSF  monies, but they are awaiting final guidance from Education on  procedures to obtain relief from these requirements. For example, due to  substantial revenue shortages, Florida has cut its state budget in recent  years and the state will not be able to meet the maintenance-of-effort  requirement to readily qualify for these funds. The state will apply to  Education for a waiver from this requirement; however, it is awaiting final  instructions from Education on submission of the waiver. Florida plans to  use SFSF funds to reduce the impact of any further cuts that may be  needed in the state education budget.", "In Arizona, state officials expect that SFSF recipients, such as local school  districts, will generally use their allocations to improve the tools they use  to assess student performance and determine to what extent performance  meets federal academic standards, rehire teachers that were let go  because of prior budget cuts, retain teachers, and meet the federal  requirement that all schools have equal access to highly qualified teachers,  among other things. Funds for the state universities will help them  maintain services and staff as well as avoid tuition increases. Illinois  officials stated that the state plans to use all of the $2 billion in State Fiscal  Stabilization funds, including the 18.2 percent allowed for government  services, for K-12 and higher education activities and hopes to avert layoffs  and other cutbacks many districts and public colleges and universities are  facing in their fiscal year 2009 and 2010 budgets. State Board of Education  officials also noted that U.S. Department of Education guidance allows  school districts to use stabilization funds for education reforms, such as  prolonging school days and school years, where possible. However,  officials said that Illinois districts will focus these funds on filling budget  gaps rather than implementing projects that will require long-term  resource commitments.

The Departments of Education, Housing and Urban  Development, Justice, Labor, Transportation, the Corporation for National  Community Service, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services have provided guidance for program  implementation, particularly for established programs. Although guidance  is expected, some new programs, such as Broadband Deployment Grants,  are awaiting issuance of implementation instructions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations and Recommendations: Moving Forward to Clarify Recovery Act Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["It has been a little over two months since enactment of the Recovery Act  and OMB has moved out quickly. In this period, OMB has issued two sets  of guidance, first on February 18 and next on April 3, with another round  to be issued within 60 days. OMB has sought formal public comment on its  April 3 guidance update and before this, according to OMB, reached out  informally to Congress, federal, state, and local government officials, and  grant and contract recipients to get a broad perspective on what is needed  to meet the high expectations set by Congress and the Administration. In  addition, OMB is standing up two new reporting vehicles, Recovery.gov,  which will be turned over to the Recovery Accountability and  Transparency Board and is expected to provide unprecedented public  disclosure on the use of Recovery Act funds, and a second system to  capture centrally information on the number of jobs created or retained.  As OMB\u2019s initiatives move forward and it continues to guide the  implementation of the Recovery Act, OMB has opportunities to build upon  its efforts to date by addressing several important issues.", "These issues can be characterized broadly in three categories: (1)  Accountability and Transparency Requirements, (2) Administrative  Support and Oversight, and (3) Communications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accountability and Transparency Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Recipients of Recovery Act funding face a number of implementation  challenges in this area. The Act includes many programs that are new or  new to the recipient and, even for existing programs; the sudden increase  in funds is out of normal cycles and processes. Add to this the expectation  that many programs and projects will be delivered faster so as to inject  funds into the economy and it becomes apparent that timely and efficient  evaluations are needed. The following are our recommendations to help  strengthen ongoing efforts to ensure accountability and transparency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Single Audit", "paragraphs": ["The single audit process is a major accountability vehicle but should be  adjusted to provide appropriate focus and the necessary level of  accountability over Recovery Act funds in a timelier manner than the  current schedule. OMB has been reaching out to stakeholders to obtain  input and is considering a number of options related to the single audit  process and related issues.", "We Recommend: To provide additional leverage as an oversight tool for  Recovery Act programs, the Director of OMB should adjust the current  audit process to:  focus the risk assessment auditors use to select programs to test for  compliance with 2009 federal program requirements on Recovery Act  funding;    provide for review of the design of internal controls during 2009 over  programs to receive Recovery Act funding, before significant  expenditures in 2010; and  evaluate options for providing relief related to audit requirements for  low-risk programs to balance new audit responsibilities associated  with the Recovery Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting on Impact", "paragraphs": ["Responsibility for reporting on jobs created and retained falls to non- federal recipients of Recovery Act funds. As such, states and localities  have a critical role in determining the degree to which Recovery Act goals  are achieved. Senior Administration officials and OMB have been soliciting  views and developing options for recipient reporting. In its April 3  guidance, OMB took an important step by issuing definitions, standard  award terms and conditions, and clarified tracking and documenting  Recovery Act expenditures. Furthermore, OMB and the Recovery  Accountability and Transparency Board are developing the data  architecture for the new federal reporting system that will be used to  collect recipient reporting information. According to OMB, state chief  information officers commented on an early draft and OMB expects to  provide an update for further state review.", "We Recommend: Given questions raised by many state and local officials  about how best to determine both direct and indirect jobs created and  retained under the Recovery Act, the Director of OMB should continue  OMB\u2019s efforts to identify appropriate methodologies that can be used to:  assess jobs created and retained from projects funded by the Recovery  Act;    determine the impact of Recovery Act spending when job creation is  indirect;  identify those types of programs, projects, or activities that in the past  have demonstrated substantial job creation or are considered likely to  do so in the future. Consider whether the approaches taken to estimate  jobs created and jobs retained in these cases can be replicated or  adapted to other programs.", "There are a number of ways that the needed methodologies could be  developed. One option would be to establish a working group of federal,  state and local officials and subject matter experts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Federal Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["Given that governors have certified to the use of funds in their states, state  officials are uncertain about their reporting responsibilities when  Recovery Act funding goes directly to localities. Additionally, they have  concerns about the capacity of reporting systems within their states,  specifically, whether these systems will be capable of aggregating data  from multiple sources for posting on Recovery.gov. Some state officials  are concerned that too many federal requirements will slow distribution  and use of funds and others have expressed reservations about the  capacity of smaller jurisdictions and non-profits to report data. Even those  who are confident about their own systems are uncertain about the cost  and speed of making any required modifications for Recovery.gov  reporting or further data collection.", "Problems also have been identified with federal systems that support the  Recovery Act as well. For example, questions have been raised about the  reliability of www.USASpending.gov (USAspending.gov) and the ability of  Grants.gov to handle the increased volume of grant applications. OMB is  taking concerted actions to address these concerns. It plans to reissue  USASpending guidance shortly to include changes in operations that are  expected to improve data quality. In a memorandum dated March 9, OMB  said that it is working closely with federal agencies to identify system risks  that could disrupt effective Recovery Act implementation and  acknowledged that Grants.gov is one such system. A subsequent  memorandum on April 8, offered a short-term solution to the significant  increase in Grants.gov usage while longer-term alternative approaches are  being explored. GAO has work underway to review differences in agency  policies and methods for submitting grant applications using Grants.gov  and will issue a report shortly.", "OMB addressed earlier questions about reporting coverage in its April 3  guidance. According to OMB there are limited circumstances in which  prime and sub recipient reporting will not be sufficient to capture  information at the project level. OMB stated that it will expand its current  model in future guidance. OMB guidance described recipient reporting  requirements under the Recovery Act\u2019s section 1512 as the minimum  which must be collected, leaving it to federal agencies to determine  whether additional information would be required for program oversight.", "We Recommend: In consultation with the Recovery Accountability and  Transparency Board and States, the Director of OMB should evaluate  current information and data collection requirements to determine  whether sufficient, reliable and timely information is being collected  before adding further data collection requirements.

In  considering other sources, states have asked whether the portion of the  State Fiscal Stabilization Fund that is available for government services  could be used for this purpose. Others have suggested a global approach  to increase the percentage for all Recovery Act grants funding that can be  applied to administrative costs. As noted earlier, state auditors also are  concerned with meeting increased audit requirements for Recovery Act  funding with a reduced number of staff and without a commensurate  reduction in other audit responsibilities or increase in funding. OMB and  senior administration officials are aware of the states\u2019 concerns and have a  number of options under consideration.", "We Recommend: The Director of OMB should timely clarify what  Recovery Act funds can be used to support state efforts to ensure  accountability and oversight, especially in light of enhanced oversight and  coordination requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communications", "paragraphs": ["State officials expressed concerns regarding communication on the  release of Recovery Act funds and their inability to determine when to  expect federal agency program guidance.

For example, they wish to be notified when funds are made available to  prime recipients that are not state agencies.", "Some of the uncertainty can be attributed to evolving reports and timing of  these reports at the federal level as well as the recognition that different  terms used by federal assistance programs add to the confusion. A  reconsideration of how best to publicly report on federal agency plans and  actions led to OMB\u2019s decision to continue the existing requirement to  report on the federal status of funds in the Weekly Financial and Activity  Reports and eliminate a planned Monthly Financial Report.
