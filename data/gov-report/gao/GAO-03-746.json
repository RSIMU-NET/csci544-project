In fiscal year 2003, OPS received $8.7 million for its R&D program, a sevenfold increase since fiscal year 1998. In response to a directive from the House Committee on Appropriations, GAO (1) assessed OPS's distribution of funding among various areas of R&D and the alignment of this funding with its mission and goals, (2) surveyed experts to obtain their views on R&D priorities, and (3) determined how OPS evaluates R&D outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OPS distributes its R&D budget among four main areas. For example, in fiscal year 2003, the office plans to allocate its $8.7 million budget as follows: 46 percent ($4.0 million) to developing new technologies to prevent damage to pipelines and prevent leaks; 21 percent ($1.9 million) to improving technologies for operating, controlling, and monitoring the condition of pipelines; 19 percent ($1.7 million) to improved pipeline materials, such as materials that are resistant to damage and defects; and 14 percent ($1.2 million) to efforts to improve data on the location and safety performance of pipelines. On the basis of our work, we believe that OPS's R&D funding is generally aligned with its mission and pipeline safety goals. OPS has taken a number of steps to ensure this alignment. For example, it obtained the views of a variety of experts and stakeholders in deciding on its R&D priorities and has described in various plans how its R&D efforts can lead to new and improved technologies that can help achieve its safety performance goals, such as reducing the impacts of pipeline accidents. The pipeline safety R&D priorities of the experts we surveyed are generally consistent with OPS's R&D priorities. For example, most assigned a high priority to the two areas of R&D that receive the highest amount of funding from OPS. OPS's efforts to evaluate the outcomes of its R&D have been limited. The agency has taken some preliminary steps toward developing an evaluation process for its R&D program, such as identifying possible measures of program results. Leading research organizations, the Office of Management and Budget, and GAO have identified a number of best practices for systematically evaluating the outcomes of federal R&D programs, such as setting clear R&D goals, measuring progress toward goals, and reporting periodically on evaluation results. These best practices can help OPS to determine the effectiveness of its R&D program in achieving desired outcomes, such as the development and use of new and improved technologies that can enhance pipeline safety."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pipelines transport nearly all of the natural gas and nearly two-thirds of the  crude oil and refined oil products in the United States.  Although pipelines  have a better safety record than other modes of freight transportation, their  cargo is dangerous and leaks or ruptures can have serious consequences,  including fatalities, harm to the environment, and property damage.  For  example, pipeline ruptures in Bellingham, Washington, in 1999 and in  Carlsbad, New Mexico, in 2000 together resulted in a total of 15 deaths and  property and other damages totaling about $46 million.  Investigators have  determined that one of the probable causes of the Bellingham accident was  excavation damage and that the cause of the Carlsbad accident was severe  internal corrosion.", "The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), within the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Research and Special Programs Administration, is  responsible for pipeline safety regulation and research.

Specifically, the program seeks to advance the most promising  technological solutions to problems that impede pipeline safety, such as  damage to pipelines from excavation or corrosion.  From fiscal years 2001  through 2003, the budget of OPS\u2019s R&D program more than tripled, from  $2.8 million to $8.7 million, partly as a result of congressional interest in  achieving technological advances that can improve pipeline safety.", "In House Report 107-722, which accompanied the Department of  Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for fiscal year  2003, the House Appropriations Committee raised concerns regarding the  effective management and utilization of these significant increases in  funding for the department\u2019s pipeline safety R&D program.  The committee  directed GAO to review the effectiveness of the program.  In subsequent  discussions with staff of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury,  and Independent Agencies of the House Appropriations Committee, we  agreed to determine  (1) OPS\u2019s distribution of funding among various areas  of pipeline safety R&D since fiscal year 2001 and the extent to which this  funding is aligned with the agency\u2019s mission and pipeline safety goals,    (2) the views of experts on pipeline safety R&D priorities, and  (3) how OPS  evaluates the outcomes of the pipeline safety R&D it funds.", "To carry out this work, we reviewed legislation and agency documents  pertaining to the R&D program and interviewed agency officials  responsible for this program.

We identified best  practices for evaluating the outcomes of R&D through a review of relevant  literature.  In addition, we sent a questionnaire to selected experts to obtain  their views on pipeline safety R&D priorities.  We selected experts who are  informed about pipeline safety or the development of new pipeline safety  technologies, including representatives of federal and state agencies,  pipeline safety advocacy groups, industry associations, pipeline  companies, technical and consulting organizations, and research institutes.

The agency primarily carries out this responsibility  through regulation, oversight, enforcement, and R&D.  OPS sets and  enforces regulations that pipeline operators must follow in designing,  constructing, maintaining, and operating pipelines.  State agencies  responsible for overseeing pipeline safety help OPS to enforce its  regulations.  In December 2000, it began implementing a new risk-based  regulatory approach, called \u201cintegrity management.\u201d  Under this approach,  operators are required, in addition to meeting minimum safety standards,  to better protect pipeline segments where a leak or rupture could have  significant consequences, such as near highly populated areas, by  conducting new tests of these segments, completing repairs according to  specified schedules, and developing comprehensive plans for addressing  the range of risks facing these segments.  The agency\u2019s R&D program is  aimed at advancing the most promising technologies for ensuring the safe  operations of pipelines.  For example, current R&D projects seek to  develop new and improved techniques for assessing the condition of  pipelines and detecting anomalies\u2014such as leaks, corrosion, and damage  from excavators\u2014that can lead to pipeline accidents.  From 1998 through  2002, a total of 1,770 pipeline accidents occurred, resulting in 100 fatalities  and $621 million in property damage.", "OPS\u2019s R&D program has undergone major changes in the last several years.   In particular, the agency has developed a new agenda for its R&D program,  using the input of key experts and stakeholders, and has received  significant increases in funding for this program.", "Until 2001, most of the research funded by OPS was aimed at helping the  agency perform its regulatory function or was in response to an accident  investigation or congressional direction.  In November 2001, the agency  held an R&D planning workshop to gain the perspectives of a variety of  experts and stakeholders on areas of R&D that have the most potential  for enhancing pipeline safety.  Attendees included representatives of  federal and state agencies, research organizations, industry groups,  pipeline companies, and technical organizations that set industry safety  standards.   OPS used the R&D priorities identified in this workshop to  develop a new agenda for its R&D program, focusing on three main  areas: (1) developing new technologies for preventing damage and  detecting leaks, (2) improving technologies for operating, controlling,   and monitoring the condition of pipelines, and (3) improving pipeline  materials.  From March through December 2002, the agency issued  announcements requesting project proposals in these areas, asking that  prospective funding recipients provide at least 50 percent of the  proposed project\u2019s cost.  As of May 2003, it had funded 10 R&D  proposals it received in response to these announcements.  In addition,  after its November 2001 R&D workshop, OPS established a Web site on  its R&D program in order to improve communications with experts,  stakeholders, and the public about its R&D agenda and activities.", "OPS\u2019s budget for its R&D program has risen more than sevenfold since  fiscal year 1998, with the most significant increases occurring since  fiscal year 2001.  Figure 1 shows the agency\u2019s budgeted amounts for  R&D from fiscal years 1998 through 2003.  OPS\u2019s budget for R&D rose  steadily from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2001, from $1.3 million to  $2.8 million.  In fiscal year 2002, the agency received $4.8 million for its  R&D program, which was $2 million more than RSPA had requested for  the program.  Agency officials attribute this funding increase to  increased concerns for pipeline safety within Congress following the  tragic pipeline accidents in Bellingham, Washington (1999), and  Carlsbad, New Mexico (2000), which together caused 15 fatalities.  For  fiscal year 2003, RSPA requested and received about $4 million in  additional funding for the program, for a total of $8.7 million.  OPS  officials told us that this requested increase was a response to  heightened congressional interest in achieving technological solutions  to pipeline safety, as evidenced by legislative proposals that called for  increased attention to this area.   RSPA is proposing funding for OPS\u2019s  R&D program of $9.2 million in fiscal year 2004, an increase of about  $0.5 million above the fiscal year 2003 amount.  OPS officials explained  that they intend to use most of this increase for a study, required by the  Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, to assess the performance of  controllers who monitor pipeline operations.  Overall, agency officials  also attribute recent increases in funding for OPS\u2019s pipeline safety R&D  program to a recognition of the challenges posed by the agency\u2019s new  integrity management regulatory approach and the criticality of the  nation\u2019s pipeline infrastructure, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks  of September 11, 2001.", "OPS\u2019s pipeline safety R&D program is continuing to evolve in response to  new directives in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 for the  planning and reporting of federal pipeline R&D efforts.

For example, they added Improved Materials  Performance to their R&D agenda because it was identified as a priority  area at the workshop.  They have also considered other factors in deciding  how to allocate funding.  For example, the agency significantly increased  funding for R&D in the areas of Damage Prevention and Leak Detection  and Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring because of a great  need for improved performance in these areas.  OPS officials explained  that, because the agency\u2019s new risk-based regulatory approach requires  pipeline operators to assess and mitigate risks to pipeline segments where  a leak or rupture could have significant consequences, these operators  need better tools and methods for monitoring pipelines and making  necessary repairs.  They also noted that OPS\u2019s R&D results assist in the  creation of industry standards on the appropriate use of new technologies.   In addition, officials explained that they decided to allocate a significant  portion of their R&D budget to the area of Improved Materials Performance  because, on the basis of current information on the development of  pipeline technologies, they believed that advances in this area held much  promise for improving pipeline safety.", "Finally, OPS has allocated about $1.2 million per year to the Mapping and  Information Systems area since fiscal year 2001 in order to maintain efforts  to improve these systems.

According to both liquid and gas pipeline associations, current  inspection tools cannot reliably detect such damage to pipelines.", "Eighty percent of the experts (39 of 49) indicated that the Enhanced  Operations, Controls, and Monitoring category should receive high or very  high funding priority. Within this category, the type of R&D that received  the most scores of high or very high funding priority (37 of 49) was the  improvement of alternative inspection techniques, called direct  assessment, to identify corrosion and other defects in pipelines that cannot  accommodate in-line inspection devices known as smart pigs.   This is a  significant issue for natural gas pipelines because the majority of these  pipelines cannot currently accommodate smart pigs, which are typically  used to assess the condition of liquid pipelines.", "In contrast to the experts\u2019 views on the importance of these first two  categories, less than one-third of the experts considered the remaining two  categories of R&D, Improved Materials Performance and Arctic and  Offshore Technologies, to be a high priority for OPS to fund.  Thirty-one  percent of the experts (15 of 49) assigned scores of high or very high  funding priority to the Improved Materials Performance category, and 20  percent (10 of 49) assigned such scores to the Arctic and Offshore  Technologies category.  However, within the category of Improved  Materials Performance, about half (25 of 49) of the experts indicated that  the type of R&D aimed at developing damage- and defect-resistant  materials should receive high or very high funding priority.  Such materials  could be used in the replacement of existing pipe or in the installation of  new pipe.  One researcher we interviewed noted that such materials are  particularly important for the gas pipeline industry, which is expanding its  infrastructure in response to increased demands for natural gas.  One  industry association estimates that the natural gas industry will need to  install about 49,500 miles of transmission pipeline from 2001 through 2015  to meet increased demand in the United States.", "Some differences exist in the views of experts from the following three  subgroups: (1) federal and state government and public interest  organizations, (2) pipeline industry and technical and consulting  organizations, and (3) research organizations.  As shown in table 2,  experts from all three subgroups generally gave the category of Damage  Prevention and Leak Detection the highest ranking, followed by the  category of Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring.  However,  experts from research organizations considered the categories of Improved  Materials Performance and Arctic and Offshore Technologies to be more  important for OPS to fund than did experts from the other two subgroups.   For example, 70 percent of experts from research organizations (7 of 10)  rated Improved Materials Performance as a high or very high priority  compared with 19 percent of experts from government and public interest  organizations (3 of 16) and 22 percent of experts from pipeline industry and  technical and consulting organizations (5 of 23).  In addition, 60 percent of  the researchers (6 of 10) rated Arctic and Offshore Technologies as a high  or very high priority for OPS compared with 19 percent of experts from  government and public interest organizations (3 of 16) and only 4 percent  of experts from pipeline industry and technical and consulting  organizations (1 of 23).", "An OPS official told us that he believed that researchers rated the Improved  Materials Performance category more highly than other experts did  because researchers have the best and most current information about the  \u201cstate of the art\u201d in technology development and are more aware of  opportunities in this area.  A leading expert from a pipeline research  organization noted that the foundation of pipeline R&D has been the  development of defect-resistant steels and that, as a consequence,  researchers in this area are very interested in R&D that will lead to further  improvements in the performance of pipeline materials.  He also explained  that researchers may have rated the Arctic and Offshore Technologies  category more highly than the other types of experts who completed our  questionnaire because researchers may be more aware of the need for such  R&D to support the construction of new pipelines in these areas in order to  reach new energy supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPS Lacks a Systematic Process for Evaluating R&D Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Although OPS has received significant increases in funding for its R&D  program in recent years, the agency has not developed a systematic  process for evaluating the effectiveness of its R&D program.
