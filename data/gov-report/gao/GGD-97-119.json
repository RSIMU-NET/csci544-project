As agreed, we are also providing information on trends for the number and cost of civilian employee relocations during this period.", "The General Services Administration (GSA) periodically has surveyed federal agencies to, among other things, obtain and analyze the estimated total payments for employee relocation travel. However, GSA\u2019s most recent survey of federal agencies\u2019 relocation travel was done in 1991 and the results have not been analyzed. To provide the requested information, for fiscal years 1991 through 1995, we surveyed executive branch departments; their subordinate agencies, bureaus, and administrations; and the largest independent agencies (hereafter referred to as federal organizations). In total we surveyed 120 federal organizations. These organizations employed about 1.9 million civilian employees, representing 96 percent of the federal civilian workforce as of September 1995. We received responses from 119 of the 120 organizations.", "Most of the 119 federal organizations that reported information on the numbers of relocations did so using one of two different categories: relocations authorized, that is, the number of civilian employees who were reported as approved to relocate; and relocations made, that is, the number of civilian employees who were reported as actually relocated.", "Similarly, most of the 119 federal organizations that reported on the costs of relocations did so using one of two different categories: relocation obligations, that is, the total funds obligated, for each fiscal year, at the time the relocation was approved and against which expenditures were to later be posted; and relocation expenditures, that is, the actual disbursements during each fiscal year for the costs incurred to relocate civilian employees.", "These different reporting categories for numbers and costs of relocations are not directly comparable. Accordingly, we report separately the information from the federal organizations that responded using each category. One organization, the Department of the Navy, reported its relocation information using all four reporting categories (relocations authorized and made and relocation obligations and expenditures). When Navy\u2019s components reported to Navy headquarters their number of civilian employees relocated, some components reported relocations authorized and others reported relocations made. Also, when reporting the cost of civilian employee relocations, some Navy components reported obligations and others reported expenditures. For this reason, we provide different segments of the Navy\u2019s relocation information in whichever of the categories Navy\u2019s components reported them for the number and costs to relocate civilian employees. As a result, in aggregating the data across all of the organizations in our survey, part of the Department of the Navy is included in each category. In total, we report relocations authorized for 97 organizations and relocations made for 23 organizations. Similarly, we report relocation obligations for 97 organizations and relocation expenditures for 23 organizations.", "The data provided in this report are based on the best information the federal organizations could provide and are not complete for each of the years for which we requested data. Several organizations did not provide information for all years during the 1991 through 1995 period. A few other organizations did not provide information for all of their components for all of the years during this period. In addition, some organizations did not provide certain types of relocation costs in their reported obligations or expenditures. As a result, the information in this report probably understates the actual numbers and costs of civilian employee relocations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal organizations relocate their civilian employees to help them accomplish their many varied and unique missions. Organizations carry out their missions through a civilian workforce of nearly 2 million employees assigned to offices in locations throughout the United States, its territories and possessions, and various foreign countries. The Secretary of State determines the length of an overseas tour for Foreign Service Officers. The tour of duty overseas for Department of Defense (DOD) employees is prescribed by DOD\u2019s Joint Travel Regulations (2 JTR). When civilian employees are authorized to relocate in the interests of the government, they are to be authorized to relocate prior to the time they actually move, and they generally have up to 2 years, and can request a third year, from the date that they report to their new location to complete the relocation and receive reimbursement for the associated costs. Therefore, the actual relocation may not take place in the fiscal year that it is authorized. Also, expenses associated with the relocation may be paid to the employee over the 2- to 3-year period.", "Two federal laws provide government organizations with the primary authority to pay the travel and related expenses of relocating a civilian employee: the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946, as amended, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5701-5742, and the Foreign Service Act of 1980, 22 U.S.C. 4081. GSA\u2019s Federal Travel Regulation (FTR), 41 C.F.R., chapters 301 to 304, implements the provisions of the Administrative Expenses Act. FTR, chapter 302, governs the travel and relocation expenses of civilian employees, except those in the Foreign Service. Based on authority provided in the Foreign Service Act, travel and relocation expenses for Foreign Service Officers are prescribed by the Secretary of State in the Foreign Service Travel Regulations. These regulations are contained in volume 6 of the Foreign Affairs Manual (6 FAM). Once any civilian employee is located in a foreign area, his or her travel allowances and differentials are set by the Secretary of State in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas).", "Both the Department of State\u2019s and GSA\u2019s travel regulations authorize federal organizations to pay basically the same expenses for relocations within the United States. These expenses include transportation of individuals, per diem, subsistence, transportation and storage of household and personal effects, and real estate expenses. The key difference is that Foreign Service Officers are not entitled to relocation income tax allowances. Overseas, the Standard Regulations apply to both Foreign Service Officers and other civilian employees, and generally provide them with the same allowances. These allowances include living quarters allowance, temporary quarters subsistence allowance, and cost of living allowance. One difference is that Foreign Service Officers are entitled to separation travel, which is relocation to anyplace in the United States that they choose upon retirement regardless of where they are located when they retire. On the other hand, other civilian employees returning from overseas are only entitled to reimbursement for travel and relocation expenses to their home of record. Another difference is that Foreign Service Officers may be authorized rest and recuperation travel when assigned to a hardship post. In order to receive reimbursement for relocation expenses/allowances to which they are entitled, both civilian employees and Foreign Service Officers must sign a service agreement to remain with the government for 12 months after the date that they report to their new duty station, mission, or agency, unless they leave the government for reasons beyond their control and that are acceptable to the agency. An employee who violates the agreement must repay the government the amount it spent to relocate him or her.", "Neither FTR nor FAM specifically define the term relocation. For the purposes of this report, we define relocation as (1) the transfer, in the interest of the government, of an existing civilian employee or appointee from one office, mission, or agency to another for permanent duty; (2) the moving of a new eligible appointee from his or her actual residence in one location to his or her first office or mission in another location; (3) the return of an existing eligible civilian employee or appointee who is separated from an overseas office or mission to his or her actual residence; and (4) the return of an existing eligible career appointee on retirement from an office or mission to his or her elected residence within the United States, its territories, or possessions.", "Collecting exact cost information for relocation travel is difficult. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates and Circular No. A-34 Instructions on Budget Execution require that federal organizations record obligations and expenditures by object class according to the nature of the services or articles procured. There are no object classes dedicated solely to recording relocation travel obligations and expenditures. Rather, relocation obligations and expenditures are captured in at least four different object classes, along with obligations and expenses that are not related to relocation travel. These object classes include (1) 12.1 civilian personnel benefits; (2) 21.0 travel and transportation of persons; (3) 22.0 transportation of things; and (4) 25.7 operation and maintenance of equipment (related to storage of household goods). As a result, relocation obligations and expenditures cannot be extracted from OMB budget/object class data. Instead, relocation obligations and expenditures must be obtained from each federal organization through queries of its automated systems or examination of its travel records.", "As the government\u2019s travel manager, GSA\u2019s Office of Governmentwide Policy is responsible for establishing governmentwide civilian travel and relocation policy, updating FTR, gathering travel and relocation costs, and providing leadership to develop sound travel and relocation policy. GSA was required by the Federal Civilian Employee and Contractor Travel Expenses Act of 1985, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5707(c), to periodically, but at least every 2 years, submit to the Director of OMB an analysis of, among other things, estimated total agency payments for employee relocation. GSA is to survey a sampling of agencies, each of which spent more than $5 million on travel and transportation payments in the prior fiscal year. This provision was to expire with the administrator\u2019s submission of the analysis that included fiscal year 1991. The Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 103-329 (Sept. 30, 1994), reinstated this provision with no future expiration date. GSA collected the required travel information for fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1991. However, GSA only analyzed the travel information for fiscal year 1989.

Our survey asked the federal organizations to include costs incurred in all of these expense categories and to indicate if there were categories of expenses for which they could not provide cost data.", "While federal organizations are not required to track or keep relocation data in a specific way, they are required to maintain travel records for 6 years that contain information on reimbursements for individuals. Based on your request for relocation information over the last several years, our questionnaire was designed to collect relocation information for fiscal years 1990 through 1995. However, at the time we sent the questionnaires to the federal organizations, they were required to have data for fiscal years 1991 through 1996, and many organizations could not provide the data for 1990. Therefore, our report presents information for fiscal years 1991 through 1995.", "Although most federal organizations were able to provide the requested information for fiscal years 1991 through 1995, the total numbers and costs of relocations are understated in three respects. First, 15 organizations were not able to provide any information for 1 or more years for one or two of the four reporting categories. Second, 10 federal organizations reported that they could not provide any cost information for one or more of the expense categories. Lastly, 6 organizations said that the information they reported did not include data from all components for at least 1 year. Federal organizations\u2019 reasons for not being able to provide the requested information included (1) records were inaccessible due to asbestos contamination; (2) records were incomplete due to office or base closures or realignments; (3) records had been sent to off-site storage; (4) accounting systems had changed during the period; and (5) the inability to separate relocation related travel expenses from other travel expenses.", "We did not independently verify the accuracy of the relocation information that the federal organizations provided because of time constraints and the number of federal organizations surveyed. However, we reviewed each questionnaire for clarity and completeness and followed up with the federal organization\u2019s contact personnel in those instances in which the response(s) was unclear or incomplete.", "To provide information on rotational policies that resulted in civilian employee relocations, we obtained copies of these policies from the pertinent federal organizations. We reviewed the policies to understand their purposes, their rotational requirements, and which employees were affected. Additionally, we interviewed cognizant officials to discuss the policies in greater detail, clarify specific issues, and determine current use of the policies.", "We did our work in Washington, D.C., from June 1996 to June 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We did not request comments on this report from the heads of the 119 federal organizations that responded to our survey because it was impractical. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Director of OMB and the Administrator of GSA. GSA provided oral comments, which are discussed in this report. In addition, GSA and OMB provided technical comments, which are incorporated in the report where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Number of Relocations Authorized by 97 Federal Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Cooperative, State, Research, Education, and Extension Service (continued)", "Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Health Care Policy & Research Health Resources & Services Administration Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration Administration for Children and Families Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (continued)", "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Federal Law Enforcement Training Center Office of the Comptroller of the Currency(continued)", "UA: data were not available.", "Fiscal year 1991 does not include data from Europe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Number of Relocations Made by 23 Federal Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Table notes on next page)", "Not all components of NOAA reported for each fiscal year, most notably, the National Weather Service.", "According to an Army Official, relocations made reported for fiscal year 1991 are underreported.", "Fiscal year 1992 data were not available from the Bonneville Power Administration.", "Information reported on a calendar-year basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Relocation Obligations by 97 Federal Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Obligations reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (Table notes on next page)", "UA: data were not available.", "Obligations reported do not include nontemporary storage of household goods expenses.", "Obligations reported for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 do not include enroute travel expense.", "Obligations reported do not include overseas renewal agreement expenses.", "Questionnaire was sent to multiple installations for completion but not all installations were able to report obligations for all categories of expenses.", "Obligations for fiscal year 1994 do not include regional data.", "Obligations reported for fiscal years 1991 to 1995 do not include relocation service contract expenses.", "Obligations reported do not include miscellaneous moving expenses.", "Obligations reported do not include transportation and storage of household goods, mobile homes, and vehicle expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Relocation Expenditures by 23 Federal Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Expenditures reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars) (continued)", "Expenditures reported by fiscal year (nominal dollars)", "Fiscal year 1992 data were not available from the Bonneville Power Administration.", "Expenditures reported do not include overseas renewal agreement expenses.", "Information reported on a calendar-year basis.", "Expenditures reported do not include enroute travel expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Gerald P.
