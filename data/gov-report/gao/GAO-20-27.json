These reforms are aimed at controlling the program's expenditures and incentivizing efficient broadband deployment. According to FCC's strategic plan, FCC must ensure the high-cost program is well managed, efficient, and fiscally responsible. One of the reforms that GAO reviewed established a funding mechanism for the carriers whereby FCC determines the level of financial support to provide the carriers based on cost and revenue estimates produced by a model. Stakeholders told GAO that this model-based funding mechanism is less prone to fraud risks than the traditional cost-accounting funding mechanism, which reimburses carriers for their reported costs. However, FCC did not make use of this reform mandatory and a substantial number of rate-of-return carriers continue to receive support from the traditional funding mechanism. FCC officials said they developed the model-based funding mechanism in consultation with industry stakeholders. However, FCC officials said they did not have plans to assess the accuracy of cost estimates from the model, which has been in use for several years, or require carriers to receive model-based support as a way to reduce fraud risks. By assessing the model, FCC would have greater assurance that it is producing reliable cost estimates and be better positioned to determine whether to make its use mandatory.", "FCC has some policies and processes in place to manage fraud risks for the high-cost program.

FCC is also developing a data-analytics tool to help detect fraud, and in August 2019 launched a new Fraud Division to focus on investigating fraud in the Universal Service Fund's programs. However, FCC's efforts do not fully align with some elements of GAO's fraud risk framework, including:", "designing and implementing an antifraud strategy for the program.", "Without regular fraud-risk assessments of the high-cost program, FCC has no assurance that it has fully considered important fraud risks, determined its tolerance for risks that could be lower priorities, or made sound decisions on how to allocate resources to respond to fraud risks. Not doing so could result in FCC compensating carriers for improper, ineligible, or inflated costs. Furthermore, in the absence of an antifraud strategy, FCC has little assurance that it can prevent or detect the types of documented rate-of-return carrier misconduct that have previously occurred.

The 1996 Act  altered the federal mechanism for funding universal service by requiring  telecommunications carriers and other entities providing interstate  telecommunications service to contribute to the USF, unless exempted by  FCC.

The high-cost program provides support to both wireline and  wireless carriers that provide telecommunications services in areas that  carriers would otherwise not serve and where there is no competition  from other providers. These are typically rural or remote areas where the  customer base is relatively small and the cost of installing infrastructure is  high. The high-cost program has been the largest USF program based on  disbursements and has been particularly important to rural areas. High- cost support is intended to offset the carriers\u2019 higher costs, thereby  allowing them to provide services and rates that are reasonably  comparable to those that consumers in lower-cost\u2014generally urban\u2014 areas receive.", "In 2009, Congress required FCC to develop a broadband plan to ensure  that every American has access to broadband capability, including a  detailed plan for providing this service at affordable rates. In response,  an FCC task force issued the National Broadband Plan in 2010, which  recommended reforming USF so it could support both telephone and  broadband service.

An FCC OIG investigation later revealed that the carrier had manipulated  FCC\u2019s accounting rules by including the costs of a nonregulated,  commercial mobile radio service in the information it submitted to NECA,  thus inflating the amount of high-cost program support the carrier  received. FCC eventually determined that the carrier owed the federal  government almost $7 million in support overpayments received between  2005 and 2010. A petition for reconsideration is pending.

In particular, unlike the traditional cost-accounting-support  mechanism, model-based support does not rely on carrier-submitted data  to determine support amounts. Instead, the model uses, among other  things, a combination of historical cost data and other data, such as  expected customer revenue, to determine support amounts. Since there  are no data provided by carriers in the process of determining support  amounts, there is no means by which carriers can provide falsified  information to fraudulently receive excess support. The carriers involved  in the previously described improper payments cases were receiving  support from the traditional cost-accounting support mechanism.", "On the other hand, stakeholders told us FCC\u2019s traditional cost-accounting  support mechanism is complex and difficult to audit, and that such  weaknesses make it prone to fraud risks. For example, USAC officials  told us it is time consuming to detect inflated costs associated with  carriers\u2019 affiliate company transactions. The traditional cost-accounting  support mechanism also requires that carriers separate costs based upon  the type of service with which the cost was associated. According to  FCC\u2019s OIG officials and representatives from accounting firms we  contacted, determining whether a carrier has overly attributed costs to  eligible services is difficult. For instance, determining if labor costs are  properly being allocated between eligible and ineligible services requires  looking at each employee\u2019s timesheet. According to USAC, it also faces  challenges auditing traditional cost-accounting support payments due to  limited expertise and capacity to address the complexity of the audits.  USAC officials noted that this issue has been exacerbated by audit staff  turnover. According to USAC officials and some stakeholders we  contacted, auditing carriers receiving traditional cost-accounting support  is also difficult due to the extensive documentation requirements for this  type of support, requirements that often entails hundreds of pages of  financial information per carrier. USAC officials told us that a single audit  can take over 1,000 hours to complete, and USAC officials told us they  only completed 10 audits of carriers that received support on a traditional  cost-accounting basis in fiscal year 2018.", "As previously noted, FCC allows carriers to choose which funding  mechanism is best suited for their company. FCC officials told us they  developed the model-based funding mechanism in consultation with  carriers and industry stakeholders. However, according to FCC officials,  the model\u2019s use is not mandatory because some carriers do not believe  that the model would accurately reflect their specific costs. FCC officials  said the agency does not have plans to assess the accuracy of the  model\u2019s cost estimates or require carriers to receive model-based  support. FCC officials told us they did not have plans to assess the  model. FCC officials told us they had not  planned to do so because in  May 2019 FCC had just made available model-based support to the  remaining legacy carriers, and FCC was still in the process of evaluating  next steps. Planning for and conducting such an assessment would  enable FCC to demonstrate the validity of the model and its reliability in  accounting for the costs of broadband deployment. Federal internal- control standards state that management should use quality information  to make informed decisions and evaluate program performance in  achieving key objectives. Furthermore, according to FCC\u2019s strategic  plan, FCC must ensure its USF programs, including those for the high- cost program, are well managed, efficient, and fiscally responsible, and  the National Broadband Plan says that FCC should move rate-of-return  carriers to incentive-based regulation mechanisms, such as model-based  support. Yet because a substantial number of rate-of-return study areas\u2014 437\u2014continue to receive traditional cost-accounting support, and the  carriers that provide service in these areas cannot be effectively audited,  significant fraud risks remain for the high-cost program.

According to  FCC officials, FCC has steering committees for each of the four USF  programs, including the high-cost program. According to FCC officials,  the steering committees allow in-depth discussions about each program,  including on operational issues such as current spending levels and  information technology systems, as well as improper payments and other  issues. However, fraud risk is but one of many responsibilities of these  steering committees, and they do not fill the role of a dedicated fraud risk- management entity, as called for by the fraud risk framework. In August  2019, FCC officially launched a Fraud Division\u2014comprising existing FCC  staff who investigate and prosecute fraud\u2014within its Enforcement  Bureau.

An effective antifraud entity tailors  the approach for carrying out regular fraud-risk assessments of its  programs. According to GAO\u2019s fraud risk framework, the approach  should, among other things:  fully consider the specific fraud risks the agency or program faces, analyze the potential likelihood and effects of fraud schemes, and document prioritized fraud risks.", "According to FCC officials, FCC has annually worked with USAC high- cost program staff to identify and assess some risks facing the high-cost  program, some of which are fraud risks, but has not planned regular  fraud-risk assessments that are tailored to the high-cost program in  accordance with GAO\u2019s fraud risk framework. FCC officials also told us  that they adopted a tool originally developed by another agency that was  used to evaluate risks facing that agency\u2019s loan and grant programs, not  just fraud risks. Using that tool as a model, FCC created a risk  assessment document that included fraud risk as one of nine categories  of risks across the high-cost program. Based on our discussions with  FCC officials, however, the document does not constitute a fraud-risk  assessment that takes into account changes to the program or operating  environment. Furthermore, the risk assessment document does not  constitute a fully tailored risk assessment because it does not identify and  assess the fraud risks stakeholders we interviewed described as inherent  to the high-cost program, detailed below.", "Risk caused by the complexity of the high-cost program\u2019s cost- allocation rules.

A fraud risk profile is the summation of key  findings and conclusions from a fraud-risk assessment, including the  analysis of the types of internal and external fraud risks, their perceived  likelihood and effects, managers\u2019 risk tolerance, and the prioritization of  risks. FCC officials said they consider the risk of fraud to be low in the  high-cost program, and FCC includes fraud risk in its current risk  assessment process. Since FCC believes the fraud risk is low for the  high-cost program, FCC has not deemed it necessary to conduct a  separate fraud-risk assessment of the program. For example, FCC  provided us with documentation related to its Enterprise Risk  Management activities that identifies risks USAC faces to achieving its  corporate objectives. However, while FCC considers fraud risks as part of  these activities, the document does not specify the fraud risk tolerance for  the program or constitute a fraud risk profile.", "Without conducting regular fraud-risk assessments to gauge the  likelihood and effects of the inherent fraud risks described above, and  potentially others, FCC cannot determine or document the program\u2019s  fraud risk profile. Furthermore, FCC has no assurance that it has fully  considered important fraud risks, determined its tolerance for risks that  could be lower priorities, or made sound decisions on how to allocate  resources to respond to fraud risks. Not doing so could result in FCC  compensating carriers for improper, ineligible, and inflated costs, such as  in the previously discussed cases of identified fraud. By regularly  assessing fraud risks to determine a fraud risk profile, FCC could better  determine the extent to which it has designed and implemented adequate  fraud-prevention controls.", "Designing and implementing an antifraud strategy for the program.  Managers who effectively manage fraud risk develop and document an  antifraud strategy that describes the program\u2019s activities for preventing,  detecting, and responding to the fraud risks identified during the fraud-risk  assessment. FCC and USAC have established mechanisms to enhance  the oversight of USF programs, mechanisms that can also help mitigate  fraud risks for the high-cost program, including:  In fiscal year 2016, USAC implemented a risk-based selection method  for conducting audits to identify the entities with the greatest risk.", "USAC forwards potential fraud, waste, and abuse cases to FCC.", "FCC\u2019s OIG established a hotline that can be used to report potential  fraud, and USAC established a Whistleblower Alert mechanism to  inform USAC of possible instances of universal service support being  misapplied or mismanaged, or when carriers are potentially violating  laws, rules, or regulations. USAC shares this information with FCC.", "FCC and USAC formed a working group tasked with developing a  data-analytics tool designed to share USAC high-cost program data  with FCC. FCC\u2019s documentation of the tool states that once  developed, the tool will help FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau in its fraud  detection activities across all USF programs. FCC officials described  the development of the tool as technically challenging and said there  is no established timeline for implementing the tool.", "FCC officials said that FCC has regular, informal interactions  concerning fraud risk with USAC and, to a lesser degree, with NECA  and that FCC has confidence that USAC\u2019s improved audit processes  are identifying issues appropriately.", "However, FCC has not specifically designed or implemented an overall  strategy to mitigate fraud risks across the high-cost program. An FCC  official said FCC believes its existing antifraud activities are adequate.  The FCC official said FCC considers the risk of fraud in the high-cost  program to be low because USAC audits have revealed that carriers\u2019  financial reporting errors occur at a low rate and therefore do not indicate  that a large amount of fraud is occurring. The official said FCC\u2019s fraud  risk-management practices are based on federal internal-control  standards and are woven into existing FCC mechanisms.", "Given that FCC has not conducted a fraud-risk assessment that is  tailored to the high-cost program and that the deceptive nature of fraud  makes it difficult to measure in a reliable way, it is unclear how FCC  officials reached the conclusion that the program\u2019s risk of fraud is low.  Also, in the absence of an antifraud strategy, FCC has little assurance  that it has the specific control activities to prevent and detect high-cost  program fraud and that the types of misconduct that previously occurred  are not widespread. The improper payment activity discussed previously  was caught after USAC provided support to these carriers, and it was not  prevented or detected through any strategic fraud risk-management effort  on FCC\u2019s part. Furthermore, the FCC\u2019s OIG has expressed significant  concerns about such abuses by rate-of-return carriers and about the  effectiveness of USAC\u2019s auditing processes in helping prevent improper  payments to these carriers. As noted above, USAC\u2019s high-cost program  audits can take over 1,000 hours and USAC faces human capital  challenges that have diminished its audit capacity. In addition, while  NECA\u2019s data validations and reviews of high-cost support provide  opportunities to identify input and data-reporting errors, they do not  specifically address whether or not the data provided by carriers are  reasonable or if the money carriers spent addresses the intended  purposes of the high-cost program. Designing and implementing an  antifraud strategy that conforms to leading practices would help FCC  effectively manage and respond to the fraud risks identified during the  fraud-risk assessments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the continuing importance of deploying telecommunications  services in difficult-to-serve areas, effective oversight for rate-of-return  carriers is an important component for helping ensure that the high-cost  program\u2019s finite funds are used properly to meet the intent of the program.  Overall, the traditional cost-accounting mechanism that FCC uses to  provide support to a substantial number of rate-of-return carriers is  complex, prone to fraud risks, and presents auditing challenges that FCC  has not fully addressed. By following leading practices from GAO\u2019s fraud  risk framework, FCC could better ensure that it is addressing and  strategically targeting the most significant fraud risks facing the high-cost  program. Furthermore, FCC\u2019s model-based support mechanism has now  been in use by some rate-of-return carriers for several years and  stakeholders agree that it is less prone to fraud risks. However, FCC has  not assessed the extent to which the model is producing reliable cost  estimates.
