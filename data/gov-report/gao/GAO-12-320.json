There is no longer parole for federal offenders and BOP has limited authority to affect the length of an inmate's prison sentence. BOP has some statutory authorities and programs to reduce the amount of time an inmate remains in prison, which when balanced with BOP\u0092s mission to protect public safety and prepare inmates for reentry, can help reduce crowding and the costs of incarceration. GAO was asked to address: (1) the extent to which BOP utilizes its authorities to reduce a federal prisoner\u0092s period of incarceration; and (2) what factors, if any, impact BOP's use of these authorities. GAO analyzed relevant laws and BOP policies; obtained nationwide data on inmate participation in relevant programs and sentence reductions from fiscal years 2009 through 2011; conducted site visits to nine BOP institutions selected to cover a range of prison characteristics and at each, interviewed officials responsible for relevant programs; and visited four community-based facilities serving the institutions visited.

BOP primarily utilizes three authorities\u0097the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP), community corrections, and good conduct time.", "(1) Eligible inmates can participate in RDAP before release from prison, but those eligible for a sentence reduction are generally unable to complete RDAP in time to earn the maximum reduction (generally 12 months). During fiscal years 2009 through 2011, of the 15,302 inmates who completed RDAP and were eligible for a sentence reduction, 2,846 (19 percent) received the maximum reduction and the average reduction was 8.0 months. BOP officials said that participants generally do not receive the maximum reduction because they have less than 12 months to serve when they complete RDAP.", "(2) To facilitate inmates\u0092 reintegration into society, BOP may transfer eligible inmates to community corrections locations for up to the final 12 months of their sentences. Inmates may spend this time in contract residential re-entry centers (RRCs)\u0097also known as halfway houses\u0097and in detention in their homes for up to 6 months. Based on the most recently available data, almost 29,000 inmates completed their sentences through community corrections in fiscal year 2010, after an average placement of about 4 months; 17,672 in RRCs, 11,094 in RRCs then home detention, and 145 in home detention only. RRCs monitor inmates in home detention and charge BOP 50 percent of the daily RRC cost to do so. However, BOP does not require RRC contractors to separate the price of home detention services from the price of RRC beds and thus, does not know the actual costs of home detention. BOP officials stated that they are developing a process to review and amend existing RRC contracts and require new contractors to submit proposals separating out RRC and home detention prices, but did not document the specifics of the review process or establish time frames or milestones for the review. Thus, BOP does not have a roadmap for how it will achieve this goal.", "(3) Most eligible inmates receive all of their potential good conduct time credit for exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations\u009754 days taken off their sentence, per year served, if an inmate has earned or is earning a high school diploma; 42 days if not. As of the end of fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011, about 87 percent of inmates had earned all of their available credit.", "BOP also has other authorities, such as releasing prisoners early for very specialized reasons, but has used these less frequently for various reasons.", "Inmate eligibility and lack of capacity impact BOP\u0092s use of certain flexibilities and programs that can reduce an inmate\u0092s time in prison. BOP officials cited inmate ineligibility for RRC placement (e.g., inmates who are likely to escape or be arrested or with sentences of 6 months or less, among other things) as the primary reason that some inmates are not released through community corrections and one of the main reasons that some inmates are not able to participate in RDAP. BOP\u0092s lack of additional RRC space has prevented it from increasing the length of its RRC placements. According to BOP, lack of program capacity also prevents eligible inmates from entering and completing RDAP early enough to earn their maximum allowable sentence reductions, which prevents BOP from maximizing the cost savings provided by the authority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BOP establish a plan, including time frames and milestones, for requiring contractors to submit prices of RRC beds and home detention services.

According to BOP  officials, the Director has motioned sentencing judges for inmates\u2019  early releases in a limited number of cases. For instance, BOP has  historically interpreted \u201cextraordinary and compelling circumstances\u201d  as limited to cases where the inmate has a terminal illness with a life  expectancy of 1 year or less or has a profoundly debilitating medical  condition. The USSC issued guidance that listed a number of  additional circumstances, such as the death or incapacitation of the  inmate\u2019s only family member capable of caring for the inmate\u2019s minor  child or children.

Throughout the typical 6-month program, inmate participants  were required to adhere to a highly regimented schedule of strict  discipline, physical training, hard labor, drill, job training, educational  programs, and substance abuse counseling. BOP provided inmates who  successfully completed the program and were serving sentences of 12 to  30 months with a sentence reduction of up to 6 months. All inmates who  successfully completed the program were eligible to serve the remainder  of their sentences in community corrections locations, such as RRCs or  home detention.

Specifically, BOP\u2019s RRC program  statement prohibits certain inmates from placement in an RRC. For  example, inmates with detainers, with sentences of 6 months or less, who  refuse to satisfy BOP\u2019s Financial Responsibility Program, or who are in  civil commitment status are all ineligible for RRC placement. According  to BOP, inmates with detainers are deemed inappropriate for placement  in community corrections due to the increased risk of escape and for  those with immigration detainers, the likelihood of deportation. Moreover,  all inmates who have financial obligations, whether court-ordered  restitution, court fees, or tax liabilities, must comply with the Financial  Responsibility Program to participate in programming including  community corrections. This ineligibility for RRC placement also  disqualifies an inmate from placement in home detention. Figure 4 shows  the number of inmates ineligible for RRC placement from April 2008 to  March 2011.", "BOP officials stated that certain offenses committed by inmates may also  make it difficult for BOP to place them in RRCs. For example, according  to BOP officials, some RRCs are required to enter into agreements with  communities regarding the type of inmates they will house and some  communities have enacted local laws that prohibit the placement of  certain inmates such as sex offenders and arsonists in a communal  setting. Other reasons inmates may not be placed in RRCs include the  inmate\u2019s refusal to be placed or the inmate\u2019s medical or mental health  needs that could not be accommodated at the RRC. According to BOP  officials, inmates may refuse RRC placement for a variety of reasons but  the reasons for refusal cited most often by officials during our site visits to  BOP facilities included:  some RRC accommodations are perceived by some inmates to be  subpar compared to prisons;  some minimum-security and low-security inmates do not want to  reside in RRCs with higher security inmates; and  some inmates do not want to pay the 25 percent subsistence fee.", "To participate in RDAP, inmates must be able to complete both the  institution and the RRC components of the program. As a result, inmates  who are prohibited from transferring to RRCs are excluded from RDAP.  For instance, BOP estimates that 2,500 criminal aliens would participate  in RDAP each year, but are ineligible due to immigration detainers. Prior  to a 1996 BOP policy change, inmates with detainers could complete the  program by participating in transitional treatment within a BOP institution.  However, according to BOP officials, transitional treatment within an  institution is ineffective because the inmate remains sheltered from the  partial freedoms and outside pressures experienced during an RRC  placement.", "Realizing that potential cost savings could result from early releases of  criminal aliens, among other reasons, BOP is considering changing its  policy and allowing eligible nonviolent criminal aliens to complete the  RDAP program without the RRC component and receive sentence  reductions of up to 1 year for successful completion. According to BOP,  this policy shift would require a rule change and the development of  procedures to ensure that no U.S. citizen was displaced from participating  in RDAP. BOP officials stated that decisions on this issue would not be  made until expanded program capacity becomes available, which is  currently uncertain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Available Capacity Impacts BOP\u2019s Use of RRCs and RDAP", "paragraphs": ["A lack of RRC beds limits BOP\u2019s ability to further utilize RRC placements.

Although BOP officials at institutions we visited stated that they assessed  inmates on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate RRC  placement length, the officials stated that referrals can be reduced due to  RRC capacity constraints. According to BOP officials, in fiscal year 2010,  about 2.7 percent of eligible inmates were denied placement due to a lack  of bed space. BOP faces challenges in increasing its RRC bed space  capacity, which limits its ability to increase the length of RRC placements.  According to BOP community corrections officials, BOP has difficulty  acquiring new RRC contracts and increasing its RRC capacity because of  local zoning restrictions and the unwillingness of many communities to  accept nearby RRCs.", "Although the Second Chance Act increased BOP\u2019s flexibility to place  inmates in RRCs for up to 12 months, as reported by BOP officials,  challenges facing the expansion of its RRC capacity limit the impact of  this increased flexibility. As of November 2011, BOP reported that  available contracted RRC bed space was 8,859 estimated beds. For each  available RRC bed, BOP can transfer one inmate to the RRC for a  maximum of 12 months, or BOP could send multiple inmates for shorter  placements (e.g., three inmates for 4 months each). As such, for this  increased flexibility to have an impact on the average length of RRC  placements, RRC capacity would need to increase. To provide all eligible  inmates with the maximum allowable 12 months in an RRC, BOP would  require about 29,000 available beds annually.", "Some inmates are more affected by capacity constraints than others,  such as those with criminal records of sex offenses or those being  released into urban areas with few RRCs. According to BOP, only a  limited number of RRCs are able to accept sex offenders, and thus BOP,  at the onset, has a limited number of RRC beds for sex offender  placement. In addition, inmates releasing to urban areas may have their  placement lengths reduced due to capacity constraints. For example,  BOP staff we interviewed during our site visits identified shortages of  RRC beds in Southern California, North Carolina, and the Washington,  D.C. metropolitan area affecting the length of RRC placements. When  referring inmates for RRC placements, BOP considers the inmate\u2019s  original sentencing location to facilitate transition and successful reentry.  As such, BOP\u2019s utilization of RRC placements is limited in geographical  areas that do not have enough RRC beds to accommodate returning  inmates.", "According to BOP officials, systemwide program capacity similarly  constrains BOP\u2019s utilization of RDAP sentence reductions\u2014specifically,  BOP\u2019s ability to admit RDAP participants early enough to earn their  maximum allowable sentence reductions. BOP officials stated that the  RDAP sentence reduction incentive caused a backlog for entry into the  program. Long wait lists resulted in inmates entering RDAP with  insufficient time to complete the program in time to receive the maximum  sentence reduction. In fiscal years 2007 and 2008, BOP reported to  Congress that long wait lists (over 7,600 systemwide) prevented some  eligible inmates from participating in the program at all\u201420 percent and 7  percent unable to participate, respectively. RDAP capacity, as measured  by the number of program slots open to inmates at one time throughout  BOP (6,685 in fiscal year 2011), has grown at a relatively steady rate  since the program began in fiscal year 1989, and increased by 400 slots  from fiscal years 2009 to 2011. According to BOP officials, as program  capacity has increased in recent years, wait lists have been reduced,  even with continued growth in the inmate population. This has enabled  inmates to enter the program sooner and resulted in an increase in the  percentage of eligible inmates who complete RDAP and receive the  maximum sentence reductions from 14 percent in fiscal year 2009 to 25  percent in fiscal year 2011. However, according to BOP officials, RDAP is  still catching up to the increased demand and continues to have wait lists.", "According to BOP officials, wait lists for entry into RDAP are currently  prioritized in accordance with statute based on inmates\u2019 proximity to their  projected release dates which include GCT credit expected to be earned,  but do not include the potential RDAP sentence reduction that eligible  participants may earn. Two subject matter experts who advocate for  inmate interests whom we spoke with stated that BOP could consider  including the potential RDAP sentence reduction in inmates\u2019 projected  release date calculations. This could ensure that eligible inmates would  enter the program sooner and in enough time to receive the maximum  reduction. For example, if two inmates have the same projected release  date, after accounting for GCT credit, but one inmate would be eligible for  a 1-year sentence reduction on completion of RDAP while the other  would not be eligible for a sentence reduction upon completion of RDAP,  the inmate eligible for the sentence reduction would have a higher  position on the wait list for entry into RDAP than the inmate ineligible for a  sentence reduction. BOP has stated that if it were to prioritize RDAP entry  in this way, some inmates who are not eligible for the sentence reduction  would not be able to enter the program at all, as they would continually be  displaced on the wait lists by inmates who are eligible for the sentence  reduction. BOP is required by statute, subject to the availability of  appropriations, to provide residential substance abuse treatment for all  eligible inmates, regardless of their eligibility for the sentence reduction  incentive, and thus must ensure that all eligible inmates are able to  participate in the program prior to their release from custody. However,  BOP was unable to provide documentation that including RDAP sentence  reduction in computation of the projected release date would continually  displace inmates eligible for RDAP but ineligible for the associated  sentence reduction.", "BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request included an increase of $15 million  for RDAP, which was not funded. According to BOP, the funding would  have reduced RDAP wait lists and enabled eligible inmates to enter the  program early enough to earn their maximum allowable sentence  reductions. BOP stated that the $15 million increase would have covered  125 new drug treatment staff positions and would have allowed an   BOP officials also  additional 4,000 inmates to complete RDAP annually.told us that if BOP changes its policy to allow criminal aliens to participate  in RDAP, the funding increase for RDAP proposed in the 2012 budget  request would have been sufficient to allow this additional inmate  population to participate in RDAP without impacting the ability of U.S.  citizens to participate and receive the maximum available sentence  reductions.", "Timely program admission would result in future cost savings through  additional sentence reductions. For example, if every eligible RDAP  participant who completed the program in fiscal year 2011 had received  their maximum sentence reduction, BOP would have been responsible for  15,729 fewer months of inmate incarceration, yielding an estimated cost  savings of about $13.2 million. BOP estimated that allowing criminal  aliens to participate in RDAP and earn sentence reductions could offer  about $25 million of additional cost savings each year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal inmate populations have been increasing and BOP is operating  at more than a third over capacity. In addition, the absence of parole in  the federal system and other federal statutes limit BOP\u2019s authority to  modify an inmate\u2019s period of incarceration. Inmates, who earn their good  conduct time, as most do, end up serving about 87 percent of their  sentences. BOP\u2019s housing of inmates in community-based facilities or  home detention is a key flexibility it uses to affect a prisoner\u2019s period of  incarceration. However, BOP does not require its RRC contractors to  separate the price of home detention services from the price of RRC  beds. As a result, BOP lacks information on the price of home detention  that could assist it in weighing the costs and benefits of alternative  options for supervising inmates in home detention. While BOP is working  to develop a process to require contractors to submit separate prices for  the price of RRC beds and home detention services, without establishing  a plan, including a time frame for development, BOP does not have a  road map for how it will achieve this goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To determine the cost of home detention and potentially achieve cost  savings, we recommend that the Director of BOP establish a plan,  including time frames and milestones for completion, for requiring  contractors to submit separate prices of RRC beds and home detention  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOJ for its review and comment.
