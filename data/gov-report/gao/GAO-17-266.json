Education described several ways staff share performance information, but according to a review of official grant files and interviews with Education officials, GAO found that staff rarely used PAM to disseminate information about grantee performance, such as notable results achieved in specific grant projects. Additionally, while Education officials said they offer staff training on PAM, they have not developed guidance to clarify use of features related to grantee performance. Federal internal control standards call for pertinent information, such as grantee performance information, to be identified, captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that permits people to perform their duties efficiently.

In the last 10 years, the number and size of Education\u2019s  discretionary grant awards have increased considerably. In fiscal year  2015, Education obligated more than $4 billion in awards for over 80  discretionary grant programs and awarded more than 7,000 discretionary  grants across the United States. As the number and size of Education\u2019s  grant awards have increased, GAO and Education\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) have reported on Education\u2019s grants management and  oversight challenges, including challenges related to effectively  monitoring grantee performance, improving risk management, and  sharing information about grantee performance across Education.", "In light of these challenges, you asked us to review Education\u2019s oversight  of its discretionary grant programs and grantees.", "This report examines (1) the extent to which Education consistently  applied its discretionary grants policies and procedures for monitoring  grantees; and (2) the extent to which Education systematically identified  and shared across the department information about the performance of  discretionary grantees. In addition, we reviewed the ways in which  Education hires and trains grant staff, which is included in appendix I.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed three of Education\u2019s seven  principal offices that award discretionary grants\u2014the Offices of  Postsecondary Education (OPE), Elementary and Secondary Education  (OESE), and Innovation and Improvement (OII). We selected these  offices because they collectively awarded about 87 percent of Education\u2019s  discretionary grant funds awarded in fiscal year 2015\u2014about $3.8 billion  out of approximately $4.3 billion\u2014according to our review of the most  recently available Education data.", "We also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, policy, and guidance  as well as agency documentation.  For instance, we reviewed  Education\u2019s Handbook for the Discretionary Grant Process (Handbook),  which generally establishes the internal policies and procedures for  discretionary grant management department-wide.  Additionally, we  reviewed Education guidance on its grantee risk assessment process.", "Further, to obtain information on how Education officials implemented  discretionary grant monitoring policies and procedures in practice, hired  and trained grant staff, and shared information about grantee performance across offices, we interviewed officials from our three  selected principal offices, including program specialists who most directly  interact with grantees. We also interviewed officials from Education\u2019s Risk  Management Service, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and Office of  Human Resources, who provide guidance and support to principal offices.  We compared the information obtained through interviews to Education\u2019s  Handbook, and also reviewed federal internal control standards  and  leading grants management practices, as appropriate.", "To determine whether Education consistently applied its grants policies  and procedures for monitoring discretionary grantees, we also reviewed a  nongeneralizable sample of 75 official grant files.  To select our sample,  we first reviewed data Education provided from its G5 grants  management system (G5) about all discretionary grant awards made from  fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the most recent data available at the time  we conducted our review. The data included information specific to each  grant award, such as the recipient name, amount awarded, and the award  type. It also identified the Education office responsible for the award and if  Education awarded the funds as a cooperative agreement. Cooperative  agreements entail a substantial level of involvement between the  awarding federal agency and the recipient, and comprise a minority of  Education\u2019s discretionary awards.  For these reasons, we excluded  cooperative agreements from our review. Second, using the G5 data, we  randomly selected grants from a pool of recipients that received new  discretionary awards made in fiscal year 2012. Doing so allowed us to  review up to 3 years of grant file monitoring documentation, where applicable. We reviewed a total of 75 official grant files\u201440 from OPE, 25  from OESE, and 10 from OII\u2014that totaled about $272 million in  discretionary grant awards made by Education over the period of our  review.  Our sample is nongeneralizable and the number of grants we  reviewed from each office was in proportion to the total number of grant  awards made by each office in fiscal year 2012.", "As part of this effort, we also interviewed 9 of the 75 selected grantees to  obtain their perspectives on Education\u2019s monitoring of their grant projects.  To do so, we randomly selected 3 grantees from each of the three  principal offices in our review. We determined that the G5 data are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report by reviewing  documentation about the G5 system and interviewing agency officials.  While the results of our grant file review and grantee interviews are not  generalizable, they provide insight into Education\u2019s monitoring of  discretionary grantees.", "To review each grant file in our sample, using Education\u2019s requirements  in the Handbook for the organization and content of official grant files, we  developed a data collection instrument to assess whether the files  contained documentation that grant staff performed various grantee  monitoring activities.  Where certain key monitoring documents should  have been present for each and every grantee\u2014for example, the  performance reports grantees are required to submit at the end of each  budget period \u2014we determined whether those documents were present  in the official file. In other instances, Education requires in its Handbook  that grant staff document activities, such as regular telephone contacts, e- mail correspondence, and site visits, as appropriate. In these instances,  we confirmed, for example, the absence or presence of routine  correspondence in the official files.

Education generally awards these types of grants through a competitive  process.  Grant project periods can vary in duration, ranging from less  than a year to 5 years.  When Education funds grants with project  periods longer than a year (referred to in this report as multiyear grants),  it generally funds the grants in annual increments called budget periods,  usually 12 months. With multiyear grants, grantees are generally eligible  to receive funding beyond the initial budget period provided certain  conditions are met; for example, Education must determine that a grantee  has made substantial progress toward the project\u2019s goals and objectives,  and Congress must have appropriated sufficient funds, among other  conditions.  Award amounts can vary widely. For example, in 2012  Education awarded a grantee $27,315 to help subsidize fees for low- income students registering for Advanced Placement and International  Baccalaureate tests, and in the same year, Education awarded another  grantee about $5 million to support professional development for teachers  and school administrators. In fiscal year 2015, Education awarded about  $4.3 billion in discretionary grants across its seven principal offices (see  table 1).", "The lifecycle of a discretionary grant has three general phases: pre- award, award, and post-award (see fig. 2). The Handbook establishes  department-wide policies and procedures for each phase. For example, in  the award phase, the Handbook describes policies for notifying grantees  about their awards.", "During the post-award phase, the Handbook establishes specific  monitoring activities Education grant staff should perform, and requires  grant staff to document these activities in the official file they are to keep  for each grantee, which may be paper-based or electronic (see fig. 3). For  example, all grant files should include the following three key documents:  grant award notifications, post-award conference records, and grantee  performance reports. As we describe below, the purpose of these  documents is to record information on various key monitoring activities.", "Grant award notification. According to the Handbook, Education\u2019s  grant staff are to send all discretionary grantees a grant award  notification (referred to in this report as an award notice) that provides  details about the grant, including the amount of the award; the binding  terms and conditions of the grant, including statutory and regulatory  requirements; and any specific conditions.  For example, as a  specific condition, a grantee may be required to seek reimbursements  from Education for grant-related expenditures (referred to in the  Handbook as \u201ccost reimbursement\u201d), or may be prohibited from  proceeding with its project until Education receives satisfactory  evidence of acceptable performance. If Education later assigns  specific conditions, grant staff are to amend the award notice and  resend it to the grantee, according to the Handbook. Additionally, the  Handbook specifies that grant staff should save copies of award  notices, as well as amended versions, if applicable, to include in the  grantee\u2019s official grant file.", "Post-award conference records. According to the Handbook, the post- award conference is the initial discussion between Education\u2019s grant  staff responsible for monitoring the grant and the grantee\u2019s project  director or other authorized representative. The Handbook specifies  that this meeting should take place within 30 days of the award to  establish a mutual understanding of the specific outcomes that are  expected, and to clarify measures and targets for assessing the  project\u2019s progress and results, among other things. This meeting may  take place in-person, via telephone or e-mail, or as part of a virtual or  in-person conference. Following the discussion, grant staff are to  document that a meeting occurred and should also save any related  notes from the discussion to the official grant file, according to the  Handbook.", "Calls, site visits, technical assistance to grantees (as needed).", "According to the Handbook, certain day-to-day activities that occur or  apply (as needed) to the particular circumstances of a grantee must  be documented in the official grant file. These activities include,  among other things, routine telephone or e-mail correspondence;  reports from a site visit by Education staff; and, if relevant, contracts  into which a grantee may have entered as a condition of receiving the  grant (e.g., a contract for a rigorous post-grant evaluation of a pilot  project). Grant staff can adjust the scope and frequency of these  activities using their professional judgment, according to grant staff  supervisors. When making these determinations, grant staff may  consider various factors, such as the amount awarded; past grantee  performance, if applicable; and any reported problems by the grantee  or requests for specific assistance.", "Performance reports. Education requires discretionary grantees to  submit reports that describe the specific activities they performed  during a budget period.

Education also stated that it conducted its own review and  found all the appropriate performance reports, though some were found  outside of the official grant files or in other Education systems, and the  agency is therefore confident that no funds were at risk.

Grant staff supervisors said that grant staffs\u2019 heavy  workload sometimes prevents them from saving grantee monitoring  documentation to the official grant file in a timely manner. One supervisor  noted specifically that grantees may send hard copies of their  performance reports in April each year, but that these may not be saved  to the official grant file until the following September because of  competing demands. Additionally, during the time of our review,  Education officials said they were enhancing G5 and that grant staff were  in the process of transitioning from their previous systems. During this  transition period, they said remnants of the old systems were used  alongside the new system because creating electronic documents proved  to be an onerous task, leading to the use of an official grant file and a  working file. Going forward, Education stated that there is a need to  consolidate to one official grant file within G5.", "At the same time, grant staff supervisors said there are various  safeguards in place that help prevent continuation awards from being  made to grantees that do not demonstrate substantial progress.  Specifically, they said grant staff cannot independently decide to make  continuation awards. Instead, grant staff must prepare a Continuation  Award Memo documenting that they have evaluated the project for  substantial progress during the budget period against the project\u2019s aims  and objectives, and recommend whether Education should continue to  fund that project. These officials said grant staff are to submit this memo  to principal office management for review before a continuation award  can be made.

The number of files they review varies  depending on factors such as the number of staff they manage, the  complexity of the grant programs in their portfolio, and the number of  awards made as part of each grant program, according to grant staff  supervisors. Additionally, they said they can also review individual official  grant files at any point as needed. During our review of 75 official grant  files, we found two documented instances that showed a grant staff  supervisor reviewed a grant file for completeness in terms of ensuring all  required documentation was included in the file.", "Principal offices have not established written procedures with enough  detail for grant staff supervisors to know how frequently to review official  grant files nor what, specifically, the review should entail. Grant staff  supervisors in our selected principal offices said they rely on the  Handbook to guide them as they conduct these reviews, but beyond  specifying that grant staff supervisors should routinely review official grant  files, the Handbook\u2014issued by RMS\u2014contains few specifics on what  these reviews should entail. For instance, it does not establish what  portion of official grant files staff supervisors should review, how often  these reviews should occur, and whether to document in the official grant  file, G5, or anywhere else that the reviews occurred.

Thoroughly reviewing official grant files is particularly important given our  findings that key monitoring documents had not consistently been  included in the 75 official grant files we reviewed. Without these  monitoring records, Education may not be able to readily demonstrate the  results that grantees achieved, or that grantees implemented their  projects according to the terms and conditions of the award.

This could include disseminating notable results and  lessons learned from the grant projects they monitor or to alert other grant  staff of potential performance issues.", "Based on our review of official grant files, staff consistently used some,  but not all, of the voluntary PAM Module features when monitoring  grantees. Specifically, in our review of 61 electronic grant files,  we  found grant staff consistently used four tabs, including the \u201cFinances\u201d and  \u201cAward Details\u201d tabs, but they rarely used others, such as the  \u201cObjectives,\u201d \u201cIssues,\u201d and \u201cNotable Results\u201d tabs (see table 2).  With the  \u201cIssues\u201d tab in particular, grant staff noted performance issues in 7 of the  61 electronic grant files we reviewed. In 4 of these 7 grant files, staff  indicated that grantees had large available balances remaining at the end  of the budget period, which could indicate non-performance or financial  mismanagement, according to the Handbook.

Education officials stated that due to the lack of consistency  in program statutes and regulations regarding grant administration,  offices\u2019 varying workloads and resources, and their differing rates of  transition to electronic record-keeping, the PAM Module tabs are  interpreted and implemented in ways that make sense for each office.  That said, RMS officials told us that the information grant staff enter in the  \u201cIssues\u201d and \u201cNotable Results\u201d tabs could be useful to inform their  grantee risk assessment process, but also said it is up to principal offices  to clarify whether their staff should use these features as they monitor  grantees.", "One potential benefit of the PAM Module is that it allows RMS to collect  data on grantee performance from a central location, according to RMS  officials. Currently, they said grantee performance information is primarily  contained in annual performance reports, which staff generally saves to  individual grant files in a portable document format (PDF). As a result,  RMS cannot easily access or aggregate the information to potentially  identify wider performance issues or possible best practices, according to  officials with whom we spoke. In particular, RMS officials said they would  like to use grantee performance information to inform their Entity Risk  Review process. Developed in 2010, Entity Risk Review is an analysis  tool RMS officials use to provide program offices with information about  the risks associated with continuing grantees and applicants. As part of  this process, RMS consolidates information, such as details about past  grantee performance, if applicable; financial information about the grantee  organization; and relevant single audit findings to develop a risk profile for  continuing grantees and applicants relative to three risk categories\u2014 administrative, financial, and internal controls, which is then shared with  principal and program offices, according to RMS officials.", "However, RMS has not taken steps to help ensure that the information  grant staff enters in the PAM Module about grantee performance will be  useable. Specifically, since the PAM Module was implemented in 2013,  RMS officials said grant staff have been inconsistently interpreting key  terminology like \u201cissues\u201d and \u201cnotable results.\u201d While RMS officials said  they offer grant staff training on the PAM Module, due to competing  priorities, they have not developed guidance to clarify what information  grant staff should enter into the PAM Module related to the \u201cIssues\u201d and  \u201cNotable Results\u201d tabs, specifically, nor circumstances under which using  the PAM Module might be an effective means to share information.  Federal internal control standards state that pertinent information should  be identified, captured, and distributed in a form and time frame that  permits people to perform their duties efficiently.  Without guidance to  help grant staff enter consistent information about grantee performance  across Education\u2019s principal and program offices, RMS may not be able  to realize the full potential of its grants management system.", "Additionally, according to RMS officials, not all offices use the PAM  Module because some program offices have not yet fully transitioned  from paper-based to electronic grant files. RMS officials said Education is  currently moving toward fully electronic grant administration, but it has not  established a time frame for when it will complete this transition.

However, Education\u2019s ability to  adequately assess the results of its grant monitoring activities,  demonstrate good stewardship of its limited resources, and show results  grantees achieved\u2014using its billions in discretionary grant funds\u2014may  be diminished when it does not routinely ensure that its grant staff review  and document in the official grant files the results grantees achieve with  federal funds. During our review of 75 official grant files, we could not  locate documentation describing the results grantees had achieved with  about $21 million in discretionary grant awards\u2014about 8 percent of the  award funds associated with our nongeneralizable sample of 75 files.  When these documents are not included in the official grant files,  Education cannot readily demonstrate\u2014in the manner called for by  federal internal control standards and its own Handbook\u2014that grant funds  were expended according to the terms and conditions of the award,  including any specific conditions, or what grantees achieved with the  funds. Absent detailed written procedures for the supervisory review of  official grant files, these issues may persist. By describing in detail what it  expects grant staff supervisors to do, Education would be better  positioned to ensure proper and consistent stewardship of its  discretionary grant funds.", "Education invested time and resources to develop features in G5 that  allow grant staff to routinely identify and share information about grantee  performance as part of their monitoring efforts. As Education continues to  move toward agency-wide adoption of its electronic G5 grants  administration system, using a centralized approach, such as G5\u2019s PAM  Module, to gather this information could provide Education opportunities  to share information about grantee performance across programs and  offices. If grant staff consistently noted performance issues in the PAM  Module, such as whether a particular grantee was placed on cost  reimbursement, RMS would have a central, easily accessible location  from which to incorporate this information into its grantee risk assessment  process. By doing so, all program offices would benefit by having the  most current information on the risks associated with specific grantees  before making new or continuation awards. This is particularly true given  that some entities may receive discretionary grants from more than one of  Education\u2019s principal offices. However, RMS has not developed guidance  on the types of information grant staff should enter into the PAM Module  related to the \u201cIssues\u201d and \u201cNotable Results\u201d tabs, specifically, nor  circumstances under which using the PAM Module might be an effective  means to share information.

Such guidance could clarify  expectations about when staff should use the \u201cIssues\u201d and \u201cNotable  Results\u201d tabs while monitoring grantees once the transition to  electronic grant files is complete, and clarify the types of information  staff should enter about grantee performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.  Their written comments are reproduced in appendix II. In its comments,  Education substantially agreed with both of our recommendations and  provided additional technical comments and clarifications, which we have  incorporated, as appropriate. Among other things, Education reported that  it will (1) establish a standard operating procedure for grant file reviews,  including a protocol for the review of these files to ensure that monitoring  efforts are documented appropriately; and (2) reinforce through grant  administration trainings the importance of sharing grantee performance  information agency-wide, including in the PAM Module.", "In commenting on our finding about the extent to which grant staff  consistently applied discretionary grant monitoring policies, Education  focused much of its attention on the 58 performance reports we  determined were missing from the official grant files we reviewed, and  which were associated with about $21 million in discretionary grant  awards. Education stated that in every case, it found the performance  reports and acknowledged that, contrary to its policies, some were found  outside of the official grant files, such as in other Education systems.  Hence, Education stated that it believes no federal funds were at risk, in  part because it was able to locate the documentation necessary for  continuation awards. Because our review focused on the required  contents of the official grant file, per Education\u2019s requirements contained  in its Handbook for the Discretionary Grant Process, we would not have  found documentation Education kept elsewhere. We have clarified our  report to note that our analyses pertain to the contents of the official grant  files we reviewed, and we make no judgment as to whether federal funds  were \u201cat risk\u201d or improperly awarded. Education also provided more  details on the safeguards described in the draft report that are meant to  ensure funding is only provided to grantees that have achieved  substantial progress and have complied with applicable regulations; we  included these details in the final report, as appropriate.", "In commenting on our finding about identifying and sharing grantee  performance information agency-wide, Education agreed that sharing  such information throughout a grant\u2019s lifecycle would be beneficial and  that a broader approach to such sharing would enhance steps it has  taken. Education also stated that the report does not provide a complete  assessment regarding system training and resources for staff use of the  PAM Module, and that its Office of the Chief Information Officer had  developed, in consultation with RMS and others, a user guide for the  PAM Module that provides multiple \u201cguidance tips.\u201d RMS officials also  confirmed, as stated in our draft report, that they had not developed  guidance clarifying how staff were to use the tabs we discuss\u2014\u201cNotable  Results\u201d and \u201cIssues.\u201d Though we were unable to obtain a copy of the  user guide after several requests during the course of our review, we are  pleased that Education reports that one exists. As stated in our report,  establishing a common understanding of when to use these tabs and the  kinds of information to enter in them could help to ensure that the  information staff enter in the PAM Module about grantee performance will  be usable by RMS or other Education offices. We also recognize that staff  need flexibility to interpret grantee performance terminology within the  context of the particular grant programs they oversee.

Education last issued a hiring plan in 2009 that outlined specific  hiring goals and related initiatives, including attracting more diverse  candidates using special initiatives, as appropriate, such as the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Pathways Program, to hire entry level staff. The  Pathways Program is a streamlined developmental program meant to  encourage careers in federal service by offering meaningful training and  career development for students and recent graduates.  These programs  can reduce the time it takes to recruit and hire staff, according to OHR  officials. OHR officials said they are currently reviewing the effectiveness  of Education\u2019s strategy to recruit, hire, and retain staff\u2014including grant  staff\u2014and plan to issue an updated hiring plan in late 2017. As part of  this review, OHR officials said they will assess Education\u2019s efforts to  recruit diverse candidates, and review the job series that comprise the  department\u2019s grant workforce to ensure job descriptions match the duties  currently being performed by staff in those roles.", "Education\u2019s current job series for grant staff identifies specific skills grant  staff need to manage discretionary grants, and Education offers training  aimed at helping staff perform these duties effectively. The skills needed  to manage discretionary grants according to Education officials include,  for example, (1) knowledge of education theories, principles, processes,  and practices; (2) proficiency in application of fact-finding and  investigative techniques; (3) analytical ability; (4) oral and written  communication; (5) development of presentations and reports; and (6)  knowledge of specific program and grant information. Education officials  said they aim to hire staff with these skills and then train them on the  specifics of grants management through mentoring and on-boarding  programs, as well as on-the-job and optional training.", "Officials from our three selected principal offices said they all have  established mentoring or on-boarding programs for new grant staff. In  fiscal year 2012, Education began offering an optional foundational  curriculum of grant management courses that, upon completion, lead to a  grant management certificate, according to RMS officials. These officials said the curriculum consists of eight courses (delivered over 15  nonconsecutive days) covering topics such as grants monitoring, financial  principles, ethics, and administrative requirements, among other things.  They said the program is offered each year to cohorts of about 35 grant  staff from across the department, and that since its inception, 228 of the  department\u2019s roughly 656 grant staff members had completed it. Grant  staff can also choose to take a variety of other training opportunities that  are offered department-wide or by principal offices on topics such as cost  analysis and budget review.", "According to RMS officials, only certain grant staff are required to receive  grant specific training, which is delivered in the form of an annual briefing.  Specifically, this briefing is intended for those employees holding a  discretionary grant license from RMS, which allows them to obligate and  award grant funds. RMS officials said the annual briefing is designed to  provide license holders an update on legislative and regulatory  developments that affect the agency\u2019s grant administration policies.
