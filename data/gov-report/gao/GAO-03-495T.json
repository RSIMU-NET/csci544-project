Now that the Internet has become such a  ubiquitous element of our lives, it is more important than ever that we take  full advantage of information technology (IT) to vastly improve the way  our government serves its citizens\u2014and to do so much more efficiently  and economically.", "Generally speaking, electronic government refers to the use of IT,  particularly Web-based Internet applications, to enhance the access to and  delivery of government information and service to citizens, to business  partners, to employees, and among agencies at all levels of government. A  variety of actions have been taken in recent years to enhance the  government\u2019s ability to realize the potential of e-government, culminating  in the recent enactment of the E-Government Act of 2002, which includes  provisions addressing everything from funding of e-government initiatives  to measures for ensuring security and privacy.", "The President has embraced e-government as one of five priorities  delineated in his management agenda for making the federal government  more focused on citizens and results. Under the leadership of the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), a team known as the Quicksilver task  force identified a set of high-profile initiatives to lead the federal  government\u2019s drive toward e-government transformation. These  initiatives\u2014now numbering 25\u2014have ambitious goals, including  eliminating redundant, nonintegrated business operations and systems;  achieving this result, according to OMB, could produce several billions of  dollars in savings from improved operational efficiency. To obtain such  savings\u2014and significantly improve service to citizens\u2014it will be critically  important that these initiatives are well managed as the government  undertakes the challenging task of turning good ideas into real-world  results.", "As requested, in my remarks today, I will summarize the results of a  review we recently conducted to assess OMB\u2019s process for selecting the e- government initiatives and monitoring their initial progress. I will focus  on some of the key aspects of initiatives that must be closely monitored to  ensure that they meet their goals. Specifically, after reviewing the overall  scope and objectives of the initiatives, I will discuss issues concerning the  completeness of the planning documents prepared for them, including  initial business cases as well as work and funding plans developed last  spring. To provide additional information, I have included an attachment  that details the partner agencies and proposed performance metrics for  each project. I have also included, as a second attachment, a list of other  pertinent GAO publications on e-government issues."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Government agencies at all levels have already implemented a broad array  of e-government applications: through the Internet, government agencies  collect and disseminate information and forms; government and  businesses order and pay for goods and services; and businesses and the  public apply for licenses, grants, and benefits, and submit bids and  proposals. Despite this substantial progress, the federal government has  not yet taken full advantage of the potential that electronic government  offers. As we have previously testified, the government faces significant  challenges in this area, including sustaining executive leadership,  protecting personal privacy, implementing appropriate security controls,  using enterprise architectures effectively, and managing IT human capital.", "Recognizing the magnitude of challenges facing the federal government,  the Congress has enacted important legislation to guide the development  of e-government. In 1998, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act  (GPEA) was enacted, establishing a requirement that by October 21, 2003,  federal agencies provide the public, when practicable, the option of  submitting, maintaining, and disclosing required information  electronically. More recently, the Congress passed the E-Government Act  of 2002, which includes provisions to promote the use of the Internet and  other information technologies to provide government services  electronically; strengthen agency information security; and define how to  manage the federal government\u2019s growing IT human capital needs. In  addition, this act established an Office of Electronic Government within  OMB to provide strong central leadership and full-time commitment to  promoting and implementing e-government.", "The executive branch has also acted to enhance and accelerate the  development of electronic government. The President made e-government  expansion one of five top priorities in his fiscal year 2002 management  agenda, which outlines a number of specific electronic government  projects. For example, the FirstGov Web portal\u2014which is intended to  serve as a single consolidated source for government services to citizens\u2014 was targeted for expansion and improvement to offer services better  organized according to citizens\u2019 needs. Also targeted for enhancement was  the FedBizOpps portal, designed to be a single point of entry for  information about federal government procurement opportunities.  Further, the agenda endorsed the establishment of a federal public key  infrastructure to ensure that electronic transactions with and within the  federal government would be private and secure.", "A major element of the President\u2019s management agenda was establishment  of the Quicksilver Task Force, which was charged with identifying  (1) systematic barriers that had blocked the deployment of e-government  advances and (2) electronic government projects that could deliver  significant productivity and performance gains across government.", "Together, the federal government\u2019s e-government initiatives are expected  to    provide high-quality customer services regardless of whether the citizen  contacts the agency by phone, in person, or on the Web; reduce the expense and difficulty of doing business with the government;   cut government operating costs;    provide citizens with readier access to government services;  increase access for persons with disabilities to agency Web sites and E- government applications; and   make government more transparent and accountable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 25 E-Government Initiatives Address a Broad Range of Electronic Services", "paragraphs": ["In its e-government strategy, released in 2002, OMB stated that the 25 e- government initiatives were selected on the basis of (1) value to citizens,  (2) potential improvement in agency efficiency, and (3) likelihood of  deploying within 18 to 24 months. The selected initiatives would achieve  their results by simplifying and unifying agency work processes and  information flows, providing one-stop services to citizens, and enabling  information to be collected on line once and reused, rather than being  collected many times.", "The initiatives are aimed at providing a wide variety of services. For  example, some are focused on setting up Web sites or portals that channel  information more effectively to citizens, businesses, or other government  entities. Recreation One-Stop is one such example, a Web portal for a  single point of access to information about parks and other recreation  venues at the federal, state, and local levels. One-Stop Business  Compliance provides an analogous service to businesses, giving them a  single Web site to consult regarding the multitude of government  regulations that may affect their activities. Other initiatives strive for more  ambitious services that may not necessarily rely on the Internet for  delivery. SAFECOM, for example, seeks to impose order and standards on  wireless communications among emergency responders across all levels  of government. The e-Payroll initiative is intended to consolidate the  federal government\u2019s many incompatible payroll systems into just two that  would service all government employees.", "As shown in figure 1, OMB has divided these efforts into five broad  categories that reflect the different customer groups targeted by each of  the initiatives:  1.  government to individual citizens,  2.  government to business,  3.  government to government,  4. internal efficiency and effectiveness, and  5.  cross cutting.", "Government to individual citizens. One of the major benefits of on-line  and Internet-based services is that they provide opportunities for greater  citizen access to and interaction with the federal government. An example  is GovBenefits.gov, a Web site designed to assist users in locating and  determining potential eligibility for government benefits and services.  Other initiatives in this category aim to improve customer service. USA  Services, for example, is intended to deploy tools, such as call centers and  coordinated E-mail systems linked to the FirstGov Web site, that will  enable citizens to ask questions and receive responses from the federal  government without having to know in advance which specific  departments or bureaus have responsibilities related to their areas of  interest.", "Government to business. Initiatives in this category seek to reduce the  reporting burden on businesses by adopting processes that eliminate  redundant data collection, provide one-stop access to information, and  enable communication using electronic business standards, such as the  Extensible Markup Language. The Expanding Electronic Tax Products for  Businesses initiative, for example, seeks to reduce the number of tax- related forms businesses must file. The Federal Asset Sales initiative aims  to create a single electronic interface for businesses to find and buy  government assets.", "Government to government. The primary goal of these initiatives is to  enable federal, state, and local governments to more easily work together  to better serve citizens within key lines of business. For example,  Geospatial One-Stop seeks to provide a single portal for accessing  standardized and coordinated federal, state, and local geospatial data. The  Disaster Management initiative seeks to provide federal, state, and local  emergency managers on-line access to disaster management information,  planning, and response tools.", "Internal efficiency and effectiveness. The initiatives in this category seek  to improve the performance and reduce the costs of federal government  administration by using e-business best practices. For example, the  Integrated Acquisition Environment initiative seeks to consolidate  business processes and information to facilitate cost-effective acquisition  of goods and services across the federal government. Lastly, e-Travel is  planned to streamline the administration of government travel by creating  a governmentwide Web-based travel management process.", "Cross-cutting initiative. The e-Authentication initiative is to develop  common interoperable authentication techniques to support all the other  initiatives. Authentication refers to the critical process of confirming the  identity of the participants in an electronic transaction. Without a means  to satisfactorily establish identities, e-government transactions are too  risky, and the potential of e-government to transform citizen services  remains severely constrained. The initiative plans to provide  authentication services through an electronic \u201cgateway,\u201d which will offer  different assurance levels to meet the varying needs of the other projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Issues Highlight the Need for Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While several of the projects have already achieved tangible results, not all  of them are making the same degree of progress. For example, some have  had major management changes\u2014management of the SAFECOM  initiative, for example, was transferred from Treasury to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency. Major management changes such as this  have led to delays in project milestones and changes in objectives.", "We believe that fluctuations such as these indicate a need for oversight to  ensure that the larger goal\u2014to realize the full potential of e-government\u2014 is not jeopardized. When we reviewed project-planning documentation  collected by OMB from each of the initiatives, we found indications that  important aspects of some of the initiatives had not been addressed and  that, for many of them, funding strategies and milestones were in a state of  flux. These findings add urgency to our concern that the initiatives be  carefully monitored to ensure that implementation challenges are  identified and addressed as quickly as possible. I would like to go through  some of the specific results of our analysis now."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Initial Business Cases Omitted Critical Elements", "paragraphs": ["As part of OMB\u2019s selection process, the Quicksilver task force screened  over 350 project ideas during the summer of 2001 and selected 34 potential  project proposals for more in-depth consideration. In September 2001,  task force members developed brief (or \u201cmini\u201d) business cases for each of  the 34 proposals. According to OMB officials, these mini business cases  were to include all the information necessary to enable sound selection  decisions. The task force reviewed the mini business cases and the final  selections were made in October.", "We analyzed the mini business cases, which were prepared for 23 of the 25  initiatives, to determine whether they were complete. To conduct our  analysis, we first identified e-government business case \u201cbest practices\u201d as  cited by federal agencies, private sector and academic researchers, and  state and local governments. From these sources, we compiled the most  frequently cited elements of a complete business case, such as a  description of the proposed concept for improved future processes and a  discussion of the benefits of implementing it. We also included elements  identified by OMB as important to e-government business cases\u2014whether  an initiative is driven by identified customer needs and whether it contains  a strategy for successful collaboration.", "As shown in figure 2, our analysis of the mini business cases showed that  although they addressed some of the required elements, the majority of  them did not include some key elements identified by OMB and best  practice guidance.", "All the business cases we reviewed included a discussion of the expected  benefits of the proposed initiative, and all but one included a discussion of  the initiatives\u2019 objectives and planned future conditions. However, only 9  of the 23 initiatives\u2019 business cases discussed how customer needs were to  be identified and addressed, and only 8 addressed collaboration among  agencies and other government entities, even though OMB considered  these elements fundamental to its e-government strategy.", "Mr. Chairman, addressing how a proposed project links to the needs of its  potential customers is key to the success of that project, and should be  discussed in the project\u2019s business case. Without a plan to assess users\u2019  needs, there is a greater risk that the project will focus too heavily on  issues that customers do not consider important or disrupt processes that  are already working well and accepted by users. In the case of the e- government initiatives, the result could be that the Internet sites and  services created might not be useful to those customers they are intended  to serve.", "Collaboration across agencies and other organizations is likewise a key  component of most of the initiatives, and therefore a discussion of  strategies for collaboration is essential to a complete e-government  business case. As the government attempts to integrate services across  organizations\u2014particularly in cases where federal agencies overlap in  providing similar services to customers\u2014the issue of how agencies  collaborate can determine an initiative\u2019s success or failure. To help  mitigate the risk of failure, the business case needs to provide a  convincing argument that collaboration can be accomplished and a plan  for how collaboration will be carried out.", "Let me point out that the initial \u201cmini\u201d business cases that we reviewed are  not the latest ones in existence for the 25 initiatives. More extensive  business cases were developed for each of the projects in fall 2002, in  conjunction with the fiscal year 2004 budget process. We have not yet had  an opportunity to review these documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spring 2002 Project Plans Revealed Cost and Schedule Uncertainties", "paragraphs": ["OMB required the managing partners of the e-government initiatives to  prepare and submit work plans and funding plans in May 2002. We  assessed the completeness of these plans, which provided the most up-to- date cost and schedule information available at the time of our review. To  conduct our analysis, we identified best practices from GAO and OMB  guidance for the effective oversight and implementation of IT projects  and compared those best practice elements to the information contained  in the May 2002 plans. In addition, several months later, we obtained  updated status information from 23 of the initiatives\u2019 project managers.", "According to the guidance we reviewed, project implementation  documents should include components such as cost estimates, a schedule  with milestones, identification of project deliverables, and an overall  strategy for obtaining needed funding and staff resources.", "As shown in figure 3, four of the five best practice elements we identified  were included in a majority of the project plans. Plans for all but two of  the initiatives contained a schedule with milestones, and all the plans  identified project deliverables. However, other best practice elements  were not included in some of the plans. For example, only 9 identified a  strategy for obtaining needed funds, and only 16 contained information  about how staffing commitments would be obtained.", "In addition to the findings shown in figure 3, our analysis of the plans  showed uncertainties about milestones for many of the initiatives. Ten of  the 24 did not identify a final completion date for the initiatives, resulting  in inadequate information to determine whether they were moving  forward in a timely manner. Further, 6 of the initiatives were not planned  to be completed within the 18 to 24 month time frame originally  established by OMB as a criterion for inclusion in its e-government effort.", "Accurate cost information was also generally lacking. The updated  information we obtained from project managers in September 2002 on  estimated costs revealed significant changes\u2014changes of more than 30  percent\u2014for about half of the initiatives. These changes, occurring within  such a short period of time, rendered the funding plans outdated soon  after they were developed. This uncertainty about how much the  initiatives would cost, combined with the fact that only 9 of the 24 plans  identified a strategy for obtaining these needed funds, led us to conclude  that OMB was not receiving adequate information to properly oversee the  e-government projects and ensure that they would have the resources to  meet their objectives efficiently and economically.", "Given the challenges we\u2019ve identified, OMB\u2019s oversight role takes on  critical importance. Each of the e-government initiatives needs a well- thought-out strategy for directly addressing its biggest challenges, such as  getting relevant government agencies to effectively collaborate. And each  also needs detailed and stable project plans, so that they can be held  accountable for achieving realistic results within budget and according to  schedule. Accordingly, in our report, we recommended that OMB take  steps as overseer of the e-government initiatives to reduce the risk that the  projects would not meet their objectives. Specifically, we recommended  that OMB ensure that the managing partners for all the initiatives  focus on customers by soliciting input from the public and conducting  user needs assessments,   work with partner agencies to develop and document effective    provide OMB with adequate information to monitor the cost, schedule,  and performance of the e-government initiatives.", "In following up on our recommendations, we requested from OMB  updated business cases that were submitted as part of the fiscal year 2004  budget process. These updated business cases should provide not only  indications of whether key topics such as collaboration and customer  focus are now being addressed, but also updated cost and schedule  information. As noted in our report, OMB agreed to provide us this  information once it was updated after release of the 2004 budget.  However, we have not yet received this information. OMB officials (from  the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs) stated earlier this week that the business cases still  needed to be reviewed before they could be released to us.", "In summary, e-government offers many opportunities to better serve the  public, make government more efficient and effective, and reduce costs.  Legislation such as GPEA and the E-Government Act of 2002 have laid a  strong foundation for building on these opportunities, and the federal  government continues to make strides in taking advantage of them.  Overall, few can argue that the 25 e-government projects are not worthy  initiatives with commendable objectives. Nevertheless, many critical  details remain to be fully addressed before the promise of e-government is  fully realized.", "Because the 25 projects represent such a broad range of activities, it is  difficult to gauge their progress collectively. Some of their objectives may  be much easier to attain than others. However, our review of the initial  planning documents associated with the projects led us to conclude that  important aspects\u2014such as collaboration and customer focus\u2014had not  been thought out for all the projects, and major uncertainties in funding  and milestones were not uncommon. Priority should now be given to  ensuring that the agencies managing these initiatives tackle these issues  and gain cost and schedule stability so that they can ultimately succeed in  achieving their potential. We believe that careful oversight\u2014on the part of  OMB as well as the Congress\u2014is crucial to ensuring this success.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
