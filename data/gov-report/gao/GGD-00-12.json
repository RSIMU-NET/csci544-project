PBS had previously used a computer program called PLUS+ to track and manage its real properties. In 1994, PBS\u2019 Central Office decided that the systems it used to support its mission were antiquated and needed to be replaced. New software was needed to support real property inventory, leasing, space assignments, and billing-related activities. PBS did market research analyses from March 1994 through October 1995, evaluating various real estate software packages.", "In March 1994, PBS began its initial efforts to obtain new software. It published a notice in the Commerce Business Daily seeking sources to supply software products to support management operations for leased and owned public buildings. Two responses to this notice were received. However, PBS determined that neither of these sources met its functional needs.", "PBS also hired a contractor to identify any existing property management software that might meet its needs. The contractor developed a list of 400 software products that it said spanned all facets of PBS\u2019 business functions. Using PBS\u2019 needs as criteria, this list was reduced to 36 products, then to 6 products for further study. However, PBS concluded that none of these products was capable of satisfying all of its minimum requirements, such as the ability and capacity to concurrently manage over 8,000 owned and leased properties.", "During discussions with real estate companies and Fortune 500 companies about real estate practices and procedures, PBS discovered a proprietary system called Permanent Record of Managed Property Transactions (PROMPT). This system had been implemented by AT&T during the summer of 1994. According to PBS officials, PBS ran a 4-month pilot test in 1995 on PROMPT. During this test, 30 percent of PBS\u2019 data were diagrammed and selected data elements on leases and space assignments, as well as other areas, were entered into the system. The test was completed in October 1995. PBS concluded that although PROMPT could meet its needs, the data were not in the format that it wanted.", "In July 1996, an acquisition plan for STAR was approved by GSA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Acquisition Policy. This plan called for a sole source contract with AT&T for the use of PROMPT, which PBS renamed STAR. On January 17, 1997, the contract, which included a license agreement granting use of PROMPT in perpetuity unless canceled by the licensee, was signed with AT&T. The contract was for labor hours on a best-effort performance basis to convert PROMPT version 2.7 into STAR, which met PBS\u2019 requirements. The base contract was for $8.3 million. Of this amount, $4.3 million was for the perpetual right to use the national license; the remaining $4.0 million was for software maintenance, a STAR reference guide, training courses and manuals, technical support services, hotline support, and travel. The contract also included several options. If all of these options were exercised, the total cost of the contract would have been $17.0 million. On October 19, 1998, the quantities in one of the options\u2014option four\u2014were increased adding 1,000 users, 310 training classes, 2,900 sets of training manuals, and 23,200 staff hours of technical support. This raised the value of the contract to $21.8 million, which was an increase of $4.8 million.", "PBS began rolling out STAR in October 1997, and it was available in all regions by January 1998. The first rent bills generated by STAR were sent to agencies in July 1998.", "PBS officials said that the introduction of STAR, among other things, has led to a cultural change that has had many effects in PBS. The officials noted that three changes particularly, affected the realty specialists who maintain STAR. First, realty specialists are now required to enter the data directly into the STAR system; second, they are to be held directly responsible for data accuracy; and third, they are responsible for billing the client agencies. In the past, the realty specialists filled out data entry sheets and data entry clerks entered the data. It was not clear at that time who was responsible for the data accuracy. Further, in the past, realty specialists were not involved in the actual billing of the clients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine what functions STAR performs, we observed how STAR operates; interviewed officials responsible for the development of STAR; and reviewed contract documents, training manuals, and the draft desk reference manual for STAR.", "To identify problems that users were experiencing using STAR, we judgmentally selected four regions, two of which were identified by PBS officials as having problems implementing STAR, one that was the lead region for STAR, and one from which congressional staff had received complaints. We also included the headquarters unit to get its perspective on STAR. PBS officials identified the users of STAR at these locations, of which realty specialists and realty assistants were identified as the major users. We then interviewed 128 users, 81 of which were realty specialists or realty assistants, in the 5 locations and asked them about the problems they have had using STAR.  Our results cannot be projected to the total universe of STAR users.", "Further, we reviewed Help Desk reports that organized user complaints about STAR into subject categories. Because of the way that the issues were categorized in the report and the actual number of items reported to the Help Desk\u2014almost 8,000\u2014we were not able to directly compare our interview-identified problems with those reported to the Help Desk. However, we discussed the problems that users had identified in our interviews, and problems that had been reported to the Help Desk, with the STAR project manager. Further, we reviewed some Help Desk reports that showed specific problems identified.", "To identify the steps that PBS has taken or is taking to deal with user problems, we interviewed officials who were responsible for addressing STAR problems and reviewed documents on changes being made to correct problems and improve STAR.", "Finally, to determine what PBS has done or plans to do to ensure STAR data integrity, we interviewed officials and reviewed plans addressing PBS\u2019 efforts to ensure that STAR data are accurate, reliable, and consistent.

One problem was mentioned by only one user but was included in this report because it involves accounting for rent revenues. According to the STAR project manager, each type of problem that was reported to us had been reported to the STAR project team through the STAR Help Desk and logged into 16 categories. According to the project manager, the PBS project team has taken actions to (1) resolve the reported problems that the team believed were legitimate and (2) add the requested enhancements that the team believed were appropriate.", "Further, 116 of the users we interviewed saw at least 1 benefit from using STAR.", "Table 2 gives a breakdown of the problems that individuals we interviewed identified.", "The project manager said that the STAR project team had taken action or action was being taken on some of the identified problems.

Further, according to another PBS official, user problems may also be a reaction to learning new business processes, such as New Pricing, and other changes.", "Table 3 contains PBS\u2019 responses to examples of the problems we identified through interviews.", "The STAR developmental process also affected STAR, particularly in relation to the user friendliness problem. According to the project manager, the time frame for developing STAR covered from January 1997 until October 1997. A different team developed each module in STAR, and communications among the teams may not have been effective because of the time constraints. The project manager thought that the lack of communications may have resulted in inconsistencies and duplication among modules. Further, she said that STAR\u2019s development was hindered because during the development phase it was learned that STAR would have to handle both the old pricing policy for client space and the new pricing policy for client space, not just the new pricing policy as originally planned. This resulted in having to change STAR\u2019s design. Also, she suggested that PBS may have released STAR to the regions before it was ready, resulting in some of the problems that have been identified by users.", "The project manager said that a cultural change occurred for realty specialists that probably affected their view of STAR. Before STAR and other business changes, realty specialists were not responsible for entering and maintaining data using a computer or for billing client agencies for their assigned space. With the introduction of STAR, New Pricing, New Billing, and the Occupancy Agreement Tool, additional workloads were placed on the realty specialist. Also, each initiative had its own implementation problems that the realty specialists had to deal with in doing their jobs.", "The nearly 8,000 service tickets handled by the Help Desk reflect PBS-wide problems and other issues reported by users. PBS had classified these tickets into 16 different categories. According to PBS officials, the same problem may have been reported on many different service tickets.

The contractor is responsible for fixing the problems associated with all tickets categorized as trouble at no cost to PBS. The three enhancement categories contain requests to make changes to STAR. Any changes to STAR resulting from these tickets categorized as enhancements have to be negotiated between PBS and the contractor, with PBS\u2019 paying for the change. The CRT leader said the team had processed 511 enhancement tickets, of which about 44 were still open. The official said that this tally and the contractor\u2019s tally of tickets categorized as enhancements, as shown in table 4, do not match because the two had not been recently reconciled. She said the contractor\u2019s system probably had some items in the enhancement categories that were not enhancements and CRT had probably closed some other tickets that were not yet recorded in the contractor\u2019s computer database as closed.", "While the 128 users we interviewed reported problems with STAR, 116 of them saw some positive benefit from STAR.

Further, other actions, such as additional contract help, are now available to the regions to help with STAR problems and training.", "The Help Desk is to record user complaints, enhancement suggestions, or other issues concerning the use of STAR on service tickets. CRT reviews and determines how to handle enhancement tickets and trouble tickets that require a fix through a new release of STAR. Guidance on the review process states that no action on a service ticket usually means that a ticket resulted from a user\u2019s momentary frustration with the system, a passing thought of a user, or that other users had already identified the problem.", "If the enhancement or trouble service ticket is accepted, CRT is to edit and define the ticket to clearly identify the issue. CRT is also to assign each of these tickets a priority\u2014high, normal, or low. Working with the contractor, CRT then decides how to implement any change considered needed. By the end of November 1999, eight versions of STAR will have been issued. According to PBS reports, STAR releases 3.0, and 4.0, combined, have about 40 enhancements. Version 4.0, which is to be released by the end of November 1999, for example, is to address the problems of (1) having to enter the same information repeatedly in different modules because modules are not linked and (2) not having the ability to enter the same date twice in the Payment Schedule screen. A category named \u201czero square foot leases\u201d is also to be added to STAR to cover the national antenna program in a release scheduled for the spring of 2000.

For example, STAR has fields that have to be filled in before you can go to the next step of your task. This is to ensure that all of the required data for a task are entered. Another example is work queues, which automatically generate requests for such things as approvals of leases, corrections, or notifications of missing information and may also be used manually to send information. This feature is also designed to automatically notify the budget analyst responsible for rent expenditures of changes so that the analyst may anticipate the effect of the change on expenditures. STAR makes certain calculations using data entered in the database to reduce the chance of human error.", "During the transition to STAR, a PBS team was formed to work with each of the teams that was developing STAR modules to assist in data transfer. According to the team leader, this team developed diagnostic edits for each module that were run on a region-by-region basis to determine missing or incomplete data before the transfer of data to STAR. Further, AT&T wrote a conversion program that included a list of edits to run against the data once they were transferred to STAR to identify missing or incomplete data. Finally, the post-conversion STAR team was tasked with regularly identifying queries, exception reports, and flags that are to be added to STAR to help identify pockets of bad data.", "To further ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent data, PBS established a Go Team in January 1999 to identify and quantify the real and perceived problems with inventory data\u2014space assignment drawings, lease files, assignment files, rent rates, bills, and information in STAR and Occupancy Agreements. For example, as previously mentioned, the GSA IG found half of the space assignment drawings were off by more than 5 percent. The Go Team found considerable problems with how well PBS was creating final rent rates\u2014the proper calculation and application of fees and other charges. In a spot check of 20 Client Billing Records, the team found minor errors in 100 percent of the cases. Also, the team found errors in parking information. In one region, a discrepancy between total parking and assigned parking, which should match in STAR, was found in about 5 percent of the buildings. This problem could affect revenues. Further, the team found errors in design gross square feet and gross square feet, which should match in STAR.  In three regions in particular, substantial variances between the design gross square feet and the gross square feet were found. Again, this could affect revenues.", "In the team\u2019s April 1999 report, it identified the causes of known data problems and identified actions that needed to be taken to fix data problems. The Go Team report identified the following as the root causes of data problems: the lack of accountability and ownership of data; the lack of clear, consistent, complete policies associated with PBS\u2019 new incomplete training; bad data to begin with;", "PBS\u2019 reorganization that moved or de-emphasized assignment functions; migration from the old computer program to STAR; personnel turnover, downsizing, and workload; and changing standards, such as moving from occupiable square feet to usable square feet to rentable square feet.", "In addition to those actions already under way that were discussed under the previous section of this report, the Go Team identified issues that it said must be addressed to improve data quality.
