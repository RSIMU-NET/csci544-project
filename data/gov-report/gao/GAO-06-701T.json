The findings of the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil for Food Program have renewed concerns about UN oversight, and the 2005 UN World Summit proposed actions to improve the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). Furthermore, over the past decade, as UN procurement more than tripled to $1.6 billion in response to expanding UN peacekeeping operations, experts have called on the UN to correct procurement process deficiencies.

In particular, current funding arrangements adversely affect OIOS's budgetary independence and compromise its ability to investigate high-risk areas. Also, weaknesses in the control environment and UN procurement processes leave UN funds vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. UN funding arrangements constrain OIOS's ability to operate independently as mandated by the General Assembly and required by international auditing standards OIOS has adopted. First, while OIOS is funded by a regular budget and 12 other revenue streams, UN financial rules severely limit OIOS's ability to respond to changing circumstances and reallocate resources among revenue streams, locations, and operating divisions. Thus, OIOS cannot always direct resources to high-risk areas that may emerge after its budget is approved. Second, OIOS depends on the resources of the funds, programs, and other entities it audits. The managers of these programs can deny OIOS permission to perform work or not pay OIOS for services. UN entities could thus avoid OIOS audits or investigations, and high-risk areas can be and have been excluded from timely examination. OIOS has begun to implement key measures for effective oversight, but some of its practices fall short of the applicable international auditing standards it has adopted. OIOS develops an annual work plan, but the risk management framework on which the work plans are based is not fully implemented. Moreover, OIOS annual reports do not assess risk and control issues facing the UN organization, or the consequences if these are not addressed. OIOS officials report the office does not have adequate resources, but they also lack a mechanism to determine appropriate staffing levels. Furthermore, OIOS has no mandatory training curriculum for staff. UN funds are vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement because of weaknesses in the UN's control environment for procurement, as well as in key procurement processes. The UN lacks an effective organizational structure for managing procurement, has not demonstrated a commitment to improving its procurement workforce, and has not adopted specific ethics guidance. While the UN Department of Management is responsible for UN procurement, field procurement staff are supervised by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which lacks the expertise and capacity to manage field procurement. Also, the UN has not established procurement training requirements or a career path, and has yet to adopt new ethics guidance for procurement staff, despite long-standing General Assembly mandates. In addition, the UN has not established an independent process to consider vendor protests despite a 1994 recommendation by a high-level panel to do so as soon as possible. Further, the UN does not consistently implement its process for helping to ensure it conducts business with qualified vendors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss United Nations  (UN) reforms in the context of improving UN internal oversight and  strengthening internal controls and processes over its procurement system.

Likewise, the UN faces a range of significant  challenges in reforming its management practices and mitigating various  program and financial risks by fully implementing internationally  recognized standards and norms. As the largest financial contributor to the  UN, with assessed and voluntary contributions totaling more than $1.6  billion in 2006, the United States has strongly advocated for the reform of  UN management practices.

In 2005, the UN purchased more than  $1.6 billion in goods and services\u2014primarily to support a peacekeeping  program that has more than quadrupled in size since 1999, and which may  increase further in the future. Thus, it is vital that demonstrated  deficiencies in procurement are addressed in a timely and effective  manner.", "In 2005, UN member states approved an agenda to reform many of the UN\u2019s  management practices, in particular by helping to ensure ethical conduct;  strengthening internal oversight and accountability; reviewing budgetary,  financial, and human resources policies; and reviewing UN mandates. Even  though UN member states support management reforms, there is  considerable disagreement within the General Assembly over the process  and implementation of the reforms, which thus far has been slow and  uneven.", "Because the UN is a multilateral institution, our oversight authority does  not directly extend to the UN, but instead extends through the United  States\u2019 membership in the organization. In recognition of this factor, we do  UN related work only in response to specific requests from committees  with jurisdiction over UN matters, including your own. Congressional  interest in this area has been high in recent years, and many of our ongoing  or recently completed requests are both bicameral and bipartisan in nature.", "My statement is based on two reports that we are releasing today.

The Under Secretary- General may be removed by the Secretary-General only for cause and with  the General Assembly\u2019s approval. OIOS\u2019s authority spans all UN activities  under the Secretary-General. To carry out its responsibilities, OIOS is  organized into four operating divisions: (1) Internal Audit Division I (New  York); (2) Internal Audit Division II (Geneva); (3) Monitoring, Evaluation,  and Consulting Division; and (4) Investigations Division. OIOS derives its  funding from (1) regular budget resources, which are funds from assessed  contributions from member states that cover normal, recurrent activities  such as the core functions of the UN Secretariat; and (2) extrabudgetary  resources, which come from the budgets for UN peacekeeping missions  financed through assessments from member states, voluntary  contributions from member states for a variety of specific projects and  activities, and budgets for the voluntarily financed UN funds and programs.", "Management of the UN\u2019s rapidly growing spending on procurement  involves several UN entities. The Department of Management controls the  UN\u2019s procurement authority, and its 70-person UN Procurement Service  develops UN procurement policies and procures items for UN  headquarters. While the Procurement Service procures certain items for  peacekeeping, about one-third of all UN procurement spending is managed  by about 270 staff at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations\u2019 19  widely dispersed field missions. These missions may not award contracts  worth more than $200,000 without the approval of the Department of  Management (based on advice from the Headquarters Committee on  Contracts). UN procurement spending has more than tripled since 1997,  peaking at $1.6 billion in 2005. Major items procured include air  transportation services, freight forwarding and delivery services, motor  vehicles and transportation equipment, and chemical and petroleum  products. The sharp increase in UN procurement was due in part to a five- fold increase in the number of military personnel in peacekeeping  missions. Peacekeeping expenditures have more than quadrupled since  1999, from $840 million to about $3.8 billion in 2005. Peacekeeping  procurement accounted for 85 percent of all UN procurement in 2004.", "In September 2005, the UN World Summit issued an \u201coutcome document,\u201d  which addressed several management reform initiatives, including reforms  for: ensuring ethical conduct; strengthening internal oversight and  accountability; reviewing budgetary, financial, and human resources  policies; and reviewing mandates. While the outcome document was  endorsed by all UN member countries, there is considerable disagreement  within the General Assembly over the process and implementation of the  reforms. In December 2005, UN member states agreed to a $950 million  spending cap on the UN\u2019s biennium budget for 2006-2007, pending progress  on management reforms.

In addition, the Institute of Internal  Auditors\u2019 (IIA) standards for the professional practice of auditing, which  OIOS and its counterparts in other UN organizations formally adopted in  2002, state that audit resources should be appropriate, sufficient, and  effectively deployed.

The majority of OIOS\u2019s staff (about 69 percent) is funded  with extrabudgetary resources.

In addition, the movement of staff positions or funds between  regular and extrabudgetary resources is not allowed. For example, one  section in the Internal Audit Division may have exhausted its regular  budget travel funds, while another section in the same division may have  travel funds available that are financed by extrabudgetary peacekeeping  resources. However, OIOS would breach UN financial regulations and rules  if it moved resources between the two budgets. According to OIOS  officials, for the last 5 years, OIOS has consistently found it necessary to  address very critical cases on an urgent basis. A recent example is the  investigations of sexual exploitation and abuse in the Republic of Congo  and other peacekeeping operations that identified serious cases of  misconduct and the need for increased prevention and detection of such  cases.

OIOS negotiates the  terms of work and payment for services with the manager of the program it  intends to examine, and heads of these entities have the right to deny  funding for oversight work proposed by OIOS. By denying OIOS funding,  UN entities could avoid OIOS audits or investigations, and high-risk areas  could potentially be excluded from timely examination. For example, the  practice of allowing the heads of programs the right to deny funding to  internal audit activities prevented OIOS from examining high-risk areas in  the UN Oil for Food program, where billions of dollars were subsequently  found to have been misused. In some cases, the managers of UN funds and  programs have disputed the fees OIOS has charged after investigative  services were rendered. For example, 40 percent of the $2 million billed by  OIOS after it completed its work is currently in dispute, and since 2001, less  than half of the entities have paid OIOS in full for the investigative services  it has provided.
