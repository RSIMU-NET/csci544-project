GAO was asked to evaluate (1) purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing requirements in VA policies and (2) VA's oversight of VAMCs' compliance with these requirements. GAO reviewed VA policies and selected two purchasing requirements, two tracking requirements, and two reprocessing requirements. At the six VAMCs GAO visited, GAO interviewed officials and reviewed documents to examine the adequacy of the selected requirements to help ensure veterans' safety.

GAO did not identify inadequacies in selected VA purchasing requirements that may create potential risks to veterans' safety. GAO found the following: (1) Tracking requirements. Because VA does not require VAMCs to enter information about certain expendable medical supplies and RME in their facilities into VA's inventory management systems, VAMCs may have incomplete inventories of these items. This, in turn, creates potential risks to veterans' safety. For example, in the event of a manufacturer recall involving these items, VAMCs may be unable to readily determine whether the items are in their facilities and should be removed and not used when providing care to veterans. (2) Reprocessing requirements. Although VA requires VAMCs to develop device-specific training for staff on how to correctly reprocess RME, VA has not specified the types of RME for which this training is required. VA has also provided conflicting guidance to VAMCs on how to develop this training. This lack of clarity may have contributed to delays in developing the required training. Without appropriate training on reprocessing, VAMC staff may not be reprocessing RME correctly, which poses potential risks to the safety of veterans. VA headquarters officials told GAO that VA has plans to develop training for certain RME, but VA lacks a timeline for developing this training. GAO also found weaknesses in VA's oversight of VAMCs' compliance with the selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements. These weaknesses render VA unable to systematically identify and address noncompliance with the requirements, which poses potential risks to the safety of veterans. GAO did not identify weaknesses in VA's oversight of VAMCs' compliance with the selected tracking requirements. GAO found the following: (1) Oversight over purchasing requirements. In general, VA does not oversee VAMCs' compliance with the selected purchasing requirements. While VA intends to improve oversight over these requirements, it has not yet developed a plan for doing so. (2) Oversight over reprocessing requirements. Although VA headquarters receives information from the VISNs on any noncompliance they identify as well as VAMCs' corrective action plans to address this noncompliance, VA headquarters does not analyze this information to inform its oversight. According to VA headquarters officials, VA intends to develop a plan for analyzing this information to systematically identify areas of noncompliance that occur frequently, pose high risks to veterans' safety, or have not been addressed across all VAMCs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making several recommendations for VA to address the inadequacies identified in selected tracking and reprocessing requirements and the weaknesses in its oversight over selected purchasing and reprocessing requirements.

Organized into 21 Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (VISN), VA\u2019s health care system includes 153  VA medical centers (VAMC) nationwide that offer a variety of outpatient,  residential, and inpatient services. In providing health care services to  veterans, clinicians at VAMCs use supplies and equipment purchased by  VA. These include expendable medical supplies, such as needles and  scalpel blades, which are generally used once and discarded, and reusable  medical equipment (RME), which is designed to be reused for multiple  patients and includes such equipment as endoscopes and some surgical  instruments. Because RME is used when providing care to multiple  veterans, this equipment must be reprocessed\u2014that is, cleaned and  disinfected or sterilized\u2014between uses. VA has established requirements  for VAMCs to follow for purchasing items such as expendable medical  supplies and RME; for tracking\u2014that is, accounting for\u2014these items at   their facilities; and for reprocessing RME.  These policies are designed, in  part, to help ensure the safety of the veterans who receive care at VAMCs.", "Recent press articles have reported lapses in compliance with VA\u2019s  reprocessing requirements at some VA medical centers, which may have  put the safety of thousands of veterans receiving care at these facilities at  risk. For example, one article reported that between 2009 and 2010, about  1,800 veterans were potentially exposed to infectious diseases at the   St. Louis VAMC, because they received care using improperly reprocessed  dental instruments. Moreover, in a September 2010 congressional hearing,  we presented our preliminary observations on veterans\u2019 safety issues  related to expendable medical supplies and RME. We reported examples  of noncompliance with VA\u2019s requirements for purchasing and tracking  certain medical supplies and equipment, which may pose risks to veterans\u2019  safety. In response, a congressional committee and certain members of  Congress have raised questions about the adequacy of VA\u2019s requirements  for purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing to help ensure veterans\u2019 safety.  In addition, questions have been raised regarding the adequacy of VA\u2019s  oversight of VAMCs\u2019 compliance with these requirements. In this report,  we examine (1) VA purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing requirements in  VA policies, which were selected based on their relevance to patient safety  incidents, and (2) VA\u2019s oversight of VAMCs\u2019 compliance with these  selected requirements.", "To examine VA purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing requirements, we  reviewed relevant VA policies, and from these policies we judgmentally  selected two purchasing requirements, two tracking requirements, and two  reprocessing requirements that we determined were relevant to patient  safety incidents that were identified at certain VAMCs. After selecting  these requirements for our review, we judgmentally selected six VAMCs  from the following locations to visit: Albany, New York; Cheyenne,  Wyoming; Detroit, Michigan; Miami, Florida; Palo Alto, California; and   St. Louis, Missouri. These VAMCs represent different surgical complexity  groups and geographic regions and serve veteran populations of different  sizes. At these six VAMCs, we examined the adequacy of the selected  purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing requirements to help the facilities  ensure the safety of veterans who received care at these facilities. To do  this, we examined how the selected requirements in these policies were  implemented and whether or to what extent the selected requirements  directly or indirectly created a potential risk to the safety of the veterans  receiving care at the VAMCs. We reviewed applicable VAMC committee  meeting minutes and other documentation on the implementation of these  requirements. We also interviewed VAMC officials who were responsible  for implementing the selected requirements in VA policies to determine  whether the selected requirements are adequate to help ensure veterans\u2019  safety.", "To examine VA\u2019s oversight of VAMCs\u2019 compliance with the purchasing,  tracking, and reprocessing requirements we selected, we reviewed VA\u2019s  oversight of these requirements and evaluated whether this oversight  provides VA with adequate information to identify and address  noncompliance. As part of this review, we assessed VA\u2019s oversight in the  context of federal standards for internal control for monitoring. The  internal control for monitoring refers to an agency\u2019s ability to assure that  ongoing review and supervision activities are conducted, with the scope  and frequency depending on the assessment of risks; deficiencies are  communicated to at least one higher level of management; and actions are  taken in response to findings or recommendations within established  timelines. We interviewed officials responsible for overseeing VAMCs\u2019  compliance with the requirements we selected for review from VA  headquarters, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), and six VISNs that  are responsible for overseeing compliance at the VAMCs we visited. In  addition, we obtained and reviewed relevant documents regarding VA  oversight, including internal reports, VAMCs\u2019 plans to correct problems  identified through oversight activities, and policy memorandums.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2010 to May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Veterans may receive certain  other health care services, such as dental care, without enrolling. VA  provides these services at various types of facilities, including VAMCs. In  providing these services to veterans, clinicians at VAMCs use expendable  medical supplies and RME. VA has established roles and responsibilities  within its system for purchasing, tracking, and reprocessing of these items  and policies that VAMCs are required to follow when purchasing and  tracking these items at their facilities.

VAMCs can purchase expendable medical supplies and  RME through their acquisition departments or through their clinical  departments, such as the radiology department. VA\u2019s policies include the  following requirements related to veterans\u2019 safety that VAMCs must follow  when purchasing expendable medical supplies and RME:  Committee review and approval. A designated VAMC committee must  review and approve proposed purchases of any expendable medical  supplies or RME that have not been previously purchased by the VAMC.  The committee, which typically includes administrative staff and clinicians  from various departments, reviews the proposed purchases to evaluate the  cost of the purchase as well as its likely effect on veterans\u2019 care. For  example, the committee that reviews and approves proposed RME  purchases often includes a representative from the department  responsible for reprocessing RME in order to determine whether the  VAMC has the capability to reprocess the item correctly and to ensure that  staff are appropriately trained to do so. Proper reprocessing of RME is  important to ensure that RME is safe to use and that veterans are not  exposed to infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV), during treatment.", "Signatures from two officials. All approvals for purchases of expendable  medical supplies and RME must be signed by two officials, the official  placing the order and the official responsible for approving the purchase.  This process helps ensure that purchases of expendable medical supplies  and RME are appropriate to use when providing care to veterans.", "VA has two inventory management systems that it requires VAMCs to use  to track the type and quantity of expendable medical supplies and RME  used in its facilities. VAMCs use information about the items in their  facilities for a variety of purposes, for example to readily determine  whether they have expendable medical supplies or RME that are the  subject of a manufacturer recall or a patient safety alert. VA policy  requires that each VAMC enter information about certain expendable  medical supplies and RME in their facilities into the appropriate system.  Specifically, VA policies include two key requirements related to veterans\u2019  safety that VAMCs must follow for tracking expendable medical supplies  and RME:  Tracking of expendable medical supplies. VAMCs must enter information  on all expendable medical supplies that are ordered on a recurring basis  into the Generic Inventory Package (GIP).", "Tracking of RME. VAMCs must enter information on all RME that is  classified as nonexpendable equipment by VA\u2019s Office of Acquisition,  Logistics, and Construction into the Automated Engineering Management  System / Medical Equipment Reporting System (AEMS/MERS).", "VA policies include requirements designed to help ensure that VAMCs  reprocess RME correctly, in order to help ensure that RME is safe for use  when providing care to veterans. VA\u2019s reprocessing policies include two  key types of requirements:  Training requirements. To ensure that RME is reprocessed in accordance  with manufacturers\u2019 guidelines, VA requires that each VAMC develop  device-specific training for reprocessing RME. To develop this training, VA  requires VAMCs to create device-specific standard operating procedures  (SOP), which provide step-by-step instructions for reprocessing. VA also  requires VAMCs to assess staff annually on their competence to reprocess  RME in accordance with these SOPs.", "Operational requirements. To ensure that reprocessing activities are  performed safely and that RME is reprocessed correctly, VA policies  establish operational requirements for VAMCs, which include that VAMC  staff must monitor sterilizers to ensure that they are functioning properly,  use personal protective equipment when performing reprocessing  activities, and segregate dirty and clean RME."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected VA Requirements for Tracking and Reprocessing Are Inadequate to Help Ensure Veterans\u2019 Safety", "paragraphs": ["We found that both the tracking and reprocessing requirements we  reviewed are inadequate to help ensure the safety of veterans who receive  care at VAMCs.

Specifically, VAMCs are not required to enter into GIP information on  expendable medical supplies purchased on a nonrecurring basis.  Furthermore, VAMCs are not required to enter into AEMS/MERS  information on RME that VA\u2019s Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and  Construction does not classify as nonexpendable equipment. RME that is  not classified as nonexpendable equipment includes certain surgical and  dental instruments. As a result, none of the six VAMCs we visited had  complete inventories of all of the expendable medical supplies or RME in  their facilities. Incomplete inventories of these items at VAMCs can pose  potential risks to veterans\u2019 safety.", "At all six of the VAMCs we visited, we identified examples of potential  risks to veterans\u2019 safety that may result from these inadequacies in VA\u2019s  tracking requirements. For example:  Limited ability to identify items on which there are alerts or recalls. In the  event of a manufacturer recall or patient safety alert related to an  expendable medical supply item or RME, VAMCs may be unable to use  their inventory management systems to systematically determine whether  the affected item is in their facilities and should therefore be removed so  that it is not used when providing care to veterans. Rather, VAMC officials  would have to rely on a physical search for the item throughout their  facilities\u2014and a physical search could miss items. As we reported in our  2010 testimony, VAMC officials and officials from the VA OIG told us that  in response to a patient safety alert in December 2008 regarding an  auxiliary water tube\u2014a type of RME that is used with a colonoscope\u2014 VAMC officials checked their inventory management systems and  concluded\u2014incorrectly\u2014that the tube was not used in the facility.  However, in March 2009, the VAMC discovered that the tube was in use in  the facility and was not being reprocessed correctly, potentially exposing  2,526 veterans to infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, and   hepatitis C.", "Difficulty maintaining appropriate inventories. Because GIP helps VAMCs  to ensure that they maintain appropriate quantities of supply items in their  facilities, VAMCs with incomplete information in GIP about the supplies in  their facilities may have difficulty ensuring that they maintain appropriate  quantities of these items. This may result in expendable medical supplies  being unavailable for veterans\u2019 care if needed or, alternatively, excess  supplies accumulating and expiring before they can be used. For example,  in 2009 and 2010, VA headquarters officials identified expired expendable  medical supplies, which were not being properly tracked in GIP, at three  of the six VAMCs we visited. Had these VAMCs been properly tracking  these supply items in GIP, they may have been able to maintain  appropriate quantities of items and therefore avoid unavailable or expired  supplies.", "Challenges developing required training. VAMCs with incomplete  information about the RME in their inventories face challenges identifying  the equipment for which they must develop device-specific reprocessing  training. None of the six VAMCs we visited relied on their inventory  management systems to systematically determine which types of RME  they had in their facilities. In fact, officials at all six VAMCs told us that  they had to use alternate methods, such as contacting individual staff  members or conducting searches in each clinical department, to determine  if the facility had a specific type of RME. These methods of searching for  RME make it difficult for VAMCs to ensure that they identify all of the  RME in their facilities for which they must develop device-specific  reprocessing training\u2014without inadvertently missing items\u2014and may  have contributed to delays in developing this training. Approximately   1 year after VA instituted the requirement for developing device-specific  training for reprocessing, three of the six VAMCs we visited had not yet  fully developed this training. Without appropriate training for reprocessing  RME, VAMCs cannot ensure that staff in their facilities are reprocessing  RME correctly so that these items are safe for use when caring for  veterans.", "At the time of our review, VA did not have plans to immediately address  the inadequacies we identified in the tracking requirements by requiring  VAMCs to enter information about all expendable medical supplies and  RME into VA\u2019s inventory management systems. VA headquarters officials  told us that they plan to address the inadequacies we identified in the  tracking requirements following implementation of a new inventory  management system\u2014Strategic Asset Management. However, VA had  suspended the implementation of this system as of March 2011. Although  VA did not plan on revising its tracking requirements immediately, officials  from two of the six VAMCs we visited told us that they have taken steps to  improve the information they maintain on the expendable medical  supplies at their facilities.

The VA reprocessing requirements we reviewed do not specify  the types of RME for which VAMCs must develop device-specific training.  This inadequacy has caused confusion among VAMCs and contributed to  inconsistent implementation of training for RME reprocessing. While VA  headquarters officials told us that the training requirement is intended to  apply to RME classified as critical\u2014such as surgical instruments\u2014and  semi-critical\u2014such as certain endoscopes, officials from five of the six  VAMCs we visited told us that they were unclear about the RME for which  they were required to develop device-specific training.", "Officials at one VAMC we visited told us that they did not develop all of  the required reprocessing training for critical RME\u2014such as surgical  instruments\u2014because they did not understand that they were required to  do so. Officials at another VAMC we visited also told us that they had  begun to develop device-specific training for reprocessing non-critical  RME, such as wheelchairs, even though they had not yet fully completed  device-specific training for more critical RME. Because these two VAMCs  had not developed the appropriate device-specific training for  reprocessing critical and semi-critical RME, staff at these VAMCs may not  have been reprocessing all RME properly, which potentially put the safety  of veterans receiving care at these facilities at risk.", "Conflicting guidance on the development of RME reprocessing training.  While VA requires VAMCs to develop device-specific training on  reprocessing RME, VA headquarters officials provided VAMCs with  conflicting guidance on how they should develop this training. For  example, officials at three VAMCs we visited told us that certain VA  headquarters or VISN officials stated that this device-specific training  should very closely match manufacturer guidelines\u2013-in one case  verbatim\u2014while other VA headquarters or VISN officials stated that this  training should be written in a way that could be easily understood by the  personnel responsible for reprocessing the RME. This distinction is  important, since VAMC officials told us that some of the staff responsible  for reprocessing the RME may have difficulty following the more technical  manufacturers\u2019 guidelines. In part because of VA\u2019s conflicting guidance,  VAMC officials told us that they had difficulty developing the required  device-specific training and had to rewrite the training materials multiple  times for RME at their facilities. Officials at five of the six VAMCs also told  us that developing the device-specific training for reprocessing RME was  both time consuming and resource intensive.", "VA\u2019s lack of specificity and conflicting guidance regarding its requirement  to develop device-specific training for reprocessing RME may have  contributed to delays in developing this training at several of the VAMCs  we visited. Officials from three of the six VAMCs told us that they had not  completed the development of device-specific training for RME since VA  established the training requirement in July 2009. As of October 2010,   15 months after VA issued the policy containing this requirement, officials  at one of the VAMCs we visited told us that device-specific training on  reprocessing had not been developed for about 80 percent of the critical  and semi-critical RME in use at the facility.", "VA headquarters officials told us that they are aware of the lack of  specificity and conflicting guidance provided to VAMCs regarding the  development of training for reprocessing RME, and were also aware of  inefficiencies resulting from each VAMC developing its own training for  reprocessing types of RME that are used in multiple VAMCs. In response,  VA headquarters officials told us that they have made available to all  VAMCS a database of standardized device-specific training developed by  RME manufacturers for approximately 1,000 types of RME and plan to  require VAMCs to implement this training by June 2011. The officials also  told us that VA headquarters is planning to develop device-specific training  available to all VAMCs for certain critical and semi-critical RME for which  RME manufacturers have not developed this training, such as dental  instruments.

Because VA does not require VAMCs to track information  about certain expendable medical supplies and RME in their inventory  management systems, VAMCs may be unaware of the complete inventory  of such items at their facilities. This knowledge is critical to maintain  available supplies on hand to serve veterans, to properly identify items for  which manufacturers have issued recalls, and to develop training on  reprocessing the RME in their inventory. Moreover, VA\u2019s lack of specificity  and conflicting guidance for developing device-specific training for  reprocessing RME has led to confusion among VAMCs about which types  of RME require device-specific training and how VAMCs should develop  that training. This confusion has contributed to some VAMCs not  developing training for their staff for some critical and semi-critical RME.  Until these weaknesses are addressed, the safety of veterans receiving  care at VAMCs could potentially be at risk.", "A general lack of oversight of VAMCs\u2019 compliance with selected  purchasing requirements makes it difficult for VA to identify and resolve  situations wherein items are purchased without proper review and  approval. A failure to review and approve these purchases poses safety  risks to veterans being treated in VAMCs. In fact, during our visits to  VAMCs, we noted examples of expendable medical supplies that were  purchased without appropriate review and approval. As a result, some  supplies may have been purchased without evaluating the likely effect on  veterans\u2019 care, or worse yet, the wrong supplies were ordered\u2014a mistake  that potentially led to some veterans being exposed to infectious diseases.  Furthermore, weaknesses in oversight of VAMCs\u2019 compliance with the  selected reprocessing requirements do not allow VA to identify and  subsequently address areas of noncompliance across all VAMCs, including  those that occur frequently, pose high risks to veterans\u2019 safety, or have not  been addressed by VAMCs.

To do this, we examined how the  requirements in these policies were implemented and whether the  requirements indirectly created a potential risk to the safety of veterans  who receive care at VAMCs. Specifically, at each VAMC we visited, we  reviewed applicable VAMC committee meeting minutes and other  documentation on the implementation of these requirements. We also  interviewed VAMC officials who were responsible for implementing the  selected requirements to determine whether the requirements were  adequate to help ensure veterans\u2019 safety.

As part of this review, we reviewed VA\u2019s oversight in the  context of federal standards for internal control for monitoring. The  internal control for monitoring refers to an agency\u2019s ability to assure that  ongoing review and supervision activities are conducted, with the scope  and frequency depending on the assessment of risks, deficiencies are  communicated to at least one higher level of management, and actions are  taken in response to findings or recommendations within established  timelines.", "We then interviewed officials from VA headquarters, including the Sterile  Processing Department, the Infectious Disease Program Office, and the  System-wide Ongoing Assessment and Review Strategy; VA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General; and the six VISNs that oversee the VAMCs we visited  who are responsible for overseeing compliance with VA\u2019s requirements,  including those we selected for our review.
