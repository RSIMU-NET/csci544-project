At the direction of the Chairman, the CJCS Exercise Program began in the early 1960s to provide joint training opportunities. According to CJCS policy, the exercise program\u2019s primary objective is to achieve joint preparedness. Specifically, joint exercises are to be designed to demonstrate that forces are proficient in wartime and other tasks considered essential by the regional commanders in chief (CINC). CJCS guidance allows the program to satisfy other national security objectives, including overseas presence, coalition building, and support of U.S. allies.", "However, the guidance requires the CINCs to ensure that the program accomplishes training essential to war-fighting missions first. The guidance also allows the CINCs to train for lesser contingencies, such as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, while emphasizing training for major contingencies.", "The Joint Staff\u2019s Operational Plans and Interoperability Directorate monitors and coordinates training activities under the CJCS Exercise Program. However, the program is actually implemented by the CINCs, who determine requirements, develop joint training plans, and conduct and evaluate CJCS exercises for their respective areas of responsibility. The military services provide forces to the CINCs and use service operation and maintenance funds to absorb the costs stemming from the forces\u2019 participation in the exercises. The Joint Staff allocates funds to cover transportation-related costs among the CINCs. Congress makes an annual appropriation for these transportation-related costs in the DOD-wide operations and maintenance account.", "The Joint Staff and CINCs coordinate some CJCS exercises with the Department of State and the National Security Council, including those that (1) involve large-scale participation of U.S. and foreign forces, (2) require granting rights or approval by another nation, (3) have particular political significance or are planned to occur in politically sensitive areas, or (4) are likely to receive prominent media attention. The State Department\u2019s role in the exercise program is primarily to review exercise plans and consult with the Joint Staff and CINCs about the implications of exercises to be held in politically sensitive regions.", "CJCS exercises may be simulated, live, or a combination of the two and can range from classroom seminars on a specific topic to the deployment of thousands of forces to train for military operations. Examples of these exercises include sending four senior military officials to a 3-day war game seminar to study the interrelationships during peacekeeping operations among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations, international and nongovernmental organizations, and the media; deploying about 1,350 land forces to a foreign country to conduct combined force tactical military operations, such as infantry tasks, reconnaissance, and combat medical operations; involving about 20,000 air, land, sea, and special operations forces in a training exercise to perform joint tasks, such as maneuvering to position, identifying targets, and providing combat support; and sending 300 Marine Corps and Air Force personnel overseas to construct a vehicle maintenance facility and renovate a community center and medical clinic.", "Over the past few years, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, CINCs, and military service commanders have expressed concerns to Congress about the high level of personnel deployments by a downsized force. DOD and Congress then considered the possibility that CJCS exercises were impacting the high DOD-wide deployment rate. On the basis of this and other concerns, the Secretary of Defense directed in May 1997 that the number of CJCS exercise man-days be decreased by 15 percent between fiscal year 1996 and 1998 to reduce the potential impact of the exercise program on deployment rates. Also, Congress, in its conference report for DOD fiscal year 1998 appropriations, called for a reduction in funding for the CJCS Exercise Program\u2014including both DOD-wide and service incremental funds\u2014of about $118.5 million.", "In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (P.L. 105-85) directed DOD to report on CJCS exercises conducted from fiscal year 1995 to 1997 and those planned for fiscal years 1998 to 2000. This one-time congressional reporting requirement was to include (1) the percentage of mission-essential tasks performed or scheduled, (2) exercise costs, (3) exercise priority, (4) an assessment of the training value of each exercise, and (5) options to minimize the effect of CJCS exercises on deployments.

On average, about 37 percent of these exercises have or will train forces to implement the CINCs\u2019 existing contingency plans; about 60 percent are designed to prepare U.S. forces for joint operations; and approximately 44 percent are designed primarily for engagement purposes, such as projecting U.S. military presence abroad or fostering relations with foreign military forces."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exercises Directed to Execute Contingency Plans", "paragraphs": ["CINCs develop contingency plans that cover a wide variety of wartime and peacetime operations, such as major theater wars and evacuations.

Thus, joint training under the CJCS Exercise Program is primarily designed to train forces, commanders, or staff of two or more services using joint doctrine, tactics, techniques, or procedures to employ forces.", "The percentage of exercises intended to provide joint training at the regional CINCs has increased over the past 3 to 4 years. In 1995, we reported that about 25 percent of CJCS exercises in fiscal years 1994-95 were designed to provide joint training. Our current evaluation of 1,405 exercises conducted during fiscal years 1995-97 and planned to be conducted during fiscal years 1998-2002 shows that 836, or about 60 percent, were or are intended to provide U.S. forces with joint training experience.

Table 1 shows the exercises directed toward joint training.", "In its February 1998 mandated report to Congress, DOD reported that 66 percent of CJCS exercises were for joint training purposes. Differences between DOD\u2019s and our figures can be attributed to methodological differences in the evaluations. For example, DOD used planned exercises for the period 1995-2000, and we used a combination of actual exercises for 1995-97 and planned exercises for 1998-2002.

CINC officials told us that maintaining total cost information would be of no value to them because they are not responsible for paying these costs. The Joint Staff does allocate each CINC an annual strategic lift funding level, which is not to be exceeded, to manage CJCS exercises. Consequently, CINC officials said total cost information would have little bearing on their management responsibilities.", "Because individual military services provide forces for CJCS exercises, they incur and pay for the incremental operations and maintenance costs associated with the forces\u2019 participation. These costs, which include consumable supplies, repair parts, and non-aviation fuel, are tracked differently by each service. Depending on the service, costs incurred by units that are preparing to participate in an exercise, equipment maintenance and repair expenses, and costs associated with recovering from participation in the exercises may or may not be tracked. To assist the Joint Staff in developing the exercise program costs for the February 1998 report, the services provided estimated cost data related to such items as consumable supplies, repair parts, per diem, non-aviation fuel, and communications.", "No commonly accepted process among the service component commands exists to capture CJCS exercise costs; therefore, the services\u2019 cost estimates will vary according to what costs they choose to include. The Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps maintained some cost data on the incremental operations and maintenance costs associated with their participation in CJCS exercises. In fiscal year 1997, for example, these services reported costs of about $54 million, $11 million, and $12 million, respectively. They developed these estimates using various systems and records of funding targets to help the Joint Staff meet its congressional reporting requirement. Navy components do not track operations and maintenance funds for flying hours and steaming days used during CJCS exercises, and Air Force components do not track flying hours used for the exercises. In providing information to the Joint Staff to satisfy DOD\u2019s reporting requirement, the Navy and the Air Force estimated incremental operations and maintenance costs, excluding flying hours and steaming days.", "Service component officials cited two reasons for not accumulating cost data at the level necessary to accurately determine total operations and maintenance costs associated with participation in CJCS exercises. First, such data would not enhance their management capabilities. Second, there was no DOD-wide requirement for them to track and report these costs. The officials said that any measure of the actual operations and maintenance costs consumed by CJCS Exercise Program participation would require individual unit commanders in the field (e.g., tank operators, pilots, mechanics, or explosive ordnance specialists) to maintain such cost data and report it through financial management channels.

However, the services do not regularly track the impact of participation in CJCS exercises on overall deployment rates. As a result, officials from the Joint Staff, CINCs, service headquarters, and service components at the five regional commands could not provide complete information on the total number of days consumed by all deployments, including those associated with CJCS exercises.

We reported in April 1996 that it is difficult to determine the actual time that either military personnel or units are deployed. Our report recommended that the Secretary of Defense (1) establish a DOD-wide definition of deployment; (2) state whether each service should have a goal, policy, or regulation stipulating the maximum amount of time units and personnel may be deployed; and (3) define the minimum data on deployments that each service must collect and maintain. DOD agreed to further pursue initiatives\u2014many which were noted in our report\u2014to enhance its ability to manage deployments. Also, in January 1997, DOD forwarded a report to the Chairman, House National Security Committee, on the impact of increased deployments on training, retention, and readiness. As part of that study, the Joint Staff assessed the capabilities of service systems to track personnel deployments. The report noted that, although all the services had systems in place to monitor deployments, each service measured and defined personnel deployment differently. For example, the Army tracks personnel at both the unit and individual level, whereas the Marine Corps and the Navy track personnel only at the unit level. The Air Force tracks personnel by aircraft type and specialty type.", "The difficulty with measuring either military personnel or unit deployment rates stems in part from the differences in how each military service defines and tracks personnel deployments. The services have different definitions of deployed forces. For example, the Marine Corps considers a servicemember deployed after that person has been away from his or her home station for 10 days, but the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy consider personnel to be deployed after only 1 day away from their home station.

At the time of our visits, officials at the service components at the regional commands had not been regularly maintaining data on the participation of their personnel in CJCS exercises. Some CINCs have tried to determine this relationship, but their data and methodologies had flaws. For example, the U.S. Pacific Command performed an analysis on the relationship between CJCS participation and personnel deployments. The analysis showed that about 4 percent of the total deployed days spent by service components in fiscal year 1996 were attributable to participation in CJCS exercises. However, the analysis did not include data from all of the units assigned to the command, the components determined deployment days differently, and the information provided by the components was not complete. For example, their personnel tracking systems do not calculate the number of days used by deployments for CJCS exercises.", "The lack of such information is especially evident at the U.S. Atlantic Command, which has responsibility for training and deploying nearly 80 percent of all U.S. forces. Officials from this command stated that, to assess the impact of CJCS exercises on personnel deployment rates, the command would need an adequate database with visibility into all deployments, operations, exercises, and training events. Command officials stated that they do not have historical personnel deployment data for all of their units; therefore, they could not determine the impact of participation in CJCS exercises on personnel deployment rates. The officials also stated that they do not have information on the extent of unit deployments and therefore do not consider this factor when selecting units for exercises.", "Although many factors contribute to the pace of deployments, such as routine training, peacekeeping efforts, and major deployments, the military officials we met with believe that personnel deployments created by participation in CJCS exercises have a minimal impact on the overall DOD-wide deployment rate. Nevertheless, the Secretary of Defense directed in the May 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review that CJCS exercise man-days be reduced by 15 percent between fiscal year 1996 and 1998 to reduce the stress on overall DOD-wide personnel deployments caused by these exercises. The officials we met with believe that any reduction in CJCS exercise participation would have virtually no impact on overall DOD-wide deployment problems. Participation in CJCS exercises has a greater impact on the personnel deployment of low-density, high-demand units rather than military units in general, according to these officials. However, their conclusion was based on professional military judgment, since no systems exist to measure the impact of the exercise program on total deployment.", "In its February 1998 report to Congress, DOD describes various actions underway to reduce personnel deployments incurred as a result of the CJCS Exercise Program.

Although the Office of the Secretary of Defense questions whether deployment problems exist, concerns expressed by Joint Staff, CINCs, and service component officials have led to actions by both DOD and Congress to reduce overall deployment rates by reducing the CJCS program in terms of funding and the number of exercises. Because DOD does not consistently track information on deployments, the impact of the exercise program on overall deployment rates cannot be precisely determined. Although DOD agreed to consider the recommendations in our April 1996 report to address the problem of managing personnel deployment rates, it has yet to fully implement them.
