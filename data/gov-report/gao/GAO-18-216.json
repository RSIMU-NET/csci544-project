Specifically, growth in e-commerce has contributed to a shift in the sale of counterfeit goods in the United States, with consumers increasingly purchasing goods online and counterfeiters producing a wider variety of goods that may be sold on websites alongside authentic products. For example, 20 of 47 items GAO purchased from third-party sellers on popular consumer websites were counterfeit, according to testing by the products' rights holders (see table), highlighting potential risks to consumers. The changes in the market for counterfeit goods can also pose challenges to the private sector\u2014for example, the challenge of distinguishing counterfeit from authentic goods listed for sale online\u2014and complicate the enforcement efforts of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).", "CBP and ICE engage in a number of activities to enhance IPR enforcement; however, while ICE has assessed some of its efforts, CBP has taken limited steps to do so. CBP's and ICE's IPR enforcement activities broadly include detecting imports of potentially IPR-infringing goods, conducting special operations at U.S. ports, engaging with international partners, and undertaking localized pilot programs or port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE have collected some performance data for each of the eight activities GAO reviewed, and ICE has taken some steps to understand the impact of its efforts. However, CBP has conducted limited evaluation of its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement. Consequently, CBP may lack information needed to ensure it is investing its resources in the most efficient and effective activities.", "CBP and ICE generally collaborate on IPR enforcement, but according to private sector representatives, restrictions on CBP's information sharing limit private sector enforcement efforts. GAO found that CBP and ICE have undertaken efforts that align with selected key practices for interagency collaboration, such as participating in developing a national IPR enforcement strategy and agreeing on roles and responsibilities. However, sharing additional information about seized items with rights-holding companies and e-commerce websites could improve enforcement, according to private sector representatives. CBP officials said they share information to the extent allowed under current regulations, but CBP has not completed an assessment of what, if any, additional information would be beneficial to share with private sector entities. Without such an assessment, CBP will not know if sharing additional information requires regulatory or legal changes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations to CBP, recommending that it (1) evaluate its efforts to enhance IPR enforcement and (2) assess potential additional information sharing with the private sector.

For example, CBP and ICE have seized and investigated  counterfeit goods, such as integrated circuits, destined for Department of  Defense supply chains. Additionally, counterfeiting has been linked to  transnational organized crime and terrorist organizations. According to  the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, the illicit trafficking of  counterfeit goods is an increasingly attractive avenue for criminal  organizations to diversify their product range. Criminal networks use  similar routes and methods to move counterfeit goods as they use to  smuggle drugs, firearms, and people, according to reports from U.S. law  enforcement and international organizations. The high rate of return on  investment and perceived low risk of prosecution associated with IP  crimes make counterfeiting attractive to criminal organizations as a  lucrative source of revenue, according to the IPR Center.", "In 2010, we reported that counterfeiting also posed a wide range of  economic risks to consumers, industry, government, and the economy as  a whole. Counterfeiting\u2019s economic effects on consumers include, for  example, financial losses resulting from counterfeit products that fail due  to inferior quality. In addition, counterfeiting may pose risks to industry  and government by increasing IPR protection and enforcement costs, by  affecting sales and brand value for the businesses whose products are  counterfeited, and by potentially reducing tax revenue collected by the  government.

For example, one item  contained misspellings of \u201cAustin, TX\u201d and \u201cMade in China,\u201d as figure 3  shows.", "Other items could be more difficult for a typical consumer to identify as  counterfeit. For example, the rights holder for a cosmetic product we  purchased identified one counterfeit item on the basis of discrepancies in  the color, composition, and design of the authentic and counterfeit items\u2019  packaging, as figure 4 shows.", "Counterfeit goods may also lack key elements of certification markings  and other identifiers. For example, on a counterfeit phone charger we  purchased, the UL certification mark did not include all components of the  authentic mark, as shown in figure 5.", "The risks associated with the types of counterfeit goods we purchased  can extend beyond the infringement of a company\u2019s IPR. For example, a  UL investigation of counterfeit iPhone adapters found a 99 percent failure  rate in 400 counterfeit adapters tested for safety, fire, and shock hazards  and found that 12 of the adapters posed a risk of lethal electrocution to  the user. Similarly, counterfeits of common consumer goods, such as  Yeti travel mugs, may contain higher-than-approved concentrations of  dangerous chemicals such as lead, posing health risks to consumers.  According to ICE, seized counterfeit cosmetics have been found to  contain hazardous substances, including cyanide, arsenic, mercury, lead,  urine, and rat droppings.", "Representatives of rights holders and e-commerce websites whom we  interviewed reported taking independent action to try to protect IPR within  their areas of responsibility. Both rights holders and e-commerce  websites maintain IPR protection teams that work with one another and  with law enforcement to address infringement issues. These teams may  include global networks of investigators and contracted brand-protection  companies. E-commerce websites may also take a variety of steps to  block and remove counterfeit items listed by third-party sellers. These  efforts rely on data collected through a variety of means, including  consumer reporting of counterfeits, notification by rights holders of IPR  infringement, and corporate efforts to vet potential third-party sellers,  according to private sector representatives. According to these  representatives, both rights holders and e-commerce websites have  utilized technology to aid their efforts. For example, one rights holder  uses search-engine \u201ccrawlers\u201d to find terms commonly associated with  counterfeit sales, in an effort to identify illicit sites and the individuals  behind them, while one e-commerce website maintains a large database  of information on the history and activity of its sellers.", "According to representatives of rights holders, consumers can best  protect themselves by buying directly from the manufacturer or its  authorized retailers online, avoiding prices that look \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d  and reporting counterfeit purchases.

First, the increasing sophistication of counterfeits can make it  difficult for law enforcement officers to distinguish between legitimate and  counterfeit goods. According to CBP officers, because the quality of  counterfeits is improving, inspecting and processing a seizure can be time  consuming and often requires working with private industry to test  potential counterfeits.", "Second, the increased variety and quantity of counterfeit goods crossing  the border complicate CBP and ICE enforcement efforts. As the range of  counterfeit goods expands, CBP has a wider variety of goods to screen,  which requires CBP officials to have in-depth knowledge of a broad range  of products and of how to identify counterfeits. The overall volume of  goods entering the country\u2014including more than 11 million maritime  containers; 13 million containers carried over land borders by truck or rail;  and 250 million cargo, mail, and express carrier packages annually\u2014can  also be difficult to manage, according to CBP officials. CBP has  responsibility for facilitating trade as well as preventing the importation of  illicit goods\u2014missions that can conflict when attempts to identify illicit  goods threaten to slow the movement of legitimate trade. Additionally, the  increased volume of imports at specific locations can strain CBP  resources. For example, CBP officials at one international mail facility  noted that the volume of both incoming mail and counterfeit goods  increased exponentially when some international mail shipments from  China were rerouted to enter the United States through that port.", "Third, shifts in the mode of transportation of counterfeit goods to the  United States pose additional challenges to CBP and ICE. According to  CBP officials, seizure processing takes roughly the same amount of time  and costs the same regardless of shipment size or value, which means  that CBP must expend the same resources to seize an express carrier  shipment that contains a few infringing goods as it would to seize a large  cargo container with hundreds of infringing goods. Another effect of the  shift in transportation mode is that seizures have become less of a  deterrent for counterfeiters who break up large shipments into multiple  smaller express carrier or mail packages. Each of these smaller packages  includes fewer goods than a single large shipment, decreasing the  counterfeiter\u2019s risk of losing significant quantities of merchandise to a  single seizure. Furthermore, the shift in mode of transportation affects  CBP\u2019s ability to target shipments in advance. For example, as we have  previously reported, the mail environment generally does not provide CBP  with access to advance information that can be used for targeting or  package retrieval. In other shipping environments, CBP officials may  have access to advance information that they can use to target potentially  counterfeit goods.", "Fourth, counterfeiters may use a variety of methods to try to deceive law  enforcement or evade detection. A large majority of infringing products  are produced overseas and shipped to the United States, according to the  Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator. According to CBP  officials and CBP, IPR Center, and Intellectual Property Enforcement  Coordinator reports, counterfeiters may try to evade detection in a  number of ways. For example, counterfeiters sometimes separate IPR- infringing labels from counterfeit goods during the transportation process  and then complete the labeling and packaging of the goods in the United  States (see fig. 6). In fiscal year 2016, CBP seized 572 shipments  containing counterfeit labels and tags intended to be applied to articles  after importation to create non-genuine products, which CBP estimated  would be worth more than $17 million if they were genuine.", "Finally, CBP and ICE officials noted that targeting the root causes of IPR  infringement requires international cooperation to disrupt the networks  that produce, sell, and ship counterfeit goods. IPR enforcement is a  global issue, as counterfeit operations may cross several borders;  however, officials said some countries are more receptive to working with  U.S. agencies than others. For example, ICE officials noted that some  countries, such as China, do not have stringent IP laws in place or do not  enforce existing laws.

Tracking goods from known counterfeiters through various website  fulfillment and delivery mechanisms is also a significant challenge for  the private sector.", "The growth of e-commerce has accelerated the pace at which  counterfeiters can gain access to consumers or reinvent themselves if  shut down.

CBP and ICE engage  in a number of activities to detect imports of potentially IPR-infringing  goods. For example, CBP officers at each port have responsibilities  for targeting such goods, and CBP conducts targeting and trend  analysis at the national level. As we observed during our port visits,  CBP also uses its Automated Targeting System to review data on  inbound and outbound shipments and to identify shipments of  potential concern. CBP has created two IPR targeting models for the  system. In addition, CBP and ICE both maintain online systems for  reporting allegations of counterfeiting and other IPR infringements.", "Conducting special operations. CBP and ICE periodically conduct  special operations\u2014such as operations focused on particular  products or surge operations that provide additional manpower to  examine a larger number of shipments\u2014at U.S. ports of entry. CBP\u2019s  Mobile Intellectual Property Enforcement Team (MIPET) and ICE\u2019s  national operations are examples of activities in this area of effort.", "Engaging with international partners. IPR enforcement requires  coordination with international partners. The IPR Center includes  representatives of the governments of Canada and Mexico, as well as  international law enforcement entities like Interpol and Europol. CBP  and ICE also work with the customs and law enforcement agencies in  other countries to share information, provide training, and conduct  joint operations.", "Undertaking localized pilots and port-led initiatives. CBP and ICE  delegate much of the responsibility for day-to-day enforcement to  ports, Centers, and field offices. This allows CBP\u2019s headquarters  offices to test pilot programs in a small number of ports and allows  ports and Centers to initiate their own activities to enhance IPR  enforcement. CBP engaged in localized pilots or port-led initiatives to  enhance IPR enforcement at each of the locations we visited.", "Within these areas of effort, CBP and ICE have undertaken activities to  enhance their IPR enforcement.

In particular, (1) CBP\u2019s metrics for  tracking the overall effectiveness of its IPR enforcement have limitations,  (2) CBP has not systematically evaluated individual IPR enforcement  activities, and (3) CBP lacks a defined process for assessing port-led  initiatives and sharing information about effective practices.", "First, CBP\u2019s metrics for tracking the overall effectiveness of its IPR  enforcement have limitations. When asked how they assess effectiveness  of CBP\u2019s IPR enforcement, CBP officials in headquarters cited an  increase in the number and value of IPR seizures as an indication of the  effectiveness of CBP\u2019s IPR enforcement efforts. However, while seizure  statistics provide important information about CBP activities, using  seizure data to measure the effectiveness of CBP\u2019s IPR enforcement has  limitations. For example, according to the U.S. Joint Strategic Plan on  Intellectual Property Enforcement for fiscal years 2017 through 2019, it is  difficult to determine whether an increase in the number of IPR seizures  represents a result of more-effective IPR enforcement or reflects a higher  volume of trade in counterfeits. Also, according to CBP officials, the  increasing shift from seizures of large cargo shipments to seizures of  smaller express carrier and mail shipments may partially explain the  growth in the number of reported seizures. Further, while CBP officials in  headquarters noted that the overall value of IPR seizures has increased,  CBP officials in the field observed that presenting CBP seizure statistics  in relation to the overall volume of trade could provide additional context  on whether CBP is seizing a larger portion of overall shipments or  whether increased seizures might be partially attributable to an increase  in the volume of trade. Other CBP officials noted that, in theory, effective  enforcement could cause the number of seizures to decrease as the  number of counterfeits entering the country also decreases. Finally, given  the volume of trade in counterfeits, CBP officials commented that CBP  cannot \u201cseize its way out of\u201d the problem of IP theft.", "Second, CBP has not systematically evaluated its individual IPR  enforcement activities and has not followed through on previous plans to  conduct such evaluations. We identified one instance in which CBP  evaluated an IPR enforcement activity. Specifically, CBP officials  conducted an analysis of the fiscal year 2016 expedited seizure  processing pilot and identified several benefits, including savings of  frontline officer hours and time and cost savings, associated with seizure  processing. While CBP has acknowledged the need to evaluate other IPR  enforcement activities, it has not followed through on previous plans to  conduct evaluations. For example, CBP\u2019s 2010 IPR Enforcement  Strategy: 5-Year Plan laid out goals and corresponding activities that it  planned to pursue. CBP outlined specific plans to evaluate all but one of  these goals at least once over the course of the 5-year period covered by  the strategy. In response to our questions about what activities had been  undertaken and how they had been evaluated, CBP could not provide  evidence that it had conducted evaluations of any of these activities as  planned.", "CBP has more recently said that it plans to evaluate other IPR  enforcement efforts to better understand their impact. For example, one  goal of MIPET and other surge operations is to build the capacity of  officers at participating ports. The U.S. Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual  Property Enforcement for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 notes that CBP  intends to assess ports after surge operations to determine their effect on  long-term interdiction rates. Additionally, although CBP tracks the  accuracy of its Automated Targeting System\u2019s IPR targeting models, a  CBP official stated that CBP has not evaluated the extent to which its  officers use these models at ports of entry. Officials said that such  evaluation would be beneficial for determining whether to continue using  the models and, if so, whether policy changes are needed to improve  their use. The U.S. Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property  Enforcement also states that CBP plans to evaluate the voluntary  abandonments pilot, and CBP officials noted their intention to evaluate  compliance rates in various e-commerce environments to inform future  enforcement efforts.", "Finally, CBP does not have a standard process for collecting information  about the results of port-led initiatives to enhance IPR enforcement and  for sharing this information internally. We have previously noted that  agencies can use pilots and demonstration projects to identify innovative  ways to improve performance, because pilots and demonstration projects  allow for experiences to be evaluated, shared systematically with others,  and adjusted as appropriate. CBP\u2019s decentralized structure allows it to  pilot new activities at individual ports. CBP officials stated that they  currently collect information on special operations conducted at ports but  that they do not have a standardized process for assessing port-led  efforts and sharing information on process improvements. Officials also  noted that they sometimes share information about port-led efforts during  quarterly phone calls and stated that they had shared information about  the expedited seizure processing initiative and the Special Operations  Team in such calls. However, they were unable to provide examples of  information about other port-led initiatives that had been shared through  this process. Officials we interviewed in the field and in headquarters  indicated that sharing of such information could be useful.", "Federal internal control standards state that agency management should  use data it collects to make informed decisions and evaluate the agency\u2019s  performance in achieving key objectives. According to federal program  evaluation guidance, which articulates best practices for program  evaluation, a program evaluation is a systematic study using research  methods to collect and analyze data to assess how well a program is  working and why. Program evaluation is closely related to performance  measurement and reporting. Evaluations answer specific questions about  program performance; may focus on assessing program operations or  results; and can play a key role in strategic planning and program  management, providing feedback on both program design and execution.  CBP officials acknowledged that further steps to evaluate their IPR  enforcement efforts would be useful.

ICE officials noted that evaluating the impacts of specific IPR enforcement  activities, including those we reviewed, can be difficult, because these  impacts ultimately rely on prosecutors\u2019 decisions to pursue criminal  charges\u2014that is, decisions over which ICE has no control. ICE officials  also noted factors that limit the usefulness of enforcement statistics, such  as arrests or convictions for IPR-related offenses, as measures of the  effectiveness of ICE\u2019s IPR enforcement activities. First, according to ICE  officials, prosecutors for some cases that start as IPR investigations  ultimately pursue money laundering or other, related charges, because  they carry harsher penalties. Second, while ICE collects data on  enforcement outcomes by fiscal year, the complicated nature of some  investigations often causes a significant amount of time to elapse  between an investigation\u2019s start and any results. Thus, various IPR  enforcement statistics reported for a single fiscal year, such as the  number of cases initiated, arrests made, or convictions secured, may be  unrelated, making it sometimes difficult to link enforcement outcomes to  ICE investigations.", "To address some of these challenges, ICE has created a process to track  cases it deems significant, which, according to ICE officials, will allow it to  better understand the impact of its efforts. ICE officials told us that ICE  had developed a set of criteria for what constitutes a significant case and  that a panel reviews proposals from the field to determine whether an  investigation meets the criteria for a significant case. If a case is deemed  significant, ICE tracks it until (1) the criminal activity is disrupted (i.e.,  actions taken as part of the investigation impede the operations of the  target organization) or (2) a criminal organization is dismantled (i.e., the  leadership, network, and financial base of the target organization are  impeded to the point where it is unable to reconstitute itself). According to  ICE, of the 115 IPR-related investigations that were deemed significant  cases in fiscal years 2012 through 2016, 59 cases, or about 51 percent,  had resulted in a disruption of criminal activity or dismantlement of a  criminal organization as of January 2017."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP and ICE Generally Collaborate on IPR Enforcement, but CBP Is Restricted in Sharing Information with the Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that CBP and ICE collaboration on IPR enforcement  is generally consistent with selected key practices for interagency  collaboration and that the agencies collaborated to address some  challenges they have faced with the creation of the Centers.

Both CBP and ICE  officials noted that the creation of the Centers has posed communication  challenges, but the agencies have taken steps to address some of the  challenges posed by the new organizational structure. Officials at ports  we visited and Centers we interviewed noted that there were challenges  associated with integrating the Centers, which operate nationally, into  local efforts, like the CEAR process. This is consistent with our June 2017  report, in which we noted that ICE officials have had to adjust to working  in the new, nationwide environment of the Centers. For example, ICE  officials in one city may be working on a case with an import specialist  located in another city.

We interviewed CBP and ICE officials in Washington, D.C.,  and in field locations in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Miami,  Florida; and New York, New York, to discuss the composition of IPR- infringing goods and challenges the agencies face in enforcing IPR. We  selected these locations on the basis of the number and composition of IP  seizures in each location, the availability of multiple ports of entry  covering different modes of transportation, and geographic diversity. We  also interviewed representatives of IP rights\u2013holding companies and e- commerce websites to discuss the challenges counterfeit goods pose in  online marketplaces.", "In addition, in an attempt to understand the frequency with which  consumers may unknowingly encounter counterfeit products online, we  used investigative tools and techniques to conduct nongeneralizable,  undercover purchases of consumer goods from third-party sellers on  popular consumer websites and asked the rights holders to test the goods  to determine whether they were authentic or counterfeit.", "We selected four trademarked consumer products of which CBP often  seizes counterfeits, according to CBP seizure data and CBP officials,  and that represented a range of consumer goods: Nike Air Jordan  shoes, Yeti travel mugs, Urban Decay cosmetics, and UL\u2013certified  phone chargers.", "We selected five popular e-commerce websites that (1) were among  the top 50 consumer shopping websites as of March 2017, according  to Alexa, a data analytics company, and (2) received a rating of \u201cB\u201d or  better from the Better Business Bureau. From the top 50 consumer  shopping websites, we chose those that (1) offered platforms for third- party sales, (2) sold a variety of trademarked products to the public,  and (3) offered a minimum of two items from at least two different  third-party sellers.", "We purchased, and had rights holders test, a total of 47 items from  third-party sellers on the five e-commerce websites. We selected  items that were advertised as new, brand-name items, and we  generally selected the lowest-priced items, factoring in both purchase  price and shipping while also targeting a variety of sellers and product  options. We did not select items whose cost exceeded the  manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price or exceeded that of an identical  item sold and fulfilled by the host website. Where seller ratings were  available, we selected items from third-party sellers with ratings of 60  percent (or the equivalent, such as 3 of 5 stars) or higher; on average,  the sellers of the items we selected had customer ratings above 90  percent as of August 2017.", "For each selected product, we purchased a minimum of two items and  a maximum of five items from different third-party sellers on any of the  five e-commerce websites that listed the product. Across all the  websites, we purchased a minimum of eight items for each product.  On each website, we purchased a maximum of one item from any  third-party seller.", "We contacted the companies that held the trademark or copyright for  each of the four products, asking for their assistance in reviewing the  items we purchased to determine whether they were authentic or  counterfeit. These companies made their assessments with no  knowledge of the websites or sellers from which we purchased the  items. We discussed the results of these tests with representatives of  the rights-holding companies and the e-commerce websites where we  purchased the items.", "To examine the efforts CBP and ICE have undertaken to improve IPR  enforcement and the extent to which they have assessed the results of  those efforts, we reviewed agency and government-wide strategic plans  for IPR enforcement, and we spoke with agency officials in headquarters  and selected field locations. We reviewed a selection of eight CBP and  ICE activities, which we grouped under four major areas of effort on the  basis of the activities highlighted in these strategic plans and agency  interviews. The list of activities we reviewed does not constitute the  entirety of activities undertaken by CBP and ICE to enhance IPR  enforcement and is intended to highlight significant efforts. We did not  review activities that officials told us were in early stages, because it  would not be reasonable to expect the agencies to have assessed the  results of those activities. Our discussion of activities does not include  activities related to private sector engagement, which we discuss  elsewhere in the report. We reviewed documentation pertaining to the  eight activities we reviewed, and we interviewed CBP and ICE officials  about the activities and any efforts to assess their results. We reviewed  federal internal control standards and prior GAO reports to identify good  practices for assessing the results of activities, and we determined the  extent to which CBP and ICE had followed those practices.", "To examine the extent to which CBP and ICE follow selected practices for  effective interagency collaboration, we reviewed agency documentation  and spoke with CBP and ICE officials in headquarters and in selected  field locations. We reviewed prior GAO reports to identify effective  practices for interagency collaboration and selected five of eight practices  that we had identified in a fiscal year 2006 report. The five practices we  selected as most relevant to the ways in which CBP and ICE coordinate  with one another are (1) establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies;  (2) define and articulate a common outcome; (3) agree on roles and  responsibilities; (4) identify and address needs by leveraging resources;  and (5) establish compatible policies, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries. We did not evaluate CBP and ICE\u2019s  interagency collaboration against the remaining three practices identified  in our fiscal year 2006 report. We also assessed CBP\u2019s intra-agency  collaboration against three of the five selected practices on the basis of  interviews with CBP officials in headquarters and selected field locations  and reviews of CBP documentation. We did not evaluate internal CBP  collaboration against the other two practices\u2014establish mutually reinforcing or joint strategies and define and articulate a common  outcome\u2014because we determined that such practices were not  applicable to intra-CBP collaboration. To determine the ways in which  CBP and ICE collaborate with the private sector, we interviewed CBP and  ICE officials in headquarters and selected field locations, reviewed CBP  and ICE documentation, and interviewed representatives of rights-holding  companies and e-commerce websites.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to January  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Locate the listed retailer on the product page and determine whether it  is a third party. \u201cFulfilled by\u201d does not mean \u201cSold by.\u201d  2.  Look for external consumer trust\u2013building features, such as a mailing  address or telephone number, real-time customer service, customer  reviews, or third-party accreditation that can be verified through the  accreditor.  3.  Buy products only from authorized retailers, such as official brand  stores. If uncertain whether a retailer acquired its product from a  legitimate distributor, ask for verifiable information from the retailer  about the source of the goods.  4.  Be aware of pricing. While some counterfeiters may try to legitimize  their merchandise with realistic prices, others may attract buyers with  low prices. If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is.  5.  During checkout, ensure your payments are submitted via a website  beginning with https:// and look for a lock symbol in your web browser.  6.  After receiving an item, look for signs that it may be counterfeit, such  as irregular brand markings; missing \u201cuse by\u201d dates, safety seals, or  markings; and missing warranty information. Verify the item\u2019s serial  number by checking the manufacturer\u2019s website.  7.  If you suspect that you have purchased a counterfeit product, notify  the brand owner and contact the place of purchase. Also, report the  counterfeit at http://www.iprcenter.gov/referral.
