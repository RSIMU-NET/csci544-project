GAO's analysis of state agency data for California and Texas from 1997 through 1999 showed that three percent of participating employers accounted for 82 percent of all hires of WOTC-certified workers. Many employers who participated in the tax credit program in those two states in 1999 say that, besides the opportunity to obtain the credit, their participation in the program was also greatly influenced by such factors as the need to address a labor shortage and the opportunity to be a good corporate citizen.

However, as government and academic analysts have pointed out, the credit may also create incentives for employers to dismiss workers who do not make the employer eligible for the credit. Specifically, employers can increase their tax credit by dismissing workers for whom the employer has never received a tax credit in order to hire other workers who make the employer eligible for a credit; this practice is called displacement. Employers can also increase their tax credit by dismissing workers whose eligibility for the credit has ended and hiring other workers who make the employer again eligible for a credit; this practice is called churning.", "Little is known about the employers who participate in the WOTC program or about participating employers\u2019 motivations for hiring and retaining workers for whom the employers can receive a tax credit.

To obtain information relating to the extent of churning and displacement, we (1) surveyed a probability sample of employers who participated in the credit program in California and Texas and (2) analyzed data from agencies in these two states on the actual earnings and employment histories of certified employees. We chose California and Texas primarily because they are among the states that certified the largest number of employees to participate in the WOTC program in fiscal year 1999 and have electronic databases of their WOTC program data. We did not evaluate the effectiveness or efficiency of the WOTC in promoting the hiring of disadvantaged individuals. For example, we did not determine the extent to which employers may have received \u201cwindfall\u201d credits for employees whom they would have hired anyway.

Our survey instruments are reproduced in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The WOTC is intended to encourage employers to hire individuals from eight targeted groups that have consistently high unemployment rates. The targeted groups are individuals in families currently or previously receiving welfare benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program or its precursor, the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program;   veterans in families currently or previously receiving assistance under a   food stamp recipients\u2014aged 18 through 24 years\u2014in families currently or previously receiving assistance under a food stamp program;   youth\u2014aged 18 through 24 years\u2014who live within an empowerment zone   youth\u2014aged 16 and 17 years\u2014who live within an empowerment zone or enterprise community and are hired for summer employment only;   ex-felons in low-income families; individuals currently or previously receiving Supplemental Security Income; and individuals currently or previously receiving vocational rehabilitation services.", "Additional eligibility criteria apply to these groups. For example, welfare recipients must have received AFDC or TANF benefits for any 9 months during the 18-month period ending on the hiring date in order to be eligible for the program.", "The amount of tax credit that employers can claim under this program depends upon how long they retain credit-eligible employees and the amount of wages they pay to WOTC-certified employees. Employers who retain certified employees for at least 120 but less than 400 hours qualify for a credit of 25 percent of up to $6,000 in wages, for a maximum credit of $1,500. Employers who retain certified employees for 400 hours or more qualify for a credit equal to 40 percent of up to $6,000 in wages, for a maximum credit of $2,400. The credit is calculated using the actual first year wages paid or incurred. Employers must reduce their tax deductions for wages and salaries by the amount of the credit. In addition, as part of the general business credit, the WOTC is subject to a yearly cap. However, excess WOTC can be used to offset tax liabilities in the preceding year or in any of 20 succeeding years.", "The WOTC was first authorized in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 to improve upon and replace a similar, expired program\u2014the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit program. The WOTC was designed to mitigate some shortcomings that had been identified in the previous credit program\u2014specifically, that it gave employers windfalls for hiring employees that they would have hired anyway and that too many credit- eligible employees left their jobs before they received much work experience. Some target groups were reformulated with the intention of focusing narrowly on those who truly need a credit for firms to risk hiring them. In addition, the minimum employment period for receiving the higher rate of credit was lengthened. The WOTC became effective beginning in October 1996 and has since been reauthorized. It is due to expire in December 2001.", "In fiscal year 1999, 335,707 individuals were certified as members of the targeted groups, making their employers eligible for the credit if the workers remained on the job for at least 120 hours. Individuals in the welfare target group made up 54 percent of the individuals certified. Youth in the food stamp target group made up another 20 percent of the individuals certified. The other six target groups each accounted for 1 to 8 percent of the remaining certifications.", "Federal and state agencies share responsibility for administering the WOTC program. The Department of the Treasury, through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), is responsible for the tax provisions of the credit. The Department of Labor, through the Employment and Training Administration, is responsible for developing policy and program guidance and providing oversight of the WOTC program. In addition, the Department of Labor awards grants to states for administering the eligibility determination and certification provisions of the program. State agencies verify and report to the Department of Labor on state certification activities. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands participate in the program. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Department of Labor regulations require these agencies to take any actions regarding displacement or churning.", "The State of New York and the Department of Labor have undertaken studies that may have findings relevant to whether employers engage in displacement or churning practices. The New York study, which was issued in 1998, concluded, among other things, that employer windfalls from churning employees are minimal. This conclusion was based on analysis of state WOTC and Wage Reporting databases with records on 12,609 individuals in New York covering the fourth quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of 1998. The study did not address displacement. The Department of Labor study is ongoing, so its results are not yet available.

To obtain information relating to the extent of displacement and churning, we surveyed a stratified probability sample of employers who have participated in the WOTC program in California and Texas. The participating employers that we surveyed are those with repeated and recent experience in the program in that they hired at least one WOTC employee in 1999 and hired at least one WOTC employee in another year. Our sample is projectible to the entire population of 1,838 employers in California and Texas who met these hiring criteria.", "For information relating to churning, we also analyzed WOTC and unemployment insurance data for these states. With these data, we determined the total earnings and length of employment of WOTC- certified employees and examined this information for evidence concerning the extent and likelihood of churning.", "For additional information relating to displacement, we analyzed national employment data in the Commerce Department\u2019s Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1995 through 1999. We used the CPS data to estimate employment rates for members of groups targeted by the credit and members of groups not targeted by the credit but who may substitute in employment for target group members. The absence of a centralized database containing the necessary detailed information precluded a nationwide survey of employers and analysis of employment practices.", "We chose California and Texas because they are among the states that   certified the largest number of employees to participate in the WOTC program in fiscal year 1999,   have electronic databases of their WOTC program data, and   provided a somewhat geographically diverse population.", "Together, California and Texas certified about 12 percent of WOTC- eligible individuals in fiscal year 1999, ranking them second and fifth, respectively, in WOTC certifications for that fiscal year. When reporting our estimates derived from the sample and our analysis of program and unemployment insurance data, we combined data from both states because the results in the two states were similar. Furthermore, the confidence intervals for all point estimates in the letter of this report are no more than 10 percentage points on either side of the estimate.", "Our survey and state agency data pertain only to participating employers in California and Texas. However, to assure ourselves that our findings are likely to apply to WOTC employers in the rest of the nation, we examined the federal laws and regulations related to the credit, surveyed state administrators responsible for the credit, and analyzed the data on participating employers. The federal tax benefits offered by the WOTC are the same across all states. Therefore, we have no reason to believe that employers in California and Texas respond differently to these incentives than employers in other states. We spoke to the officials who were responsible for administering the WOTC program in all 50 states, and they all confirmed that their states made no effort to either encourage or discourage displacement or churning. From the participating employer data, we determined that employers who operate in multiple states account for most of the WOTC hires in California and Texas. Moreover, we found no differences relevant to churning and displacement between employers in California and Texas in the results of our survey and agency data analyses, suggesting that our conclusions would be generalizable to employers in other states as well.", "We did not evaluate how effective or efficient the WOTC has been in increasing the employment and earnings of target group members.

However, agreements between the Department of Labor and state WOTC offices require the states to conduct audits of the accuracy of their WOTC records. A review of studies of the accuracy of unemployment insurance data, which was conducted for the National Research Council, concluded that the data appear to be accurate. The study notes that employers are required by law to report the data and that intentional inaccuracies are subject to penalties. This same review of studies found that the CPS data are a valuable source of information on the national low-income population, with broad and fairly accurate measures of income. However, the study noted that sample sizes may be small for some subpopulations (e.g., welfare recipients in particular states), and the percentage of some subpopulations covered by the survey appears to have declined modestly in recent years.

This view is consistent with the employers\u2019 estimate that the credit offsets less than half the costs of recruiting, hiring, and training credit-eligible employees. Our employer survey also indicates that most vacancies filled by credit-eligible employees occur for reasons unrelated to displacement and churning, such as voluntary separations. Furthermore, our survey indicates that most employers change at least one recruitment, hiring, or training practice, which, studies suggest, may make these employers more likely to retain new hires. Our analysis of program and employment data from state agencies supports what we learned from the survey regarding the low probability of churning. These data show that employment rarely ends near the earnings level that yields the maximum credit, and employees earning the maximum are no more likely to separate than are other WOTC-certified employees. The agency data do not allow us to perform similar tests for the occurrence of displacement. However, displacement is less likely to occur when employers are increasing their workforce\u2014as has been the case since the introduction of the credit\u2014 because they have less need to dismiss non-WOTC workers in order to hire WOTC workers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "California and Texas Employers View Displacement and Churning as Not Cost- Effective", "paragraphs": ["Most employers do not consider displacement and churning to be cost- effective employment practices. Based on our survey, we estimate that 93 percent of participating employers in California and Texas would agree that displacement is cost-effective to little or no extent. An estimated 93 percent of employers also hold that view regarding churning. Displacement and churning are not cost-effective if the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training a new employee exceeds the amount of WOTC that an employer expects to earn from that employee. Under those circumstances, the WOTC provides no incentive for that employer to dismiss an existing employee to hire a WOTC-certified one. According to our employer survey, on average, the tax credit offsets less than one-half (47 percent) of this cost.

Most initial contacts indicated that they were the most appropriate respondent or that they would receive the survey and forward it as necessary. Approximately 4 weeks after the initial mailout, we conducted a second mailout to those who had not yet responded.

Unless otherwise noted, the 95-percent confidence intervals for all percent estimates in the letter of the report do not exceed plus or minus 10 percentage points around the estimate.", "In addition to the reported sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce other types of error, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted may introduce variability into our survey results that is difficult to measure. We conducted pretests of the survey to evaluate the wording of the questions. One particular source of nonsampling error unique to this survey involves the location to which that respondent\u2019s answers refer. In some cases, the employer or EIN that we selected corresponded to a very large corporation, and our contact was in a hiring division located outside the state or local office of interest. In the initial phone calls, the location of interest was specified; however, the respondent may have responded with a different location in mind or may have been unable to take into account variation in hiring practices across several local offices. Careful pretesting of the survey did not uncover such issues, but this possibility may lead to additional variation in our survey results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of Our Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Our survey and state agency data pertain only to participating employers in California and Texas. However, to assure ourselves that our findings are likely to apply to WOTC employers in the rest of the nation, we examined federal laws and regulations related to the credit, surveyed state administrators responsible for the credit program, and analyzed data on the participating employers. The federal tax benefits offered by the WOTC are the same across all states.  Therefore, we have no reason to believe that employers in California and Texas respond differently to these incentives than employers in other states. We spoke to the officials who were responsible for administering the WOTC program in all 50 states, and they all confirmed that their states made no effort to either encourage or discourage displacement or churning. Moreover, employers that operate in multiple states account for most of the WOTC hires in California and Texas. We found no significant differences between employers in California and Texas in the results of our survey and agency data analyses, suggesting that our conclusions will be generalizable to employers in other states as well.", "We did not verify the state and federal databases we used. However, agreements between the Department of Labor and state WOTC offices require the states to conduct audits of the accuracy of state WOTC records. A review of studies of the accuracy of unemployment insurance data conducted for the National Research Council concluded that the data appear to be accurate. The review noted that employers are required by law to report the data, and intentional inaccuracies are subject to penalties. This same review of studies found that the CPS data are a valuable source of information on the national low-income population, with broad and fairly accurate measures of income. However, the study noted that sample sizes might be small for some subpopulations (e.g., welfare recipients in particular states) and the percentage of some subpopulations covered by the survey appears to have declined modestly in recent years. The sample size for the targeted and nontargeted groups in our analysis was sufficiently large that the confidence intervals for the estimated employment rates were no more than 6 percentage points on either side of the estimate. We concluded that the slight decline in coverage of welfare recipients is unlikely to affect our analysis of trends in employment rates over the period.", "As noted, we analyzed the tax data from IRS\u2019 Statistics of Income Division. These data undergo numerous quality checks but do not include information from amended tax returns (i.e., revisions made by taxpayers themselves after their initial filings)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Survey Instruments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Statistical Analysis of State Databases", "paragraphs": ["To investigate whether reaching the maximum earnings in a given quarter affects the likelihood that employees will separate from their WOTC employers, we used state WOTC and unemployment insurance data on total earnings and duration of employment. We also used data from these sources on other employee characteristics, such as target group and occupation, and employer characteristics, such as total employment and the industry of the employer. The data were collected for 108,935 WOTC- certified employees and 5,347 employers in California and Texas for the years 1997 through 1999.", "We used the logistic regression model to quantify the effect of reaching the maximum earnings on the probability that the employee separates from the employer. We also used the model to estimate the effect of other employee characteristics, such as current wages (total earnings in a given quarter) and membership in a target group, on the probability of separation. The results of this analysis are presented as odds ratios in table 5. An odds ratio is a measure of relative risk of the occurrence of an event\u2013in this case, the separation from an employer. The reported odds ratios indicate the effect of a particular characteristic (e.g., reaching the maximum earnings) on the probability of separation, controlling for the effects of other characteristics included in the analysis. The estimate of the effect, represented by the odds ratio, is the net effect of the characteristic (i.e., net of the effects of all other characteristics).", "If the characteristic increases the probability of separation, the odds ratio will be greater than 1, and if it decreases the probability of separation, the odds ratio will be less than 1. This interpretation is slightly different when the characteristics are different categories. An example of such a \u201ccategorical\u201d characteristic is membership in a target group where the categories are welfare recipients, veterans, food stamp youth, and so on. In such cases, the analysis omits one of the categories (called the \u201creference group\u201d) and tests whether the included categories have greater or less chance of separation relative to the omitted category. An odds ratio of greater than1 indicates greater probability of separation, while an odds ratio of less than 1 indicates less probability of separation.", "Table 5 shows that reaching the maximum earnings has no statistically significant effect on the odds that employees will separate from their employers. The variable called \u201cmaximum earnings\u201d indicates the quarter in which an employee\u2019s cumulative earnings are between $5,000 and $7,000. This interval includes $6,000 as its midpoint and indicates that reaching the maximum occurs in the quarter when the employee is within $1,000, more or less, of the maximum earnings eligible for the credit. The odds ratio for this variable is not significantly different from 1, meaning that employees whose earnings are within $1,000 of the maximum in a quarter are no more likely to separate than employees whose earning are outside this range. Table 5 shows that reaching the maximum has no effect on the likelihood of separation across most target groups as well. For example, members of the welfare target group are no more likely to separate in the quarter in which they reach the maximum than are members of other target groups who reach the maximum.", "We also used the logistic regression model to analyze the effect of reaching the maximum earnings separately for each state. The separate analysis permitted more characteristics of the employees and employers to be included because data on characteristics were not always available for both states. We analyzed the likelihood of separation in each state using only the characteristics in table 5, and then expanded the analysis to include the additional variable characteristics available in each state. This analysis shows that the conclusion about the effect of reaching the maximum on separation does not change when additional characteristics are added to the model. When variables indicating the occupation of the employee are added to the analysis in California, reaching the maximum earnings continues to have no effect on separation. When variables indicating the employer\u2019s industry and size in terms of total employment are added to the analysis in Texas, reaching maximum earnings is significant, but employees reaching the maximum are still slightly less likely to separate. Specifically, they are 9 percent less likely to separate than are employees who do not reach maximum earnings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Kerry Dunn, Tre Forlano, Wendy Ahmed, Sam Scrutchins, Stuart Kaufman, Barry Seltser, and Cheryl Peterson made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
