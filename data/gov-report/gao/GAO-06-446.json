Since then, the services have embarked on separate acquisition efforts to develop airborne electronic attack assets. In 2003, the Navy started development of the EA-18G aircraft to replace the EA-6B. This report was done under the Comptroller General's authority and assesses if (1) DOD's 2002 conclusion that the EA-6B inventory would be insufficient beyond 2009 remains valid for assessing the Navy's future needs, and (2) the acquisition approach used to develop the EA-18G is knowledge-based and might mitigate future risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EA-6B aircraft will be able to meet the Navy's suppression of enemy air defense needs through at least 2017 and the needs of the Marine Corps through 2025--as long as sufficient numbers of the aircraft are outfitted with upgraded electronics suites. The conclusion that the EA-6B inventory would be insufficient past 2009 was not based on the Navy's requirement for 90 aircraft, but on an inventory requirement of 108 aircraft that would meet the needs of all services. The decision to move to a system of systems using multiple aircraft types means the Navy will no longer be required to support all of DOD's electronic attack requirements. However, insufficient quantities of upgraded jamming systems means that the majority of the EA-6B fleet is equipped with the older jamming system that is limited in its ability to conduct numerous critical functions. If the Navy is required to support all services, given the recent Air Force proposal to terminate its EB-52 standoff jammer program, additional EA-6Bs may require the Improved Capability (ICAP) III upgrade. The risk of cost growth and schedule delays in the EA-18G program is increasing because the program is not following a knowledge-based approach to acquisition. None of its five critical technologies were fully mature as the system development phase began, and that is still the case today. Of particular concern is the ALQ-218 receiver, placed in the harsh wingtip environment on the EA-18G and not the more benign setting of the EA-6B's tail, for which it was developed. While the EA-18G's design appears stable, and almost all its design drawings are complete, that may change once the aircraft is flight-tested. Production of the EA-18G is also risky: One-third of the total buy will be procured as low-rate initial production aircraft based on limited demonstrated functionality."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In conducting military operations, U.S. aircraft are often at great risk from  enemy air defenses, such as surface-to-air missiles (SAM). The services  use specialized aircraft to neutralize, destroy, or temporarily degrade  enemy air defense systems through either electronic warfare or physical  attack. These aircraft use electronic warfare jammers, which disrupt  enemy radar and communications to temporarily suppress enemy air  defenses. Other specialized aircraft use antiradiation missiles that home in  on radars used by surface-to-air missiles or antiaircraft artillery systems to  degrade or destroy them. Because specialized aircraft protect aircraft of  all services in hostile airspace, the suppression mission necessarily  crosses individual service lines.", "Over the past decade, we have issued several reports calling attention to  the possibility that our nation\u2019s ability to counter such defenses is being  degraded. In 1996, for example, we reported that the Department of  Defense (DOD) had decided to eliminate the F-4G and EF-111 suppression  aircraft without first fielding comparable replacements. Because no  replacements were available, the Navy\u2019s EA-6B aircraft became DOD\u2019s  only standoff radar jammer aircraft, providing suppression support for all  services. In January 2001, we called attention to the acknowledged gap  between the services\u2019 suppression capabilities and their needs. The gap  was a consequence of the increasing modernization of enemy air defenses  that had outpaced DOD\u2019s effort to improve its suppression capabilities. At  that time, DOD stated that the analysis of alternatives (AoA) for airborne  electronic attack (AEA) would provide a basis for its future strategy and  lead to a balanced set of acquisition programs for the services. Urgency to  complete such an analysis of alternatives was motivated by a projected  shortfall of the EA-6B inventory, primarily caused by attrition, and the  increasing cost of operating such aging aircraft. The study found that the  EA-6B aircraft inventory was declining faster than had been projected and  concluded that it would be insufficient to meet DOD\u2019s needs beyond 2009.  In November 2002 we recommended that a comprehensive strategy was  needed to remedy the situation. Since then, the military services have  embarked on separate acquisition efforts to develop a future AEA system  of systems (SoS) for DOD. In 2003 the Navy started development of the  EA-18G aircraft to replace the EA-6B as its contribution to the DOD AEA  SoS.", "We examined the analysis of alternatives and planned acquisition efforts to  determine (1) whether the key conclusion that the projected inventory of  EA-6Bs would be insufficient beyond 2009 for all services remains valid for  projecting the Navy\u2019s future needs and (2) whether the acquisition  management approach to developing the Navy\u2019s airborne electronic attack  core component, the EA-18G, is knowledge-based and can help mitigate  future risks.  We conducted this work under the Comptroller General\u2019s  authority and are addressing the report to you because of your  committees\u2019 jurisdiction on these issues.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed the 2002 analysis of alternatives;  pertinent DOD, service, and contractor documents addressing the status of  the EA-6B inventory; plans for maintaining them; status of EA-6B  suppression capabilities; testing conducted for the EA-6B Improved  Capability (ICAP) III program; the AEA system of systems; gaps in the  AEA; and potential solutions for AEA. We interviewed officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Strategic Command (Offutt, Nebraska);  Commander Electronic Attack Pacific Fleet (Whidbey Island); and officials  responsible for requirements and programs for the Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps. We interviewed personnel responsible for ICAP III  electronic warfare testing at the Office of the Director, Operational Test  and Evaluation (Washington, D.C.); Commander of Operational Test and  Evaluation Navy (Norfolk, Virginia); and VX-9 personnel responsible for  ICAP III testing at China Lake, California. We discussed airborne  electronic attack issues and EA-18G development and production with  contractor personnel at Boeing Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri and El  Segundo, California. We discussed software matters with officials at China  Lake and Point Mugu, California. We met with pilots at Patuxent River  Naval Air Station; China Lake, California; Whidbey Island Naval Air  Station, Washington; Fallon Naval Air Station, Nevada; and Boeing  Corporation to discuss pilot workload issues, the nature of the threat,  ICAP III testing, and tactics developed for AEA. As with our past work on  the EA-18G development effort conducted under our annual assessment of  selected major defense acquisition programs, we focused our work to  determining whether the program was following a knowledge-based  acquisition approach. We met with Navy EA-18G program officials  currently involved with the development effort to document the maturity  status of the aircraft\u2019s critical technologies, and the status of its design  effort and plans for producing the aircraft.

The AEA mission is focused on protecting U.S. aircraft and ground forces  by disabling enemy electronic capabilities. The EA-6B performs this  mission with a complement of electronic receivers and jammers, referred  to as its electronic suite, which are located on the aircraft structure and in  external pods attached to its wings. A development effort is currently  under way to replace the EA-6B with a two-seater electronic attack variant  of the F/A-18F, designated the EA-18G Growler.", "The EA-6B joined the Navy\u2019s fleet in January 1971. The EA-6Bs\u2019s initial  deployment was in 1972 over the skies of Southeast Asia. Since the early  1990s, use of the EA-6B has steadily increased. In 1991 the aircraft was  used in Operation Desert Storm and in support of Iraqi \u201cno-fly\u201d zones  instituted after that war. In 1995, the EA-6B was selected to become the  sole tactical radar support jammer for all services after the Air Force  decided to retire its fleet of EF-111 aircraft. This decision resulted in  increased use of the EA-6B. Since 1995 the Prowler force has provided  AEA capability during numerous joint and allied operations against both  traditional and nontraditional threats. It was used to provide support for  Operation Allied Force in Kosovo and for peacekeeping operations over  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia, and is currently being used against  traditional and nontraditional target sets in support of ground forces.  These capabilities continue to be demonstrated in the Global War on  Terrorism, in which EA-6B operations in Afghanistan and Iraq protect  coalition forces and disrupt critical communications links.", "There have been several upgrades to the EA-6B\u2019s electronic suite since it  was initially fielded to address increased threats faced by U.S. forces. The  standard version, fielded in 1971, was quickly replaced in 1973 with the  expanded capability EA-6B, which augmented the electronic  countermeasure coverage of the aircraft. In 1977, the Improved Capability  version entered service, and was followed by a more sophisticated ICAP II  version, first deployed in 1984. The EA-6B/ICAP II featured updated  receivers, displays, and software to cover a wider range of known  surveillance and surface-to-air missile radars. As a result of heavy use and  the limited inventory of the EA-6B, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that  the inventory of EA-6Bs be managed as low-density/high-demand (LD/HD)  assets. Low-density/high demand assets are force elements consisting of  major platforms, weapon systems, or personnel that possess unique  mission capabilities and are in continual high demand to support  worldwide joint military operations. In 1998 an ICAP III upgrade was  initiated to address capability gaps against threats from mobile surface-to- air missile systems. In addition, concerns surfaced about an anticipated  decline in the EA-6B inventory because of structural fatigue issues. As a  result, an AEA analysis-of-alternative was started in 1999 to find a  replacement for the EA-6B. At that time it was anticipated that the EA-6B  would remain in the inventory until at least 2015.", "Plans, as recently as December 2001, were to upgrade all 123 EA-6B  aircraft in the inventory to the ICAP III configuration. The ICAP III  provides rapid emitter detection, identification, geolocation, selective  reactive jamming, and full azimuth coverage. Also, ICAP III-equipped EA- 6Bs will have the ability to integrate multiple EA-6Bs to match any threat  density, and to control other manned or unmanned assets. The upgrade is  needed to address capability gaps in the ICAP II electronic suite presently  installed in EA-6B aircraft. The EA-6B ICAP III production line is currently  scheduled to shut down after the fiscal year 2006 buy.", "The AoA report, published in 2002, concluded that an EA-6B replacement  would be needed in 2009 to meet the services needs. The AoA further  concluded that two components are needed to provide a complete AEA  solution that is able to meet DOD\u2019s collective needs. These two  components are a recoverable \u201ccore\u201d component and an expendable  \u201cstand-in\u201d component.", "The AEA AoA report identified 27 platform combinations that were  capable of delivering jamming support. The study concluded that the final  AEA solution must address both anticipated short-term platform  shortfalls, as well as how best to implement the follow-on capability based  on the menu of alternatives developed by the AoA. In addition, the study  concluded that before a service can begin a formal acquisition program,  the discussion should consider, among other things, whether one service  will provide all DOD core component capability, and whether the AEA  core component will reside on a single platform.", "Subsequent to the AoA report, the Navy and the Air Force each decided to  develop their own unique aircraft from the 27 platform combinations  identified in the AoA to perform the core component of AEA, as shown in  figure 2. The Navy opted to develop the EA-18G Growler, a derivative of  the F/A-18F, as its core component. The Air Force decided to develop an  electronic attack variant of the B-52, designated the EB-52 SOJ (Standoff  Jammer), to function as its core component of the AoA solution and an  unmanned combat air vehicle and an unmanned decoy as the expendable  stand-in components of its AEA AoA solution. The Marine Corps opted to  continue using the EA-6B with the ICAP III electronic suite in anticipation  of an electronic variant of the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) being developed  as a replacement for its EA-6Bs.

The goal of the B-52 SOJ  program was to provide long-range jamming of sophisticated enemy air  defense radars and communications networks, using high-powered  jamming equipment. The Air Force believes that a standoff jamming  capability is still required, and it is investigating the solution options,  platform numbers, and mix to deliver this capability. As part of the  cancellation of the B-52 SOJ, the Air Force is investigating other solution  options and platforms to provide the standoff capability, including  examining how the B-52 SOJ cancellation affects Navy plans to retire the  expeditionary squadrons of EA-6Bs.

Procurement and replacement of 114 wing center sections for the EA-6B,  begun in 1998, have been made on 94 aircraft and are ongoing. A few  aircraft have received more than one wing center replacement because of  heavy use. As a result, program officials identified the fatigue life of the  fuselage as the determining factor in projected inventory levels. The  official estimated life analysis of the EA-6B was conducted between 1984  and 1988. The aircraft used in that analysis had 1,873 actual flight hours  when the test began, and program management believes that factor was  not considered in determining the current fuselage life limit. Program  management has asked that updated fatigue life charts be developed based  on this information. Program management predicts that this will result in  an increase in fuselage life to 14,000 hours, as shown in the solid line in  figure 3. In addition, according to program officials extended inventory life  can be obtained by procuring 32 additional EA-6B wing center sections at  an estimated cost of $170 million. This would result in an inventory of over  90 EA-6Bs through 2019. This projected inventory is represented by the  dashed line in figure 3.

The wingtip environment is also known to be harsh, with noise and  vibration that are known to be particularly severe and can degrade the  reliability of receiver components. Isolators will be used in an attempt to  lower the vibration levels. Since the ALQ-218 antenna elements will be  subject to flexing of the wing that could reduce system performance,  accelerometers will be placed in the wingtip pods to measure relative  movement between the wingtips so that accurate threat locations can be  made. In addition, many subcomponents also include new and modified  parts, so the receiver\u2019s performance and delivery schedule are being  tracked as risks to the program. Furthermore, the unique ALQ-218 wingtip  covers, or radomes, have recently surfaced as potentially problematic.  There are technical risks with the radome\u2019s electrical characteristics and  environmental specifications--especially its ability to withstand hail strike  requirements. The radome is being tracked as a high risk to the program  because it may not meet a performance requirement.

This creates a risk,  acknowledged by the program office, that redesign and retrofitting may be  needed, since it will not be known how effective and suitable the EA-18G  will be or what changes are required until after those tests are completed.", "The EA-18G requirements are to meet, and in some cases exceed, those of  the EA-6B ICAP III, adding an air-to-air intercept capability and the ability  to communicate while jamming. However, according to program  documents the first operational test, scheduled to be completed in  February 2007, 2 months before the low-rate initial production decision,  will demonstrate a much more limited capability, primarily the ability to  radiate a simple, single-source jamming assignment and the ability to  receive, identify, and display limited simple emitters. Test results  demonstrating full ICAP III equivalent capabilities will not be available  until the operational evaluation scheduled to be completed in January  2009, 3 months before the projected full-rate production decision, when  the third and final software release will be available for testing.", "The test plan is driven by software development, and the EA-18G software  will be available for testing in three releases, or builds. Software is on the  critical path to program completion and will provide the functionality that  is available for testing before each production decision. While the program  officials responsible for managing the software appear to be tracking all  major cost, schedule, and quality markers, software development is still  considered a moderate risk. Problems or delays in the initial software  releases could affect the start of the operational evaluation. Even before  that, the current software development schedule will not allow the  program to demonstrate that the EA-18G system can fully function until  after the program office has committed to producing all 30 of the low-rate  initial production aircraft. Under the current schedule, operational testing  of the final software release needed to demonstrate the desired  functionality of EA-18G aircraft will not be completed until January 2009 \u2013  3 months before the projected full-rate production decision."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Should the Air Force decisions to terminate its EB-52 jammer and Joint- Unmanned Combat Air System programs stand, the airborne electronic  attack framework that arose after the 2002 analysis of alternatives will not  materialize as planned. These decisions and the emergence of irregular  threats place an added burden on the Navy\u2019s EA-6B and EA-18G airborne  electronic attack assets and may result in an even larger gap in DOD\u2019s  capability.", "A reduction in plans to upgrade Navy EA-6B with ICAP III electronic suites  creates a transition shortfall in capability until the EA-18G becomes  operational. Potential delays in the EA-18G development and testing effort  would only aggravate this shortfall. The EA-18G development schedule is  based on a premise--EA-6B inventory will not be sufficient beyond 2009-- that is no longer valid for assessing the Navy\u2019s future needs. The inventory  of EA-6B aircraft is now projected to be sufficient to meet Navy and  Marine Corps needs for another decade or longer. In addition, the  compressed and aggressive schedule, a direction given to the program  office, does not allow decision makers to benefit from the demonstration  of knowledge at critical junctures, a proven mitigator of risk.", "The availability of EA-6B aircraft allows DOD to consider an alternative to  its current strategy. After determining how it will fulfill the warfighter\u2019s  needs and address capability shortfalls, DOD could outfit additional EA-6B  aircraft with upgraded ICAP III electronic suites. This option is made  possible by the successful integration of the ICAP III electronic suite with  the EA-6B aircraft and structural improvements. However, this would  necessitate not closing production of these electronic suites in 2006, as  presently planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To mitigate the effects accruing from the shortfall in upgraded EA-6B  aircraft, the risk of delay in the development of the EA-18G, and the  proposed cancellation of the EB-52 jammer and the Joint-Unmanned  Combat Air System, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the  following two actions:    Determine the number of EA-6Bs equipped with ICAP III electronic  suites necessary to deal with the existing and near-term capability  gaps.", "Consider procuring this necessary number of ICAP III upgrades. If  DOD implements the option, we recommend that the department    continue the EA-6B ICAP III production line after the fiscal year  2006 buy, and  restructure its EA-18G low-rate initial production plans so that  procurement of the aircraft occurs after the aircraft has  demonstrated full functionality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report. The  comments appear in appendix II.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense determine the necessary number of EA-6Bs equipped with ICAP  III electronic suites to deal with the existing and near-term capability gap.  DOD agreed that the Navy\u2019s airborne electronic attack inventory needs  review and has directed a study of department wide airborne electronic  attack forces to be issued on September 15, 2006. However, it is unclear  from DOD\u2019s response if the department's review will specifically identify,  as we recommended, the necessary number of ICAP III-equipped EA-6Bs  needed to address the existing and near-term capability gap. In light of the  end of planned ICAP III production this year, DOD needs to identify this  specific number, as it is a necessary prerequisite to our second  recommendation.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense consider procuring the determined number of ICAP III  upgrades and that if DOD takes this option, the department (1) continue  ICAP III production and (2) restructure the EA-18G low-rate initial  production plans so that the procurement of the aircraft occurs after the  aircraft has demonstrated full functionality. Regarding the first part of our  recommendation, DOD agreed that it should consider procuring the  required ICAP III upgrades, as determined by the ongoing airborne  electronic attack review, but stated that it is premature to make a decision  until the ICAP III inventory levels are determined. We agree that such  determination is a prerequisite and have so stated in our first  recommendation. However, that determination needs to be completed  before the ICAP III production line ends in fiscal year 2006. With regard to  the second part of our recommendation, DOD stated that the current EA- 18G low-rate initial production plan provides the best balance of risk and  cost to expeditiously meet warfighters\u2019 needs. We remain concerned that  producing EA-18G aircraft before testing demonstrates that the design is  mature unnecessarily increases the likelihood of design changes that will  lead to cost growth, schedule delays, and performance problems. In the  past, Congress has raised concerns about the costly outcomes of highly  concurrent development and production efforts that are not \"flying before  buying.\"  Starting production before flight tests demonstrate the full ICAP  III equivalent capability works as intended places the $2,297.1 million low- rate initial production investment at significant risk. The procurement of  additional ICAP-III-equipped EA-6Bs would allow the time to properly test  the EA-18G before making a production decision and reduce the risk of  costly retrofitting of the initially produced EA-18Gs.  Therefore, we  continue to believe that our recommendation should be implemented.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Air Force, and  Navy; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Director, Office of  Management and Budget.
