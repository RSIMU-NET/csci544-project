Furthermore, the legislation and its implementation provided for checks and balances to ensure the integrity of the process. GAO has played a long-standing role as an independent and objective observer of the BRAC process. GAO has operated in a real-time setting and has had access to significant portions of the process as it has evolved, thus affording DOD an early opportunity to address any concerns GAO might identify. GAO's role in the 2005 round remains the same, and GAO has been observing the process since DOD began work on the 2005 round. Timely access to DOD data is key to fulfilling GAO's role. GAO's initial observations on key issues DOD is required to address in its 2004 report are as follows. The selection criteria for the 2005 round are basically sound and provide a good framework for assessing alternatives. Nevertheless, GAO provided DOD with comments on the draft criteria that focused on the need for clarification of how DOD intends to consider total costs to DOD and other federal agencies and environmental costs in its analyses. The department has indicated that it would be issuing clarifying guidance. DOD plans to estimate its excess capacity using a methodology that it used in 1998 for similar purposes. While this methodology provides a rough indication of excess capacity for selected functional areas, it has a number of limitations that create imprecision when trying to project a total amount of excess capacity across DOD. A more complete assessment of capacity and the potential to reduce it must await the results of the current BRAC analyses being conducted by DOD during the 2005 round. DOD financial data suggest that, assuming conditions similar to those in the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, each military department could achieve annual net savings by 2011. While we believe that the potential exists for significant savings to result from the 2005 round, there are simply too many unknowns at this time to say conclusively to what extent annual net savings will be realized by 2011. For example, in 2005 DOD is placing increased emphasis on jointness and transformation and is likely to use BRAC to incorporate any force redeployments from overseas locations that may result from ongoing overseas basing reassessments. This suggests a need for caution in projecting the timing and amount of savings from a new BRAC round."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to have the opportunity today to provide you with an  overview of our work involving the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) base  realignment and closure (BRAC) process.

Legislative restrictions effectively precluded bases from being closed  between 1977 and 1988. However, legislation enacted in 1988 supported  the tasking of a special commission chartered by the Secretary of Defense  to identify bases for realignment and closure and provided relief from  certain statutory provisions that had hindered DOD\u2019s previous efforts.  With this legislation, a base realignment and closure round was initiated in  1988.", "Congress later passed the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of  1990, which created an independent commission and authorized three  BRAC rounds in 1991, 1993, and 1995. The four commissions generated  499 recommendations\u201497 major closures, and hundreds of smaller base  realignments, closures, and other actions. However, DOD recognized at  the time it was completing its recommendations for the 1995 BRAC round  that excess infrastructure would remain after that round and that  additional closures and realignments would be needed in the future.  Subsequent Defense Science Board and Quadrennial Defense Review  studies, and others, echoed the need for one or more future additional  BRAC rounds, but congressional action to authorize a future BRAC round  did not occur for several years, in part because of concerns over how  some decisions were made in the 1995 BRAC round.

Also, we noted that it was not  clear to what extent the impact of costs related to potential environmental  restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance activities  would be included in cost and savings analyses of individual BRAC  recommendations.

In this regard, DOD opted to use a methodology that would  give some indication of excess capacity but would not be directly linked to  the capacity analysis being performed as part of the 2005 BRAC process.  DOD officials indicated that they would build on the approach they used in  their 1998 report to estimate excess base capacity and address other  BRAC issues. In November 1998, we reported that DOD\u2019s analysis gave  only a rough indication of excess base capacity because it had a number of  limitations. In addition, the methodology did not consider any additional  excess capacity that might occur by looking at facilities or functions on a  cross-service basis, a priority for the 2005 round.", "To estimate excess capacity in 1998, the military services and the Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA) compared capacity for a sample of bases in 1989  with projected capacity for a sample of bases in 2003, after all scheduled  BRAC actions were completed. The services and DLA categorized the  bases according to their primary missions, and they defined indicators of  capacity, or metrics, for each category. Varied metrics were used to depict  capacity. For example, metrics included maneuver acres per brigade for  Army training bases, square feet of parking apron space for active and  reserve Air Force bases, or capacity direct labor hours as compared with  budgeted or programmed direct labor hours for Navy aviation depots.  DOD officials are building on this methodology to compare 1989 data with  more recent data in order to estimate current excess capacity as a means  of meeting their 2004 reporting requirement.", "That methodology, while providing an indication of excess capacity, has a  number of limitations that make it difficult to be precise when trying to  project a total amount of excess capacity across DOD. In addition to the  factors already noted, GAO and the Congressional Budget Office  previously reported that by using 1989 as a baseline DOD did not take into  account the excess capacity that existed in that year, which was prior to  the base closures of the prior four rounds. As a result, the percentage of  excess increased capacity reported may be understated or overstated for  functional areas considered. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget  Office reported that the approach could understate the capacity required if  some types of base support were truly a fixed cost, regardless of the size  of the force. Another limitation of DOD\u2019s methodology is that each  installation could be counted only in one category even though it might  have multiple functions. For example, an Air Force base that has a depot  and a fighter wing could only be categorized in one functional area.", "While the prior BRAC rounds have focused solely on reducing excess  capacity, DOD officials have stated this is not the sole focus of the 2005  BRAC round. DOD officials have noted that the 2005 round aims to further  transform the military by rationalizing base infrastructure to the force  structure, enhancing joint capabilities and seeking crosscutting solutions  and alternatives for common business-oriented support functions, as well  as eliminating excess capacity. A complete assessment of capacity and  opportunities to reduce it must await the completion of DOD\u2019s ongoing  official analyses under BRAC 2005. Nevertheless, we believe sufficient  indicators of excess capacity exist, as well as opportunities to otherwise  achieve greater efficiencies in operations, to justify proceeding with the  upcoming round."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certification of BRAC 2005 Round Annual Net Savings by 2011", "paragraphs": ["DOD financial data indicate that the department has generated net savings  of about $17 billion through fiscal year 2001\u2014the final year of the prior  BRAC rounds\u2014-and is accruing additional, annually recurring savings of  about $7 billion thereafter. We have consistently affirmed our belief that  the prior BRAC rounds have generated substantial net savings\u2014primarily  in the form of future cost avoidances\u2014for the department. While these  amounts are substantial, we have, at the same time, viewed these savings  estimates as imprecise for a variety of reasons, such as weaknesses in  DOD\u2019s financial management systems that limit its ability to fully account  for the costs of its operations; the fact that DOD\u2019s accounting systems, like  other accounting systems, are oriented to tracking expenses and  disbursements, not savings; the exclusion of BRAC-related costs incurred  by other agencies; and inadequate periodic updating of the savings  estimates that are developed. DOD, in its 1998 report to Congress,  indicated that it had plans to improve its savings estimates for the  implementation of future BRAC rounds. We have also recommended that  DOD improve its savings estimates for future BRAC rounds, such as the  2005 round. DOD has not yet acted on our recommendation, but DOD  officials told us that they intend to implement a system to better track  savings for the upcoming round.", "As required by the fiscal year 2002 legislation, DOD is required to certify  for the upcoming 2005 BRAC round that it will achieve \u201cannual net  savings\u201d for each military department by 2011. Using precise terminology  is critical in statements regarding BRAC savings, because it can make a big  difference in specifying when savings will actually occur and the nature of  those savings. According to DOD officials, \u201cannual net savings\u201d essentially  refer to the estimated savings that are generated from BRAC in a given  year that are greater than the costs incurred to implement BRAC decisions  in that same year.", "Another way of looking at net savings is to consider the point at which  cumulative savings exceed the cumulative costs of implementing BRAC  decisions over a period of years. Experience has shown that the  department incurs significant upfront investment costs in the early years  of a BRAC round, and it takes several years to fully offset those cumulative  costs and begin to realize cumulative net savings. The difference in the  terminology is important to understand because it has a direct bearing on  the magnitude and assessment of the savings at any given time. For  example, as shown in table 2, initial annual net savings reported by the  department as a whole in the 1995 BRAC round did not begin to occur  until fiscal year 2000, or the fifth year of implementation; in each of the  prior years, the costs had exceeded the estimated savings.", "On the other hand, as shown in table 2, there were no cumulative net  savings as of fiscal year 2001, the sixth and final year of BRAC  implementation. Cumulative net savings did not occur in this case until  fiscal year 2002, based on DOD\u2019s data.", "DOD financial data suggest that, assuming conditions similar to those of  the 1993 and 1995 rounds, annual net savings for each of the military  departments for the 2005 round could be achieved by 2011\u2014that is, by  2011 savings could exceed closure-related costs for that year. While we  believe that the potential exists for significant savings to result from the  2005 BRAC round, we are not in a position to say conclusively at this point  to what extent DOD will realize annual net savings by 2011. In addition to  the imprecision of DOD\u2019s data, there simply are too many unknowns at  this time, such as the specific timing of individual closure or realignment  actions that affect savings estimates and the implementation costs that  may be required. The savings to be achieved depend on the circumstances  of the various recommended closures and realignments as put forth by the  2005 BRAC Commission and on the implementation of those  recommendations. Further, DOD has gone on record stating that the  upcoming round is more than just an exercise of trimming its excess  infrastructure. DOD is also seeking to maximize joint utilization and  further its transformation efforts. To what extent these goals may affect  savings is also unknown at this point. And finally, to what extent forces  that are currently based overseas may be redeployed to the United States  and what effect that redeployment may have on BRAC and subsequent  savings remain unknown as well.", "Notwithstanding the issues we raise that could affect savings, and the  point at which savings would exceed the costs associated with  implementing recommendations from a 2005 BRAC round, we continue to  believe that it is vitally important for DOD to improve its mechanisms for  tracking and updating its savings estimates. DOD, in its 1998 report to  Congress on BRAC issues, cited proposed efforts that, if adopted, could  provide for greater accuracy in the estimates. Specifically, the department  proposed to develop a questionnaire that each base affected by future  BRAC rounds would complete annually during the 6-year implementation  period. Those bases that are closing, realigning, or receiving forces  because of BRAC would complete the questionnaire. DOD would request  information on costs, personnel reductions, and changes in operating and  military construction costs in order to provide greater insight into the  savings created by each BRAC action. DOD suggested that development of  such a questionnaire would be a cooperative effort involving the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, the military departments, the defense agencies,  the Office of the DOD Inspector General, and the service audit agencies.  This proposal recognizes that better documentation and updating of  savings will require special efforts parallel to the normal budget process.  We strongly endorse such action. If the department does not take steps to  improve its estimation of savings in the future, then previously existing  questions about the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of DOD\u2019s  savings estimates will likely continue.

What we are seeing is that, in keeping with the economic  downturn in recent years, the average unemployment rate in 2003  increased for 60 of the 62 communities since 2001. However, the year 2003  unemployment rate data indicated that the rates for many of these BRAC  communities continue to compare favorably with the U.S. rate of 6.1  percent. That is, 43 (69 percent) of the communities had unemployment  rates at or below the U.S. rate.", "As with unemployment rates, we had also previously reported that annual  real per capita income growth rates for BRAC-affected communities  compared favorably with national averages. From 1996 through 1999, 53  percent, or 33, of the 62 areas had an estimated average real per capita  income growth rate that was at or above the average of 3.03 percent for  the nation at that time. Data included in our 2002 report were the latest  available at that time, recognizing time lags in data availability. Our recent  analysis has also noted that changes in the average per capita income  growth rate of affected communities over time compared favorably and  were similar to corresponding changes at the national level. Our more  recent analysis indicates that 30 of the 62 areas examined (48.4 percent),  had average income growth rates higher than the average U.S. rate of 2.2  percent between 1999 and 2001, which represents a drop from the rate  during the previous time period.", "We have previously reported on our discussions with various community  leaders who felt the effects of base closures. These discussions identified a  number of factors affecting economic recovery from base closures,  including:  robustness of the national economy,    diversity of the local economy,   regional economic trends,    natural and labor resources,   leadership and teamwork,    public confidence,    government assistance, and   reuse of base property.", "If history is any indicator, these factors are likely to be equally applicable  in dealing with the effects of closures and realignments under BRAC 2005.", "This concludes my statement.
