Absent reliable national data, GAO also selected 6 of 170 VAMCs (selected for variation in geographic location and the TPAs that served them) and manually reviewed a random, non-generalizable sample of 196 Choice Program authorizations. The authorizations were created for veterans who were referred to the program between January and April of 2016, the most recent period for which data were available when GAO began its review. The sample of authorizations included 55 for routine care, 53 for urgent care, and 88 that the TPAs returned without scheduling appointments. GAO also obtained the results of VHA's non-generalizable analysis of wait times for a nationwide sample of about 5,000 Choice Program authorizations that were created for selected services between July and September of 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Through the Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program), eligible veterans may receive care from community providers when it is not readily accessible at Veterans' Health Administration (VHA) medical facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses two contractors\u2014or third party administrators (TPA)\u2014to schedule most veterans' Choice Program appointments after receiving referrals from VA medical centers (VAMC). GAO found that veterans who are referred to the Choice Program for routine care because services are not available at VA in a timely manner could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days for care if VAMCs and the TPAs take the maximum amount of time VA allows to complete its appointment scheduling process. This is not consistent with the statutory requirement that veterans receive Choice Program care within 30 days of their clinically indicated date (when available), which is the soonest date that it would be appropriate for the veteran to receive care, according to a VHA clinician. Without designing appointment scheduling processes that are consistent with this requirement, VA lacks assurance that veterans will receive Choice Program care in a timely manner.", "GAO and VHA found that selected veterans experienced lengthy actual wait times for appointments in 2016, after manually reviewing separate samples of Choice Program authorizations. For example, when GAO analyzed 55 routine care authorizations that were created between January and April of 2016, it found that the process took at least 64 calendar days, on average. When VHA analyzed about 5,000 authorizations created between July and September of 2016, it took an average of 51 calendar days for veterans to receive care.", "a GAO excluded from its analysis the amount of time the TPA took to schedule the appointment and the overall wait time because its sample selection methodology differed from VHA's in a way that would have skewed these two averages but not the averages for the other segments of the process.", "GAO also found that VHA cannot systematically monitor the timeliness of veterans\u2019 access to Choice Program care because it lacks complete, reliable data to do so. The data limitations GAO identified include:", "A lack of data on the timeliness of referring and opting veterans in to the program. GAO found that the data VHA uses to monitor the timeliness of Choice Program appointments do not capture the time it takes VAMCs to prepare veterans\u2019 referrals and send them to the TPAs, nor do they capture the time spent by the TPAs in accepting VAMCs\u2019 referrals and opting veterans in to the Choice Program. VHA has implemented an interim solution to monitor overall wait times that relies on VAMC staff consistently and accurately entering unique identification numbers on VHA clinicians\u2019 requests for care and on Choice Program referrals, a process that is prone to error.", "Inaccuracy of clinically indicated dates. GAO found that clinically indicated dates (which are used to measure the timeliness of care) are sometimes changed by VAMC staff before they send Choice Program referrals to the TPAs, which could mask veterans\u2019 true wait times. GAO found that VAMC staff entered later clinically indicated dates on referrals for about 23 percent of the 196 authorizations it reviewed. It is unclear if VAMC staff mistakenly entered incorrect dates manually, or if they inappropriately entered later dates when the VAMC was delayed in contacting the veteran, compiling relevant clinical information, and sending the referral to the TPA.", "Unreliable data on the timeliness of urgent care. GAO found that VAMCs and TPAs do not always categorize Choice Program referrals and authorizations in accordance with the contractual definition for urgent care. According to the contracts, a referral is to be marked as \u201curgent,\u201d and an appointment is to take place within 2 days of the TPA accepting it, when a VHA clinician has determined that the needed care is (1) essential to evaluate and stabilize the veteran\u2019s condition, and (2) if delayed would likely result in unacceptable morbidity or pain. GAO reviewed a sample of 53 urgent care authorizations and determined that about 28 percent of the authorizations were originally marked as routine care authorizations but were changed to urgent by VAMC or TPA staff, in an effort to administratively expedite appointment scheduling.", "Without complete, reliable data, VHA cannot determine whether the Choice Program has helped to achieve the goal of alleviating veterans\u2019 wait times for care.", "GAO found that numerous factors adversely affected veterans\u2019 access to care through the Choice Program. These factors include: (1) administrative burden caused by complexities of referral and appointment scheduling processes, (2) poor communication between VHA and its VAMCs, and (3) inadequacies in the networks of community providers established by the TPAs, including an insufficient number, mix, or geographic distribution of community providers. VA and VHA have taken numerous actions throughout the Choice Program\u2019s operation that were intended to help address these factors, though not all access factors have been fully resolved. For example, to help address administrative burden and improve the process of coordinating veterans\u2019 Choice Program care, VA established a secure e-mail system and a mechanism for TPAs and community providers to remotely access veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records. However, these mechanisms only facilitate a one-way transfer of necessary information. They do not provide a means by which VAMCs or veterans can view the TPAs\u2019 step-by-step progress in scheduling appointments or electronically receive medical documentation associated with Choice Program appointments.", "While the Choice Program will soon end, VA anticipates that veterans will continue to receive community care under a similar program that VA plans to implement, which will consolidate the Choice Program and other VA community care programs. Incorporating lessons learned from the Choice Program into the implementation and administration of the new program could help VHA avoid similar challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["For VA's future consolidated community care program, GAO is making 10 recommendations, which include:", "establishing an achieveable wait-time goal for the community care program that will permit VHA to monitor whether veterans are receiving care within time frames that are comparable to the amout of time they would otherwise wait for care at VHA medical facilities;", "designing an appointment scheduling process that (1) is consistent with the wait-time goal and (2) sets forth time frames within which veterans' referrals must be processed, appointments must be scheduled, and appointments must occur;", "allow VHA to systematically monitor the amount of time taken to prepare referrals, schedule appointments, and complete appointments;", "prevent veterans' clinically indicated dates from being modified by individuals other than VHA clinicians; and", "separate clinically urgent referrals and authorizations from those for which the VAMC or the TPA has decided to expedite appointment scheduling for administrative reasons; and", "establishing a system that will help facilitate seamless, efficient care coordination and exchanges of information among VAMCs, VHA clinicians, TPAs, community providers, and veterans.", "VA generally agreed with all but one of GAO's recommendations, which was to separate clinically urgent referrals from those that are administratively expedited.

In  recent years, we and others have expressed concerns about the ability of  VHA\u2019s medical facilities to provide health care services in a timely  manner. Serious and long-standing problems with veterans\u2019 access to  care were also highlighted in a series of congressional hearings in the  spring and summer of 2014, after several well-publicized events raised  additional concerns about wait times for appointments at VHA medical  facilities. In some cases, delays in care or VHA\u2019s failure to provide care  reportedly have resulted in harm to veterans. Due to these and other  concerns, we concluded that VA health care is a high-risk area and added  it to our High Risk List in 2015.", "In response to the problems with veterans\u2019 access to care at VHA medical  facilities that were highlighted during the 2014 congressional hearings,  Congress enacted the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act  of 2014 (Choice Act) on August 7, 2014. Among other things, the law  established a temporary program\u2014called the Veterans Choice Program  (Choice Program)\u2014and provided up to $10 billion in funding for veterans  to obtain health care services from non-VA community providers when  they faced long wait times, lengthy travel distances, or other challenges  accessing care at VHA medical facilities. The temporary authority and  funding for the Choice Program was separate from that of other  previously existing programs through which VA has the option to  purchase care from community providers. Legislation enacted in August  and December of 2017 provided an additional $4.2 billion for the Veterans  Choice Fund. VA may continue to authorize Choice Program care until  all amounts in the Choice Fund are exhausted. Currently, VA is in the  process of planning its future community care program, which (as  described in an October 2015 plan VA submitted to Congress) will  consolidate the Choice Program and six other VA community care  programs into one program.", "In accordance with the Choice Act, VA and VHA had up to 90 days to  prepare for Choice Program implementation from the time the Choice Act  was enacted. To cope with the compressed implementation time frame,  VA modified contracts it had previously established with Health Net  Federal Services (Health Net) and TriWest Healthcare Alliance (TriWest)  to administer a different VA community care program and gave them certain responsibilities related to Choice Program administration,  including the scheduling of routine and urgent care appointments for  veterans needing care in the community. VA and VHA refer to Health  Net and TriWest as third-party administrators (TPA). The Choice Program  implementation tasks included designing a framework to administer the  program (which involved dividing responsibilities between VAMCs and  TPAs), negotiating contract modifications to add Choice Program  administration responsibilities to the TPAs\u2019 existing contracts with VA,  designing referral and appointment scheduling processes for VAMCs and  the TPAs, strengthening the community provider networks the TPAs had  established under their existing VA contracts, creating TPA call centers,  training VAMC and TPA staff, producing and distributing Veterans Choice  Cards to veterans, and educating veterans and community providers  about the new program.", "External reviews, media reports, and congressional hearings held over  the course of the Choice Program\u2019s implementation and operation have  highlighted programmatic weaknesses, such as insufficient provider  networks, significant delays in scheduling appointments, and a lack of  timely payments to network providers.

In addition, we exchanged written  correspondence with VA\u2019s Office of General Counsel about the  application of VHA\u2019s wait time goals to the Choice Program. We also  interviewed a VA contracting official and officials from VHA\u2019s Office of  Community Care (the office responsible for implementing and overseeing  the Choice Program), as well as officials from the two Choice Program  TPAs, Health Net and TriWest.

Before May 2015, VA provided VAMCs the flexibility to  decide on a case-by-case basis whether to refer veterans to the Choice  Program or one of VA\u2019s other community care programs when services  were not available. In June 2017, VHA issued another policy  memorandum that rescinded the referral hierarchy that required VAMCs  to refer to the Choice Program first. It directed VAMCs to refer veterans to  the Choice Program only if they met the Choice Act\u2019s wait-time, distance,  and geographic eligibility criteria, and to instead use other VHA medical  facilities, facilities with which VA has sharing agreements, and other VA  community care programs to deliver care to veterans when services were  not available at a VHA medical facility and veterans did not qualify under  the Choice Act\u2019s eligibility criteria. In August 2017, after Congress  provided an additional $2.1 billion for the Choice Program, VHA again  changed its guidance on referral patterns for the Choice Program and  VA\u2019s other community care programs.

It was not until May 2016 (about 18 months into the  Choice Program\u2019s implementation) that VA modified its contracts to clarify  that the TPAs are to create Choice Program authorizations only after they  have contacted the veterans and confirmed that they want to opt in to the  program.", "Due to these differing interpretations, VA lacked comparable performance  data for the two TPAs for the first 18 months of the Choice Program\u2019s  expected three-year implementation. Therefore, it could not compare the  timeliness of access nationwide. In addition, since VA modified the TPAs\u2019  contracts midway through the Choice Program\u2019s implementation, officials  can only comparatively examine whether the timeliness of both TPAs\u2019  appointment scheduling and completion has improved since June 2016,  which is when the relevant contract modification took effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TPAs Sometimes Select Incorrect Return Reasons or Inappropriately Return Choice Program Authorizations without Making Appointments", "paragraphs": ["VHA collects data and monitors various reasons the TPAs return Choice  Program authorizations to VAMCs without making appointments.

For example,  in one case, the TPA was unable to schedule an appointment with a  primary care provider\u2014even after contacting 11 different network  providers\u2014but the TPA staff returned the authorization to the VAMC  indicating that the veteran had declined care. TPA officials who  reviewed this authorization with us agreed that it was inappropriate to  mark this authorization as having been returned because the veteran  declined care and that their staff instead should have indicated that  they had been unable to schedule an appointment with a network  provider.", "In the remaining 9 of the 20 cases, we could find no VHA or TPA  documentation to substantiate the reasons the TPAs selected when  they returned the authorizations to VA, nor any other reasons for  return. For example, the TPAs incorrectly selected \u201cmissing VA data\u201d  as the reason they returned 5 of these 9 authorizations.

However, TPA staff must  manually select return reasons when they send authorizations back to  VAMCs, a process that is subject to error or manipulation. There is a  process by which VA\u2019s contracting officer\u2019s representatives validate the  monthly data submitted by the TPAs, but it cannot identify the data  reliability issues we found when manually reviewing VHA and TPA  documentation associated with a sample of returned Choice Program  authorizations.

Among the main issues cited were the following:", "Manual referral processes and lack of TPA access to veterans\u2019  records. To prepare veterans\u2019 Choice Program referrals, VAMC staff  had to follow a manual, time-consuming process to retrieve and  collate key contact and clinical information from veterans\u2019 VA  electronic health records. This was because\u2014throughout most of the  Choice Program\u2019s implementation\u2014VA had no system for  automatically generating referral packages that contained all of this  information; nor did TPA staff have access to veterans\u2019 VA electronic  health records. If VAMC staff made mistakes (such as mistyping or  inadvertently omitting veterans\u2019 telephone numbers or addresses) or if  the referrals were missing clinical information that the TPAs needed  for appointment scheduling purposes, the TPAs had to either contact  the VAMC to correct or obtain the missing information or return the  referrals to VA without attempting to schedule appointments. These  manual processes impeded the VAMCs\u2019 progress in preparing  referrals and the TPAs\u2019 progress in scheduling veterans\u2019 Choice  Program appointments.", "Limited availability of care coordination tools and dependence  on telephone-based customer service for appointment  scheduling. A lack of care coordination tools and near-constant  telephone calls also delayed VAMC and TPA staff from efficiently  processing veterans\u2019 referrals for appointments. For example, the  Choice Program had no web-based portal through which VAMC staff  and veterans could view the TPAs\u2019 step-by-step progress in  scheduling appointments. While both of the TPAs had portals that  allowed VAMC staff (but not veterans) to obtain certain information\u2014 such as whether the TPA had already scheduled an appointment\u2014the  portals did not show if, or when, veterans\u2019 referrals had been  accepted, the dates and times of the TPAs\u2019 attempts to contact  veterans, or the number of community providers the TPA had  contacted in its attempts to schedule an appointment. VAMC staff we  interviewed said that while they could submit written messages to the  TPAs through the portals, TPA staff did not always answer these  messages in a timely manner. This, in turn, made telephone calls  between veterans, the VAMCs, and the TPAs the most effective form  of follow-up regarding veterans\u2019 Choice Program referrals, according  to VAMC managers and staff. Officials from one selected VAMC  estimated that their community care staff (which included about 30  employees) was answering approximately 10,000 calls per month,  and another VAMC had hired a full-time staff person just to answer  telephone calls.", "Workload associated with re-authorizing veterans\u2019 care. VAMC  and TPA staff also told us they faced a lengthy administrative process  to re-authorize care if veterans\u2019 Choice Program authorizations  expired before veterans received care or if veterans needed services  that were outside the scope of their original authorizations. The TPAs  referred to these as \u201csecondary authorization requests\u201d or \u201crequests  for additional services.\u201d Without these re-authorizations, veterans\u2019  care from community providers could be delayed or interrupted.  VAMC and TPA staff had to process a high volume of these requests  for two main reasons. First, the Choice Program originally had a 60- day limit on episodes of care, which meant that all appointments  within the episode of care had to be completed within 60 days of the  initial date of service. Even if the veteran needed care that could  routinely be expected to outlast this 60-day time frame (such as  maternity care or cancer treatment), community providers and the  TPAs would still have to request additional referrals from the VAMCs  to authorize the remaining care. Second, TPAs would have to request  additional referrals if an episode of Choice Program care was already  in progress and the veteran needed services that were not specifically  authorized in the VAMC\u2019s original referral. According to some VAMC  managers and staff, this generated significant workload for the  VAMCs. Officials from one of the selected VAMCs said it had to hire a  full-time nurse just to process secondary authorization requests.", "Manual post-appointment follow-up processes. According to  VAMC managers and staff we interviewed, the manual processes  used for post-appointment follow-up also added to delays for veterans  seeking care through the Choice Program. After an episode of care is  complete\u2014whether services are delivered at a VHA medical facility or  in the community\u2014VHA\u2019s policy requires VAMC staff to document  that care was provided and make the results of encounters available  to VHA clinicians by entering medical records or other clinical  information into the veteran\u2019s VA electronic health record. When  medical records from the community provider became available,  VAMC staff had to retrieve copies from the TPAs\u2019 portals and scan  them into veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records. (See appendix V for  an illustration of this process.) VAMC staff described this as a very  time-consuming process because it could take months for claims or  medical records from Choice Program appointments to appear in the  TPAs\u2019 portals. At the time of our interviews in the summer of 2016,  managers from two of the VAMCs in our sample said they each had  backlogs of more than 6,000 Choice Program and other community  care consults to complete. These backlogs adversely affected  veterans\u2019 access to Choice Program care because the time VAMC  staff spent attempting to complete some veterans\u2019 consults could not  be spent on preparing other veterans\u2019 Choice Program referrals.", "Over the course of the Choice Program\u2019s implementation, VA and VHA  took multiple actions to address administrative burden, including the  following. Opportunities exist to improve or build on these actions as VA  moves forward with the consolidated community care program it plans to  implement.", "Implementation of a web-based tool to automate Choice Program  referral preparation. In early 2016, to improve the process of  gathering information from veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records to  prepare Choice Program referrals, staff from two VAMCs developed a  web-based tool\u2014called the \u201creferral documentation\u201d (REFDOC) tool.  According to VHA documentation, the REFDOC tool automates the  process of gathering necessary information and assembling it in a  standardized format for veterans\u2019 Choice Program referrals. VHA\u2019s  initial analyses of the REFDOC tool\u2019s effectiveness found that it sped  up the process of preparing Choice Program referrals by about 20  minutes per referral, which helped reduce the administrative burden  associated with preparing referrals. However, VHA\u2019s nationwide  dissemination of the tool to all of the VAMCs was slowed by  limitations of VA\u2019s information technology systems. As of November  2016 (about 9 months after the tool was created), it had only been  implemented at 18 of VHA\u2019s 170 VAMCs. VHA gradually made the  tool available at the remaining VAMCs between November 2016 and  May 2017.", "Standardized episodes of care. In April 2017, VHA approved  standardized episodes of care\u2014or \u201cbundles\u201d of clinically necessary  medical services and procedures\u2014that are to be authorized whenever  veterans are referred to community providers for specified types of  care. This was intended to help address administrative burden  associated with clinical review processes and improve veterans\u2019  access to care. To start, VHA approved standardized episodes of care  for 15 different types of care, including physical therapy, maternity  care, and optometry. VA and VHA documentation indicate that they  intend to roll out additional standardized episodes of care over time  and continue using them once VA transitions to the consolidated  community care program it is planning to implement.", "Acquisition of a secure e-mail system and a mechanism for TPAs  and community providers to remotely access veterans\u2019 VA  electronic health records.

In the spring of 2017, VA acquired software  that allows VAMC managers and staff to e-mail encrypted files  containing veterans\u2019 medical records to the TPAs and community  providers. Only the intended recipient can decrypt and respond to  messages containing the files. According to VHA documentation,  this secure e-mail system was intended to improve the efficiency  of coordinating veterans\u2019 Choice Program care and address  potential security risks associated with printing paper copies of  veterans\u2019 medical records and sending them to the TPAs or  community providers via fax or U.S. mail.", "Remote access to veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records. In May  2017, VHA began offering a secure, web-based application called  the Community Viewer as a tool for community providers  nationwide to have access to assigned veterans\u2019 VA electronic  health records. Like the secure e-mail system, this tool is intended  to improve the efficiency of coordinating veterans\u2019 Choice  Program care.", "However, VHA\u2019s ability to seamlessly coordinate care with community  providers remains limited\u2014even with the secure e-mail system and the  Community Viewer\u2014because these tools only facilitate a one-way  transfer of the information needed to coordinate the care veterans receive  at VHA medical facilities and in the community. For the purposes of care  coordination, it is important that information sharing among all participants  concerned with a veteran\u2019s Choice Program or other VA community  care\u2014including VHA clinicians, the TPAs, community providers, and the  veteran\u2014is as seamless as possible. According to the federal internal  control standard for information and communication, agencies should  internally and externally communicate the necessary information to  achieve their objectives. While the secure e-mail system and  Community Viewer tool provide an interim solution for VAMCs to transfer  information from veterans\u2019 VA electronic health records to the TPAs and  community providers, they do not provide a means by which VAMCs or  veterans can (1) view step-by-step progress in scheduling appointments,  or (2) electronically receive the clinical results of Choice Program or other  VA community care encounters. Building such a capability into the future  consolidated community care program that VA plans to implement would  allow VHA to improve the care coordination processes that exist in the  Choice Program.", "Pilot programs for VAMC staff to schedule Choice Program  appointments. In July 2016 and October 2016, VHA began  implementing pilot projects, whereby staff at two VAMCs took over  from the TPAs the responsibility of scheduling veterans\u2019 Choice  Program appointments. Specifically, VA modified its contracts with  TriWest and Health Net to implement the two VAMC scheduling pilots  at the Alaska VA Health Care System and the Fargo VA Health Care  System, respectively. In these two locations, VAMC staff schedule  veterans\u2019 appointments and send relevant clinical documentation to  the Choice Program providers. According to VHA officials, this had  the potential to improve veterans\u2019 access to care by improving the  efficiency of the Choice Program appointment scheduling process.", "The results of these two VAMC scheduling pilots are particularly  relevant, given that VA\u2019s RFP, as amended, for its planned  consolidated community care program indicates that VAMCs\u2014rather  than TPAs\u2014will carry out community care appointment scheduling,  unless VA exercises a contract option for the TPAs to provide such  services for VAMCs that request them. However, while VHA officials  told us that while they have taken some steps to begin evaluating the  effectiveness of the pilots in improving appointment scheduling, these  efforts have not been completed. The lack of an evaluation of the two  VAMC scheduling pilots is inconsistent with the federal internal control  standard for risk assessment, which stipulates that an agency should  identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined  objectives. In addition, the federal internal control standard for  monitoring calls for ongoing monitoring to assess the effectiveness of  management strategies, make needed corrections if shortcomings are  identified, and determine if corrective actions are achieving desired  outcomes. Without evaluating the results of the scheduling pilots at  the Alaska and Fargo VA Health Care Systems, VA lacks assurance  that VAMC staff have the potential to schedule veterans\u2019 community  care appointments in a more timely manner than TPA staff otherwise  would schedule them.

According to managers and staff at the six  selected VAMCs, VA and VHA have issued numerous contract  modifications and policy changes with little advanced notice  throughout the Choice Program\u2019s implementation. According to these  VAMC managers and staff, the untimely communication of changes  created confusion at the VAMC level that affected veterans\u2019 access to  Choice Program care. We reviewed documentation showing that from  October 2014 (when it modified the TPAs\u2019 contracts to add  responsibilities related to Choice Program administration) until July  2017, VA modified each TPA\u2019s contract about 40 times. Many of these  contract modifications\u2014along with other legislative and regulatory  changes that VA implemented during this period\u2014changed VAMC or  TPA processes related to Choice Program referrals and appointment  scheduling. Many of the VAMC managers and staff we interviewed  said they struggled to keep up with the contract modifications and  policy changes, that VHA\u2019s Office of Community Care did not always  leave adequate time to prepare for them, and they felt they were  never really able to become proficient at new processes before  additional changes occurred. This meant that training sometimes  happened after the contract modifications or VHA policy changes had  already gone into effect. For example, managers and staff at three of  the selected VAMCs told us that they were not informed in advance  about a June 2016 contract modification that required the TPAs to  return Choice Program authorizations to VAMCs if they failed to  schedule appointments within required time frames. This contract  modification had the potential to significantly increase VAMCs\u2019  workloads, because they would have to arrange veterans\u2019 care  through other means once the authorizations were returned.  According to individuals at two of these three VAMCs, they first heard  about this change from TPA staff, rather than from VHA.", "VHA took the following two actions intended to help address staffing- related factors that adversely affected the timeliness of veterans\u2019 Choice  Program care.", "Staffing tool for VAMCs to estimate needs. In the spring of 2017,  VHA developed a tool that is intended to help VAMCs project their  staffing needs for the consolidated community care program VA plans  to implement. VHA used workload data and site visit observations to  develop the tool. Among the six selected VAMC managers we  interviewed, impressions about the reasonableness of the staffing  estimates generated by the community care staffing tool were mixed.  For example, managers at two of the VAMCs said that the tool likely  underestimated the number of staff they would need to handle  referrals and appointment scheduling once VA transitions to the  consolidated community care program. In contrast, managers from  two other VAMCs thought that the tool\u2019s staffing estimates seemed  about right.", "Co-locating TPA staff at selected VAMCs to assist with  resolution of problems. To help facilitate problem resolution  between VAMCs and the TPAs as they work to schedule veterans\u2019  Choice Program appointments, VA modified the TPAs\u2019 contracts in  November 2015 to allow for TPA staff to be co-located at selected  VAMCs. VHA officials expected that one potential benefit of co- locating TPA staff would be that fewer veterans\u2019 Choice Program  referrals would be returned to VAMCs because of missing clinical  information because TPA staff could help resolve such problems  locally before the TPA returned referrals. As of May 2017, TPA staff  were working at 70 of VHA\u2019s 170 VAMCs\u2014or about 40 percent of all  VAMCs. Similar care coordination arrangements may exist under the  consolidated community care program VA is planning to implement, if  VA exercises a contract option for the TPAs to provide such services  at VAMCs that request them.", "However, the communication-related factors that VHA and TPA officials  identified as affecting the timeliness of veterans\u2019 Choice Program care  remain. VHA relied on ad hoc communications such as memoranda, fact  sheets, e-mails, national conference calls, and occasional web-based  trainings to communicate policy and process changes to VAMCs  throughout the Choice Program\u2019s implementation. Our interviews with  VAMC managers and staff suggest that these were not the most effective  methods of communication because messages about key changes  sometimes lacked sufficient detail or failed to reach the VAMC staff  responsible for implementing them in a timely manner. According to the  federal internal control standard for control activities, agencies should  implement control activities through their policies and procedures, which  document the responsibilities of managers and staff who are responsible  for implementing a program. Among other things, this may include  management reviewing and updating policies and day-to-day procedures  in a timely manner after a significant change in the program has occurred.  VHA has no comprehensive policy directive or operations manual for the  Choice Program, and its broader policy directive for VA community care  programs has not been updated since January 2013. As a result, VAMC  staff have operated in an environment that is frequently changing with no  definitive reference source or sources of up-to-date policy and processes  to consult, such as a comprehensive policy directive or operations  manual. Instead, VAMC staff have had to keep track of the Choice  Program\u2019s policy and process changes through VHA\u2019s various ad hoc  communications. This poses a risk to VHA, as it increases the likelihood  that VAMCs will implement new policies and processes inconsistently. In  addition, there is risk that VAMC managers and staff will not always be  aware of the most current policies and processes. Unless a  comprehensive policy directive or operations manual is created, those  risks could remain for the consolidated community care program VA is  planning to establish."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Provider Networks Affected Timely Access, but VHA Plans to Improve Available Information Related to Provider Capacity and Veteran Demand for Future TPAs", "paragraphs": ["According to VAMC managers and TPA officials we interviewed, the  TPAs\u2019 inadequate networks of community providers affected both the  timeliness with which veterans received Choice Program care and the  extent to which veterans were able to access community providers  located close to their homes. In September 2015, about 11 months after  the Choice Program was implemented, VA contracting officials sent  corrective action letters to both TPAs, citing network adequacy (i.e., the  number, mix and geographic distribution of network providers) as a  concern. TPA officials we interviewed acknowledged that their networks  initially were not adequate to meet demand for Choice Program care.  From the TPAs\u2019 perspective, the brief transition period before the Choice  Program began operations in November 2014 was not enough time to  strengthen the community provider networks they had previously  established under PC3, another VHA community care program.  Furthermore, the TPAs told us that VA had not provided them with  sufficient data on the expected demand for Choice Program care\u2014by  clinical specialty and zip code\u2014prior to or after the Choice Program\u2019s  implementation.", "The overall number of community providers participating in the TPAs\u2019  Choice Program networks nationwide grew dramatically over the following  year\u2014from almost 39,000 providers in September 2015 to more than  161,000 providers as of September 2016. However, at the time of our  review, managers at five of the six selected VAMCs told us that they still  observed TPA network inadequacies that impeded veterans\u2019 access to  Choice Program care. Similarly, managers at three VAMCs in our sample  said that key community providers\u2014including large academic medical  centers\u2014have refused to join the TPAs\u2019 networks or dropped out of the  networks after joining them, often because the TPAs had not paid them in  a timely manner for the services they provided.", "Establishing adequate networks of Choice Program providers in rural  areas has been particularly difficult.

According to a December 2015 analysis by VHA  researchers, the majority of network providers in two of the three VISNs  examined were located within 40 miles of VAMCs, leaving large  geographic areas of these VISNs (particularly rural areas) outside the 40- mile radius with few network providers. For example, only 3.8 percent of  primary care providers and 3.2 percent of behavioral health providers in  VISN 20 (which covers Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) were  located more than 40 miles from VAMCs within that VISN. While the  areas lacking network providers generally have fewer veterans relative to  other areas within these VISNs, the analysis by VHA researchers  suggests that veterans living in these areas are likely to have difficulty  accessing Choice Program network providers that are located closer to  their homes than the nearest VAMC, which is over 40 miles away.", "VA and VHA have tried to address network inadequacy that existed under  the Choice Program and either have taken or plan to take additional  actions to address this issue for the community care program VA plans to  implement, including the following.", "Establishment of Choice Program provider agreement process.", "To help address inadequacies in the TPAs\u2019 provider networks and  improve veterans\u2019 access to care under the Choice Program, VHA  established the Choice Program provider agreement process in  February 2016. This process allowed VAMCs to establish agreements  with community providers, schedule veterans\u2019 appointments, and  reimburse the providers directly (using Choice Program funds) when  the TPAs failed to schedule veterans\u2019 appointments for reasons  relating to network inadequacy, among others. Originally, the  VAMCs were required to send veterans\u2019 referrals to the TPAs and  wait for them to be returned before they could proceed with arranging  care through a Choice Program provider agreement. While this  process had the potential to increase the availability of providers for  the Choice Program, it did not immediately improve the timeliness of  veterans\u2019 Choice Program care because veterans still had to wait for  as long as it took the VAMCs to send their referrals to the TPAs and  for TPAs to return them before the VAMCs could proceed with  arranging care through Choice Program provider agreements.  According to the policies and contractual requirements that were in  effect at the time, it could have taken up to 40 calendar days after a  VHA clinician first identified the veteran\u2019s need for care until the TPA  returned the referral and the VAMC could proceed with arranging care  through a Choice Program provider agreement. However, in March  2017, VHA updated the Choice Program provider agreement process  so that\u2014if the TPAs were returning a high volume of a VAMC\u2019s  referrals for one or more types of care\u2014the VAMC could seek  approval from its VISN and VHA\u2019s Office of Community Care to  bypass the TPA and proceed directly to arranging that type of care  through Choice Program provider agreements. This had the potential  to improve the timeliness of veterans\u2019 access to Choice Program care  because it eliminated the steps of sending referrals to the TPAs and  waiting for them to be returned.", "Improving quality of information given to future TPAs. To help  inform the recruitment of network providers for the consolidated  community care program VA plans to establish, VA plans to provide  future TPAs more robust data than they provided the current TPAs at  the start of the Choice Program. In particular, VA\u2019s RFP for the  consolidated community care program, as amended, indicates that VA  will provide (1) zip-code-level data on the number of authorizations  that were issued in fiscal year 2015 for specific types of care (e.g.,  chemotherapy and obstetrics) and (2) VAMC-level data on the clinical  specialties with the greatest wait times for appointments at VAMCs.  These local-level data could help TPAs estimate the number of  network providers of various specialties they will need to recruit in  specific localities if awarded a contract for the consolidated  community care program that VA is planning to implement.", "Performing market assessments. In preparation for the  consolidated community care program VA plans to establish, VA and  VHA officials are planning to conduct market assessments in 96  markets nationwide. Through these market assessments, officials told  us, VA will (1) examine the clinical capacity that currently exists within  VHA medical facilities and among community providers, (2) assess  veterans\u2019 current and future demand for health care services, and (3)  develop long-term plans for ensuring that veterans will have access to  high-quality health care services\u2014whether they receive care from  VHA clinicians or from community providers. According to VHA  officials, the market assessments will help inform network provider  recruitment efforts for the consolidated community care program VA is  planning to implement. In addition, VHA officials told us that the  market assessments will help VISN- and VAMC-level leaders make  more informed, strategic decisions about whether it is more efficient to  maintain or build capacity for delivering particular types of care within  VHA medical facilities, or if they should routinely purchase certain  types of care in the community. In November 2017, VHA officials told  us that they expect to begin conducting the market assessments early  in calendar year 2018, and the officials estimate that it will take about  18 months to complete assessments for all 96 markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Choice Program is approaching the end of its life, and with plans to  consolidate it with VA\u2019s other community care programs, opportunities to  improve the program are diminishing. Congress created the Choice  Program in 2014 in response to longstanding challenges in veterans\u2019  access to care delivered within VHA medical facilities. However, we found  numerous operational and oversight weaknesses with VHA\u2019s  management of scheduling veterans\u2019 medical appointments through the  Choice Program. While it may not be feasible for VA and VHA to  implement corrective actions to address all of our findings before the  Choice Program ends, it is imperative that VA incorporate lessons  learned from the Choice Program when it implements the consolidated  community care program it has planned.", "First, we found VHA\u2019s process for scheduling appointments for veterans  through the Choice Program was not consistent with statutory  requirements. The Choice Act requires veterans to receive care no more  than 30 days from the date an appointment is deemed clinically  appropriate or from the date the veteran prefers to receive care; however,  we found that veterans could potentially wait up to 70 calendar days to  receive routine care through the Choice Program. In effect, we found that  in 2016, some veterans\u2019 actual wait times far exceeded 30 days. Although  VA has made some relevant contract modifications and issued guidance  to address Choice Program wait times, VHA has not adjusted the Choice  Program\u2019s appointment scheduling process or established timeliness  standards for all steps of the process. In addition, VHA\u2019s monitoring of  access to Choice Program care has been limited by incomplete and  unreliable data. In particular, the data VHA uses preclude it from  accurately identifying the number of days that occur within each phase of  the process, from initial referral to the actual appointment. Furthermore, a  lack of controls has allowed for inappropriate changes to be made in  veterans\u2019 clinically indicated dates and routine versus urgent care  categorizations, affecting VA\u2019s ability to monitor whether veterans are  receiving Choice Program care in a timely manner. The lack of reliable  data and performance measures also hinders VHA\u2019s ability to oversee the  program and identify problems and corrective actions. Further, we found  that VHA is missing out on opportunities to enhance its design of the  planned consolidated community care program. For example, VHA has  not fully evaluated its pilot programs for scheduling appointments nor  developed tools such as a mechanism that would allow the seamless  sharing of information between VHA and the TPAs. Lastly, we found that  VHA often relied on inefficient, ad hoc methods of sharing information  (such as memoranda, fact sheets and emails), which often failed to reach  the VAMC managers and staff responsible for implementing the program.", "After the Choice Program ends, VA anticipates that veterans will continue  to receive care from non-VHA providers under the consolidated  community care program that it is planning to implement. VA\u2019s and VHA\u2019s  design of the future program can benefit from the lessons learned under  the Choice Program. Ignoring these lessons learned and the challenges  that have arisen under the Choice Program as VA and VHA design the  future consolidated program would only increase VA\u2019s risk for not being  able to ensure that all veterans will receive timely access to care in the  community."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that VA and VHA incorporate lessons learned from the Choice  Program as they develop and implement a consolidated VA community  care program, we are making the following 10 recommendations:", "The Under Secretary for Health should establish an achievable wait- time goal for the consolidated community care program that VA plans  to implement that will permit VHA to monitor whether veterans are  receiving VA community care within time frames that are comparable  to the amount of time they would otherwise wait to receive care at  VHA medical facilities. (Recommendation 1)", "The Under Secretary for Health should design an appointment  scheduling process for the consolidated community care program that  VA plans to implement that sets forth time frames within which (1)  veterans\u2019 referrals must be processed, (2) veterans\u2019 appointments  must be scheduled, and (3) veterans\u2019 appointments must occur, which  are consistent with the wait-time goal VHA has established for the  program. (Recommendation 2)", "The Under Secretary for Health should establish a mechanism that  will allow VHA to systematically monitor the average number of days it  takes for VAMCs to prepare referrals, for VAMCs or TPAs to schedule  veterans\u2019 appointments, and for veterans\u2019 appointments to occur,  under the consolidated community care program that VA plans to  implement. (Recommendation 3)", "The Under Secretary for Health should implement a mechanism to  prevent veterans\u2019 clinically indicated dates from being modified by  individuals other than VHA clinicians when veterans are referred to  the consolidated community care program that VA plans to  implement. (Recommendation 4)", "The Under Secretary for Health should implement a mechanism to  separate clinically urgent referrals and authorizations from those for  which the VAMC or the TPA has decided to expedite appointment  scheduling for administrative reasons. (Recommendation 5)", "The Under Secretary for Health should (1) establish oversight  mechanisms to ensure that VHA is collecting reliable data on the  reasons that VAMC or TPA staff are unsuccessful in scheduling  veterans\u2019 appointments through the consolidated community care  program VA plans to implement, and (2) demonstrate that it has  corrected any identified deficiencies. (Recommendation 6)", "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the contracts for  the consolidated community care program VA plans to implement  include performance metrics that will allow VHA to monitor average  driving times between veterans\u2019 homes and the practice locations of  community providers that participate in the TPAs\u2019 networks.  (Recommendation 7)", "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should establish a system for the  consolidated community care program VA plans to implement to help  facilitate seamless, efficient information sharing among VAMCs, VHA  clinicians, TPAs, community providers, and veterans. Specifically, this  system should allow all of these entities to electronically exchange  information for the purposes of care coordination. (Recommendation  8)", "The Under Secretary for Health should conduct a comprehensive  evaluation of the outcomes of the two appointment scheduling pilots it  established at the Alaska and Fargo VA Health Care Systems (where  VAMC staff, rather than TPA staff, are responsible for scheduling  veterans\u2019 Choice Program appointments), which should include a  comparison of the timeliness with which VAMC staff and TPA staff  completed each step of the Choice Program appointment scheduling  process, as well as the overall timeliness with which veterans  received appointments. (Recommendation 9)", "The Under Secretary for Health should issue a comprehensive policy  directive and operations manual for the consolidated community care  program VA plans to implement and ensure that these documents are  reviewed and updated in a timely manner after any significant  changes to the program occur.

In its comments, VA concurred with 8 of our 10  recommendations and described its plans for implementing them. VA  stated that VHA\u2019s Office of Community Care will work collaboratively with  other VA and VHA offices to evaluate modifications to the current wait- time goals and measurement processes so that wait times for VA  community care can be compared to wait times for care delivered at VHA  medical facilities.", "VA did not concur with our recommendation to implement a mechanism  to separate clinically urgent referrals and authorizations from those that  are designated as urgent for administrative reasons. VA stated that  because VAMC staff (rather than TPA staff) will be responsible for  scheduling veterans\u2019 appointments under the consolidated community  care program it plans to implement, there would no longer be a need to  separate clinically urgent referrals from those that need to be  administratively expedited. However, we maintain that our  recommendation is warranted. In particular, we found that VA\u2019s data did  not always accurately reflect the timeliness of urgent care because both  VAMC and TPA staff inappropriately re-categorized some routine care  referrals and authorizations as urgent ones for reasons unrelated to the  veterans\u2019 health conditions. Regardless of whether VAMC staff or TPA  staff are responsible for appointment scheduling, VA will need to ensure  that it uses reliable data to monitor the extent to which veterans receive  urgent care within required time frames. Without a means of separating  clinically urgent referrals and authorizations from ones for which the  scheduling process must be administratively expedited, VA\u2019s data on the  timeliness of urgent care will continue to be unreliable.", "VA agreed in principle with our recommendation to issue a  comprehensive policy directive and operations manual, but stated in its  comments that it would wait to determine whether a comprehensive policy  directive is needed until after the consolidated community care program  has been fully implemented and any interim implementation challenges  have been resolved. However, when implementing a new program, it is  important that agencies establish the program\u2019s structure, responsibilities,  and authorities at the beginning to help ensure that the new program\u2019s  objectives are met. Relying on outdated policies and unreliable  communication methods increases VA\u2019s risk of encountering foreseeable  challenges. Without issuing a comprehensive policy directive and  operations manual before the start of the new program, VA risks  experiencing untimely communication issues similar to those that affected  veterans\u2019 access to care throughout the Choice Program\u2019s  implementation. A comprehensive policy directive and operations manual  that could be updated as changes occur would give VAMCs a definitive  source of real-time, up-to-date information and reduce the likelihood that  VAMCs will implement new policies and processes inconsistently under  the future program.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,  the Under Secretary for Health, appropriate congressional committees,  and other interested parties.

We (1) analyzed Choice Program appointment wait times for selected  veterans using a sample of 196 Choice Program authorizations for routine  and urgent care; (2) reviewed VHA\u2019s analysis of Choice Program  appointment wait times for a sample of about 5,000 Choice Program  authorizations; (3) reviewed data VHA uses to monitor the timeliness of  Choice Program care and reasons that the TPAs have returned Choice  Program referrals without making appointments; (4) interviewed VA, VHA,  and TPA officials; and (5) reviewed federal internal control standards, as  follows.  1.  Our analysis of Choice Program wait times for a sample of 196  authorizations. To analyze the timeliness of Choice Program  appointment scheduling and completion for a sample of veterans, we  selected six VAMCs and a random, non-generalizable sample of 196  authorizations for veterans who were referred to the Choice Program  by those six VAMCs between January 2016 and April 2016. We  judgmentally selected the six VAMCs to include variation in  geographic location, with three VAMCs that serve rural veteran  populations and three VAMCs that serve urban veteran populations.  In addition, three of the VAMCs were served by Health Net, and three  were served by TriWest. (See table 5.)", "To select our random, non-generalizable sample of 196 Choice  Program authorizations, we obtained VA data on all authorizations  created by the TPAs between January and April 2016 for veterans  who were referred to the program by the six VAMCs we selected\u2014a  universe of about 55,000 authorizations. From these 55,000  authorizations, we randomly selected:", "55 routine care authorizations (about 10 authorizations per VAMC)  for which the TPAs scheduled appointments for veterans,", "53 urgent care authorizations (about 10 authorizations per VAMC)  for which the TPAs scheduled appointments for veterans, and", "88 routine and urgent care authorizations (about 15 authorizations  per VAMC) that the TPAs returned to VA without scheduling  appointments for any one of the following three reasons\u2014(1) VA  requested the authorization be returned, (2) VA data were missing  from the referral, and (3) the veteran declined or did not want  Choice Program care.", "For all 196 Choice Program authorizations in our sample, we  manually reviewed VHA documentation (specifically, the veterans\u2019 VA  electronic health records) and TPA documentation to track the  number of calendar days that elapsed at each step of the Choice  Program appointment scheduling process. For the authorizations that  the TPAs returned to the VAMCs without making appointments, we  examined VHA and TPA documentation to determine whether the  veterans eventually obtained care through other means\u2014such as  through another VA community care program, a different Choice  Program referral, or at a VHA medical facility\u2014and how long it took to  receive that care. Determining whether veterans in our sample  experienced clinical harm or adverse clinical outcomes because of  delays in the VAMCs\u2019 or TPAs\u2019 processing of their referrals and  authorizations was outside the scope of our review.", "We selected our sample of 55 routine care and 53 urgent care  authorizations for which the TPAs succeeded in scheduling  appointments to include only authorizations for which the TPAs did  not meet VA\u2019s appointment scheduling goals at one phase of the  appointment scheduling process: when the TPAs attempt to schedule  appointments after the veterans have opted in to the program. This  was to ensure that our sample included only authorizations for which  scheduling was delayed, so that we could examine the potential  causes of appointment scheduling delays and whether delays also  occurred at other phases of the process (such as when VAMCs were  preparing the veterans\u2019 referrals or when the TPAs were attempting to  reach the veterans for them to opt in to the program). We omitted this  phase of the appointment scheduling process when calculating the  timeliness of appointment completion for the 55 routine care  authorizations and 53 urgent care authorizations in our sample.  Rather than reporting veterans\u2019 overall wait times for these  authorizations, we report the average number of calendar days that  elapsed (1) while VAMCs were preparing veterans\u2019 Choice Program  referrals, (2) while the TPAs were attempting to reach veterans for  them to opt in to the program, and (3) while veterans waited to attend  their appointments after the TPAs succeeded in scheduling them. To  assess the reliability of the authorization data we used, we  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, manually reviewed the  content of the data, and electronically tested it for missing values. We  concluded that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives. The findings from our review of Choice  Program authorizations cannot be generalized beyond the VAMCs  and the veterans\u2019 Choice Program authorizations we reviewed.  2.  VHA\u2019s analysis of Choice Program wait times for a sample of  about 5,000 authorizations. We obtained from VHA\u2019s Office of  Community Care the results of a nationwide analysis of Choice  Program appointment timeliness it conducted in February 2017.  Specifically, VHA directed its VAMCs to manually review veterans\u2019  health records and TPA documentation and report observations for a  non-generalizable sample of about 5,000 randomly selected Choice  Program authorizations that were created between July and  September of 2016. The sample was limited to authorizations for  Choice Program appointments that had been scheduled for time- eligible veterans who needed four types of specialty care\u2014 mammography, gastroenterology, cardiology, and neurology.  According to VHA officials, they limited their analysis to these four  types of care because delayed treatment for any of these specialties  could cause adverse health outcomes for patients. To assess the  reliability of VHA\u2019s data, we manually reviewed the results of its  analysis and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about  potential outliers. We concluded that VHA\u2019s data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective. The results of  VHA\u2019s analysis cannot be generalized beyond the sample of Choice  Program authorizations that it reviewed.  3.  VHA data on timeliness of Choice Program appointments and the  reasons TPAs return referrals without making appointments. To  evaluate the information VHA uses to monitor access to care under  the Choice Program, we reviewed data that VHA collects to monitor  the timeliness with which the TPAs schedule appointments and the  timeliness with which appointments occur after the TPAs have  scheduled them. We also reviewed and tested the reliability of VHA  data on the reasons the TPAs have returned Choice Program  referrals to VAMCs without scheduling appointments, which may offer  insights about access to care (e.g., the percentage of referrals that  are returned due to a lack of providers in the TPAs\u2019 networks).  4.  Interviews with officials. We interviewed VA, VHA, and TPA officials  responsible for administering the Choice Program contracts and  overseeing implementation of the program. We interviewed these  officials to gain an understanding of the processes they followed and  the information they used to monitor veterans\u2019 access to Choice  Program care.  5.  Federal internal control standards. We examined the results of our  and VHA\u2019s analyses and the information VHA uses to monitor  veterans\u2019 access to care under the program in the context of federal  standards for internal control for (1) information and communication  and (2) monitoring. The internal control standard for information and  communication relates to management\u2019s ability to use quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.
