For example, the Department of Justice sought to locate and interview 4,112 aliens who were believed to be in the country and who might have knowledge that would assist the nation in its anti-terrorism efforts. However, as shown below, almost half of these aliens could not be located and interviewed because INS lacked reliable address information. The reliability of INS's alien address information is contingent, in part, on aliens' compliance with the requirement that they notify INS of any change of address. However, lack of publicity about the requirement that aliens should file change of address notifications, no enforcement of penalties for noncompliance, and inadequate processing procedures for changes of address also contribute to INS's alien address information being unreliable. Because INS does not publicize the change of address requirement, some aliens may not be aware of it and may not comply with it. Alternatively, some aliens who are aware of the requirement may not comply because they do not wish to be located. These aliens have little incentive to comply given that INS does not enforce the penalties for noncompliance. On the basis of our review of available data, INS does not appear to have enforced the removal penalty for noncompliance since the early 1970s. When aliens do comply with the requirement, INS lacks adequate processing procedures and controls to ensure that the alien address information it receives is recorded in all automated databases. Addressing these problems should help improve the reliability of INS's alien address information but would not necessarily result in a system that would allow INS to reliably locate all aliens, because some aliens will not likely comply.

In Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and amendments to that section, the Congress reinforced the importance of the government being able to identify which lawfully admitted nonimmigrants remained in the United States beyond their authorized period. This section directs the Attorney General to develop an integrated entry and exit control system that will collect the records of arrival and departure for every alien entering and leaving the United States. The 1996 act also authorized the establishment of an electronic student tracking system to verify and monitor the foreign student and exchange visitor information program.

As part of the effort to protect the nation in anticipation of World War II, the Congress required aliens to register, be fingerprinted, and notify the Attorney General of each change of address, thereby providing INS with the means to identify, track, and locate aliens while they are in the United States. According to the legislative history of the Alien Registration Act, the act was considered to be \u201ca measure of self- defense to provide for the fingerprinting and registration of all aliens in the United States\u2026(and)\u2026a safeguard to know something about their activities and their movements here.\u201d", "Although some requirements of the law have varied since 1940, the Congress has continuously required immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens entering or living in the United States to provide identifying and current address information and has provided penalties for failing to register or file address information. As shown in figure 2, the Alien Registration Act of 1940 required immigrant and nonimmigrant aliens to register with the government. Immigrants were required to report changes of address within 5 days, and nonimmigrants were required to report their address every 90 days irrespective of whether they had moved. In 1950, the Congress increased the reporting requirements for immigrants by requiring them to annually report their addresses. In 1952, the Congress extended the annual address reporting and change of address notification requirements to all aliens and also extended from 5 to 10 days the amount of time aliens were provided to file a change of address. In 1981, the Congress eliminated the requirements that aliens annually report their addresses and that nonimmigrants report their address every 90 days.", "Although the Congress eliminated these requirements, it vested the Attorney General with discretionary authority, upon 10 days\u2019 notice, to require aliens from any country or countries, or any class or group, who are required to be registered, to provide their current address and such additional information as may be required. These changes represent the latest amendments to the laws governing alien registration and address reporting. The Congress currently requires aliens to provide address information through registration and change of address reporting requirements.", "In addition to the registration and change of address requirements, the Congress has continuously provided penalties for aliens who failed to comply with these requirements, as shown in figure 2. The misdemeanor penalty enacted in 1940 for failing to file a change of address notice was a fine of up to a $100 and/or imprisonment for up to 30 days. In 1952, the misdemeanor penalty was increased to a $200 fine and/or imprisonment for up to 30 days and a removal penalty was added, irrespective of whether the alien is charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor. The law provides that an alien, who fails to notify the Attorney General in writing of each change of address and new address within 10 days from the date of such change, shall be taken into custody and removed from the United States unless the alien can establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the failure was reasonably excusable or was not willful. As of September 2002, this penalty remained in effect.", "On June 13 and July 26, 2002, DOJ reiterated that certain aliens are legally obligated to file a change of address form with INS within 10 days of moving to a new address to be used for enforcement and other purposes. On June 13, 2002, DOJ issued a proposed rule concerning the registration and monitoring of certain nonimmigrants. Specifically, the proposed rule would impose registration requirements on nonimmigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria; certain nonimmigrant aliens from other countries that the State Department and INS determine to be an elevated national security risk; and aliens fitting specific criteria who are identified by INS inspectors at points of entry into the United States. Individuals falling into these categories would be required to provide specific information at regular intervals to ensure that they were in compliance with the terms of their visas and admission and that they departed at the end of their authorized stay.

In addition, the alien identifying and address information maintained by INS may not allow law enforcement officials to verify the identity of an alien being sought in cases where several aliens have the same name but are located at different addresses. Senior representatives of the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force told us that the ability to locate aliens within the United States is crucial to their respective missions. According to a senior representative of the task force, the ability to locate aliens in this country is also crucial to the nation\u2019s success in fighting the war on terrorism.", "On November 9, 2001, as part of the nation\u2019s anti-terrorism effort, the Attorney General directed all U.S. Attorneys to locate and request voluntary interviews with 4,793 nonimmigrant aliens who might have had knowledge of foreign terrorists or their organizations. To assist the U.S. Attorneys, the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force asked INS to provide current address information for the aliens who were to be sought for interviews. INS obtained the address information from the Nonimmigrant Information System (NIIS), an automated database that contains address and identity information on nonimmigrants who were inspected upon their entry into the United States. Because the task force considered INS\u2019s address information to be of questionable reliability, it consulted public source databases and supplemented INS\u2019s information in order to provide the most current address information for these aliens to the U.S. Attorneys. U.S. Attorneys determined that  681 aliens had left the country. As of February 26, 2002, even with the information from public source data bases, 1,851, or 45 percent, of the 4,112 aliens believed to be in the country had not been located and interviewed while 2,261, or 55 percent, had been located and interviewed.", "As a second example, INS investigators determined that INS\u2019s address information was inaccurate for 45 aliens who may have known some of the terrorists responsible for the September 11th attacks. According to the Assistant District Director for Investigations in San Diego, he was advised that at least two of the terrorists had student visas and were supposed to be attending school in the San Diego area. He requested that INS headquarters provide him with a list of aliens with student visas who had entered the United States within the last 2 years and, at the time of their entry, indicated they were going to the San Diego area. From a list of 700 aliens, INS investigators identified 45 whom they wanted to locate. According to INS investigators who sought to locate these aliens, INS\u2019s address information for all 45 student aliens was inaccurate as none of them were located at the addresses that INS had provided. Efforts to supplement INS\u2019s address information with the schools\u2019 address information provided accurate addresses for 10 students. It is possible that some or all of the 35 aliens that INS could not locate had left the country.", "As a third example, in January 2002, the Deputy Attorney General directed INS and other DOJ components to establish an Absconder Apprehension Initiative to locate and remove aliens who had been ordered removed but who had failed to leave the United States. Of the estimated 314,000 aliens with final orders of removal still at large in the United States, INS identified 5,046 who were from countries in which there has been an Al Qaeda terrorist presence or activity. To locate and apprehend these aliens, INS, in cooperation with the FBI, the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, and U.S. Attorneys, used INS address data and supplemented these data with address information from public source databases. According to a senior INS official, as of June 24, 2002, 4,334, or 86 percent, of the 5,046 alien absconders had not been apprehended, while 712, or 14 percent, had been apprehended. It is possible that some of the aliens who had not been located may have left the country.", "These examples illustrate one inherent limitation of an address reporting requirement that relies on self reporting, as the reliability and completeness of the address information is dependent on the extent to which aliens comply with the reporting requirement. Those aliens who wish to remain illegally in the country would not likely comply as it could lead to their removal. In these examples, many aliens were not found even after INS\u2019s address information was supplemented with address information from public source databases or schools, which could indicate that some aliens may be able to avoid detection.", "In addition, aliens\u2019 identifying and address information maintained by INS may not allow law enforcement officials to verify the identity of an alien being sought in cases where several aliens have the same name but are located at different addresses. Senior officials from the FBI, the Secret Service, and the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force stressed the need to be able to verify an alien\u2019s identity in order to determine the correct address. These officials recommended that INS collect aliens\u2019 Social Security numbers (SSNs) in order to verify an alien\u2019s identity. The law provides authority for the Attorney General to require aliens to provide their SSNs. As shown in figure 3, INS formerly collected aliens\u2019 SSNs on the Form I-53 as part of the alien address reporting program.", "When the program ended in 1981, INS eliminated the Form I-53 and did not revise the change of address form (Form AR-11) to provide for aliens to report their SSNs. Collecting aliens\u2019 SSNs can help verify an individual\u2019s identity and provide ready access to records, such as drivers licenses and financial records, that are searchable using SSNs. Having aliens\u2019 SSNs would also afford the federal government a better opportunity to locate aliens through automated databases that are searchable using SSNs.Revising the Form AR-11, to include a field that an alien can use to report a SSN or indicate that he or she does not have one, would provide one method for collecting this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Publicity, No Enforcement of Penalties, and Inadequate Processing Procedures Contribute to INS\u2019s Unreliable Address Information", "paragraphs": ["Lack of publicity, no enforcement of penalties for not filing a change of address notification, and inadequate procedures and controls for processing change of address notifications explain in part why INS cannot maintain current and reliable address information.

Aliens may be aware of the requirement but may have little incentive to comply given that, based on our review of available data, INS does not appear to have enforced the removal penalty for noncompliance since the early 1970s.", "INS\u2019s historical records from 1950 through 2002 do not provide the number of aliens who were placed in removal proceedings for failing to file a change of address notification. According to an official with the Executive Office for Immigration Review, its records date from 1988 and contain no cases where aliens were charged and placed in removal proceedings for failing to file a change of address notification. A review of federal cases and cases brought on appeal from the Executive Office for Immigration Review to the Board of Immigration Appeals indicates just a few instances where INS charged an alien with failure to file a notification of address or change of address in a removal proceeding. We also found a few cases where an alien was prosecuted for failure to give notice of an address or change of address.", "Senior INS investigators cited two reasons for INS\u2019s lack of enforcement. The principal reason cited was that INS\u2019s change of address records are not maintained in a manner that permits the agency to determine whether an alien has complied with the requirement. In order to place an alien in removal proceedings, INS is required to certify that the alien did not comply with the filing requirement by issuing a certificate of no record. According to a senior official with INS\u2019s Office of General Counsel, if the certificate is to be legally sustainable, INS must be able to check all change of address records to be certain that the alien did not comply. However, INS lacks procedures and controls for maintaining complete and current change of address records. As a result, INS cannot determine whether an alien has complied and, therefore, cannot issue certificates of no record with the required degree of certainty. According to a 1944 INS report, INS was able to determine if an alien had complied with the change of address requirement because it maintained all address verification cards within the Alien Registration Division in headquarters. As a result, INS personnel could review the change of address records to determine if an alien had provided a change of address. If no change of address card for a specific alien was in INS\u2019s centralized file, INS could determine that it did not have a record showing that the alien had reported a change of address. Senior INS records officials said that it would be impossible to reliably reconstruct years of change of address records in order to create a complete, current, and centralized system of address records because they could not be certain that some change of address records had not been lost, misplaced, misfiled, or destroyed.", "The second reason cited for INS\u2019s lack of enforcement was that the agency\u2019s internal policy discourages enforcement of this type of case. INS\u2019s Operations Instructions provide internal guidance to its employees. The Operations Instructions governing the enforcement of the penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirement states that noncompliance shall not normally serve as the sole basis for initiating prosecution or removal proceedings. In contrast, under the law, noncompliance can be the sole basis for removal unless the alien can establish that the violation was not willful or was reasonably excusable. This internal policy has been in effect since March 8, 1972. According to a senior INS investigative official, this policy may have been established because INS could not reliably determine if an alien had or had not filed a change of address notification. Senior INS investigative officials said they interpret the instruction as preventing enforcement of the penalties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS Lacks Procedures and Controls Needed To Ensure Alien Address Information Is Complete", "paragraphs": ["When aliens do submit Forms AR-11, INS must update its automated databases for the estimated 111,500 change of address notifications it receives annually. However, INS lacks written procedures and automated controls to help ensure that reported changes of address are recorded in all automated databases."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "INS Does Not Update Address Information in All Automated Databases", "paragraphs": ["INS has at least 16 different automated databases that capture alien identity and address information. For example, when an alien enters the country as a visitor, his or her name and intended address are to be recorded in the automated NIIS. If the alien subsequently applies to adjust his or her visa status, the application for adjustment is to be recorded in the automated Computer Linked Application Information Management System (CLAIMS 3). Consequently, an alien\u2019s name and address may appear in more than one INS automated system. In this example, if the alien then moved and filed a change of address notification, INS would have to update both NIIS and CLAIMS 3 to ensure that the most current address information was recorded and that the address data across different automated databases was consistent. However, INS does not update all databases that contain alien address information and does not have the ability to update address information in NIIS.", "As shown in figure 4, INS\u2019s prescribed change of address form is the Form AR-11 that is to be used by all aliens to report their new address. Aliens are to complete a Form AR-11 and mail it to INS headquarters in Washington, D.C. Upon receipt, INS staff determine where each alien\u2019s file is located and forward the change of address card to the appropriate INS office. INS does not create paper-based files for most nonimmigrant aliens. Consequently, if INS headquarters staff cannot associate a Form AR-11 with an alien\u2019s file, the card is placed in a box and held until a technician can do further research on them. These cards are not forwarded to any INS office and are not used to update automated databases. The forms that are sent to district offices or INS\u2019s National Records Center may not be used to update any database as there are no written procedures or automated controls that require or would provide for updating all databases. Change of address forms that are sent to the service centers are to be used to update the CLAIMS 3 database. No other databases that may also contain the alien\u2019s address are updated.", "In addition to the Form AR-11, INS has four other change of address forms and a 1-800 telephone number that are generally to be used by aliens who qualify or have applied for a specific immigration benefit. As shown in figure 5, the different forms are to be sent to INS\u2019s service centers or asylum offices for processing. At the service centers and asylum offices, some but not all automated databases are required to be updated with the new address information. Consequently, for those aliens who submit a change of address form, the consistency of their address information may vary between or among different INS automated databases.", "Irrespective of the change of address form that is used, all databases are not updated because INS does not have adequate written procedures or automated controls that require or provide for updating address information in all automated databases in which the alien\u2019s name and address information appears. INS could establish automated controls such as a single automated address database from which other INS databases download alien address information. Alternatively, INS could establish automated linkages whereby updating address information in one automated database would automatically update address information in all databases. In either case, INS would need to record the date that the change of address was received in order to identify which address was most current and to determine whether an alien had filed a change of address within the required 10 days. Furthermore, INS\u2019s written procedures do not require all databases with address information to be updated. INS has drafted but not yet implemented field office processing procedures for the Form AR-11. These draft procedures do not require that all automated databases be updated.", "Potential alien address inconsistencies among INS databases may have hampered DOJ\u2019s efforts to locate aliens. For example, if any of the 4,793 aliens who were being sought for interviews by U.S. Attorneys had submitted changes of address, their new addresses would not have been recorded in the database that was used to search for their current addresses. These aliens\u2019 address information was provided to the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force by INS from the NIIS database that is not updated when INS receives changes of address. Consequently, these 4,793 aliens\u2019 address information was only as current as the date of their last entry into the United States. In a similar example, the Alien Absconder Initiative obtained address information on aliens who were ordered removed but who failed to depart the country from INS\u2019s Deportable Alien Control System (DACS). As with the NIIS database, change of address information submitted to INS is not used to update address information in DACS.

INS\u2019s concept of operations includes capturing and electronically storing alien address information in a timely manner, providing access to appropriate personnel through a single facility that provides easy sharing and updating of address information, and providing clear direction to aliens concerning their responsibility to provide current address information. To implement this concept of operations, the task force recommended a short-, medium-, and long-term strategy including the designation of a lead agency official for address issues, a reduction in the number of change of address forms, making the updating of address information a priority, issuing a request for information to identify best practices, developing a single centralized address repository, and developing compliance policies to monitor the process.", "As of September 11, 2002, INS had accepted the task force\u2019s recommendations.

These involve implementing a publicity campaign to make more aliens aware of their responsibilities; making arrangements with the U.S. Postal Service to make forms available in post offices; establishing internal controls for ensuring that data from aliens\u2019 change of address forms are consistent in all automated databases and permit the issuance of a certificate of no record; and clarifying internal guidance to establish that noncompliance can be the sole basis for removal. INS has begun to take action to implement the Address Issues Task Force recommendations that will help to improve INS\u2019s alien address information. As of October 2002, INS had designated a lead agency official for address issues. Furthermore, INS planned to reduce the number of change of address forms, make the updating of address information a priority, issue a request for information to identify best practices, develop a centralized address repository, and develop compliance policies to monitor the process.", "Taking these steps should help improve the reliability of INS\u2019s address information, but they would not likely result in a system that would allow INS to locate all aliens. To a large extent, the accuracy and reliability of INS\u2019s address information is contingent on aliens\u2019 compliance. It is reasonable to assume that INS will never be able to know where every alien is located at any point in time because some aliens who are in the United States illegally may not want INS to know where they are and, therefore, will not likely comply with the address reporting requirement. It is also likely that some aliens will not know about the requirement or may simply forget to file the forms. Moreover, for INS to maintain a reliable system that is based solely on alien self-reporting would seem an almost impossible task without a significant infusion of resources. There may be alternative cost-effective approaches for obtaining or assembling more complete and accurate alien address information, particularly for those aliens who do not comply with the change of address notification requirement, that meets the needs of INS and the law enforcement community. These approaches include, but are not limited to, conducting a nationwide alien address registration pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority, requesting legislative reinstatement of the alien address reporting program, matching INS address data with those of federal and/or state agencies, and purchasing address information from commercially available sources.

Beginning August 27, 1940, INS, in cooperation with the Post Office Department, registered and fingerprinted aliens in the United States who were required to register. As of December 31, 1940, 4,921,452 aliens had been registered. Aliens in the United States were required to submit (1) an official registration form, which contained information such as name, country of birth, address, occupation, and immigration status, and (2) a fingerprint card. INS reviewed the registration documents and if they were found acceptable, a registration receipt card bearing the individual number, name, and address of the registrant was issued and mailed. Fingerprint cards were forwarded to the FBI to identify aliens with criminal records. INS considered the requirement that resident aliens notify of a change of address within 5 days to be important because it provided the only statutory method for keeping these aliens\u2019 locations current. As of February 1, 1943, INS received about 1,850,000 notifications of changes of address.

The survey concluded that it would be more efficient to integrate the division\u2019s functions into the central office, and accordingly, the division was eliminated on December 31, 1944. One of the reasons cited for eliminating the division was the inability to maintain current address information for aliens who were in the country. According to the survey report, an estimated 5 to 40 percent of the registered aliens had moved without filing changes of address as required, and the U.S.", "Attorneys had refused to prosecute these violations. In addition, the act did not require that aliens\u2019 deaths and departures be reported to the Alien Registration Division and many were not reported.
