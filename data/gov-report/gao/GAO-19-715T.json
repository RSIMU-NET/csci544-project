To obtain such evidence, VBA staff may request  that the veteran undergo a disability medical exam conducted by the  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and VBA also contracts with  private firms to perform these exams. According to VBA, it has increased  its reliance on contractors to help avoid delays in the disability claims  process related to completion of these exams.", "We previously reported that VBA needed to make improvements to its  oversight of contracted examiners, particularly given its increasing  reliance on them. For example, from fiscal year 2012 through mid- September 2019, the number of these exams completed by VBA  contractors more than quadrupled\u2014from roughly 178,000 to almost  958,000, according to VBA.

According to its  Request for Proposals, VA expected the new contracts to cover  approximately 7.7 million exam requests in the United States over a 10- year period.

We also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, relevant  provisions of selected versions of various contracts, and VA guidance.  We interviewed VA, VHA, and VBA officials; each of the five contractors  that performed exams under the 2016 contract; a private firm that  performs audits of VBA contracted examiners\u2019 licenses; and three  national veterans service organizations. For this testimony, we  incorporated recent updates from VBA on the status of our  recommendations and obtained some information on the new contracts,  staffing levels, and exam management system updates in September  2019.

Such  evidence includes the veteran\u2019s military service records, medical exams,  and treatment records from VHA medical facilities and private medical  service providers. If necessary to provide support to substantiate a claim,  VA will also provide a medical exam for the veteran, either through a  provider at a VHA medical facility or through a VBA contractor. According  to VBA officials, VBA monitors a VHA facility\u2019s capacity to conduct exams,  and in instances when the facility may not have capacity to conduct a  timely exam, VBA will send an exam request to one of its contractors  instead.", "Once the contractor accepts the exam request from VBA, it assigns a  contracted examiner to conduct the exam and complete an exam report  designed to capture essential medical information for purposes of  determining entitlement to disability benefits. The contractors send the  completed report to VBA, which uses the information as part of the  evidence to evaluate the claim and determine whether the veteran is  eligible for benefits.", "In 2016, VBA established an exam program office to manage and  oversee contractors, monitor their performance, and ensure that they  meet contract requirements. For example, in 2018 we reported that the  contracts require that contractors develop plans outlining how they will  ensure examiners are adequately trained. We also reported that  contractors are required to provide VBA with monthly exam status  reports, which include the number of canceled, rescheduled, and  completed exams, among other things. VBA also has an office dedicated  to completing quality reviews of contractors\u2019 exam reports, which are  used to assess contractor performance.", "VBA awarded new contracts in 2018, in part, because it wanted to update  performance measures for its contractors and to change how contractors  were assigned to each region throughout the country, according to  agency officials. For example, officials said that the agency restructured  the service areas in its contracts from five U.S. geographic districts to four  to balance the number of rural and urban areas contained in each region.  In doing so, they said that VBA\u2019s goal was to distribute exams in rural  areas, where it can be more challenging to find examiners, more evenly  across all contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Information on Quality and Timeliness Continues to Affect VBA\u2019s Oversight of Contractors\u2019 Performance", "paragraphs": ["VBA has not fully resolved issues in collecting information on contractors\u2019  quality and timeliness, which continues to hinder its ability to oversee  contractor performance. We previously reported that VBA\u2019s lack of  complete and accurate information on the quality and timeliness of exams  limited its oversight of contracted examiners and contributed to other  challenges in managing the contracts. For example, VBA officials had told  us that as of late June 2018, VBA was behind in completing quality  reviews for contracted exams that were completed in 2017, in part, due to  lack of staff to complete the quality reviews. Further, VBA officials had  acknowledged that they did not have accurate information on whether  contractors were completing veterans\u2019 exams in a timely manner as  outlined in the contracts. We reported in 2018 that VBA measured  timeliness as the number of days between the date the contractor accepts  an exam request and the date the contractor initially sends the completed  exam report to VBA. However, we previously found that the exam  management system VBA used until spring 2018 did not retain the initial  exam completion date when VBA sent an initial exam report back to a  contractor for clarification or correction. In such cases, VBA\u2019s system  maintained only the most recent date an exam report was sent back to  VBA. In such a situation, according to agency officials, VBA would not  always be able to accurately assess a contractor\u2019s timeliness as outlined  in the contracts. Similar to our findings, the VA Office of Inspector  General\u2019s June 2019 report on VBA\u2019s oversight of contracted exam  cancellations also identified deficiencies due to staffing shortages and  exam management system limitations, among other reasons.", "According to VBA officials in 2018, because VBA did not have complete  and accurate information on contractor performance, it could not carry out  key oversight activities. For example, VBA officials acknowledged that  they were unable to track exams that needed corrections or clarifications,  which we reported is needed to determine if VBA should reduce payment  to a contractor. In 2018, we reported that the contracts required that  contractors correct these exams within a certain number of days and bill  VBA for these exams at half price. However, we found that VBA\u2019s lack of  complete and reliable information on insufficient exams hindered its ability  to ensure such requirements were met.", "Further, in the absence of current and accurate quality and timeliness  information, we reported in 2018 that VBA officials told us that they had  not completed the quarterly reports that summarize how each contractor  performed. VBA\u2019s delay in completing these reports meant that it had not  administered other provisions of the contracts. For example, we reported  in 2018 that the contracts stated that VBA could use performance data to  help determine how to allocate exams within specified areas in the United  States that have two contractors; in particular, VBA could decide to  allocate more exams to the contractor with higher performance results.  However, VBA did not have performance data on which it could base its  allocation of exams. Rather, the agency based allocation on contractor  workload. Further, we reported that the contracts outlined how VBA  could use performance data to administer financial incentives linked to  performance targets. However, due to the lack of performance  information, VA had not yet administered these incentives at the time of  our review in October 2018.", "In our 2018 report, we recommended that VBA take steps to address the  oversight issues we identified by developing and implementing a plan for  using data from the new exam management system to accurately assess  contractor timeliness, monitor time spent correcting exams, and verify  proper exam invoicing.", "VBA has taken steps to address issues with both the incomplete quality  information and inaccurate timeliness data. For example, to help resolve  the delays in completing quality reviews, VBA officials said in November  2018 that the agency had hired additional staff to assess quality of  contract exam reports. As of September 2019, officials said they have 16  out of 17 full-time positions filled in the quality review office because one  employee left and that they are in the hiring phase for the final position.  With the addition of quality review staff, officials stated that VBA is up-to- date on completing initial quality reviews. However, they said the agency  has not yet finalized any quality scores, or completed the quarterly  performance reports, under the new contracts. As such, according to  VBA, it has not yet administered financial incentives linked to  performance.", "To address the inaccurate timeliness data, VBA officials stated that the  agency\u2019s new exam management system, implemented in spring 2018,  was designed to capture information that would allow VBA to accurately  calculate contractor timeliness. Officials also said that VBA revised its  performance measures to help it more fully assess contractors\u2019  performance. In its agency comment response to our draft report in  September 2018, VBA had a target completion date of December 2018  for implementing our recommendation. However, as of September 2019,  VBA reported that it has not been able to fully implement its plan for using  the new system to improve oversight of contractors and did not provide a  target completion date for fully implementing our recommendation. In  particular, VBA has not been able to implement an automated invoicing  system that it plans to use to validate the accuracy of contractors\u2019  invoices nor can it reconcile historical data in the exam management  system. As a result, according to VBA, it still cannot ensure that it is  paying contractors the correct amounts based on the terms of the  contracts. According to VBA, the delay in implementation is, in part, a  result of having to fix technical issues with exam scheduling requests and  an ongoing effort involving multiple VA offices to align VBA\u2019s systems with  those of multiple contractors. To address these issues, VBA stated that it  has completed testing of its invoice system with all of the contractors and  anticipates completing analysis of the results of those tests by October  2019 and will provide an updated target completion date at that time.", "We also recommended that VBA regularly monitor and assess aggregate  performance data and trends over time to identify higher-level trends and  program-wide challenges. Without plans to conduct comprehensive  performance analyses, we stated that VBA is limited in its ability to  determine if the contract exam program is achieving its quality and  timeliness goals in a cost effective manner. VBA stated that as it makes  improvements to its exam management system data it will be able to  implement this recommendation, but did not provide a specific date. VBA  also noted that information collected in the new exam management  system has helped them to identify potential issues with the metrics that  they use to assess contractor performance and that the agency is in the  process of identifying the best way to analyze the data to make  improvements to the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VBA Has Not Finalized System to Verify All Training Has Been Completed", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported that VBA relies on contractors to verify that their  examiners complete required VA training and that VBA did not have  information on whether the training effectively prepares examiners to  conduct high quality exams. Specifically, we noted that the contractors,  rather than VBA, access the contractor training systems to verify that  examiners have completed the required training before they are approved  to conduct exams. Further, VBA did not review contractors\u2019 self-reported  training reports for accuracy or request supporting documentation, such  as training certificates, or solicit feedback from contracted examiners on  the effectiveness of training or suggestions for improvement.", "Since VBA was without plans to verify completion of training, we noted  that VBA risked using contracted examiners who are unaware of the  agency\u2019s process for conducting exams. This could lead to poor-quality  exams that need to be redone and, thus, delays for veterans. Similarly,  without information on the effectiveness of training, VBA may not know  whether additional training courses are needed. To address these  concerns, we recommended that VBA document and implement a plan  and processes to verify that contracted examiners have completed  required training and that it collect feedback on training for the purpose of  assessing its effectiveness and making improvements as needed.", "As of July 2019, after VBA determined that none of its contractors were  comprehensive in reporting all examiners\u2019 training, VBA reported that the  agency started conducting random audits of contractor training records.  Additionally, VBA said that contractors can submit feedback following the  completion of each VBA-developed training course and that it will use this  information to make improvements. However, VBA is still in the process  of developing a centralized training system to collect information on all  training completed by contracted examiners and to obtain participant  feedback on each course. VBA stated that it expects the system updates  that would allow it to verify that all examiners have completed required  training will be fully implement by the end of fiscal year 2020 and that it  will continue random audits until full implementation.", "In conclusion, as VBA increasingly relies on contractors to perform  veterans\u2019 disability compensation exams, it is important that the agency  ensures proper oversight of these contractors. Specifically, VBA needs to  ensure that (1) it has accurate and up-to-date information on individual  contractor performance to ensure veterans receive quality and timely  exams and that contractors are properly paid, as well as a mechanism to  asses overall performance of the contract; and (2) examiners are trained  to conduct these exams in a manner that results in accurate exam reports  that claims processors can use to make a disability ratings decision.  Without sustained oversight, VBA also runs the risk of causing undue  harm to veterans through delayed or inadequate exams.", "Chair Luria, Ranking Member Bost, and Members of the Subcommittee,  this concludes my prepared statement.
