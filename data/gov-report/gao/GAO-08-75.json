VBA plans on improving some of its control mechanisms through its new claims management system, the Veterans Service Network (VETSNET), including developing the ability to track cancellations. However, VBA has no plans to include a prompt for scheduling reevaluation diary dates in VETSNET. VBA cannot effectively manage the disability reevaluation process because some of the data it collects are inconsistent and it does not systematically collect and analyze key management data.

To develop the information for this report, we  analyzed VBA workload and timeliness data and reviewed federal  regulations on disability reevaluations, VBA\u2019s written guidance and  training materials on reevaluations, and VBA\u2019s procedures for conducting  reevaluations. We discussed the procedures for ensuring that  reevaluations are conducted and the information used to manage the  reevaluation program with headquarters and regional office officials and  observed control procedures at 5 of VA\u2019s 57 regional offices. We selected  these five offices based on the number of reevaluations they completed,  the time it took to complete reevaluations, and geographic dispersion. For  more details on our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

VBA rates such disabilities by using its Schedule for Rating  Disabilities. For each type of disability, the Schedule assigns a percentage  rating that is intended to represent the average earning reduction a veteran  with that condition would experience in civilian occupations. Veterans are  assigned a single or combined (in cases of multiple disabilities) rating  ranging from 0 to 100 percent, in increments of 10 percent. Basic monthly  payments range from $115 for a 10 percent disability to $2,471 for a 100  percent disability. About 58 percent of veterans receiving disability  compensation have disabilities rated at 30 percent and lower; about 9  percent have disabilities rated at 100 percent. The most common  impairments for veterans who began receiving compensation in fiscal year  2005 were, in order, hearing impairments, diabetes, post-traumatic stress  disorder, back-related injuries, and other musculoskeletal conditions.", "VA performs disability reevaluations for disabilities required by regulation  and whenever it determines that it is likely that a disability has improved,  or if evidence indicates there has been a material change in a disability or  that the current rating may be incorrect. Federal regulations generally  instruct VA to conduct reevaluations between 2 and 5 years after any  initial or subsequent VA examination, except for disabilities where another  time period is specifically mentioned in the regulations. The latter  generally require a reexamination 6 or 12 months after the discontinuance  of treatment or hospitalization.", "The reevaluation process starts when a VBA Rating Veterans Service  Representative (RVSR) completes a disability compensation claim and  determines whether the veteran should be reevaluated at some time in the  future. RVSRs base this decision on a number of factors. The disability  reevaluation may be mandated by the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. For  example, a veteran with a 100 percent disability rating due to a heart valve  replacement is required to be reevaluated 6 months after discharge from  the hospital. Alternatively, the RVSR may determine that the severity of  the disability may change. For instance, medical evidence may suggest that  a veteran with limited range of motion will be continuing physical  rehabilitation and is expected to improve. To ensure that the disability is  reviewed in the future, the RVSR enters a diary date into VBA\u2019s claims  processing system, which later generates a reminder that the disability  needs to be reviewed. When this reminder is generated, the veteran\u2019s file is  retrieved and an RVSR performs a preliminary assessment of whether a  reevaluation should be conducted. If the RVSR determines that a  reevaluation is no longer needed, the reevaluation is cancelled. For  example, staff may cancel a reevaluation when a veteran dies or if the file  is already being reviewed by VBA following the veteran\u2019s claim that his  disability has worsened. If the RVSR determines that a reevaluation of the  disability should be conducted, the RVSR can simply review the  information in the file or, if needed, collect supplemental medical  information which can include the results of a physical examination. Once  all of the information has been analyzed, an RVSR can make a decision to  increase, decrease, or continue the current rating. Figure 1 summarizes the  disability reevaluation process.", "VBA maintains a quality assurance review program known as the  Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR) program. VBA selects  random samples of each regional office\u2019s disability compensation  decisions and assesses the regional office\u2019s accuracy in processing and  deciding such cases. For each decision, the STAR quality review unit  reviews the documentation contained in the regional office\u2019s claim file to  determine, among other things, whether the regional office complied with  the Veterans Claims Assistance Act duty-to-assist requirements for  obtaining relevant records, made correct service connection  determinations for each claimed condition, and made correct disability  rating evaluations for each condition. VBA has a fiscal year 2008  performance goal that 90 percent of compensation decisions contain no  errors that could affect decision outcomes; its long-term strategic goal is  98 percent. In addition to STAR, regional offices conduct their own local  quality assurance reviews.

Since VBA randomly selects claims for review from the  total number of disability decisions, it is not likely that VBA will review  many reevaluations. Similarly, each regional office\u2019s quality assurance  review would not likely select many reevaluation claims. Specifically, the  local quality assurance guidance calls for reviewing a random selection of  an average of five claims for each RVSR per month. Disability  reevaluations are part of the sample, but since they are a small portion of  the total caseload, they have a low likelihood of being selected.

Regional office staff stated that such information on the  disability reevaluation process could be useful in aiding their daily  decision making on which disabilities to reevaluate and when to schedule  them. Having such historical data could also aid VBA in workload  management decisions. For example, in January 2002, as a temporary  effort to free up staff for processing its backlog of disability compensation  and pension claims, VBA postponed most of their currently scheduled  reevaluations for 2 years. VBA made this decision without historical data  on the extent to which reevaluations affect the benefit levels of disabilities  and lost an opportunity to target only those cases likely to result in a  change in status. As such, VBA did not know the potential number of  veterans it could be over- or under-compensating for the 2 years the  reevaluations were postponed.

Inadequate management controls could result in some veterans  being under-compensated for conditions that have worsened or over- compensated for conditions that have improved. VBA is improving some  of its operational controls over reevaluations. For example, through its  VETSNET system VBA plans to track the number and reasons for  cancellations. However, without a system to remind staff to schedule  disability reevaluation diary dates or a system that automatically  schedules diary dates for all claims that require reevaluation, staff could  inadvertently fail to enter diary dates, and reevaluations may not be  scheduled and performed as needed. Meanwhile, measuring regional office  performance requires reliable performance data. VBA cannot adequately  measure how long it actually takes regional offices to complete disability  reevaluations since offices use different starting points for measuring  timeliness. For offices that start measuring their timeliness after the claim  review has been started, the measurement can result in undercounting the  total amount of time to complete a disability reevaluation. Also, without  reliable performance data, VBA cannot accurately evaluate regional office  timeliness or compare regional offices\u2019 performance. Therefore, VBA  cannot reward good performance and take actions to improve lagging  performance. In addition, without data on the results of reevaluations,  VBA cannot ensure that it is prioritizing its resources to reevaluate those  veterans whose disabilities are likely to change, and that it is reevaluating  those disabilities at the appropriate point in time. Moving in this direction  becomes increasingly more important given Operation Enduring Freedom  and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Outcome data on the reevaluation process  could be used to target certain disabilities in the future. For example, if  VBA found that reevaluating a certain disability never resulted in a change  in the rating level, then it could consider not reevaluating that disability in  the future. In addition, data on the timing of reevaluations could also be  used strategically to refine when disabilities are reevaluated. For example,  some regional offices may be scheduling reevaluations for 2 years into the  future for a particular disability, whereas other regional offices may be  using a 3-year time period. This information could be combined with the  outcomes of such reevaluations to refine guidance and training on  scheduling reevaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  direct the Under Secretary for Benefits to take the following five actions to  enhance VBA\u2019s disability reevaluation process:    VA should modify its electronic claims processing system so that a  rating decision cannot be completed without staff completing the diary  date field.", "VA should modify its electronic claims processing system to ensure  that a diary date is automatically generated by the system for all  disabilities where a reevaluation is required by VA\u2019s Schedule for  Rating Disabilities.", "VBA should include cancelled reevaluations in its quality assurance  reviews and should evaluate the feasibility of periodically sampling a  larger number of completed disability reevaluations for quality  assurance review.", "VBA should clarify its guidance so that all regional offices consistently  use the date they are notified of a matured diary date as the starting  point for measuring timeliness.", "VBA should develop a plan to collect and analyze data on the results of  disability reevaluations.
