Overseen by State, the organizations that operate RSCs hire staff to process and prescreen applicants who have been referred for resettlement consideration. According to State and RSC officials, RSCs have experienced staff fraud. Officials said that instances of staff fraud are uncommon, but they illustrate risks to the integrity of RSC operations. To manage these risks, State and RSCs have established a number of activities consistent with leading antifraud practices. For example, officials from all nine RSCs stated that they assign staff fraud risk management responsibilities to designated individuals. State has also worked with RSCs to develop and implement controls to ensure program integrity. However, RSCs face challenges implementing some of these controls. Additionally, State has not required RSCs to conduct regular staff fraud risk assessments tailored to each RSC or examined the suitability of related control activities.

In fiscal year 2016, the United States admitted nearly 85,000  refugees for resettlement, the largest yearly number in more than 15  years. The Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau of Population, Refugees,  and Migration (PRM) manages the process by which refugees seek to be  resettled in the United States, which is known as the United States  Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). State works with the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (USCIS), which has responsibility for adjudicating  applications from these individuals. State receives applications and  referrals for refugee resettlement from a variety of sources, with most  coming from UNHCR. Both State and USCIS coordinate with nine  Resettlement Support Centers (RSC) worldwide to manage referrals and  applications to USRAP, collect information on each refugee applicant,  and prepare approved refugee applicants for resettlement to the United  States.

We  also conducted interviews with UNHCR and State officials in Washington,  D.C.; UNHCR headquarters offices in Geneva, Switzerland, and  Copenhagen, Denmark; and UNHCR field offices in El Salvador, Jordan,  and Kenya. We also met with State and RSC officials in Austria, El  Salvador, Jordan, and Kenya. We traveled to these locations between  May 2016 and September 2016 and selected them to observe diverse  types of refugee populations and several different types of UNHCR  referrals. For the purposes of this report, we define \u201cprogram integrity\u201d as  the extent to which the resettlement referral process is free from fraud,  waste, and abuse by both staff and applicants. An important component  of program integrity is to combat fraud in the UNHCR resettlement referral  process. In this report, we define fraud as including any attempt to (1)  gain financial benefit as a staff member of UNHCR or one of its  contractors through inappropriate means or (2) gain access to the  program by an applicant through providing false information or other  inappropriate means. We describe how State and UNHCR work together  to ensure program integrity in the resettlement referral process and report  on measures put in place by State and UNHCR, but determining the  effectiveness of these measures was beyond the scope of our review.", "To examine the extent to which State and RSCs follow leading practices  to reduce the risk of fraud committed by RSC staff, we took a number of  steps. First, we reviewed RSC SOPs and guidance documents from  State, IOM, and various NGOs. We evaluated the staff fraud risk  management activities conducted by State and RSCs by comparing  antifraud activities reported by RSCs with the leading practices  encompassed in GAO\u2019s A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in  Federal Programs (the Fraud Risk Framework). For the purposes of this  report, we reviewed documentation and spoke with State and RSC  officials about instances of fraud committed by staff at RSCs, including  malfeasance and collusion. To assess the controls PRM has in place to  monitor RSCs, we reviewed RSC cooperative agreements, recent  monitoring reports PRM completed for 8 of the 9 RSCs, questionnaires  completed by six RSC directors in advance of monitoring visits, and fiscal  year 2015 quarterly reports that RSCs submitted to PRM. We also  interviewed officials from IOM and various NGOs. We spoke with officials  at all nine RSCs, including during visits to RSCs in Austria, Jordan,  Kenya, and the RSC Latin America suboffice in El Salvador. Observations  from our site visits are not generalizable to all RSCs but provide  illustrative examples and apply to the USRAP program through fiscal year  2016.", "Second, to analyze the extent to which RSCs reported compliance with  the 72 required control activities listed in State\u2019s USRAP Program  Integrity Guidelines (see app. I), we examined the most recent Internal  Malfeasance Prevention and Mitigation Measures and Actions report  submitted to State by all nine RSCs. For each required measure, RSCs  report the actions taken to comply with the measure. If an RSC reported  an action that met the measure required by State, we determined the  RSC to have reported compliance. If an RSC (a) reported an action that  met some, but not all, of the parts of the required measure; (b) reported  progress toward compliance but had not yet fully complied with the  required measure; (c) reported an action that did not meet any parts of  the required measure; or (d) did not report actions related to a measure,  we determined that the RSC did not report compliance. While we  analyzed RSC reporting on these actions, we did not independently verify  all of the information contained in the reports. When possible, we did  verify certain information reported by RSCs, such as confirming during  our visits to RSC offices that required signage was displayed.", "Third, we assessed whether RSC staff fraud risk assessments were  conducted at regular intervals or when the program experienced changes  and were tailored to RSC operations. We determined staff fraud risk  assessments to be conducted at regular intervals or when the program  experienced changes if RSCs reported conducting such an assessment  more than once. We determined that RSCs had not conducted staff fraud  risk assessments at regular intervals or when the program experienced  changes, if RSC officials reported that they had not conducted a staff  fraud risk assessment or if they reported they had conducted such an  assessment but had not done so more than once. If RSCs completed  staff fraud risk assessments, we examined whether those assessments  were tailored to RSC operations. We determined staff fraud risk  assessments to be tailored if RSCs reported that they had conducted a  risk assessment since October 2014 and assessments examined risks  specific to individual RSC operations. If a staff fraud risk assessment was  conducted, but RSC officials reported that it did not examine the risks  specific to RSCs individually, we determined the risk assessment was not  tailored to RSC operations.", "In the background of this report, we report on the number of refugees  globally at the end of 2015, identify the number and nationality of  refugees referred to USRAP by UNHCR from fiscal year 2011 through  June 2016, and describe the process of classification as a refugee by the  United States. To do so, we analyzed data on global refugee populations  from UNHCR\u2019s 2015 Global Trends Report. We also analyzed record- level data on all refugee applications to the United States from the State  system that serves as a repository of application information and tracks  the status of all individual refugee applications to USRAP\u2014the Worldwide  Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS). The data we  reviewed from WRAPS include information on all refugee applications  made from fiscal year 2011 through June 2016. We assessed the  reliability of RSCs\u2019 data on refugees, for example, by reviewing the  information for missing data or obvious errors and interviewing State  officials responsible for ensuring data quality. We determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. The data we  included regarding the staffing levels at all nine RSCs were provided by  State. In most cases, we used the data State reported for the number of  full-time staff equivalents in fiscal year 2016.

The  1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   defines a refugee as someone who, as a result of events occurring before  January 1, 1951 and owing to a \u201cwell-founded fear of being persecuted  for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social  group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is  unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection  of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the  country of his former habitual residence, as a result of such events, is  unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\u201d The 1967  Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees expanded the definition of  refugee to include all refugees covered by the definition in the 1951  Convention with no date or geographic limitation. Over time, UNHCR\u2019s  mandate has expanded beyond providing protection and humanitarian  assistance, and seeking, together with governments, durable solutions for  refugees, to include asylum-seekers, stateless persons, returnees, and in  certain circumstances, internally displaced persons. UNHCR has over  10,000 staff located at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland;  Budapest, Hungary; Copenhagen, Denmark; and in field offices in more  than 128 countries.", "UNHCR\u2019s mandate, as established by the United Nations General  Assembly, is the provision of international protection, material assistance,  and durable solutions to refugees and other persons of concern.  According to UNHCR, registration is a key tool for providing protection to  refugees. Registration in the refugee protection context is the recording,  verifying, and updating of information on asylum-seekers, refugees, and  other persons of concern to UNHCR. Registration is the first step in  formalizing the protection relationship between the individual seeking  protection and the host government in the country of asylum, UNHCR, or  both. UNHCR uses registration as a tool to assist in determining which  types of assistance and protection are most appropriate.", "UNHCR also uses Refugee Status Determination (RSD), which it  describes as the legal or administrative process by which governments or  UNHCR determine whether an asylum-seeker meets the definition of a  refugee under international, regional, or national law. This determination  involves one or more interviews by trained government officials in the  country of asylum or by trained UNHCR RSD staff. RSD and registration  are distinct processes, although data recorded during the individual\u2019s  registration as an asylum-seeker may be drawn upon and confirmed  during RSD. If an asylum-seeker is determined to be a refugee, his or her  registration will be updated from asylum-seeker to refugee, or if there was  no prior registration, the refugee will be registered as such. In the majority  of its operations, UNHCR records identity data in UNHCR\u2019s database and  case management system, the Profile Global Registration System  (ProGres).", "UNHCR promotes and provides both legal and physical protection, and  also provides for basic needs including food, water, shelter, and medical  care in response to refugee crises worldwide. According to UNHCR,  registration is a fundamental component of UNHCR\u2019s protection activities.  For instance, during registration, the organization collects information on  the numbers of refugees and their specific characteristics, such as family  composition or special health needs, which assists it in determining the  type of assistance that an individual refugee or families may initially  require. Information on registered refugee populations is also used by the  organization to help determine the amount and types of assistance that  specific regions may need. Registration is described by UNHCR as an  ongoing process that includes inputting refugees\u2019 biographic and  biometric information into databases and case management systems and  updating it. UNHCR uses ProGres to log and maintain biographic  information such as names and family information, and uses the  Biometric Identity Management System (BIMS) and IrisGuard to collect  and store biometric information such as iris scans and fingerprints.", "UNHCR reports that the number of refugees registered with the  organization worldwide has grown significantly in recent years. For  instance, the total number of refugees was estimated to be approximately  21.3 million by the end of 2015, approximately 1.7 million more than the  total reported at the end of 2014. This number includes 4.9 million  refugees from Syria, 2.7 million from Afghanistan, and 1.1 million from  Somalia. See figure 1 for the number of UNHCR-registered refugees by  country of origin as of December 31, 2015.", "In addition to providing protection and humanitarian assistance to  refugees and other persons of concern, UNHCR is mandated to work with  governments to provide \u201cdurable solutions\u201d to those individuals so that  they may transition out of refugee status and rebuild their lives. The three  durable solutions that UNHCR facilitates include (1) voluntary repatriation  to a refugee\u2019s home country, (2) integration within the country in which  they are currently located, and (3) resettlement to a third country. For  instance, a refugee may decide to permanently return to his or her home  country, with the support of UNHCR and that country, once the crisis that  prompted his or her flight ends. Alternatively, refugees unable to safely  repatriate to their home country may in certain cases, with the help of  UNHCR, acquire permanent legal status with rights such as citizenship in  their country of asylum, which UNHCR reports approximately 1.1 million  refugees have done over the past decade. However, if neither repatriation  nor local integration is available or appropriate, UNHCR may consider  submitting a refugee\u2019s case to a third country for resettlement  consideration. UNHCR refers refugees for resettlement consideration to  various countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada,  Denmark, and the United Kingdom, among others. Refugees can be  referred for resettlement consideration by UNHCR only if they meet  UNHCR\u2019s preconditions for resettlement consideration and fall under one  or more of the resettlement submission categories.", "To assess refugees\u2019 eligibility for resettlement referrals, UNHCR officials  conduct interviews with refugees to obtain their basic biographic  information, assess evidence of past or feared persecution, and  determine eligibility for all other solutions that might be available to them.

UNHCR has several offices that are  responsible for overseeing antifraud activities, in addition to providing  audit services, investigating instances of fraud, and conducting broad  reviews of country-level operations. The United Nations Office of Internal  Oversight Services and the Board of Auditors conduct regular reviews of  UNHCR and audit its financial statements, respectively.

For example, the board\u2019s annual reports track previous  recommendations, many of which focus on ensuring financial  accountability, conducting fraud risk assessments, and establishing  regular performance reporting mechanisms, among other things.", "UNHCR also has an Inspector General\u2019s office that investigates  allegations of staff misconduct and assigns responsibility to its  headquarters, Nairobi, or Bangkok staff to conduct investigations. In  2015, the Inspector General\u2019s Investigative Office opened 88  investigations, including 21 investigations related to fraud complaints. Of  those 21 fraud investigations, 7 were related to the refugee status  determination or resettlement processes. According to UNHCR officials,  fraud committed by persons of concern is investigated locally, and local  management can open an investigation and decide sanctions if applicant  fraud is established.", "In addition, according to UNHCR officials, between 2014 and 2016, the  organization sent as many as 10 teams to conduct reviews of field office  operations, including registration, protection, and resettlement. Although  the composition of these teams varies depending on the field operation  being visited, they usually include officials responsible for reviewing  registration, RSD, resettlement, interactions with the regional bureau, and  other things. According to UNHCR officials, these visits have resulted in  strengthening refugee protection and resettlement operations. For  example, in response to alleged instances of fraud at UNHCR\u2019s activities  in an Asian country, the organization undertook two visits in 2016 to  investigate and respond. First, UNHCR\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s office  visited to investigate potential staff fraud but determined that while certain  procedures may not have been followed, staff fraud was not established.  Later, UNHCR sent a team to review how the operations there could be  strengthened throughout the registration, protection, and resettlement  processes.

UNHCR  headquarters also issued baseline SOPs on resettlement, which provide  a template for local field offices to complete and adapt for local situations.  The resettlement SOPs vary by country and refugee population but,  according to UNHCR officials, they adhere to these baseline  requirements. Despite the complexity and regional variations in its  refugee registration, refugee status determination, and resettlement  referral processes, UNHCR officials said that standardizing procedures  ensures that the organization has established basic antifraud practices  worldwide.

However, State and managers from the other three RSCs reported  instances of staff fraud or malfeasance in recent years, including the  following:  In 2013, an RSC reported a significant case of staff fraud, resulting in  the termination of two staff members. According to State and RSC  officials, two RSC staff promised to expedite applicant cases in  exchange for money. Although the staff were actually unable to  influence the outcome of the applicants\u2019 cases, the illusion of  expediting the process in exchange for money allowed the extortion to  take place. After an investigation by State\u2019s local Regional Security  Officer, the RSC terminated the two staff members and all individuals  involved were arrested. In response, State undertook new antifraud  initiatives, such as the creation of new antifraud guidelines for RSCs  and commissioning an evaluation of risks posed by staff fraud.", "In 2014, while conducting interviews in the field, officials discovered  three interpreters soliciting money from applicants, according to State  officials. These officials said that the RSC identified the three  interpreters and discovered that they had a record of misconduct with  local police. The RSC terminated the interpreters and barred them  from any future employment with the RSC. Since the incident, State  officials said that the RSC has maintained a list of interpreters who  are barred from providing services for the RSC.", "In 2016, another RSC discovered that a staff member connected a  personal thumb drive to an RSC laptop without approval with the  intention of accessing applicants\u2019 files. The RSC reported the activity  to State and the organization that manages the RSC. In coordination  with State, RSC officials contracted with a private firm to conduct a  forensic analysis of any potentially compromised information. The  analysis determined that the staff member had attempted but failed to  access any information and subsequently, the staff member was  terminated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and RSCs Have Taken Steps to Combat Staff Fraud but Have Not Followed Some Leading Practices", "paragraphs": ["To address instances of fraud committed by staff at RSCs, State and  RSCs report instituting a number of antifraud activities, many of which  correspond with leading practices identified in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework.

The framework includes practices such as implementing  activities that demonstrate an antifraud culture, designing and applying  control activities to address fraud risks, monitoring the application of fraud  controls, and conducting regular fraud risk assessments.

The  Fraud Risk Framework identifies the involvement of all levels of an  organization in setting an antifraud tone as a leading practice for fraud  risk management. Management at every RSC said that all RSC staff had  the responsibility to combat staff fraud. For example, management at all  eight RSCs operated by IOM or NGOs reported that they had required  their staff to review and sign their organization\u2019s code of conduct  annually. Furthermore, managers at all nine RSCs said that they had  required their staff to attend annual antifraud training and reported to  State that RSC staff had complied with these measures.", "Additionally, State and RSCs have created organizational structures to  combat staff fraud by assigning specific staff the responsibility of  overseeing staff fraud risk management activities, a leading practice  highlighted in the Fraud Risk Framework. All nine RSCs stated that they  had assigned staff fraud risk management responsibilities to specific staff  members. Individual RSCs have varied in how they assign these  responsibilities. For instance, while RSC Africa, RSC Middle East and  North Africa, and RSC Turkey and Middle East reported having positions  dedicated to leading their fraud risk management activities, RSCs Austria,  Cuba, and East Asia have assigned overseeing fraud risk management  activities as a duty of their respective RSC directors. The three  remaining RSCs operated by IOM\u2014including RSCs Eurasia, Latin  America, and South Asia\u2014stated that staff had been assigned to oversee  fraud risk management responsibilities at each of them.

For example, State reported that it had hosted an annual  resettlement workshop, attended by RSC directors and UNHCR staff.  State also reported that RSC staff attend region-specific meetings to  share fraud risk management information. According to RSC Middle East  and North Africa reporting, they have held similar fraud-focused quarterly  meetings attended by representatives from State and UNHCR. In addition  to attending organized conferences and meetings, management at RSCs  stated that they had shared fraud-related information as it arose. When  an RSC experiences an instance of staff fraud, State requires the RSC to  report the fraud to State. According to RSC officials, depending on the  RSC\u2019s operating organization, the RSC may also report the staff fraud to  its headquarters, inspector general, partner organizations, or ethics office.", "Another leading practice in the Fraud Risk Framework is the development  of specific control activities to prevent and detect fraud. State officials  identified two key guidance documents containing control activities: RSC  SOPs and the Program Integrity Guidelines. First, according to State  officials, State provides guidance to RSCs on developing SOPs that  include staff fraud risk controls. For example, State requires RSCs to  record the names of staff and interpreters who interact with applicants  during prescreening interviews into WRAPS in order to mitigate fraud risk.  According to State and RSC officials, although each RSC has used  State\u2019s guidance as a template, RSCs may incorporate additional  procedures, including program integrity activities, based on their specific  operational environment, such as size, complexity, location, or applicant  population.", "Second, in response to the staff fraud incident in 2013 that resulted in the  termination of two RSC staff, State developed and provided RSCs with a  list of 87 measures designed to prevent and mitigate staff fraud at RSCs,  known as the Program Integrity Guidelines. Of the 87 measures, State  requires 72 and recommends the remaining 15. These measures include  control activities addressing issues such as background checks,  interpreter assignment, antifraud training, office layout, case file reviews,  electronic data management, and reporting and responding to instances  of suspected fraud. For example, State\u2019s Program Integrity Guidelines  have required RSCs to establish physical drop boxes or e-mail addresses  to allow applicants to report instances of suspected staff fraud, as well as  whistleblower policies for other staff to inform RSC management of  suspected staff fraud. State has also required RSCs to include signage  that indicates that the admissions process is free and instructions on how  to report fraud. See figure 3 for examples of such RSC antifraud signage.  Each RSC that we visited displayed similar signage in interview rooms,  hallways, or applicant waiting areas.", "Consistent with another leading practice identified in the Fraud Risk  Framework, State and RSCs also reported that they had implemented  control activities designed to prevent and detect staff fraud; however,  some gaps remain. State works with RSCs to implement the control  activities identified in the Program Integrity Guidelines to mitigate staff  fraud risks. RSCs report their compliance with the Program Integrity  Guidelines to State via annual RSC Internal Malfeasance Prevention and  Mitigation: Measures and Actions reports. For each measure listed in the  Program Integrity Guidelines, RSCs report the actions they have taken to  comply.", "State required RSCs to comply with the original Program Integrity  Guidelines by October 2014.

State officials told  us that they work to ensure that each RSC complies with all required  controls in the Program Integrity Guidelines. If an RSC reports that it does  not yet fully comply with a measure listed in the Program Integrity  Guidelines, State expects the RSC to report its progress toward  compliance to State.

For State\u2019s monitoring of RSC  antifraud activities, program officers and refugee coordinators have  served as the primary liaison between their assigned region\u2019s RSCs and  State. According to State officials, its program officers have conducted  monitoring of RSCs through frequent communication, program reports,  and annual monitoring visits. State officials said that program officers  have communicated with RSC management frequently via telephone and  e-mail to conduct administrative functions, provide updates to State  guidance, and address issues, including those related to staff fraud.", "Program officers also have reviewed program reports submitted by RSCs,  which include a section that describes instances of suspected staff fraud  from the previous quarter, if any, and updates to staff fraud risk  management activities. For example, one RSC reported that, as an  antifraud measure, it had prohibited staff from using their personal  smartphones at worksites and issued staff cellphones without cameras or  Internet capability. State also assigns to local U.S. embassies refugee  coordinators who monitor RSC staff fraud risk management activities  through frequent interaction with RSC staff. According to State officials,  during visits to RSCs, refugee coordinators have provided additional  monitoring of RSC staff fraud risk management activities by checking  compliance with State\u2019s Program Integrity Guidelines and receiving  notification of and addressing reported instances of staff fraud.", "Additionally, IOM and NGOs have reported conducting annual monitoring  visits of the RSCs that they operate. State has required the operating  organization of each RSC to \u201cconduct annual monitoring that includes  fraud vulnerabilities\u201d and submit the results of the monitoring visits to  State. All four RSCs operated by IOM and all four RSCs operated by  various NGOs reported that their respective operating organizations  conducted such monitoring visits. For example, when one operating  organization conducted a monitoring visit to an RSC in 2015, it  recommended that the RSC should program its computers to lock after 5  minutes of inactivity, as required by the Program Integrity Guidelines.", "According to State officials, State program officers are also expected to  conduct annual monitoring visits and create monitoring reports to check  RSC compliance with State\u2019s RSC SOPs and Program Integrity  Guidelines. According to these monitoring reports, program officers  observe day-to-day operations at RSCs during the monitoring visits. For  instance, program officers report that they have observed RSC  caseworkers conducting prescreening interviews of applicants. Upon  concluding the annual monitoring visits, program officers are to complete  written monitoring reports including a section that assesses RSC  compliance with the Program Integrity Guidelines and makes  recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities for staff fraud. For example,  the completed monitoring report for one RSC recommended upgrading  the locks for its file library to an electronic system enabled by iris or  fingerprint scan as a step to mitigate vulnerabilities of staff fraud. Further,  program officers also have administered questionnaires to RSC directors  and caseworkers to gather feedback on RSC procedures. In these  questionnaires, State has asked RSC directors to comment on RSC  procedures concerning hiring and training new staff.

State officials told  us that not all RSCs had conducted staff fraud risk assessments because  State\u2019s Program Integrity Guidelines recommend but do not require these  assessments. Without State requiring RSCs to conduct regular staff fraud  risk assessments tailored to their specific operations, staff fraud risk  assessments conducted by individual RSCs have varied. While officials  from six of the nine RSCs stated that they had completed some form of  staff fraud risk assessment, officials from four of them stated that they  had done so only once. Additionally, only two of the nine RSCs have  conducted staff fraud risk assessments specifically tailored to their  operations. Further, State and most RSCs have not examined the  suitability of existing fraud controls, another recommended leading  practice in the Fraud Risk Framework. For example, while one RSC has  regularly assessed the suitability of its existing staff fraud controls by  conducting regular staff fraud risk assessments that examine the  likelihood and impact of potential fraudulent activity and related fraud  controls, the remaining eight RSCs have not done so.

According  to this report, refugees may become more susceptible to participating in  acts of staff fraud as they become more desperate to reach another  country. As the number of refugees accepted varies each year by RSC,  internal control systems may need to be changed to respond to the  potential increased fraud risk. Moreover, as described earlier, individual  RSCs face challenges complying with some of the existing fraud controls  outlined in the Program Integrity Guidelines.

One of these activities is  designing and implementing antifraud controls. For instance, State has  required that RSCs comply with 72 staff fraud control measures. While  RSCs have complied with most of these measures, persistent gaps  remain. Pursuing efforts to ensure RSC compliance with these controls is  essential to reducing the risks of staff fraud.", "Additionally, some RSCs have not conducted regular risk assessments  tailored to their operations or examined the suitability of existing fraud  controls.
