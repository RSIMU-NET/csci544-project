The  benefits have been enormous. Vast amounts of information are now  literally at our fingertips, facilitating research on virtually every topic  imaginable; financial and other business transactions can be executed  almost instantaneously, often 24 hours a day, and electronic mail, Internet  Web sites, and computer bulletin boards allow us to communicate quickly  and easily with an unlimited number of individuals and groups.", "However, this widespread interconnectivity poses significant risks to the  government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer systems and, more important, to  the critical operations and infrastructures they support. For example,  telecommunications, power distribution systems, water supplies, public  health services, national defense (including the military\u2019s warfighting  capability), law enforcement, government services, and emergency  services all depend on the security of their computer operations. If they  are not properly controlled, the speed and accessibility that create the  enormous benefits of the computer age may allow individuals and  organizations to eavesdrop on or interfere with these operations from  remote locations for mischievous or malicious purposes, including fraud  or sabotage. Table 1 summarizes the key threats to our nation\u2019s  infrastructures, as observed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).", "Government officials remain concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, foreign  intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI, terrorists,  transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly becoming  aware of and using information exploitation tools such as computer  viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping sniffers  that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access to  data. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a significant  threat, because these individuals often have knowledge about the  organization and its system that allows them to gain unrestricted access  and inflict damage or steal assets without knowing a great deal about  computer intrusions. As larger amounts of money and more sensitive  economic and commercial information are exchanged electronically, and  as the nation\u2019s defense and intelligence communities increasingly rely on  standardized information technology (IT), the likelihood increases that  information attacks will threaten vital national interests.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more  intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively  easy to use. A hacker can download tools from the Internet and literally  \u201cpoint and click\u201d to start an attack. Experts agree that there has been a  steady advance in the level of sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  that have been discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise  computers, and share them with other attackers. In addition, they can  combine these attacks with other forms of technology to develop  programs that automatically scan networks for vulnerable systems, attack  them, compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further.", "From 1995 through 2003, the CERT\uf8e8 Coordination Center (CERT/CC)  reported 12,946 security vulnerabilities that resulted from software flaws.  Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic growth in security vulnerabilities over  these years. The growing number of known vulnerabilities increases the  potential for attacks by the hacker community. Attacks can be launched  against specific targets or widely distributed through viruses and worms.", "Along with these increasing vulnerabilities, the number of computer  security incidents reported to CERT/CC has also risen dramatically\u2014from  9,859 in 1999 to 82,094 in 2002 and to 137,529 in 2003. And these are only  the reported attacks. The Director of the CERT Centers has estimated that  as much as 80 percent of actual security incidents goes unreported, in  most cases because (1) there were no indications of penetration or attack,  (2) the organization was unable to recognize that its systems had been  penetrated, or (3) the organization was reluctant to report. Figure 2 shows  the number of incidents that were reported to the CERT/CC from 1995  through 2003.", "According to the National Security Agency (NSA), foreign governments  already have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  methods to attack these systems. The National Infrastructure Protection  Center (NIPC) reported in January 2002 that a computer belonging to an  individual who had indirect links to Osama bin Laden contained computer  programs that indicated that the individual was interested in the structural  engineering of dams and other water-retaining structures. The NIPC report  also stated that U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies had  received indications that Al Qaeda members had sought information about  control systems from multiple Web sites, specifically on water supply and  wastewater management practices in the United States and abroad.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, warnings of the potential  for terrorist cyber attacks against our critical infrastructures have  increased. For example, in his February 2002 statement for the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence, the Director of Central Intelligence  discussed the possibility of a cyber warfare attack by terrorists. He stated  that the September 11 attacks demonstrated the nation\u2019s dependence on  critical infrastructure systems that rely on electronic and computer  networks. Further, he noted that attacks of this nature would become an  increasingly viable option for terrorists as they and other foreign  adversaries become more familiar with these targets and the technologies  required to attack them. James Woolsey, a former Director of Central  Intelligence, shares this concern, and on October 29, 2003, in a speech  before several hundred security experts, he warned that the nation should  be prepared for continued terrorist attacks on our critical infrastructures.  Moreover, a group of concerned scientists warned President Bush in a  letter that \u201cthe critical infrastructure of the United States, including  electrical power, finance, telecommunications, health care, transportation,  water, defense and the Internet, is highly vulnerable to cyber attack. Fast  and resolute mitigating action is needed to avoid national disaster.\u201d  According to a study by a computer security organization, during the  second half of 2003, critical infrastructure industries such as power,  energy, and financial services experienced high attack rates. Further, a  study that surveyed over 170 security professionals and other executives  concluded that, across industries, respondents believe that a large-scale  cyber attack in the United States will be launched against their industry by  mid-2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Control Systems?", "paragraphs": ["Control systems are computer-based systems that are used within many  infrastructures and industries to monitor and control sensitive processes  and physical functions. Typically, control systems collect sensor  measurements and operational data from the field, process and display  this information, and relay control commands to local or remote  equipment. In the electric power industry, control systems can manage  and control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric  power\u2014 for example, by opening and closing circuit breakers and setting  thresholds for preventive shutdowns. Employing integrated control  systems, the oil and gas industry can control the refining operations at a  plant site, remotely monitor the pressure and flow of gas pipelines, and  control the flow and pathways of gas transmission. Water utilities can  remotely monitor well levels and control the wells\u2019 pumps; monitor flows,  tank levels, or pressure in storage tanks; monitor water quality  characteristics\u2014such as pH, turbidity, and chlorine residual; and control  the addition of chemicals. Control systems also are used in manufacturing  and chemical processing. Control systems perform functions that vary  from simple to complex; they can be used simply to monitor processes\u2014 for example, the environmental conditions in a small office building\u2014or to  manage most activities in a municipal water system or even a nuclear  power plant.", "In certain industries, such as chemical and power generation, safety  systems are typically implemented in order to mitigate a potentially  disastrous event if control and other systems should fail. In addition, to  guard against both physical attack and system failure, organizations may  establish backup control centers that include uninterruptible power  supplies and backup generators.", "There are two primary types of control systems. Distributed Control  Systems (DCS) typically are used within a single processing or generating  plant or over a small geographic area. Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA) systems typically are used for large, geographically  dispersed distribution operations. For example, a utility company may use  a DCS to generate power and a SCADA system to distribute it. Figure 3  illustrates the typical components of a control system.", "A control system typically is made up of a \u201cmaster\u201d or central supervisory  control and monitoring station consisting of one or more human-machine  interfaces where an operator can view status information about the  remote/local sites and issue commands directly to the system. Typically,  this station is located at a main site, along with application servers and an  engineering workstation that is used to configure and troubleshoot the  other components of the control system. The supervisory control and  monitoring station typically is connected to local controller stations  through a hard-wired network or to a remote controller station through a  communications network\u2014which could be the Internet, a public switched  telephone network, or a cable or wireless (e.g., radio, microwave, or   Wi-Fi) network. Each controller station has a remote terminal unit (RTU),  a programmable logic controller (PLC), or some other controller that  communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring station.", "The control system also includes sensors and control equipment that  connect directly with the working components of the infrastructure\u2014for  example, pipelines, water towers, or power lines. The sensor takes  readings from the infrastructure equipment\u2014such as water or pressure  levels, electrical voltage or current\u2014and sends a message to the  controller. The controller may be programmed to determine a course of  action and send a message to the control equipment instructing it what to  do\u2014for example, to turn off a valve or dispense a chemical. If the  controller is not programmed to determine a course of action, the  controller communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring  station and relays instructions back to the control equipment. The control  system also can be programmed to issue alarms to the operator when  certain conditions are detected. Handheld devices, such as personal digital  assistants, can be used to locally monitor controller stations. Experts  report that technologies in controller stations are becoming more  intelligent and automated and are able to communicate with the  supervisory central monitoring and control station less frequently, thus  requiring less human intervention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Control Systems Are at Increasing Risk", "paragraphs": ["Historically, security concerns about control have been related primarily  to protecting them against physical attack and preventing the misuse of  refining and processing sites or distribution and holding facilities.

These widely-used, standardized  technologies have commonly known vulnerabilities, and sophisticated and  effective exploitation tools are widely available and relatively easy to use.  As a consequence, both the number of people with the knowledge to wage  attacks and the number of systems subject to attack have increased.

Cyber threats could come from numerous sources  ranging from hostile governments and terrorist groups to disgruntled  employees and other malicious intruders. Based on interviews and  discussions with representatives from throughout the electric power  industry, the Information Assurance Task Force of the National Security  Telecommunications Advisory Committee concluded that an organization  with sufficient resources, such as a foreign intelligence service or a well- supported terrorist group, could conduct a structured attack on the  electric power grid electronically, with a high degree of anonymity, and  without having to set foot in the target nation.", "In July 2002, NIPC reported that the potential for compound cyber and  physical attacks, referred to as \u201cswarming attacks,\u201d was an emerging  threat to the critical infrastructure of the United States. As NIPC reports,  the effects of a swarming attack include slowing or complicating the  response to a physical attack.

Using war dialers to find modems connected to the  programmable circuit breakers of the electric power control system,  hackers could crack passwords that control access to the circuit breakers  and could change the control settings to cause local power outages and  even damage equipment. A hacker could lower settings from, for example,  500 amperes to 200 on some circuit breakers; normal power usage would  then activate, or \u201ctrip,\u201d the circuit breakers, taking those lines out of  service and diverting power to neighboring lines. If, at the same time, the  hacker raised the settings on these neighboring lines to 900 amperes,  circuit breakers would fail to trip at these high settings, and the diverted  power would overload the lines and cause significant damage to  transformers and other critical equipment. The damaged equipment would  require major repairs that could result in lengthy outages.", "Control system researchers at DOE\u2019s national laboratories have developed  systems that demonstrate the feasibility of a cyber attack on a control  system at an electric power substation where high-voltage electricity is  transformed for local use.

Consequently, vendor-provided software patches may be  either incompatible with the customized version of the operating system  or difficult to implement without compromising service by shutting down  \u201calways-on\u201d systems or affecting interdependent operations. Another  constraint on deploying patches is that support agreements with control  system vendors often require the vendor\u2019s approval before the user can  install patches. If a patch is installed in violation of the support agreement,  the vendor will not take responsibility for potential impacts on the  operations of the system. Moreover, because a control system vendor  often requires that it be the sole provider of patches, if the vendor delays  in providing patches, systems remain vulnerable without recourse.", "Information security organizations have noted that a gap exists between  currently available security technologies and the need for additional  research and development to secure control systems. Research and  development in a wide range of areas could lead to more effective  technologies. For example, although technologies such as robust firewalls  and strong authentication can be employed to better segment control  systems from external networks, research and development could help to  address the application of security technologies to the control systems  themselves.

Upgrading all the components of a control system can be a  lengthy process, and the enhanced security features of newly installed  technologies\u2014such as their ability to interpret encrypted messages\u2014may  not be able to be fully utilized until all devices in the system have been  replaced and the upgrade is complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securing Control Systems May Not Be Perceived as Economically Justifiable", "paragraphs": ["Experts and industry representatives have indicated that organizations  may be reluctant to spend more money to secure control systems.  Hardening the security of control systems would require industries to  expend more resources, including acquiring more personnel, providing  training for personnel, and potentially prematurely replacing current  systems, which typically have a lifespan of about 20 years.", "Several vendors suggested that since there have been no reports of  significant disruptions caused by cyber attacks on U.S. control systems,  industry representatives believe the threat of such an attack is low. While  incidents have occurred, to date there is no formalized process for  collecting and analyzing information about control systems incidents, thus  further contributing to the skepticism of control systems vendors. We have  previously recommended that the government work with the private  sector to improve the quality and quantity of information being shared  among industries and government about attacks on the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures.", "Until industry users of control systems have a business case to justify why  additional security is needed, there may be little market incentive for the  private sector to develop and implement more secure control systems. We  have previously reported that consideration of further federal government  efforts is needed to provide appropriate incentives for nonfederal entities  to enhance their efforts to implement CIP\u2014including protection of control  systems.

These  experts indicate that, as a result, those two groups do not always fully  understand each other\u2019s requirements and so may not effectively  collaborate to implement secure control systems.", "These conflicting priorities may perpetuate a lack of awareness of IT  security strategies that could be deployed to mitigate the vulnerabilities of  control systems without affecting their performance. Although research  and development will be necessary to develop technologies to secure  individual control system devices, existing IT security technologies and  approaches could be implemented as part of a secure enterprise  architecture to protect the perimeters of, and access to, control system  networks.

DHS\u2019s assigned role includes: ensuring that there is broad awareness of the vulnerabilities in control  systems and the consequences of exploiting these vulnerabilities, developing best practices and new technologies to strengthen the security  of control systems, and  identifying the nation\u2019s most critical control system sites and developing a  prioritized plan for ensuring cyber security at those sites.", "In addition, the President\u2019s strategy recommends that DHS work with the  private sector to promote voluntary standards efforts and the creation of  security policy for control systems.", "DHS recently began to focus on the range of activities that are under way  among the numerous entities that are working to address these areas. In  October 2003, DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate initiated a study  to determine the current state of security of control systems. In December  2003, DHS established the Control Systems Section within the Protective  Security Division of its Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  (IAIP) Directorate. The objectives of this section are to identify computer- controlled systems that are vital to infrastructure functions, evaluate the  potential threats to these systems, and develop strategies that mitigate the  consequences of attacks. In addition, IAIP\u2019s National Cyber Security  Division (NCSD) is planning to develop a methodology for conducting  cyber assessments across all critical infrastructures, including control  systems. The objectives of this effort include defining specific goals for the  assessments and, based on their results, developing sector-specific  recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities. NCSD also plans to examine  processes, technology, and available policy, procedures, and guidance.  Because these efforts have only recently been initiated, DHS  acknowledges that it has not yet developed a strategy for implementing  the functions mentioned above.", "As I previously mentioned, many government and nongovernment entities  are spearheading various initiatives to address the challenge of  implementing cybersecurity for the vital systems that operate our nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures. While some coordination is occurring, both federal  and nonfederal control systems experts have expressed their concern that  these efforts are not being adequately coordinated among government  agencies, the private sector, and standards-setting bodies. DHS\u2019s  coordination of these efforts could accelerate the development and  implementation of more secure systems to manage our critical  infrastructures. In contrast, insufficient coordination could contribute to delays in the general acceptance of security requirements and the  adoption of successful practices for control systems,  failure to address gaps in the research and development of technologies to  better secure control systems,  impediments to standards-creating efforts across industries that could lead  to less expensive technological solutions, and  reduced opportunities for efficiency that could be gained by leveraging  ongoing work.", "In summary, it is clear that the systems that monitor and control the  sensitive processes and physical functions of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructures are at increasing risk from threats of cyber attacks.  Securing these systems poses significant challenges. Numerous federal  agencies, critical infrastructure sectors, and standards-creating bodies are  leading various initiatives to address these challenges. DHS\u2019s  implementation of our recommendation\u2014with which the department  concurred\u2014to develop and implement a strategy for better coordinating  the cybersecurity of our critical infrastructures\u2019 control systems among  government and private sector entities can accelerate progress in securing  these critical systems. Additionally, implementing existing IT technologies  and security approaches can strengthen the security of control systems.   These approaches include establishing an effective security management  program, building successive layers of defense mechanisms at strategic  access points to the control system network, and developing and testing  continuity plans to ensure safe operation in the event of a power outage or  cyber attack.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
