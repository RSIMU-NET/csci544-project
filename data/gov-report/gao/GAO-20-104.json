We verified information maintained by each of these  organizations on the length of time it takes to complete certain steps in  the contracting process with information contained in the contract files.  After correcting certain errors, such as incorrectly recorded dates, we  determined that this information was sufficiently reliable for purposes of  reporting on the length of time to conduct pre-award contracting activities.  We also interviewed knowledgeable officials at the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, which is part of the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment (ASD(Sustainment)),  DLA Energy, the military departments, installations, and the contractors  providing utility services. We selected a non-generalizable sample of  three military installations with completed utilities privatization projects to  gather information about the factors that affect the time to complete the  pre-award contracting process. The selection was based on  characteristics such as the fiscal year the contract was awarded and the  number and type of utility systems privatized. We visited the following  military installations: (1) Naval Air Station Key West, Florida; (2) Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio; and (3) Fort Riley, Kansas.

The authority defines  a utility system as a system for the generation and supply of electric  power; the treatment or supply of water; the collection or treatment of  wastewater; and the supply of natural gas, among others. When  privatizing a utility, the Secretary of a military department makes a  decision to convey a system to a private or public entity, and then a utility  services contract is awarded. Figure 1 shows examples of common utility  systems found on military installations.", "A utility system includes the associated equipment, fixtures, and  structures, as well as easements and rights-of-way. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2688  states that the Secretary of a military department may convey a utility  system, or part of a system, to a municipal, private, regional, district, or  cooperative utility company or other entity. DOD\u2019s policy states that the  military departments may maintain ownership of utility systems and  decide not to privatize them for security reasons, or when privatization is  determined to be uneconomical. According to officials, once DOD  conveys a utility system and awards a contract for utility services, the  contractor is responsible for replacing, repairing, and maintaining the  associated equipment and structures as needed.

During the period covered by our review, the instruction  directed the military departments to attempt to privatize all utility systems,  unless the Secretary of the military department determines that the  system is exempt from privatization for security or economic reasons. In  February 2019, DOD released supplemental guidance, which, among  other things, superseded the relevant portions of the instruction (and  cancelled prior supplemental guidance), and did not include a preference  for privatization or the direction to complete privatization decisions on all  covered utility systems. Instead, utilities privatization may now be  performed at the discretion of the military departments.", "The military departments have the responsibility for program  implementation, as the statutory authority to privatize utility systems is  granted to the Secretaries of the military departments. As such, the  military departments determine which systems will be privatized and  which systems may be exempted from privatization. Once a military  department begins to consider an installation for privatization, the  installation command assists and facilitates in carrying out the  privatization effort. According to officials, DLA Energy is the contracting  agent for the majority of privatized utility services contracts awarded on  behalf of the Army since 2004 and for the Air Force since 2008. Navy  officials noted that NAVFAC is the contracting agent and administrator for  the Navy and Marine Corps privatized utility services contracts.", "As of December 2019, the military departments have privatized roughly a  quarter of the utility systems on military installations (614 of the 2,590  systems); roughly a third of the systems were already owned by entities  other than the federal government (733 of 2,590) (see table 2).", "As reflected in the table, the military departments have identified 580  utility systems that are available for future utilities privatization. As of  September 2018, DLA Energy reported that it had 18 ongoing utilities  privatization efforts\u201412 for Army and six for Air Force. Also, the Navy  noted that it has three ongoing utilities privatization efforts. According to  Air Force and Navy officials, their departments took a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d on  new utilities privatization efforts in 2015 to determine if privatization is the  best option for recapitalizing their deteriorating utility systems. The Navy  and Air Force resumed new utilities privatization efforts in fiscal year 2017  and fiscal year 2019, respectively.

Once the  military department has decided to consider privatizing a utility system at  an installation, the department initiates efforts to award one or more utility  services contracts. This contracting process is governed by federal  statutes, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the DOD and military  department supplements to the FAR, and military department and agency  guidance. For example, DOD is generally required to award utility  services contracts using competitive procedures, but can award contracts  through other than competitive procedures when authorized by an  exception, which we refer to as non-competitive. Figure 3 depicts the five  phases of the pre-award contracting process identified by GAO.", "Acquisition Planning: Acquisition planning includes developing  requirements, preparing cost estimates, and conducting market  research to determine market interest, among other activities. For  utilities privatization efforts, requirements also include the inventory of  equipment\u2014such as pipes, valves, and wires\u2014and structures  associated with the utility system. For privatized utility services  contracts this phase begins with the decision to consider the  privatization of utilities at a given installation and generally ends with  the approval of an acquisition strategy.", "Solicitation: Military departments may solicit offers from prospective  contractors by issuing a request for proposals. The request for  proposals informs the prospective contractors of the government\u2019s  requirements, the anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to  the contract, the information required in a proposal, and the factors  used to evaluate proposals and their relative importance. Those who  wish to respond must submit their proposal to the contracting office in  the time and manner stated in the request for proposals. We consider  the solicitation phase to begin with solicitation issuance and end at the  deadline to submit the initial proposals, although the solicitation can  be amended later and proposals revised.", "Initial Evaluation: Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the  proposals based on stated evaluation factors and the offerors\u2019 ability  to perform the prospective work successfully. For example, proposals  undergo technical evaluation to determine offerors\u2019 ability to meet the  technical requirements and cost or price evaluation to determine  whether the price is fair and reasonable. We consider the initial  evaluation phase to begin when potential offerors submit initial  proposals and end once government contracting personnel receive  approval to enter into negotiations or discussions.", "Discussion/Negotiation: Negotiations are exchanges, in either a  competitive or non-competitive environment, between the government  and offerors that are undertaken with the intent of allowing the offerors  to revise proposals and obtaining the best value for the government.  Negotiations allow, among other things, the offerors to address any  government concerns with the proposals. We consider this phase to  begin when the contracting officer receives approval to enter into  negotiation and end when contracting personnel receive approval to  award the contract.", "Contract Award: We consider the contract award phase to begin  when the approval to award the contract is given and to end when the  contracting officer signs the contract. In utilities privatization, as a part  of the contract award phase, the Secretary of the military department  makes a decision to convey the utility systems after the awardee has  been selected.", "While the utilities privatization process must comply with relevant statutes  and regulations, it has certain unique attributes. According to DLA  Energy and military department officials, installations must conduct a  thorough inventory of the physical assets associated with the utility system (e.g., linear feet of water pipes and location, number and location  of gas valves, and the number and location of lift station pumps) as well  as the system\u2019s workload data to inform the requirements document. This  is due to the fact that ownership of these physical assets will convey\u2014 i.e., be legally transferred\u2014to the contractor after contract award.  Conveyance from the military installation to a regulated public sector  utility, such as a municipal water and wastewater authority, requires  additional approval from the state\u2019s utility regulatory commission. Finally,  privatized utility services contracts are generally long-term, up to 50 years  in some cases.

For example, in July 2018, we reported that although  DOD proposed reducing the time it takes to award weapon systems  contracts, the department has limited understanding of how long it  currently took and therefore lacked a baseline to measure success. We  also found that, according to contracting officials, factors such as the  quality of proposals, prospective offeror responsiveness to agency  request for additional information, and complexity of the technical requirements can add or reduce the time required for evaluation of  proposals.

They stated that it is due, in part, to the long-term nature of the  contracts\u2014that can be up to 50 years\u2014and the complexity of the  contracts. The entire pre-award contracting process could be longer, as  we found that, with the exception of the one Navy-awarded contract we  reviewed, DOD does not maintain complete data for every phase of the  process.

Table 3  presents the available information on the average time to complete the  five phases of the pre-award contracting process identified by GAO for  the contracts we assessed.", "As indicated in table 3, even after excluding the time needed to conduct  acquisition planning, there is wide variation in the average time taken  from when contracting officials issued the solicitation to when they  awarded the privatized utility services contracts. For example, NAVFAC  took more than 92 months\u2014or more than 7 years\u2014to award its contract  to privatize the Naval Air Station Key West wastewater system. The total  time required to award the contract included a 30-month period during  which the privatization effort was paused to evaluate alternative paths to  meet new Florida wastewater regulations. Navy officials stated that our  timeline should not include the 30-month period because the pause did  allow any additional work to be accomplished to prepare for contract  award. After determining that privatizing the utility system remained the  most effective approach, however, the Navy resumed evaluating revised  proposals that had been received in response to the amended original  solicitation. DLA Energy took, on average, about 45 months\u2014or nearly 4  years\u2014to privatize utility systems and make awards for the 19 contracts it  was responsible for. In contrast, the Air National Guard awarded a non- competitive contract to privatize the wastewater system at Truax Field in  Wisconsin to a local utility provider in about 6 months. However,  according to Air National Guard officials, the local utility provider already  maintained the infrastructure for the installation and had previously  conducted an assessment of the installation wastewater system used to  finalize the privatization requirements. While Air National Guard officials  could not provide a date as to when they began to consider utilities  privatization, they stated that they spent more than 70 months in  acquisition planning before issuing the solicitation due, in part, to  unfamiliarity with the utilities privatization process.", "While no provision of the regulations or policies governing utilities  privatization that we reviewed require DOD contracting activities to collect  data on the time to complete each phase of the pre-award process, since  2014, DLA Energy officials have attempted to maintain such data for all  the contracts for which they were the contracting agent. However, DLA  Energy did not maintain data for the completion of milestones within the  acquisition planning phase carried out by the military departments. In  2014, DLA Energy officials, with input from Army and Air Force utilities  privatization officials, established milestones to plan and monitor key pre- award contracting activities, including a target time to complete each  milestone. DLA Energy and military department officials noted that these  data help provide insight into, and accountability for, the progress made  or challenges encountered during the pre-award process. However, the  usefulness of these data are limited because the military departments  must provide time frames for the front end of the process and have not  done so. We found that a number of factors can affect the time to  complete pre-award contracting activities, but for the purpose of  establishing milestones to monitor these activities, DLA Energy varied the  number of milestones and time frames to complete specific activities  depending on whether the contract was competitively awarded and the  number of proposals received. While table 3 shows the average time it  took to complete pre-award phases by contracting agent for the contracts  in our audit scope, figure 5 shows the milestones used by DLA Energy for  competitive and non-competitive awards and the target time frames DLA  Energy established for each milestone.", "DLA Energy officials noted that the time frames for the first three steps in  the process\u2014determining that one or more utility systems on an  installation should be considered for privatization through when the  military department provides DLA Energy a complete requirements  package\u2014are determined by the military departments.

A DLA Energy official stressed  that the target time frames are meant to improve contract award time  frames, incentivize performance, and provide accountability, and that they  do not expect every contract to meet targets due to the complex nature of  utilities privatization. Nevertheless, DLA Energy and military department  officials stated that implementation of the milestones helped reduce the  amount of time needed to award privatized utility services contracts. Our  analysis of the 18 competitive utility services contracts awarded by DLA  Energy from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 indicates that the average  time from receipt of requirements to contract award has decreased. For  example, our analysis indicated that DLA Energy took an average of  nearly 61 months from receipt of requirements to competitively award  eight contracts related to solicitations issued prior to 2014. Once the  milestone tracking process was initiated in 2014, our analysis indicates  that DLA Energy took an average of about 35 months from receipt of  requirements to competitively award 10 privatized utility services  contracts (see fig. 6).", "Of the 10 privatized utility services contracts DLA Energy awarded since  the process was initiated in 2014,  two met or exceeded DLA Energy\u2019s target time frame;  six were awarded within 6 months of the target time frame; and  two were awarded over a year longer than the target time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Factors Affected Length of Time to Award Privatized Utility Services Contracts", "paragraphs": ["DLA Energy and military department officials identified several factors  that, individually or collectively, could affect the time to award a privatized  utility services contract.

According to a  utilities privatization official we interviewed, unexpected changes to  requirements may affect the time to award a utility services contract.", "For example, Navy officials stated that Naval Air Station Key West  initiated efforts to privatize its wastewater treatment facilities in August  2007 to meet new Florida wastewater regulations by the compliance  deadline of July 2010. A Navy installation official stated that they  determined that they would be challenged to meet the new regulations  with existing facilities and could not upgrade those facilities to meet  the new standards due to inadequate personnel and funding. After the  Navy issued the original wastewater solicitation in March 2008, the  state extended the required compliance date to December 2015. As a  result, installation and Navy officials reconsidered utilities privatization  and assessed whether the extended deadline would allow them to  reach compliance without privatization. After evaluating alternative  paths of action to ensure compliance with the new Florida wastewater  regulations, installation and Navy officials determined it remained in  the best interest of the installation to proceed with the solicitation and  contract award.", "Wright-Patterson Air Force Base officials stated that after they issued  their solicitation for privatization of water systems, installation officials  discovered that two of the wells were contaminated by firefighting  foam. This foam, used to extinguish aircraft fires, contained chemicals  which washed off runways and seeped into the groundwater.  According to installation officials, concentrations of these chemicals  exceeded non-regulatory lifetime health advisory levels, prompting the  installation to remove the chemicals before distributing the water for  use on base. To address the problem immediately, installation officials  reported that they engaged with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to  fund a project to modify the existing water treatment plant to remove  the chemicals before distributing the water for use; they could not wait  for the award of the utility services contract. Installation officials stated  the modification to the water treatment plant included the construction  of a building to house a large filtration system to remove the  contaminant. These officials also stated the modified water treatment  plant was then included in the requirements package for the utilities  privatization effort.", "DLA Energy officials stated that a change to the requirements  included in utilities privatization efforts was a frequent occurrence. As  this information is central to determining the technical requirements  and the cost estimate, changes to an inventory can affect the length of  time spent in acquisition planning and in discussions and negotiations.  Army officials stated that completion of the list of inventory to be  privatized is a time-consuming process as records of the amount of  pipes, valves, wires, facilities, or other items is often incomplete. Army  and Air Force officials indicated that often multiple surveys of  inventory are conducted by both the military departments and the  contractor selected to maintain the utility system to finalize  requirements. Officials reported that this is because, in part, a final  and complete inventory is required so that after award the government  can finalize the bill of sale and convey those systems to the utility  services contract(s) provider(s).", "Technical Complexity. According to utilities privatization officials, the  technical complexity of the utilities privatization effort can also affect  how long it takes to award a utility services contract. At Fort Riley,  DLA Energy officials, installation officials, and contractor  representatives shared with us that the complexity of the regulated  environment of some utilities had an effect on the time to award. For  example, a contractor representative stated his regulated utility  company was one of the potential contractors vying for a utility  services contract at Fort Riley, and this required additional approval  from the state\u2019s utility regulatory commission. DLA Energy officials  stated and the contractor representative stated that this additional  complexity led to a prolonged negotiation and discussion effort as his  company sought additional information about the asset inventory to  create what it perceived to be a quality proposal for both the utility  services contract and its utility regulatory commission. Our analysis of  DLA Energy data found that for the majority of the contracts, the  discussion/negotiation phase required the longest amount of time  during the pre-award contracting process. The time to award for this  utility system took one year longer than other utility systems privatized  on the same installation.", "Continuity of Personnel. Utilities privatization officials we  interviewed stated that the continuity of personnel involved in the  process is critical to awarding a contract in a timely manner. For  example, at Naval Air Station Key West, officials told us that staff  turnover was prevalent at all levels multiple times during the utilities  privatization process. These officials noted this turnover was due, in  part, to the isolated location of the installation, which made it difficult  to recruit and retain both civilian and military staff. They also noted  that in turn, this turnover of staff led to loss of knowledge and  dispersion of data. During our visit, we observed that installation staff  had difficulty locating documentation and had limited knowledge of  what occurred during the pre-award contracting process at the  installation. Officials explained that this was due, in part, to the loss of  some documentation due to flooding and the management of the  process by other commands. In contrast, installation and contracting  officials at Fort Riley stated that there was no turnover in the  installation staff during the pre-award contracting process and no  turnover in the DLA Energy contracting staff once they took  responsibility for administering the utility services contracts. Officials  at Fort Riley stated that with continuity of staff, knowledge and  working relationships were built and maintained. DLA Energy awarded  utility services contracts for three utility systems in a comparatively  quick time frame compared to the other contracts in our analysis.", "Command Support for Privatization. Utilities privatization officials  stated that the support of the installation\u2019s command leadership can  facilitate award of a utility services contract. For example, officials at  Fort Riley said the installation commander and director of public works  department fully supported utilities privatization as the solution to the  installation\u2019s failing utility systems. These officials noted that due to  this desire to privatize utility systems, the senior installation leadership  openly communicated its goals and support of privatization throughout  the pre-award contracting process. For example, Fort Riley officials  stated that public works department staff assigned to work on the  utilities privatization effort were sequestered or removed from all other  assigned responsibilities. Installation officials stated this allowed the  employees to focus on the utilities privatization tasks. According to  Fort Riley officials, this leadership support was a factor in reducing the  time to contract award. According to our analysis, the utility services  contracts for Fort Riley were awarded more quickly than the majority  of the utility services contracts we assessed at other installations. In  contrast, officials at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said their  leadership was reluctant to fully support utilities privatization. While  senior military department leadership directed the installation to  privatize its utility systems, installation leadership was reluctant to do  so due to concerns of job loss for public works department employees  and perceived loss of flexibility in installation operations and  maintenance funding. Installation officials stated that this reluctance  was one factor in the amount of time it took to make the contract  awards. According to our analysis, the contracting award process for  the three utility systems at that location took longer than the majority  of the utility services contracts we assessed at other installations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Generally Demonstrated Leading Practices for Lessons Learned to Improve the Utilities Privatization Pre- award Process, but Lacks Key Data and Archive for Lessons", "paragraphs": ["DOD is generally applying leading practices in its efforts to improve the  timeliness of the utilities privatization pre-award contracting process, but  is missing opportunities to analyze the effects of its changes and to better  share the information with stakeholders.

Reducing the amount of time to award these contracts is a stated goal of  DOD. ASD(Sustainment) issues annual data calls to the military  departments to collect information such as the number of utility systems  privatized by military department, the authority under which a privatization  took place, and award dates for the utility services contracts. DLA Energy  and military department officials indicated that collecting this information  has contributed to efforts to reduce the amount of time needed to award  utility services contracts. They acknowledge, however, that the military  departments do not collect information on the formal decision to consider  privatization of utility systems and the length of time to conduct key  acquisition planning activities, such as developing a complete inventory of  physical assets to document its requirements. The requirements package  is a key component in the pre-award contracting process and includes an  inventory of the utility system. This inventory includes items such as the  pipes, valves, and wires that make up the utility system. Consequently,  neither DLA Energy nor the military departments, with the exception of  the Navy, had reliable information on the entire time it took to complete  the pre-award contracting process. Without data on the key tasks that  need to be completed during the pre-award contracting phase, DOD is  missing an opportunity to assess the extent to which updated guidance,  training, and other ongoing efforts are having an effect on the time to  award utility services contracts. In recognition of this, an Air Force official  stated that the Air Force Civil Engineer Center recently implemented a  schedule-tracking mechanism to capture these dates, which will be used  with all new utilities privatization efforts. Collecting this information  consistently across all military departments would allow for a more  thorough analysis of contracting process information and could support  future process improvement efforts.", "Analyze information.

As mentioned  previously, this analysis led to the development of milestones and  associated time-based targets to achieve each milestone, based on  the number of proposals received, to reduce the pre-award  contracting process. According to a DLA Energy official, the agency  coordinated with its contractor support, and Army and Air Force  program management offices to establish the time-based targets. In  May 2014, the Air Force conducted a utilities privatization process  improvement review with DLA Energy, among others, to streamline  the utilities privatization process. The review allowed the Air Force to  reduce the planned timelines for the utilities privatization pre-award  contracting process, which DLA Energy administers on behalf of the  Air Force, between the issuance of competitive solicitations to award  by 14 months to 33 months. Similarly, in October 2014, the Army  conducted a utilities privatization process improvement review with  DLA Energy with a goal to reduce the time needed from issuance of a  competitive solicitation to award of utility services contracts to less  than 36 months. Army and DLA Energy officials identified  opportunities for process or program improvement during the review.  Overall, adopted changes reduced the planned timelines for the  utilities privatization pre-award contracting process by approximately 5  months to 31 months.", "An Air Force official stated that lessons learned are collaboratively  shared annually and have revealed lessons learned to improve the  contracting process. This has led to updates of Air Force request for  proposals template.", "The 2016 Navy study not only collected data on utilities privatization  but also provided analysis to understand the opportunities, costs, and  benefits associated with privatization. The Navy used the study to  enable decisions about whether privatization is the appropriate  strategy to reduce life-cycle expenditures on utility infrastructure. The  analysis performed for the study resulted in multiple products and  findings. For example, the Navy created an Excel-based tool to  consolidate utility data, organize data, and prioritize installations for  evaluation of the potential to privatize.", "ASD(Sustainment) revises its utilities privatization guidance and  procedures based on lessons learned and changes in laws and  regulations.

In addition, contractors interviewed Air Force and Army  utilities privatization representatives to garner lessons learned and  understand other DOD components\u2019 approaches to utilities  privatization. One result of the study was development of a repeatable  methodology and framework, based on specific lessons learned, that  can be used to evaluate candidate sites for utilities privatization. In  addition, according to an official, the Navy is using the lessons  learned from its study to develop its new utilities privatization  handbook, a draft of which emphasizes the need throughout the  process for the collection, documentation, and sharing of lessons  learned to help future installations and refine the utilities privatization  program. According to the Navy, it plans to update the handbook on  an ongoing basis to reflect lessons learned from its pilot program with  DLA Energy, and with the Army and Air Force utilities privatization  programs.", "An Air Force official stated that over an 18-month period they  assessed their utilities privatization process and developed a new,  comprehensive utilities privatization process for pre-award contracting  activities. The Air Force determined the scope of the applicability of  lessons learned when it revised its draft utilities privatization playbook  to incorporate this new process.", "DLA Energy revised how it monitors the utilities privatization process  based on its analysis of historical utilities privatization data. DLA  Energy officials said they validated these changes by testing the  milestones and associated targets on a 2014 Army utility services  contract and found them to be reasonable. Army and Air Force  officials agreed with the assessment. DLA Energy officials stated that  they also determined the scope of the applicability of lessons learned  by determining to whom and what the lessons learned applied, and by  taking actions to continually revisit and revise its templates and  procedures. For example, we found that the fiscal years 2012 and  2016 versions of the request for proposals template reflected changes  for both the Army and Air Force but we could not determine if they  were the result of lessons learned. We also identified revisions DLA  Energy made to incorporate lessons learned into operating manuals it  uses for the utilities privatization process.

DOD, however, does not collect consistent information on  the time to complete key phases needed to award utility services  contracts. Specifically, DOD does not have information on when the  military departments identify that one or more utility systems on an  installation should be considered for privatization and when the  installation delivers a completed requirements package as part of the  acquisition planning phase. The lack of consistent data on these two key  events may hinder DOD\u2019s efforts to identify additional opportunities to  reduce the length of time needed to award utility services contracts.  Similarly, DOD recognizes the importance of collecting and disseminating  lessons learned for the utilities privatization program, but currently lacks a  mechanism to archive lessons learned during the pre-award contracting  phase.

We had  identified this pause and the rationale underlying the Navy\u2019s decision to  do so in the draft report. We continue to believe it is appropriate to reflect  this period in our calculations as the Navy did not cancel the original  solicitation and, after deciding to continue to pursue the privatization  efforts, evaluated the offerors\u2019 proposals that had been previously  received prior to the pause and subsequently awarded the utility services  contract based on that solicitation. In that regard, we consider the change  in the date by which the Navy had to comply with Florida\u2019s wastewater  regulations to be a relevant example of one of the many external factors  that can affect the time needed to privatize utilities at a military  installation.

The results of this selection are not  generalizable to all utility services contracts or military installations, but  provide insights and illustrative examples regarding factors that affect  timing in the contract award process used to privatize utility systems.", "To determine the extent to which DOD demonstrated leading practices  identified by GAO and others for collecting and disseminating lessons  learned, we compared DOD\u2019s activities related to lessons learned against  the five leading practices identified in our prior work to determine whether  DOD demonstrated actions consistent with these practices. We then had  a second analyst check the same documents and activities to verify our  initial results. These leading practices for lessons learned are discussed  in a September 2012 GAO report, Federal Real Property Security:  Interagency Security Committee Should Implement a Lessons-Learned  Process; and a December 2018 GAO report, Project Management: DOE  and NNSA Should Improve Their Lessons-Learned Process for Capital  Asset Projects. We compared DOD\u2019s lessons learned documentation,  including the Air Force\u2019s lessons learned database, DLA Energy\u2019s utilities  privatization website and operating manuals, the military departments and  DLA Energy contracting process policies and procedures, and Air Force  and Navy utilities privatization handbooks against these practices. Based  on our analysis, we assessed whether DOD fully (met all of the criteria),  partially (met part of the criteria), or did not (met none of the criteria)  demonstrate the leading practices. To determine the actions that DOD  has taken to learn lessons from the utilities privatization pre-award  contracting process and demonstrate leading practices, we interviewed  officials from ASD(Sustainment), the military departments, and DLA  Energy; obtained and analyzed documents; and attended the 2019 DLA  Energy Worldwide Energy Conference to gain a greater understanding of  utilities privatization.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2019 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Timothy J.
