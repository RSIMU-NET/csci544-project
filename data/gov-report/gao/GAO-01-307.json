Although the program has addressed issues related to DOD's departmental IA goals, established new IA policy, improved communication across the department, and introduced mechanisms for monitoring IA efforts throughout DOD, many IA issues remain unaddressed. Given the high priority that DOD puts on IA, GAO believes the the program should have made progress on more of its implementation plan objectives by this time and gone further with the ones it has begun to address. Top-level DOD management has not carried out oversight commensurate with the program's high-priority role and the program has not received the resources that were judged necessary by DOD when the program was initiated.

Weaknesses in  DOD systems and associated risks have been highlighted by numerous  reports of vulnerabilities, organized intrusions, and theft related to  department systems and networks, and by our 1996 report on penetrations  and on pervasive vulnerabilities in DOD computer systems, which  recommended implementation of a departmentwide information security  program.", "In January 1998, DOD responded to these risks by announcing its plans for  a Defense-wide Information Assurance Program (DIAP), intended to  promote integrated, comprehensive, and consistent information assurance  (IA) practices across the department. IA refers to the range of information  security activities and functions needed to protect and defend DOD\u2019s  information and systems. DOD estimates a department IA budget of at least  $6 billion for the 5-year period from fiscal years 2001 through 2005. In  February 1999, the department issued an approved DIAP Implementation  Plan, which described, at a high level, the program\u2019s goals, objectives, and  organizational structure, and confirmed its responsibility for the planning,  coordination, integration, and oversight of Defense-wide computer security  initiatives.", "Given its importance as DOD\u2019s central focal point for IA, we were asked to  examine the progress and accomplishments of DIAP since its inception.

It has concluded that IA is essential to DOD\u2019s information  superiority. DOD defines IA as \u201cInformation Operations that protect and  defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability,  integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation . . .   includes providing for the restoration of information systems by  incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.\u201d In this  context, availability is assured access by authorized users, integrity is  protection from unauthorized change, authentication is verification of the  originator, confidentiality is protection from unauthorized disclosure, and  nonrepudiation is undeniable proof of participation. A 1997 DOD task force  report acknowledged that the department requires substantial IA  capabilities for its highly interconnected computing and communications  environment, noting that \u201cwithout information assurance, it is increasingly  likely that our forces will fail to accomplish their mission.\u201d", "Other policy and guidance documents also emphasize the critical role of IA  in DOD\u2019s mission. In October 1998, the Joint Doctrine for Information  Operations identified IA as an essential component of the military\u2019s  defensive information operations. In February 2000, the DOD CIO\u2019s annual  report on IA identified it as the department\u2019s second highest priority IT  issue, following Year 2000 remediation. In March 2000, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense issued a guidance and policy memorandum  recognizing the pivotal role of global networking in departmental activities  and requiring the use of IA safeguards and operational procedures for all of  DOD."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Several Factors Affect DOD\u2019s Ability to Protect Its Systems", "paragraphs": ["Defense operations rely increasingly on interconnected information  systems, which results in sharing of security risks among all  interconnected organizations.

Reports by us and DOD document serious and pervasive  deficiencies that can impair the military\u2019s ability to (1) control physical and  electronic access to its systems and data, (2) ensure that software is  properly authorized, tested, and functioning, (3) limit employees\u2019 ability to  perform incompatible functions, and (4) resume operations in the event of  a disaster. Numerous Defense functions, including weapons and  supercomputer research, logistics, finance, procurement, personnel  management, military health, and payroll have been adversely affected by  system attacks and fraud. DOD, in turn, has acknowledged the need for  improvements.", "The department\u2019s IA challenges are heightened by the growing threat of  Internet-based attacks. Intrusions into government information systems\u2014 including DOD\u2019s\u2014continue to escalate, in number and complexity,  requiring better detection, faster damage containment, and more efficient  reporting mechanisms. Furthermore, DOD recognizes that increasing  availability of its systems to authorized users has also increased  opportunities for unauthorized access, presenting the most serious threat  to DOD information. In this environment, security incidents remain an  ongoing problem for DOD.", "DOD has identified an even more fundamental challenge underlying these  organizational and technological challenges\u2014a shortage of qualified  personnel to fill positions that manage and protect its information systems.  Although poor planning of system procurements, downsizing of military  and civilian personnel, and an increased emphasis on outsourcing have  contributed to DOD\u2019s IT personnel shortage, this shortage also reflects a  broader problem in recruiting and retaining IT security professionals in  both the public and private sectors, according to a DOD human resources  study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DIAP Is DOD\u2019s Focal Point for IA", "paragraphs": ["In January 1998, the Deputy Secretary of Defense responded to these  challenges by forming DIAP and assigning responsibility for its oversight to  DOD\u2019s CIO, who is also the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command,  Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD(CI)).

An  example of an IA metric is the number of system outages caused by  infrastructure failures during a fixed period. Joint force-level IA metrics  were separately developed, approved, and issued by the Joint Staff for its  own use and for use by the commanders-in-chief, military services, and  combat support agencies. The DIAP staff plans further development of  department readiness metrics, coordination between department and joint  force metrics, and integration of the metrics into management processes.", "Although these metrics have been developed, systems and processes are  not yet in place to provide department decisionmakers with data to assess  the department\u2019s IA readiness status. DOD plans indicate that department- level readiness reports will not be available before late 2002. DIAP  personnel stated several factors that contribute to this shortfall. First, they  said that DOD\u2019s automated readiness reporting systems are limited in their  current capability to capture IA-related inputs, and they said that these  systems could not be easily modified to provide that capability. Second,  they noted that processes for developing strategic department-level and  joint force IA metrics have been largely independent of each other,  presenting risks for unnecessarily burdensome reporting requirements and  interpretation conflicts. Further, neither DIAP nor the Joint Staff have  taken steps, such as testing the metrics on a specific program, to ensure  that the metrics are appropriate. Therefore, data reported by components,  services, and agencies may not provide a true picture of DOD\u2019s readiness  status.

The DIAP staff expects to contribute enhancements to a Defense- wide IT database for IA-related system components.", "However, the department still lacks comprehensive operational policies  and procedures that would provide consistency in IA monitoring and  management across the department. For example, no departmentwide  policy on the use of intrusion-detection systems has been established. The  absence of such operational policies impairs DOD\u2019s ability to realistically  manage risks to its information and systems.

While DIAP officials said they lacked the staff needed  for this assignment, we also noted that other DOD officials disagreed on  the need for these detailed IA budget codes. Third, DIAP has not yet  integrated planning, programming, and budgeting data with the  department\u2019s acquisition management or requirements-generation systems  to provide a comprehensive view of IA resources and funding priorities. A  DIAP official stated that program staff have no plans to address this issue  until DIAP achieves greater influence on DOD\u2019s program management  processes.

In addition to its executive  positions, advisory bodies, and coordination groups, DIAP has sponsored  or participated in at least 39 IA-related working groups involving three  distinct reporting chains (civilian defense, military, and intelligence). Yet  Defense policy does not assign DOD components and their managers  specific responsibilities with regard to DIAP and its groups nor are  mechanisms to enforce such responsibilities in place. Without specific  definition of their responsibilities and accountability for their involvement  with DIAP activities, Defense components have provided inconsistent  support in areas such as assigning staff, responding to information  requests, attending coordination meetings, and reporting plans and  progress on DOD IA initiatives. A DIAP Program Execution Plan, as  envisioned in the 1999 DOD CIO Annual Information Assurance Report,  would clarify organizational responsibilities with regard to DIAP, but such a  plan has not yet been developed.", "The DIAP staff itself cannot require DOD components to contribute to its  activities or respond to its requests for information.

Instead, the greatest number of these positions filled at any one time has  been 16. During our review, the DIAP staff consisted of 12 personnel  primarily detailed from NSA and DISA. The Joint Staff, military services,  and other Defense agencies were also directed through DIAP\u2019s  implementation plan to provide personnel to the DIAP staff office;  however, they have not filled the positions identified in that plan, frequently  citing their own personnel shortages as a constraint on assigning staff to  departmental IA efforts.

The DOD CIO Council, chartered 8  months before the formation of DIAP, was officially disbanded in March  2000 by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and replaced by the larger CIO  Executive Board to provide a more decision-oriented approach toward  department acquisition, management, use, and oversight of technology.  DIAP management and implementation plans had called for increasing  Defense agency representation on the CIO Council to improve its ability to  address IT and IA across the department.
