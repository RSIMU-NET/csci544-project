The Wounded, Ill, and Injured Senior Oversight Committee (SOC)--jointly chaired by DOD and VA leadership--has assumed responsibility for these policies. The NDAA 2008 also requires GAO to report on the progress DOD and VA make in jointly developing and implementing the policies. This report focuses on the joint development of the policies. Implementation of the policies will be addressed in future reports. Specifically, this report provides information on (1) the progress DOD and VA have made in jointly developing the comprehensive policies required by the NDAA 2008 and (2) the challenges DOD and VA are encountering in the joint development of these policies. GAO determined the current status of policy development by assessing the status reported by SOC officials and analyzing supporting documentation. To identify challenges, GAO interviewed the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Executive Director and Chief of Staff of the SOC, the departmental co-leads for most of the SOC work groups, the Acting Director of DOD's Office of Transition Policy and Care Coordination, and other knowledgeable officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA have made substantial progress in jointly developing policies required by sections 1611 through 1614 of the NDAA 2008 in the areas of (1) care and management, (2) medical and disability evaluation, (3) return to active duty, and (4) transition of care and services received from DOD to VA. Overall, GAO's analysis showed that as of April 2009, 60 of the 76 policy requirements GAO identified have been completed and the remaining 16 policy requirements are in progress. DOD and VA have completed all of the policy development requirements for medical and physical disability evaluations, including issuing a report on the feasibility and advisability of consolidating the DOD and VA disability evaluation systems, although the pilot for this approach is still ongoing. DOD has also completed establishing standards for returning recovering servicemembers to active duty. More than two-thirds of the policy development requirements have been completed for the remaining two policy areas--care and management and the transition of recovering servicemembers from DOD to VA. Most of these requirements were addressed in a January 2009 DOD memorandum that was developed in consultation with VA. DOD officials reported that more information will be provided in a subsequent policy instruction, which is to be issued in August 2009. VA also plans to issue related policy guidance in the fourth quarter of 2009. DOD and VA officials told GAO that they have experienced numerous challenges as they worked to jointly develop policies to improve the care, management, and transition of recovering servicemembers. According to officials, these challenges contributed to the length of time required to issue policy guidance, and in some cases the challenges have not yet been completely resolved. For example, the SOC must still standardize key terminology relevant to policy issues affecting recovering servicemembers. DOD and VA agreement on key definitions for what constitutes \"mental health,\" for instance, is important for developing policies that define the scope, eligibility, and service levels for recovering servicemembers. Recent changes affecting the SOC may also pose future challenges to policy development. Some officials have expressed concern that DOD's recent changes to staff supporting the SOC have disrupted the unity of command because SOC staff now report to three different officials within DOD and VA. However, it is too soon to determine how well DOD's staffing changes will work. Additionally, according to DOD and VA officials, the SOC's scope of responsibilities appears to be in flux. While the SOC will remain responsible for policy matters for recovering servicemembers, a number of policy issues may now be directed to the DOD and VA Joint Executive Council. Despite this uncertainty, DOD and VA officials told GAO that the SOC's work groups continue to carry out their roles and responsibilities. GAO provided a draft of this report to DOD and VA for comment. VA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. DOD and VA did not provide other comments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 1.6 million U.S. troops have deployed in Operation Enduring  Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) since October 2001.  In May 2009, the Department of Defense (DOD) reported that over 34,000  servicemembers have been wounded in action since the onset of these  conflicts. Because of improved battlefield medicine, those who might  have died in past conflicts are now surviving, many with multiple serious  injuries such as amputations, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Beyond adjusting to their injuries,  recovering servicemembers may face additional challenges, including  difficulties managing their outpatient recovery process, difficulties  navigating the military\u2019s disability evaluation system, and problems  transitioning between care provided by DOD and care provided by the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).", "Questions were raised in the media and by Congress about whether DOD  and VA are prepared to meet the needs of the increasing number of  recovering servicemembers and veterans. In February 2007, a series of  Washington Post articles disclosed deficiencies in the provision of  outpatient services at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, including poor  living conditions at Walter Reed, a confusing disability evaluation system,  and servicemembers remaining in outpatient status for months and  sometimes years without a clear understanding about their plan of care or  the future of their military service. Various review groups investigated the  challenges that DOD and VA faced in providing care to recovering  servicemembers and made a number of recommendations to address the  problems they identified. Shortly after the media disclosures, we testified  about the challenges facing recovering servicemembers during their  recovery process.", "In May 2007, DOD and VA established the Wounded, Ill, and Injured Senior  Oversight Committee (SOC) to address the problems that had been  identified with the care of recovering servicemembers. The committee is  co-chaired by the Deputy Secretaries of DOD and VA and includes military  service Secretaries and other high-ranking officials within both  departments. One of the SOC\u2019s primary responsibilities is to oversee the  development of policies in response to the recommendations of the review  groups that studied the issues associated with recovering servicemembers\u2019  health care and benefits. SOC officials sign and issue interim policy  guidance, which is then developed by DOD and VA into finalized policies.

Specifically, section 1611(a) of the NDAA 2008 directs  DOD and VA to cover four key areas\u2014(1) care and management,   (2) medical evaluation and disability evaluation, (3) the return of  servicemembers to active duty, and (4) the transition of recovering  servicemembers from DOD to VA. Because of the related ongoing work of  the SOC, it assumed responsibility for addressing these requirements. The  NDAA 2008 also requires that we report on the progress DOD and VA  make in developing and implementing the comprehensive policy.

We testified on these issues on April 29,  2009, before the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services  Committee.", "To assess the extent to which DOD and VA have made progress in  developing the required policies, we asked SOC representatives to report  on the status of policy development for the 76 individual requirements that  we identified in sections 1611 through 1614 of the NDAA 2008, which we  grouped into 14 categories. (See app. I for a summary of these  requirements and categories.) We also asked the SOC representatives to  provide documentation to substantiate the status of each requirement, and  we verified the reported status of each requirement by reviewing this  documentation. We determined whether each of the requirements (1) had  been completed, (2) was in progress, or (3) had not been acted upon. We  considered a requirement to have been \u201ccompleted\u201d if a document had  been signed and approved by DOD, VA, or both, at the SOC level, that  contained standards, guidelines, or procedures that addressed the  requirement, even if DOD, VA, or both plan to issue additional policies on  the subject. We considered a requirement to be \u201cin progress\u201d if  documentation demonstrated that work had been initiated to develop  standards, guidelines, or procedures that addressed the requirement. We  considered a requirement not to have been acted upon if no action had  been taken to develop standards, guidelines, or procedures that addressed  the requirement. We based our review in part on the interim policy  documents signed by DOD and VA officials working through the SOC. In  some cases, interim policy documents were signed by officials of both  departments, and in other cases, the documents were signed by officials of  one department, depending upon the requirement. Interim policy  documents could be in the form of memoranda of agreement, memoranda  of understanding, directives, decision- or directive-type memoranda,  instructions or policy memoranda, or other guidelines or forms of  guidance. In addition, we conducted follow-up interviews with DOD and  VA officials when we needed clarification on the reported progress or  additional documentation. We did not, however, evaluate the quality of the  policy documents we reviewed or the extent to which these policies have  been implemented. To identify the challenges DOD and VA encountered in  jointly developing the required policies, we interviewed officials from both  departments to obtain an account of their experiences in the policy  development process. In conducting our work, we interviewed the Acting  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Executive  Director and Chief of Staff of the SOC, the departmental co-leads for most  of the SOC work groups, the Acting Director of DOD\u2019s Office of Transition  Policy and Care Coordination, and other knowledgeable DOD and VA  officials.", "The NDAA 2008 also requires us to certify whether we had timely access  to sufficient information to make informed judgments on the matters  covered by our report.

The most seriously injured servicemembers  from these conflicts usually receive care at Walter Reed Army Medical  Center or the National Naval Medical Center. According to DOD officials,  once they are stabilized and discharged from the hospital, servicemembers  may relocate closer to their homes or military bases and be treated as  outpatients by the closest military or VA facility.", "Recovering servicemembers potentially navigate two different disability  evaluation systems that serve different purposes. DOD\u2019s system serves a  personnel management purpose by identifying servicemembers who are  no longer medically fit for duty. If a servicemember is found unfit because  of medical conditions incurred in the line of duty, the servicemember is  assigned a disability rating and can be discharged from duty. This  disability rating, along with years of service and other factors, determines  subsequent disability and health care benefits from DOD. Under VA\u2019s  system, disability ratings help determine the level of disability  compensation a veteran receives and priority status for enrollment for  health care benefits. To determine eligibility for disability compensation,  VA evaluates all claimed medical conditions, whether they were evaluated  previously by the military service\u2019s evaluation process or not. If VA finds  that a veteran has one or more service-connected disabilities that together  result in a final rating of at least 10 percent, VA will pay monthly  compensation and the veteran will be eligible to receive a higher priority  status for health care benefits enrollment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Address the Care and Benefits for Recovering Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["Efforts have been taken to address the deficiencies reported at Walter  Reed related to the care provided and the transition of recovering  servicemembers.

The NDAA 2008 includes a  number of provisions to strengthen support for families of recovering  servicemembers, including those who become caregivers. However, DOD  and VA officials on a SOC work group stated that before they could  develop policy to increase support for such families, they had to obtain  concrete evidence of their needs. Officials explained that while they did  have anecdotal information about the impact on families who provide care  to recovering servicemembers, they lacked the systematic data needed for  sound policy decisions\u2014such as frequency of job loss and the economic  value of family-provided medical services. A work group official told us  that their proposals for increasing support to family caregivers were  rejected twice by the SOC, due in part to the lack of systematic data on  what would be needed. The work group then contracted with researchers  to obtain substantiating evidence, a study that required 18 months to  complete.

One of the  important tasks facing the SOC was the need to standardize key  terminology relevant to policy issues affecting recovering servicemembers.  DOD took the lead in working with its military services and VA officials to  identify and define key terms. DOD and VA officials told us that many of  the key terms found in existing DOD and VA policy, the reports from the  review groups, and the NDAA 2008, as well as those used by the different  military services were not uniformly defined. Consequently, standardized  definitions were important to promote agreement on issues such as  identifying the recovering servicemembers who are subject to NDAA  2008 requirements,  identifying categories of servicemembers who would receive services  from the different classes of case managers or be eligible for certain  benefits,    managing aspects of the disability evaluation process, and establishing criteria to guide research.", "In some cases, standardized definitions were critical to policy  development. The importance of agreement on key terms is illustrated by  an issue encountered by the SOC\u2019s work group responsible for family  support policy. In this case, before policy could be developed for  furnishing additional support to family members that provide medical care  to recovering servicemembers, the definition of \u201cfamily\u201d had to be agreed  upon. DOD and VA officials said that they considered two options: to  define the term narrowly to include a servicemember\u2019s spouse, parents,  and children, or to use broader definitions that included distant relatives  and unrelated individuals with a connection to the servicemember. These  two definitions would result in significantly different numbers of family  members eligible to receive additional support services.

Requirements related  to screening and treatment for TBI and PTSD were embedded in several  sections of the NDAA 2008, including section 1611, and were also  discussed extensively in a task force report on mental health. DOD and  VA officials told us that policy development for these issues was difficult.  For example, during development of improved TBI and PTSD treatment  policy, policymakers often lacked sufficient scientific information needed  to help achieve consensus on policy decisions. Also, members of the SOC  work group told us that they disagreed on appropriate models for  screening and treatment and struggled to reorient the military services to  patient-focused treatment. A senior DOD official stated that the adoption  of patient-focused models is particularly difficult for the military services  because, historically, the needs of the military have been given precedence  over the needs of individual servicemembers. To address these challenges,  the SOC oversaw the creation of the Defense Centers of Excellence for  Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury\u2014a partnership between  DOD and VA. While policies continue to be developed on these issues, TBI  and PTSD policy remains a challenge for DOD and VA. However, DOD  officials told us that the centers of excellence have made progress with  reducing knowledge gaps in psychological health and TBI treatment,  identifying best practices, and establishing clinical standards of care.", "Release of psychological health treatment records to DOD by VA health  care providers who treat members of the National Guard and Reserves.  Section 1614 of the NDAA 2008 requires the departments to improve  medical and support services provided to members of the National Guard  and Reserves. In pursuing these objectives, VA faced challenges related to  the release of medical information to DOD on reservists and National  Guard servicemembers who have received treatment for PTSD or other  mental health conditions from VA. DOD requests medical information  from VA to help make command decisions about the reactivation of  servicemembers, but VA practitioners face an ethical dilemma if the  disclosure of medical treatment could compromise servicemembers\u2019  medical conditions, particularly for those at risk of suicide. The challenge  of sharing and protecting sensitive medical information on  servicemembers who obtain treatment at VA was reviewed by the Blue  Ribbon Work Group on Suicide Prevention convened in 2008 at the behest  of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. DOD and VA are continuing their  efforts to address the privacy rights of patients who receive medical  services from VA while serving in the military, and to protect the  confidential records of VA patients who may also be treated by the  military\u2019s health care system. The need to resolve this challenge assumes  even greater importance in light of DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s increasing capability to  exchange medical records electronically, which will expand DOD\u2019s ability  to access records of servicemembers who have received medical  treatment from VA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the SOC\u2019s Staff and Scope of Responsibilities Could Pose Future Challenges to Joint Policy Development", "paragraphs": ["The SOC has experienced turnover in leadership, reconfiguration in its  organizational structure at DOD, and changes affecting policy  development responsibilities. These changes could pose future challenges  to DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s efforts to develop joint policy.", "The SOC has experienced leadership changes caused by the turnover in  presidential administrations as well as turnover in some of its key staff.  For example, the outgoing deputy secretaries of DOD and VA, who  previously chaired the SOC, left their positions in January 2009 with the  change in administration, and new deputy secretaries were not confirmed  until February and April 2009. In their absence, the Secretaries of VA and  DOD co-chaired a SOC meeting as a short-term measure. DOD also  introduced other staffing changes to replace personnel who had been  temporarily detailed to the SOC and needed to return to their primary  duties. DOD had relied on temporarily-assigned staff to meet SOC staffing  needs because the SOC was originally envisioned as a short-term effort. In  a December 2008 memorandum, DOD outlined the realignment of its SOC  staff. This included the transition of responsibilities from detailed,  temporary SOC staff and executives to permanent staff in existing DOD  offices that managed similar issues. For example, the functions of LOA 7  (Legislation and Public Affairs) will now be overseen by the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Public Affairs, and the DOD General Counsel. DOD also  established two new organizational structures\u2014the Office of Transition  Policy and Care Coordination and an Executive Secretariat office. The  Office of Transition Policy and Care Coordination oversees transition  support for all servicemembers and serves as the permanent entity for  issues being addressed by LOA 1 (Disability Evaluation System), LOA 3  (Case Management), and LOA 8 (Personnel, Pay, and Financial Support).  The Executive Secretariat office is responsible for performance planning,  performance management, and SOC support functions. According to DOD  officials, the new offices were created to establish permanent  organizations that address a specific set of issues and to enhance  accountability for policy development and implementation as these offices  report directly to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness. Currently, many of the positions in these new  offices, including the director positions, are staffed by officials in an acting  capacity or are unfilled.", "DOD\u2019s changes to the SOC are important because of the potential effects  these changes could have on the development of policy for recovering  servicemembers. However, officials in both DOD and VA have mixed  reactions about the consequences of these changes. Some DOD officials  consider the organizational changes to the SOC to be positive  developments that will enhance the SOC\u2019s effectiveness. They point out  that the SOC\u2019s temporary staffing situation needed to be addressed, and  also that the two new offices were created to support the SOC and provide  focus on the implementation of key policy initiatives developed by the  SOC\u2014primarily the disability evaluation system pilot and the new case  management programs. In contrast, others are concerned by DOD\u2019s  changes, stating that the new organizations disrupt the unity of command  that once characterized the SOC\u2019s management because personnel within  the SOC organization now report to three different officials within DOD  and VA. However, it is too soon to determine how well DOD\u2019s new  structure will work in conjunction with the SOC. DOD and VA officials we  spoke with told us that the SOC\u2019s work groups continue to carry out their  roles and responsibilities.", "Finally, according to DOD and VA officials, the scope of responsibilities of  both the SOC and the DOD and VA Joint Executive Council appear to be in  flux and may evolve further still. According to DOD and VA officials,  changes to the oversight responsibilities of the SOC and the Joint  Executive Council are causing confusion. While the SOC will remain  responsible for policy matters directly related to recovering  servicemembers, a number of policy issues may now be directed to the  Joint Executive Council, including issues that the SOC had previously  addressed. For example, management oversight of many of LOA 4\u2019s  responsibilities (DOD and VA Data Sharing) has transitioned from the SOC  to the IPO, which reports primarily to the Joint Executive Council. It is not  clear how the IPO will ensure effective coordination with the SOC\u2019s LOAs  for overseeing the development of information technology applications for  the disability evaluation system pilot and the individual recovery plans for  the Federal Recovery Coordination Program. Given that information  technology support for two key SOC initiatives is identified in the joint  DOD/VA Information Interoperability Plan, if the IPO and the SOC do not  effectively coordinate with one another, the result may negatively affect  the development of improved policies for recovering servicemembers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD and VA for comment.
