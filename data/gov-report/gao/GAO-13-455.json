However, HUD has not yet fully implemented any of these practices in executing and managing the information technology (IT) projects associated with these efforts. Specifically, while the department had developed project management artifacts such as charters and requirements management plans, none of these documents included all of the key details that could facilitate effective management of its projects such as full descriptions of the work necessary to complete the projects, cost and schedule baselines, or prioritized requirements, among other things. Department officials attributed these deficiencies to a lack of project management expertise.", "Because HUD has not taken these foundational steps to fully define its modernization efforts, the department is not well positioned to successfully manage or execute the associated projects. These incomplete documents limit the department's ability to fully understand the work to be completed or accurately report project progress. A major reason for these information deficiencies is HUD's inadequate development and use of its project management framework, which did not ensure the quality or completeness of artifacts developed. Specifically, the framework did not always include essential guidance and, in other cases, the projects did not always implement the guidance provided. Further, the governance structure did not consistently operate as intended to provide adequate oversight to ensure compliance with key project management practices. As a result, the department increases the risk of continuing to inadequately apply project management practices and may not be positioned to effectively manage or report progress of its key modernization efforts. Fully implementing effective project management practices is critical for the success of these two modernization efforts and others under way or planned."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HUD establish a plan of action to fully implement best practices, provide needed project management expertise, and improve the development and use of its project management framework and governance structure.

In this regard, our  specific objective was to identify the extent to which the department has  implemented key project management practices for the FHA  Transformation and NGMS modernization efforts.", "To address this objective, we examined all of the 14 projects for FHA  Transformation and NGMS that had been identified in the department\u2019s  fiscal year 2011 expenditure plan. We assessed these projects against  key IT management practices in the areas of (1) project planning, (2)  requirements management, and (3) acquisition planning. As part of our  analysis, we reviewed HUD project management documentation for the  14 FHA Transformation and NGMS projects, including charters, work  breakdown structures (which define the necessary work and provide a  basis for cost and schedule estimates), project management plans,  requirements management plans and traceability matrixes (which provide  the ability to follow a requirement from origin to implementation), and  acquisition strategies. We assessed whether this documentation was  consistent with project management practices identified by the Project  Management Institute (PMI) and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI),  and best practices we previously identified for cost estimating and project  schedules. We also attended the department\u2019s project management  meetings to observe how the identified practices were being applied.

In August 2009, HUD published the  FHA Office of Housing Information Technology Strategy and  Improvement Plan, which identified and prioritized 25 IT areas with  performance gaps for its single-family housing, multifamily housing  development and rental assistance, health care facilities programs, and  enterprise applications. In May 2010, FHA Transformation began  planning and executing modernization efforts aimed at addressing the  gaps identified in the plan. Specifically, the modernization initiative is  intended to implement technology within the following four functional  areas aimed at addressing changes in FHA\u2019s business model, operating  environment, and components of the loan life cycle:  Infrastructure and legacy migration: Provide a scalable  infrastructure to support rules engines, analytics, and reporting  systems, as well as a mechanism for transferring legacy applications  to the new platform.

For example, the Legacy Application Transformation project is  expected to implement a software service tool that aggregates data to  identify emerging issues and trends in borrower risk and fraud by  analyzing the accuracy and validity of verified assets, income, and  employment on individual loans. Other projects within this functional  area include business process reengineering and a pilot designed to  automate and streamline the multifamily housing underwriting  process. Using the new infrastructure, an automated underwriting tool  is expected to be deployed to expand the capabilities for processing  loan applications for insurance programs and replace current systems  (e.g., the Development Application Processing System).", "Counterparty management: Provide applications for improved  performance and compliance of lenders and appraisers through more  proactively identifying risk trends and improving loan file review  techniques. Specific projects include the Lender Electronic  Assessment Portal, a web-based automated delivery of electronic  applications and storage of lender application data that assists with  reviewing new lender applications and requests for annual  recertification to participate in FHA programs. Future plans call for  replacing seven legacy applications.", "Portfolio analysis: Provide tools intended to augment risk monitoring  and management; enhance predictive analytics; provide timely and  flexible reporting; and deliver more accurate, detailed information to  decision makers. For example, the Portfolio Risk Reporting &  Analytics project is intended to provide a web-based software service  tool for modeling FHA program risks.

Thus, it did not reflect the  entire scope of the project and lacked descriptions of the work that would  be performed following the first increment, which is expected to deploy  initial functionality by late summer of 2013. Further, rather than being  organized by deliverables\u2014that is, unique and verifiable products, results,  or capabilities\u2014the draft was organized by life-cycle phases such as  definition and design. As a result, it did not allow for progress to be  measured by deliverable, which would enable more precise identification  and effective mitigation of the root causes for any cost or schedule  overruns.

Moreover, these practices state that to be effective, a project  management plan should identify life-cycle processes to be applied,  outline plans for project tailoring (i.e., determining what processes and  documentation would be necessary to accomplish project objectives),  provide communication techniques to be used, and list management  reviews. Further, building on the initial summary schedule and budget in  the charter, the project management plan should include baseline cost  and schedule estimates developed during planning activities.

Yet, the plan did not indicate if these were considered to be  the project\u2019s schedule and cost baselines against which progress would  be measured. The impact of the lack of clear baselines was evidenced by  inconsistencies between the project management plan and other project  documentation. For example, weekly status reports indicated that the  solution would be implemented by November 2013, rather than by the  July 2013 date identified in the project management plan.

In addition, such baseline information provides managers and  sponsors the foundational basis for measuring project progress. Relying  on information reported to an external entity such as OMB rather than on  cost and schedule baselines to manage projects may not allow the project  manager to have accurate real-time information available when  responding to stakeholder interests regarding the status of project  progress.

Further, the NGMS  Budget Forecasting and Formulation project developed a matrix that used  a unique identifier that allowed traceability from 15 high-level  requirements to more detailed functional requirements. In addition, these  requirements and the traceability matrix were approved by the  appropriate stakeholders.

Specifically, in examining documentation for control gate  reviews, we found that the Technical Review Subcommittee did not  consistently operate as intended or use the guidance provided in the  department\u2019s framework. While the department\u2019s framework outlines  processes for conducting control gate reviews of projects and provides  templates to be used, the reviews were conducted without using the  framework guidance.

Specifically, we assessed  whether project charters addressed important elements such as the  project purpose or justification, the project manager\u2019s responsibility  and authority level, and the name and responsibility of the project  sponsor. We assessed whether the work breakdown structures were  deliverable-oriented hierarchical decompositions of the work to be  executed and had associated dictionaries.

A charter formally authorizes a project and identifies high-level  information that constitutes and assigns responsibility for project success.  This is a critical artifact for creating project management plans,  documenting business needs, and outlining the result a project is  intended to achieve. Specifically, to be effective, project management  practices state that a charter should include high-level requirements; high-level project description; high-level risks; measurable objectives and related success criteria; project approval requirements (e.g., what results in project success  the project\u2019s purpose or justification;  summary milestone schedule;  summary budget;  and who is responsible for final sign off); assigned project manager, responsibility and authority level; and the name and authority of the sponsor or other person(s) authorizing  the project charter.", "According to best practices, a work breakdown structure is the  cornerstone of every project because it defines in detail the work  necessary to accomplish a project\u2019s objectives and provides a basic  framework for a variety of related activities like estimating costs,  developing schedules, identifying resources, and determining where  risks may occur. In the context of the work breakdown structure, work  refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of effort and not  to the effort itself. Creating a work breakdown structure involves  subdividing (or decomposing) project deliverables and work into smaller,  more manageable components (called work packages) that can be  scheduled, cost estimated, and managed. According to best practices,  the work breakdown structure is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical  decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team to  accomplish the project\u2019s objectives and create the required deliverables.  Further, these practices state that a work breakdown structure should  also represent the entire scope of the project and product work, including  project management, and it should be standardized to enable an  organization to collect and share data among projects. In addition, it  should be accompanied by a dictionary of the various work breakdown  structure elements that describes in brief narrative form what work is to  be performed in each element.", "As we have previously reported, agencies need to develop  comprehensive project management plans, and best practices emphasize  the importance of having a plan in place that, among other things,  establishes a complete description that ties together all activities and  evolves over time to continuously reflect the current status and desired  end point of the project. According to project management practices, a  project management plan is the primary source that defines, among other  things, how the project is to be executed and controlled. Project  management plans can be either summary level or detailed and can be  composed of one or more subsidiary plans to address elements of project  management. To be effective, best practices state that a project  management plan integrates cost and schedule baselines from planning  activities, and this baseline information should be updated as needed and  periodically compared with actual performance data in order to track and  report progress. While the content of a project management plan will vary  depending upon the type and complexity of a project, it is developed  through a series of integrated processes and is progressively elaborated  by updates during the execution and management of a project. Such  plans include  identification of the projected life cycle and processes to be applied to  each phase;  results of project tailoring; how the team will execute the work to accomplish project objectives; project cost and schedule baselines; how the team will maintain the integrity of performance measurement a change management plan that documents how changes will be  baselines;  the needs and techniques for communicating among stakeholders;  key management reviews; a configuration management plan to define those items that are  configurable, those items that require formal change control, and the  process for controlling change to such items; and  subsidiary management plans (scope, requirements, schedule, cost,  quality, process improvement, human resources, communication, risk  and procurement).", "According to project management practices, effective planning of  requirements includes documenting the processes and methods to be  used for effectively developing and managing requirements from initial  identification through implementation. A project\u2019s success is directly  influenced by the care taken in capturing and managing requirements.  Other essential planning activities such as developing a work breakdown  structure or estimating a project\u2019s cost and schedule are built upon  requirements developed. Best practices state that in establishing  requirements, project teams should plan requirements collection activities  such as conducting interviews, focus groups, facilitated workshops, or  other techniques, including surveys and prototypes. Depending on the  type of project, the approach for managing requirements can vary, but  requirements management plans document the approach for how  requirements development activities will be conducted. In particular, a  plan includes how requirements activities (e.g., collecting requirements) will be  planned, tracked, and reported;  configuration management activities such as how changes will be  initiated, analyzed, and managed;  requirements prioritization methods; product metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and a traceability structure outlining attributes for a traceability matrix and  identifying what other project documents requirements will be traced  to.", "Project management practices state that requirements traceability  matrixes are designed to support backward traceability by linking each  requirement to the broader business objective it supports and forward  traceability by linking these requirements to more detailed functional  requirements. Traceability refers to the ability to follow a requirement from  origin to implementation and is critical to understanding the  interconnections and dependencies among the individual requirements  and the impact when a requirement is changed. This bidirectional  traceability can help management determine whether the project  addresses all requirements and that those requirements and the related  deliverables are traceable back to valid business needs. According to  best practices, requirement matrixes provide tracing to business needs, opportunities, goals and objectives; high-level requirements to more detailed requirements; criteria used for evaluation and acceptance of the requirements; a set of approved requirements; and status of requirement changes and requests.", "Further, matrixes should have specific attributes recorded for each  requirement. Attributes associated with each requirement\u2014such as a  unique identifier, textual description, priority, version, current status, and  date completed\u2014should be recorded.", "According to best practices, effective IT project management also  involves early planning for and management of acquisitions. The  planning process begins with the identification of project needs which can  best be, or must be, met by acquiring products, services, or results  outside of the organization. During planning, coordination of the  acquisition with other project management activities, such as budgeting,  scheduling, resource estimating, risk identification, and requirements  definition, should be discussed and documented. Most organizations  have documented policies and procedures specifically defining mandatory  acquisition activities for obtaining contracted goods or services. The  acquisition planning process should result in a plan or strategy that  describes how management decisions will be applied for a particular  project. Such strategies serve as the road map for effectively planning  and managing acquisitions from initiation through contract closure. In  particular, project management practices indicate that acquisition  strategies should provide guidance for defining the types of contracts to be used; addressing risk management issues; coordinating procurement with other project aspects, such as  scheduling and performance reporting;  setting the scheduled dates in contracts for determining dates for  deliverables and coordinating with other project management  processes; and establishing procurement metrics to be used in managing and  evaluating contractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Teresa M.
