Several schools we interviewed reported that a primary reason to become a FFELP lender was to generate more revenue for the school. About 80 percent of school lenders in school year 2003-2004 were private nonprofit schools, and almost all of them had graduate and professional programs in medicine, law, or business. Most school lenders have contracted with other FFELP organizations to administer their loan programs and subsequently have sold their loans to earn revenue, but school lenders differed in terms of how they financed the loans made and when they sold their loans. About a third of the school lenders we interviewed used their own money to finance the loans they made, while the others obtained lines of credit from a bank or secondary market lender, in some cases from the same organization that eventually purchased the loans disbursed by the school lender. Most schools we interviewed reported using or planning to use revenues earned from the sale of loans to lower student borrowing costs or provide need-based aid. A number of statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to all lenders and schools, and some applicable only to school lenders, exist to safeguard the interests of taxpayers and borrowers. FSA, however, has little information about how school lenders' have complied with FFELP regulations. Under the HEA, FFELP lenders that originate or hold more than $5 million in FFELP loans must submit annually audited financial statements and compliance audits. In October 2004, FSA discovered that 10 of 29 school lenders required to submit an audit for fiscal year 2002 had not done so. Moreover, FSA has not conducted program reviews of school lenders. However, during the course of our review, three regional offices asked 31 school lenders about their compliance with the regulation pertaining to the use of interest income and special allowance payments for need-based grants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended, established the  Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), which provided about $65 billion in student loans in fiscal year 2004 and is the largest source of federal financial aid for students and their families. A number of for-profit commercial, nonprofit, and public agencies are involved in the program,  including originating lenders, secondary markets, postsecondary  institutions (schools), and the Department of Education (Education).  Commercial and nonprofit lenders\u2014such as banks and state-designated  agencies\u2014provide loan capital, and the federal government guarantees  these loans against substantially all loss through borrower default. Originating lenders often sell their loans to secondary markets, thereby  obtaining additional capital to make new loans and receiving premium  revenues\u2014payments from loan buyers that are calculated as a percentage  of the face value of the loans sold. Lenders that hold loans receive interest income paid by borrowers and in some cases special allowance payments  from the federal government for the loans they hold. Schools assess  students\u2019 levels of financial need, certify borrower eligibility for loans, and disburse loan proceeds to students. Education\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is responsible for overall program administration and ensuring  compliance with laws and regulations.", "When FFELP was created, in 1965, Congress broadly defined eligible  lenders\u2014including schools\u2014to ensure that students would be able to locate a lender. Schools that are FFELP lenders primarily make loans to  graduate students because of statutory limitations on lending to  undergraduates. As we and various news media have reported, schools,  including those that have participated in the federal government\u2019s other  major student loan program\u2014the William D. Ford Direct Student Loan  Program (FDLP), created in 1993\u2014are becoming increasingly interested in  entering the student loan business as lenders. The possibility of an  increasing number of schools becoming FFELP lenders and receiving  revenues from the loans they make has raised concerns. Specifically,  questions have been raised about whether it is appropriate for schools to  become lenders, given that they both determine students\u2019 eligibility for  loans and in some cases set the price of attendance. Additional concerns  have been raised about the propriety of the schools\u2019 contractual  relationships with other FFELP participants and whether these  relationships create an incentive for schools to encourage student  borrowing. In light of these issues and the pending reauthorization of the  HEA, we are providing information and analysis on three issues:  1. \t To what extent have schools participated in FFELP as lenders and  what are their characteristics?  2. \t How have schools structured their lending operations and what are the  benefits for schools and borrowers?  3. \t What statutory and regulatory safeguards exist to protect the interests  of taxpayers and borrowers?", "To assess the extent to which schools have participated in FFELP as  lenders, we analyzed data from Education\u2019s information systems on school  lenders\u2019 loan volume in each school year from 1993\u20131994 to 2003\u20132004,  which we converted to real 2003 dollars; the amount of loans made by  other FFELP lenders for students attending these schools; and  characteristics of school lenders, such as whether they are private or  public schools. On the basis of our review of the documentation for these  data and our discussions with Education officials about the steps they take  to ensure the reliability and validity of these data, we determined that the  data from these systems were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our  study. To assess school lending operations and benefits to schools and  borrowers, we conducted site visits and interviews with 13 school lenders  and reviewed their contracts with other lenders and servicers. We also  interviewed 12 other lenders, including secondary markets; 2 state- designated guaranty agencies, which perform a variety of administrative  functions on behalf of the federal government in the FFELP; and related  higher education and financial aid associations. We also interviewed  officials of all schools that were lenders in school year 2003\u20132004 or  planning to lend in 2004\u20132005, to gather information on what type of  lender purchased their loans. To assess existing safeguards for borrowers  and taxpayers, we reviewed the HEA, related regulations, guidance issued  by Education, and court decisions. We also interviewed officials in  Education\u2019s FSA, Office of General Counsel, Office of Inspector General,  and Office of Postsecondary Education.

In fiscal year 2004, about $65 billion was disbursed  through FFELP and about $19 billion was disbursed through FDLP.", "Since FFELP (originally called the guaranteed student loan program) was  created in the HEA of 1965, the student loan market has changed  significantly. First, there has been a dramatic growth in student loan  volume, with more students relying on private loans, which are not part of  FFELP, than at any point in the past. Combined with the recent increases  in tuition rates and thus in the revenues generated by school tuition, this  makes the student loan market an important economic concern. Second, a  few very large lenders provide the capital for most of the loan volume.  Specifically, in fiscal year 2003, 10 lenders originated 54 percent of all  FFELP loans. Third, the creation of FDLP in 1993 and the significant  growth of private alternative nonfederal loans have increased competition  across loan programs. The primary result of this competition has been an  improvement in benefits for borrowers and of loan management in both  FFELP and FDLP, with most loans today being originated, disbursed, and  serviced electronically, according to financial aid officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disbursing Loans through FFELP", "paragraphs": ["In order to receive a Stafford loan through FFELP, students must fill out  and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).

Lenders provide the capital for loans to  both undergraduate and graduate students. Under the HEA, eligible FFELP  lenders include banks, postsecondary schools, credit unions, and state  nonprofit agencies. For a lender to originate a loan, the school must certify  that a student is enrolled and therefore eligible to receive a loan, and the  borrower must complete a promissory note.", "After a loan is disbursed to a borrower, lenders may either service or sell  their loans. Servicing includes sending bills to borrowers and collecting  loan payments after the loan has entered repayment. Lenders may contract  with an outside organization for loan servicing. Lenders also have the  option of selling loans to a secondary market, thereby freeing up capital to  make additional student loans. To encourage lenders\u2019 participation in  FFELP, the federal government guarantees FFELP lenders a minimum rate  of return, called the lender yield. When the interest rate paid by borrowers  is below the lender yield, the federal government makes special allowance  payments. Lenders receive these special allowance payments for loans  that they hold.", "State-designated guaranty agencies, which are nonprofit organizations  designated by the state to administer FFELP loans, perform a variety of  administrative functions under the program.

About a third of  the school lenders we interviewed used their own money to finance the  loans they made, while the others obtained a line of credit, in some cases  from the same organization that eventually purchased the loans originated  by the school lender. Some school lenders used the same organization to  finance, originate, service, and purchase their loans.

In this example, the school  received financing from a bank and loan servicing from a private nonprofit  company and eventually sold the loans to a state secondary market.", "Further, one school lender we interviewed had a unique approach in how  it structured its lending program. The actual lender was a foundation  affiliated with the school because state law prohibits public schools from  incurring debt in that state. According to a school official, the foundation  finances the loans, provides them to borrowers, collects interest payments  from borrowers and special allowance payments from Education, and is  responsible for having the loans serviced until they are later sold to the  secondary market. After the foundation covers its administrative  expenses, the official stated it gives the school any remaining money. As  shown in figure 6, the foundation contracted with a secondary market, in  this example a state agency, to originate, service, guarantee, and purchase  the loans.", "By and large, school lenders contracted with others to operate their  lending program, but some school lenders reported that it was beneficial  to assume financing, origination, or servicing responsibilities themselves  rather than contract with others. For example, four school lenders used  endowment or other institutional funds to finance their loans, and one  school lender\u2019s affiliated foundation issued a taxable bond to raise the  funds needed to finance the loans. One school lender that used its own  funds also performed its own loan origination.

Typically, officials from school lenders that sold the loans before 90 days  after they were fully disbursed reported doing so in part to minimize risk  associated with potential default on loans and associated servicing costs.  Moreover, some school lenders reported that they preferred to make and  sell loans within the same fiscal year so that they could repay lines of  credit to avoid having to record outstanding debt on the school\u2019s annual  financial statements. For one school lender it was important not to record  additional debt because of concerns about the impact of such debt on the  school\u2019s bond rating. The school lender that sold the loans a week after  first disbursement received the premium much sooner than those schools  that sold the loans after full disbursement. Two school lenders that sold  loans after the student had graduated or left the school were private  schools with sufficient resources to finance the loans and were not as  concerned about financial liability or receiving revenue quickly.", "Several of the school lenders we interviewed reported that operating as a  lender was only marginally more labor intensive and costly than the  traditional processes for schools that are not FFELP lenders, and that the  premium received when loans are sold makes being a lender worthwhile.  Generally, school lenders incur initial start-up and ongoing costs when  serving as a FFELP lender. Start-up costs can include staff time to  research and sign contracts with other FFELP participants and training  staff on new software to process loans. Ongoing costs include payment of  a 0.5 percent fee to the federal government for each loan and staff to  manage the loan process and originate and service loans. The extent of  these costs borne by a school lender depended on how school lenders  negotiated their contracts, with some negotiating contracts in which they  did not have to pay for costs normally paid by FFELP lenders. For  example, school lenders we interviewed that obtained a line of credit to  finance their FFELP loans typically were charged market interest rates on  the money borrowed. However, according to one contract, the secondary  market that provided the line of credit for the school lender to finance its  loans did not charge the school lender interest. In exchange, this school  lender sold a legal interest in the loans on the day they are first disbursed,  entitling this secondary market to all principal payments, accrued interest,  government subsidies, and special allowance payments. Additionally,  several of the school lenders did not pay for loan servicing, while most  school lenders interviewed paid about $2 a month per loan for servicing.  Moreover, one school lender also told us that it receives a special rate on  private loans offered to students to supplement FFELP loans from the  purchaser because of the volume of graduate loans it sells."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many School Lenders Reported Using or Planning to Use the Money from Selling Loans to Lower Borrowing Costs or Provide Need-Based Aid, but They Are Not Required to Do So", "paragraphs": ["Many school lenders interviewed reported using the premium received on  the sale of the loans to lower borrowing costs and provide need-based aid  to students, although current law does not specify how premiums should  be used. The premiums that school lenders receive are based on several  factors, such as the default rate of the students attending the school, the  average amount borrowed by students, and the number of loans per  borrower. Some school lenders received a fixed premium for their loan  portfolio, while other schools were paid a variable premium that  corresponded to the average amount borrowed. For example, one school  lender\u2019s premium increased by 0.25 percentage points for nearly all  increases of $1,000 in the average amount borrowed by students. The  premiums received by school lenders we interviewed ranged from 1.85  percent to 6 percent of the total value of the loans sold, with an average  premium of 4.4 percent.", "Unlike special allowance payments and interest income that under HEA  must be used for need-based grants, school lenders may choose how they  use premiums received when selling loans. Premiums are the primary  source of revenue for many school lenders since most choose to quickly  sell loans, thereby giving up the right to receive special allowance  payments and interest income. Officials from several school lenders  emphasized that as their financial budgets have been constrained, the  revenue received from being a lender is a primary motivation for becoming  a school lender. For example, one large public school lender estimated  that it will receive about $7.5 million over a 3-year period. A smaller  private school lender estimated it will receive less than $1 million over the  next 3 years. Most of the school lenders interviewed reported that they  used or plan to use premium money for student financial aid. However,  they differed in how they allocated the money. For example, two school  lenders reported using premium revenues to pay part of the origination fee  for borrowers and generate revenue for need-based aid, while another  school lender reported using premium revenue for only need-based aid.  School lenders either used money to lower borrowing costs and/or provide  need-based grants to its students. For some school lenders, the financial  benefits offered to students who borrow through them are better than  those offered prior to the school becoming a lender.", "Although most of the school lenders reported using the premium revenues  to provide financial benefits for students, under current law they could use  the money to meet other institutional needs, such as student recruitment  or facility improvement. One school lender told us that it does not plan to  use premium revenue for need-based aid but instead will use it for  initiatives that would improve students\u2019 educational environment, such as  enhancing technological equipment. Legislation proposed in the House of  Representatives in May 2004 would require school lenders to use the  premium for need-based aid. Generally, school officials told us that the  requirement seems reasonable because most of the school lenders already  use the revenue for that purpose. According to officials from two school  lenders, they plan to use the premium for need-based aid but are still  determining specifically how the money will be allocated. One school  lender noted that the premium is applied to the school\u2019s general operating  budget and that it is used in part for need-based aid.", "The school lenders we interviewed differed in the loan origination and  guarantor fees charged to borrowers as well as repayment terms offered,  and certain school lenders offered more financial benefits to borrowers  than others. Four of the 13 school lenders we interviewed waived  origination fees for their students. Additionally, several school lenders  used guaranty agencies that did not charge or reduced the guarantor fee.  Moreover, some school lenders sold their loans to secondary markets that  offered better repayment terms than others, such as interest-rate  reductions and principal rebates for timely payments.

For example, one school lender contracted with a  state agency for the sale of its loans because the state agency agreed to  pay the origination fees for borrowers, reduce borrowers\u2019 interest rate to 0  percent if they made the first 36 payments on time, and reduce interest  rates 0.25 percent for making payments electronically. Officials from two  state agencies that purchase loans from school lenders said they were able  to fund borrower benefits to residents of their state or students attending  schools in the state in part with earnings from loans financed with tax- exempt bonds issued by their states prior to October 1, 1993. The federal  government guarantees holders of loans financed with such bonds a  minimum 9.5 percent yield, providing these agencies a source of relatively  higher revenues in light of low current market interest rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Number of Statutory and Regulatory Provisions Exist to Safeguard the Interests of Taxpayers and Borrowers, but FSA Has Not Regularly Monitored School Lenders\u2019 Compliance with the Provisions", "paragraphs": ["A number of statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to all lenders  and schools, and some applicable only to school lenders, exist to  safeguard the interests of taxpayers and borrowers.

These  include whether the applicant is capable of implementing adequate procedures for  making, servicing, and collecting loans;  the financial resources of the applicant; and  in the case of a school that is seeking approval as a lender, its  accreditation status.", "Additionally, under the HEA, all FFELP lenders that originate or hold more  than $5 million in FFELP loans must have an independent annual  compliance audit, which examines the lender\u2019s compliance with the HEA  and relevant regulations as well as its financial management of FFELP  activities. Lenders must then submit this audit to FSA. About 17 percent of  the school lenders in school year 2003\u20132004 did not originate more than  $5 million and therefore were not required to have a compliance audit.

Education once attempted to  enforce the anti-inducement provision with respect to school lenders.  Specifically, Education proposed to limit the participation of a secondary  market based on its financing and purchasing contracts with a school  lender. Education contended that these contracts provided the school with  an improper financial inducement to solicit more loan applications from  students than it would have otherwise. The secondary market challenged  Education\u2019s actions in federal district court, which found that the school  lender\u2019s financing, servicing, and loan purchase contracts were not  uncommon among traditional FFELP lenders. Moreover, the premium paid  and other economic benefits received by the school lender were  unremarkable and did not rise to the level of an improper inducement. The  court found also that there was no evidence that borrowers were  counseled improperly or encouraged to borrow more than they needed.  Finally, while the court pointed out that under the anti-inducement  provision, lenders are prohibited from offering \u201cinducements\u201d to  educational institutions, including school lenders, it found that Congress\u2019  intent was unclear.

The lack of clarity  surrounding the issue of inducements is not solely a problem for school  lenders. In an August 2003 memo, Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General  (OIG) noted that it had concerns about bargaining practices between  schools and lenders for private loans that students may obtain to  supplement FFELP loans and preferred lender status that may violate the  anti-inducement provision. OIG recommended that Education reevaluate  the anti-inducement provision and determine if statutory revisions should  be proposed during HEA reauthorization, but Education has not taken any  action in response to OIG\u2019s memo.

Congress was also  concerned that schools were determining the cost of attendance and also  awarding students financial aid while investing few resources in  preventing loan default. While there was pressure from some groups for  Congress to eliminate the school lender provision in the 1976  reauthorization of the HEA, there were still concerns about students\u2019  access to loans and school lenders\u2019 roles in helping meet students\u2019 need.  Rather than eliminating school lenders, Congress enacted and revised  several provisions designed to reduce the number of school lenders with  abusive practices that contributed to high default rates. In 1992, Congress  added another requirement specific to school lenders that they use interest  income and special allowance payments for need-based grants.

FSA was unaware that in fiscal  year 2004, one school lender who received a lender identification number,  which is needed to originate loans, had been placed on probation by its  accrediting agency. According to the accrediting agency, the school lender  was on probation because of concerns about the school\u2019s financial  stability. In general, the lack of financial stability at a school can have a  serious impact on the funding of instructional programs, the quality of  learning resources available to students, and the number of faculty and  staff employed.", "FSA is also responsible for ensuring that lenders submit required annual  compliance audits that attest to the lender\u2019s financial stability and  compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance audits are but one  source of information about a lender\u2019s compliance with laws and  regulations and are a mechanism to assess an organization\u2019s internal  controls. Without these audits, Education\u2019s ability to monitor and detect  significant fraud or other illegal acts is compromised. Compliance audits  are generally due 6 to 9 months after the end of the lender\u2019s fiscal year. If  a lender does not submit the compliance audit, then Education may  suspend the lender\u2019s participation in the FFELP program. For fiscal year  2002, FSA did not verify, on a timely basis, that all school lenders required  to submit compliance audits, which were due between June and August  2003, had done so. As a result, FSA did not realize, until September 2004,  that 10 of 29 school lenders had failed to submit required compliance  audits for fiscal year 2002. Moreover, while FSA had previously notified 6  of these 10 school lenders that FSA had not received the required  compliance audits, it had not yet notified the remaining 4 schools of their  failure to submit such audits. FSA subsequently reminded the 4 school  lenders to submit their required compliance audits and suspended the  remaining 6 school lenders from receiving interest and special allowance  payments for their failure to submit compliance audits. After FSA  contacted or suspended the school lenders in September 2004, 3 school  lenders subsequently submitted their fiscal year 2002 compliance audits.

FSA is planning  to conduct a more thorough review of 10 school lenders to gain a further  understanding of how school lenders are structuring their lending  programs. FSA officials reported that school lenders will be selected based  on several risk factors, such as a large increase in loan volume or an  increase in default rates. As part of these reviews, FSA will follow the  review guide used for traditional lenders, and it will also review contracts  to ensure there are no violations of the anti-inducement provision and that  fee arrangements are appropriate.

Postsecondary schools were included in the definition of  eligible FFELP lenders as one way to help ensure that all students would  have access to student loans. In recent years, an increasing number of  schools are becoming FFELP lenders as a way to generate more revenue  for the school, rather than ensure students\u2019 access to loans. As the number  of schools becoming lenders continues to increase, it is critical for FSA to  ensure school lenders\u2019 compliance with laws and regulations designed to  ensure program integrity, thereby protecting taxpayer dollars and student  interests. For one such requirement\u2014annual submission of compliance  audits\u2014FSA has not ensured that school lenders have submitted them in a  timely manner. Without this information, FSA is unaware of, among other  things, whether school lenders disburse loans only to eligible students in  accordance with the law and are financially stable. A school\u2019s financial  stability is important because if a school is unable to meet its financial  obligations, it may place into jeopardy students\u2019 completion of their  educational programs and, in turn, their ability to repay their student  loans.
