For both reports, GAO reviewed relevant requirements and visited 10 VA facilities. For its report on the oversight and management of the Non-VA Medical Care Program, GAO reviewed non-VA medical care spending and utilization data from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012. For its report on the Millennium Act emergency care benefit, GAO reviewed 128 denied Millennium Act claims to determine the accuracy of processing decisions.", "GAO made numerous recommendations to VA in the two prior reports related to improving (1) data on wait times and cost-effectiveness for non-VA medical care; (2) compliance with claims processing requirements; and (3) veterans' knowledge of non-VA medical care eligibility.

The lack of data on wait times limits VA's efforts to effectively oversee the Non-VA Medical Care Program because it is not possible for VA to determine if veterans who receive care from non-VA providers are receiving that care sooner than they would in VA facilities. In addition, GAO found that VA cannot assess the cost-effectiveness of non-VA medical care because it cannot analyze data on all services and charges for an episode of care, which is a combined total of all care provided to a veteran during a single office visit or inpatient stay. As a result, VA cannot determine whether delivering care through non-VA providers is more cost-effective than augmenting its own capacity in areas with high utilization of non-VA medical care.", "GAO's March 2014 report found patterns of noncompliance with applicable requirements for processing emergency care claims covered under the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (Millennium Act) at each of the four VA facilities visited. This led to the inappropriate denial of some claims and the failure to notify veterans that their claims had been denied at these facilities. The Millennium Act authorizes VA to cover emergency care for conditions not related to veterans' service-connected disabilities when veterans who have no other health plan coverage receive care at non-VA providers and meet other specified criteria. Specifically, GAO determined that about 20 percent of the 128 claims it reviewed had been denied inappropriately, and almost 65 percent of the reviewed claims lacked documentation showing that the veterans were informed their claims were denied and explained their appeal rights. As a result of GAO's review, the VA facilities reconsidered and paid 25 claims that they initially had inappropriately denied. GAO also found that there is significant risk that these patterns of noncompliance will continue because VA's existing oversight mechanisms do not focus on whether VA facilities appropriately approve or deny non-VA medical care claims or fail to notify veterans that their claims have been denied.", "GAO also reported in March 2014 that gaps exist in veterans' knowledge about eligibility criteria for Millennium Act emergency care, and communication weaknesses exist between VA and non-VA providers. Specifically, GAO found that veterans' lack of understanding about their emergency care benefits under the Millennium Act presents risks for potentially negative effects on veterans' health because they may forgo treatment at non-VA providers, and on veterans' finances because they may assume VA will pay for care in situations that do not meet VA criteria. Despite VA's efforts to improve communications, some non-VA providers reported instances in which VA facilities' claims processing staff were unresponsive to their questions about submitted claims."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Department of  Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) delivery of care through its Non-VA Medical Care  Program. The majority of veterans enrolled in the VA health care system  receive care in VA-operated medical facilities, such as VA medical  centers and community-based outpatient clinics. However, VA is  authorized to obtain health care services from non-VA providers to help  ensure that veterans are provided timely and accessible care. For  example, VA may utilize non-VA medical care when a VA facility is unable  to provide certain specialty care services, such as cardiology or  orthopedics, or when a veteran would have to travel long distances to  obtain care at a VA medical facility. Non-VA providers treat veterans in  non-VA facilities, such as physicians\u2019 offices or hospitals in the  community. Non-VA providers are commonly paid by VA using a fee-for- service arrangement. In fiscal year 2013, VA spent about $4.8 billion on  non-VA medical care for more than 1 million veterans, which accounted  for about 11.6 percent of VA\u2019s total medical services budget for that year.", "There are two main non-VA medical care delivery methods\u2014 preauthorized care and emergency care\u2014that are approved using two  different processes. The first, preauthorized care, is approved in advance  by VA facility officials. VA may authorize veterans to seek care from non- VA providers for a number of reasons, including when (1) wait times for  appointments at VA facilities exceed VA standards; (2) the distance  veterans must travel to VA facilities is impractical for the veteran; and   (3) VA facilities do not offer the medical services the veteran needs.  Preauthorized care accounts for the majority of spending and utilization  (about 60 percent of spending and about 88 percent of utilization) for the  Non-VA Medical Care Program. The second, emergency care, is not  typically approved in advance by VA facility officials and has certain  criteria that must be met in order for VA to approve reimbursement for the  non-VA provider.", "In response to serious and longstanding problems regarding the timely  scheduling of veterans\u2019 appointments in VA facilities that have been  highlighted in recent congressional oversight hearings, VA has  announced its intention to allow additional veterans to be treated through  its Non-VA Medical Care Program. With this likely increase in the  utilization of non-VA medical care, it is not only important to ensure that  veterans will obtain timely treatment from non-VA providers, but also to  ensure that non-VA medical care is a reliable and cost-effective means  for VA to deliver services. Today, I will address the extent to which (1) VA  collects reliable information on wait times and cost-effectiveness of the  Non-VA Medical Care Program; (2) VA facilities comply with claims  processing requirements for emergency care provided under the  Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (Millennium Act), and  the extent to which VA oversees facilities\u2019 claims processing activities;  and (3) VA educates veterans about eligibility for Millennium Act  emergency care and communicates with non-VA providers about claims  processing.", "My statement is based on the key findings of two GAO reports that  identified weaknesses in VA\u2019s management and oversight of its Non-VA  Medical Care Program: a March 2014 report entitled VA Health Care:  Actions Needed to Improve Administration and Oversight of Veterans\u2019  Millennium Act Emergency Care Benefit, and a May 2013 report entitled  VA Health Care: Management and Oversight of Fee Basis Care Need  Improvement. For the March 2014 report, which focused on VA\u2019s administration and oversight of Millennium Act emergency care delivered  to veterans by non-VA providers, we reviewed the law, its implementing  regulations, and applicable VA policies and guidance to identify  applicable requirements for processing these claims. We then visited four  VA facilities that were selected on the basis of fiscal year 2012 spending  totals and geographic location and reviewed VA documents\u2014including  128 Millennium Act emergency care claims that these four facilities had  denied in fiscal year 2012. We also interviewed officials from VA, non-VA  providers, and veterans service organizations. For the May 2013 report,  which focused on VA\u2019s management and oversight of non-VA medical  care spending and utilization, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations,  VA policies, and spending and utilization data on non-VA medical care  from fiscal years 2008 through 2012. We also interviewed VA officials and  examined the non-VA medical care operations at six selected VA facilities  that varied in size, services offered, and geographic location. The results  of both of these studies cannot be generalized to all VA facilities, but they  illustrate the serious weaknesses in various aspects of the Non-VA  Medical Care Program. We have made numerous recommendations to  VA in these previous reports, and VA has concurred with all of them. We  are not making any new recommendations at this time.

Specifically, the non-VA  provider submits a claim to either a Veterans Integrated Service Network  (VISN) or a VA facility for payment following the veteran\u2019s treatment. In  some VISNs, claims processing activities are centralized in a VISN-level  department that is responsible for reviewing claims from non-VA  providers, obtaining copies of medical records for veterans\u2019 non-VA  medical care, and approving payment to non-VA providers. In other  VISNs, these claims-processing activities are decentralized and are the  responsibility of individual VA facilities. After VA facility or VISN officials  review the claims for accuracy, non-VA providers are reimbursed by VA.  (See fig. 2.)", "To process all claims for non-VA medical care, VA facilities use software  called the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS). FBCS is primarily a  system that helps VA facilities administer payments to non-VA providers,  as opposed to a system that automatically applies relevant criteria and  determines whether claims are eligible for payment.

Most notably, VA does not collect data on how long  veterans must wait to be seen by non-VA providers. We previously  reported that the amount of time veterans wait for appointments in VA  facilities influenced VA\u2019s utilization of non-VA medical care. For example,  in our May 2013 report, VA officials from all six facilities we reviewed  reported that they routinely referred veterans to non-VA providers to help  ensure that veterans receive timely care and their facilities meet  performance goals for wait times for VA facility-based care.from one of these VA facilities explained that veterans needing treatment  in several specialties\u2014including audiology, cardiology, and  ophthalmology\u2014were referred to non-VA providers for this reason.", "In fiscal year 2012, VA performance goals for wait times for care in VA  facilities called for veterans\u2019 primary care appointments to be completed  within 7 days of their desired appointment date and veterans\u2019 specialty  care appointments to be scheduled within 14 days of their desired  appointment date. However, since VA did not track wait times for non-VA  providers, little was known about how often veterans\u2019 wait times for non- VA medical care appointments exceeded VA facility-based appointment  wait time goals. Officials from one VA facility we reviewed explained that  non-VA providers in their community also faced capacity limitations and  may not be able to schedule appointments for veterans any sooner than  the VA facility.", "Limitations in the way VA collects non-VA medical care data also did not  allow the Department to analyze the cost-effectiveness of non-VA medical  care provided to veterans. In our May 2013 report, we found that VA  lacked a data system to group medical care delivered by non-VA  providers by episode of care\u2014a combined total of all care provided to a  veteran during a single office visit or inpatient stay. For example, during  an office visit to an orthopedic surgeon for a joint replacement evaluation,  an X-ray for the affected joint may be ordered, the veteran may be given  a blood test, and the veteran may receive a physical evaluation from the  orthopedic surgeon. The non-VA provider would submit a claim to VA for  the office visit, and separate claims would be submitted by the radiologist  that X-rayed the affected joint and the lab that performed the veteran\u2019s  blood test. However, VA\u2019s non-VA medical care data system was not able  to link the charges for these three treatments together. We found that this  left VA without data for comparing the total non-VA medical care costs for  various types of services with the VA facility-based alternative.", "Without cost-effectiveness data, VA is unable to efficiently compare VA  and non-VA options for delivering care in areas with high utilization and  spending for non-VA medical care. Two VA facilities we reviewed had  undertaken such assessments, despite the limitations of current data.  Officials at one facility reported that they expanded their operating room  capacity to reduce their reliance on non-VA surgical services, saving an  estimated $18 million annually in non-VA medical care costs. Similarly,  officials from the second facility reported that they were able to reduce  their reliance on non-VA medical care by hiring additional VA staff and  purchasing additional equipment to perform pulmonary function tests, an  effort that reduced related non-VA medical care costs by about $112,000  between fiscal years 2010 and 2012. The lack of non-VA medical care  data available on an episode of care basis also prevents VA from  efficiently assessing the appropriateness of non-VA provider  reimbursement. Specifically, VA officials cannot conduct retrospective  reviews of VA facilities\u2019 claims to determine if the appropriate rate was  applied for the care provided by non-VA providers.", "To help VA address these concerns, we made two recommendations in  our May 2013 report that directed VA to (1) analyze the amount of time  veterans wait to see non-VA providers and apply the same wait time  goals to non-VA medical care that have been used to assess VA facility- based wait times, and (2) establish a mechanism for analyzing the  episode of care costs for non-VA medical care. VA concurred with these  recommendations. In June 2014, we discussed VA\u2019s progress in  implementing these recommendations with VA officials. These officials  indicated that the Department anticipated being able to track some wait  time information for veterans seen by non-VA providers that VA contracts  with under its new Patient Centered Community Care (PCCC) initiative in  the near term. However, wait time information for all non-VA medical  care will not be readily available until VA completes a redesign of its  claims processing system, which is expected to occur in fiscal year 2016.  With respect to establishing a mechanism to analyze the episode of care  costs for non-VA medical care, VA officials explained that they are in the  process of fully implementing this recommendation by (1) improving  existing data systems to systematically audit claims that include billing  codes typically included in bundled payments while the claims are in a  pre-payment status and to require VA facilities to review these claims  prior to payment, and by (2) making improvements to its Non-VA Medical  Care Program data that would allow all non-VA medical care data to be  analyzed on an episode of care basis.

There are a number of steps in the claims  review process that were susceptible to errors that could lead to  inappropriate denials of non-VA medical care claims. For example, we  found nine instances where VA staff incorrectly determined that non-VA  medical care was not preauthorized when, in fact, a VA clinician had  referred the veteran to the non-VA provider.that VA must notify veterans in writing about denied claims and their  appeal rights. However, we found that one facility we visited could not  produce documentation of veteran notification for any of the 30 denied  claims we reviewed. We concluded that when veterans are not informed  that their claims for non-VA medical care have been denied, and VA has  inappropriately denied the claims, then veterans could become financially  liable for care that VA should have covered.

These  recommendations directed the Department to establish or clarify its  policies or take other actions to improve VA facilities\u2019 compliance with  existing policy requirements. VA concurred with these six  recommendations. Based on discussions with VA officials in June 2014 to  obtain information about the status of their planned actions for  implementing these recommendations, we believe that VA is making  progress on the implementation of three of the six recommendations.

These 30 facilities were selected for review by VA based on their claims  processing timeliness. However, we reported in March 2014 that the  criteria VA used to select facilities for review may not direct VA to the  facilities most in need of a field assistance visit because VA does not take  into account the accuracy of claims processing activity. Moreover, we  found that the checklist VA uses for its field assistance visits does not  examine all practices that could lead VA facilities to inappropriately deny  claims. Further, VA does not hold facilities accountable for correcting  deficiencies identified during these visits, and it does not validate facilities\u2019  self-reported corrections to address field assistance visit deficiencies.  According to VA officials, these visits are meant to be consultative in  nature and assist facilities in improving their non-VA medical care claims  processing. However, we found weaknesses in VA\u2019s reliance on facilities\u2019  self-reported actions when we reviewed the Department\u2019s fiscal year  2012 and 2013 field assistance visit data and found unresolved problems  in fiscal year 2013 that originated in fiscal year 2012.", "Further, VA implemented automated processes for auditing approved  non-VA medical care claims to ensure that VA facilities apply the correct  payment rates and no duplicate versions of the claims were previously  paid.

VA  officials said that the primary intent of the written materials was to  communicate the importance of promptly seeking care and to discourage  veterans from delaying care by bypassing non-VA providers in the event  of an emergency. However, some VA officials acknowledged that they  were aware of specific recent cases where veterans delayed or avoided  seeking treatment at non-VA providers to go to a VA facility instead.

Later, the VA facility denied these claims because VA could  find no record of this contact with the non-VA provider or  authorizations for continued care.", "VA officials said they have attempted to improve communications with  non-VA providers. Specifically, they have established a website and  electronic newsletter for non-VA providers in order to disseminate  information about non-VA medical care requirements. In addition, VA  mailed letters to all non-VA providers that had submitted claims during the  previous 2 years to inform them of these online resources. However,  none of the four non-VA providers included in our March 2014 review  recalled receiving the letter that VA mailed. Two non-VA providers were  familiar with the website, but one commented that it lacked some  necessary information and was not useful. None of these four non-VA  providers were aware of VA\u2019s electronic newsletter, and VA officials  acknowledged that a very small percentage of the non-VA providers who  submit claims to VA had signed up for it. While these communications  have not always reached their intended audience, VA is continuing its  efforts to improve communications with non-VA providers. Specifically,  VA has been conducting satisfaction surveys to continue monitoring its  communications with non-VA providers and has been holding training  sessions for VA staff on improving outreach with non-VA providers.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Michaud, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
