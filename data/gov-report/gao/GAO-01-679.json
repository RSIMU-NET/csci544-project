Prompted by Congress, EPA has responded with various initiatives, including the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Program, which requires more than 1,000 local governments to undertake storm water management programs. Those municipalities in Phase I of the program have been trying to reduce pollutants in storm water runoff for several years, and it is time to begin evaluating their efforts. EPA however, has not established measurable goals for this program, nor has it attempted to evaluate the program's effectiveness in reducing storm water pollution or to determine its cost. EPA attributes its inaction to inconsistent data reporting from municipalities, insufficient staff resources, and other competing priorities within the Office of Wastewater Management. Although municipalities report monitoring and cost data to EPA or state regulatory agencies annually, these agencies have not reviewed this information to determine whether it can be useful in determining the program's overall effectiveness or cost."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the reported cost information will be difficult to analyze unless EPA and its state partners set guidelines to elicit more standardized reporting. Better data on costs and program effectiveness are needed--especially in light of the Phase II program that will involve thousands more municipalities in 2003.

Water that runs over developed areas, including paved surfaces such as  roads and parking lots, before reaching a water body is known as urban  runoff and is an increasingly important category of water pollution.  As  urban areas have expanded over the past several decades, the amount of  urban runoff has also increased.  Although the overall quality of the nation\u2019s  waters has improved since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, a  significant number of water bodies still suffer from poor water quality.   Because the act brought discharges from \u201cpoint sources,\u201d such as industrial  plants and municipal treatment plants, under control, the continuing  pollution of these waters suggests that other sources, including urban  runoff, are contributing to water quality problems.  As a result, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) now classifies urban runoff as a  significant cause of impairment to water quality.  The Water Quality Act of  1987, which amended the Clean Water Act, required EPA, among other  things, to regulate as a point source urban runoff that reaches municipal  sewer systems.  EPA\u2019s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  Program for storm water requires that certain local governments take  measures to control storm water runoff.", "Concerned about the degradation of water quality in urban areas, you  asked us to report on (1) the amount of runoff from urban areas,  particularly from roads, highways, and other impervious surfaces, and its  effects on water quality and (2) the programs that federal regulations  require local governments to develop to address urban runoff, and the  costs and effectiveness of those programs.  To address these issues, we  reviewed federal and other studies and interviewed experts on the  relationship between the amount of paved and other impervious surfaces  and the amount of runoff, and on the types of materials typically contained  in urban runoff.  We also reviewed studies and interviewed experts on the  sources of these materials and any actual or potential effects on water  quality from urban runoff.  We visited five urban areas and organizations  that are affiliated with their watersheds to obtain site-specific information  about urban runoff problems, programs these areas have implemented in  response to federal requirements, and the costs and effectiveness of these  programs.   Finally, we reviewed studies and estimates of the costs and  investment requirements associated with implementing storm water  management programs.  Because this report focuses on local governments\u2019  actions, we did not review the portions of the National Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System Storm Water Program that address industrial facilities  and construction sites.", "We performed our review from August 2000 through May 2001 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nonpoint source pollution can result when water, such as precipitation,  runs over land surfaces and into bodies of water.  Significant nonpoint  sources of pollution can include paved urban areas, agricultural practices,  forestry, and mining.  However, in urban and suburban areas, this runoff  generally enters a sewer system that can be regulated as a point source of  water pollution.  For example, precipitation from rain or snowmelt may run  into a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4 or storm sewer) that  eventually discharges into a body of water.  The precipitation may also run  into a combined sewer system, which carries a combination of storm water  runoff, industrial waste, and raw sewage in a single pipe to a sewage  treatment facility for discharge after treatment.  Lastly, the precipitation  may run off of land or paved surfaces directly into nearby receiving waters.", "EPA\u2019s Office of Wastewater Management, which is within the Office of  Water, implements the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) Program.  The program was created in 1972 with the passage of  the Clean Water Act.  Created to control water pollution from point  sources\u2014those sources, such as a factory or wastewater treatment plant,  that contribute pollutants directly into a body of water from a pipe or other  conveyance\u2014the NPDES Program did not specifically address storm water  discharges.  In 1987, the Congress amended the Clean Water Act with the  Water Quality Act, which directed EPA to also control storm water  discharges that enter MS4s\u2014essentially requiring EPA to treat such storm  water as a point source.  MS4s are defined as those sewers that collect and  convey storm water; are owned or operated by the federal, state, or local  government; and are not part of a publicly owned treatment (sewage)  facility.", "To regulate urban storm water runoff, EPA published regulations in 1990  that established the NPDES Storm Water Program and described permit  application requirements.  According to EPA, the program\u2019s objective, in  part, is to preserve, protect, and improve water quality by, among other  things, controlling the volume of runoff from paved surfaces and by  reducing the level of runoff pollutants to the maximum extent practicable  using best management practices (BMP).  The 1987 act also authorized  EPA to implement a program that provides federal funds and technical  assistance to states to develop their own nonpoint source pollution  management programs.  States can use the federal funds they receive for  nonpoint source programs to address nonpoint sources of pollution as well  as urban runoff.", "Currently, EPA manages NPDES Storm Water programs in six states  (Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico)  and has delegated authority to the remaining 44 states to manage these  programs.  The storm water program is being implemented in two phases.   Local governments meeting the following criteria must comply with EPA\u2019s  storm water program regulations.  First, Phase I of the program requires  that municipalities with a population of 100,000 or more obtain a permit for  their MS4 system; second, the program requires that entities obtain a  permit if they discharge storm water from sites with industrial activities,  including construction activities that disturb 5 acres or more of land.  In  addition, NPDES permitting authorities may also bring other municipalities  and industrial entities into the program if they deem it necessary.   Municipalities that meet these conditions must submit a permit application  to EPA or the governing regulatory state agency.  In 1990, the regulations  specifically identified 220 municipalities throughout the United States that  were required to apply for a Phase I permit.  According to EPA, as of April  2001, about 256 Phase 1 MS4 permits had been issued and about 17 more  still needed to be issued.  Because some permits cover more than one  municipality, these permits cover about 1,000 medium and large  municipalities nationwide.", "The final rule for Phase II of the program was issued in December 1999.   Phase II extends Phase I efforts by requiring that a storm water discharge  permit be obtained by (1) operators of all MS4s not already covered by  Phase I of the program in urbanized areas and (2) construction sites that  disturb areas equal to or greater than 1 acre and less than 5 acres of land.   As with Phase I of the program, permitting authorities may require  additional small MS4s and construction sites to obtain a permit if they are a  significant contributor of pollutants.  Currently, EPA anticipates that about  5,000 municipalities may be subject to permitting requirements under  Phase II of the storm water program.  These municipalities are required to  obtain permits no later than March 10, 2003.", "EPA also regulates combined sewer overflows (CSO) that can be caused by  urban storm water runoff.  Combined sewer systems, in which storm water  enters pipes already carrying sewage, may overflow when rain or snowmelt  entering the system exceeds the system\u2019s flow capacity.  In the CSO that  results, the mixture of untreated sewage and runoff bypasses the water  treatment facility and is diverted directly into receiving waters.  (See fig. 1  for an illustration of combined and separate sewer systems.)  These  combined systems generally serve the older parts of approximately 900  cities in the United States.  Pipes carrying sewage and storm water  separately generally serve newer parts of cities.  EPA\u2019s 1994 CSO policy  requires communities with combined sewer systems to take immediate and  long-term actions to address CSO problems.  The policy contains  provisions for developing appropriate, site-specific NPDES permit  requirements for all combined sewer systems that overflow because of wet- weather events.  The Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000 requires that  any permit, order, or decree issued for a CSO conform to the 1994 policy.   Under this act, EPA is also required to submit a report to the Congress by  September 2001 on the status of the program.", "The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Program, established under the  Clean Water Act, is intended to address water bodies that do not meet  water quality standards because of pollutant loadings from point and  nonpoint sources.  Currently, it is unclear how and when this program will  affect EPA\u2019s and states\u2019 issuance of storm water permits.  A TMDL is a  calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can  receive and still meet the water quality standard set by the state.  Under  EPA\u2019s regulations, the state is to allocate this \u201cpollutant load\u201d among the  point and nonpoint pollutant sources that flow into the water body and  then take steps to ensure that no source exceeds its assigned load.  In 1996,  EPA issued a policy that outlined an interim approach to including water  quality standards in storm water permits.  The policy promoted the use of  BMPs in the first 5-year term permits, followed by a tailoring of BMPs in the  second round of permits as necessary to comply with water quality  standards.  Until recently, few TMDLs had been established, and citizen  organizations sued EPA for its lack of action.  EPA issued a new set of  regulations for the TMDL Program in 2000, but the Congress prevented  EPA from spending money to implement the rule in 2000 and 2001.   It is  possible that establishing a TMDL for a body of water could result in the  application of a numeric effluent limit to outfalls that release storm water  into that body of water.  Some city officials we spoke with generally felt  that numeric effluent limits would significantly increase the cost of  managing storm water."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Volume of Urban Runoff Increases With the Expansion of Urban Development and Can Affect Water Quality", "paragraphs": ["Since World War II, urban runoff has increased throughout the United  States.  This increase is directly related to growth in the amount of  impervious surfaces due to urban and suburban development and the  construction of roads, highways, and other impervious surfaces.   Coinciding with this growth in impervious surfaces has been a reduction in  wetlands and in the amount of storm water that infiltrates the ground to  recharge aquifers.  Moreover, the loss of vegetation due to development  and related runoff can cause major erosion.  Ultimately, much of this runoff  is channeled into gutters, storm drains, and paved channels, and vegetation  and sediment removed with the runoff may end up in receiving waters.   EPA has identified urban storm water runoff as one of the leading sources  of pollution to the nation\u2019s rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries.  Runoff  from impervious surfaces picks up potentially harmful pollutants and  carries them into receiving waters.  Studies have shown that urban runoff  and the pollutants it carries can negatively affect water quality, aquatic life,  and public health."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Paved Surfaces Have Increased With Urban and Suburban Expansion and Growth in Automobile Use", "paragraphs": ["According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, between 1945 and 1997,  urban land area increased by almost 327 percent, from 15 million acres to  about 64 million acres in the contiguous 48 states.  From 1992 through 1997,  the annual rate of development averaged about 1 million acres per year.   The land developed between 1945 and 1997 came primarily from forestland  and pasture and range.  For example, according to the Bureau of the  Census, between 1960 and 1990, the amount of land used for urban  purposes in Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., grew by about 170  percent and 177 percent, respectively.  As a result, urbanization, with its  accompanying expansion of impervious surfaces like sidewalks, roofs,  parking lots, and roads, has significantly increased the nation\u2019s total  developed land and paved surface area.  Figure 2 demonstrates the growth  in the urbanized areas of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., over the last half  of the 20th century.", "The increase in paved surfaces has been spurred not only by urban and  suburban development, but also by a steady increase in the use of  automobiles, the primary mode of daily transportation for most Americans.   Roads also play an important role in the economy of the United States,  since trucks carry about 75 percent of the value of all goods shipped.   According to EPA, paved road mileage in the United States increased by  278 percent from 1945 to 1997.  In 1945, 19 percent of the public roads in  the country were paved; by 1997, that percentage had increased to 61. (See  fig. 3.)  According to a 1999 study, motor-vehicle infrastructure, such as  roads and parking lots, accounts for close to half of the land area in U.S.  urban cities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in Impervious Surfaces Leads to Increased Runoff", "paragraphs": ["The increase in impervious surfaces over the past several decades has led  to an increase in storm water runoff.  In part, this has occurred because  highways and other developments have reduced the amount of wetlands  and other undeveloped land.  Wetlands mitigate the effects of storm water  runoff by acting as a natural form of flood control, facilitating sediment  replenishment, and improving water quality by removing excess nutrients  and other chemical contaminants before the contaminants can affect  receiving waters.  According to a 2000 EPA report, of the 12 states that  listed wetland losses, six reported that they had significant losses due to  highway construction, and 10 reported that they had significant losses due  to residential growth and development.  However, the effect of road  building on wetland loss has been reduced in recent years.  According to a  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) official, since 1996, wetlands  have been replaced and restored under the Federal-Aid Highway Program  at an average rate of 2.7 acres for every acre lost to highway building.   Other undeveloped land with vegetation also performs some of the roles  that wetlands play in managing runoff, although to a lesser extent.", "Furthermore, as impervious surfaces increase, less storm water is able to  infiltrate through the soil to groundwater.  Impervious areas allow only a  very small amount of initial infiltration compared with unpaved areas  whose infiltration capacity varies, depending on the soil type.  Figure 4  demonstrates EPA\u2019s estimates of the impact of impervious surfaces on the  percentages of storm water that runs off, infiltrates the ground, and is lost  through evapotranspiration.  When natural ground cover is present over  an entire site, normally 10 percent of precipitation runs off the land into  nearby creeks, rivers, and lakes.  In contrast, when a site is 75- to 100- percent impervious, 55 percent of the precipitation runs off into these  receiving waters.  However, according to an FHWA official, the runoff rates  can be reduced if developers take mitigating actions to develop and  implement BMPs to control flooding or runoff.", "The decrease in storm water infiltration that accompanies urbanization  also reduces the amount of water that is available to recharge groundwater  supplies.  For this reason, reduced infiltration may lead to problems with  the water table in certain urban areas.  For example, a Massachusetts  Department of Environmental Protection official noted that a low recharge  rate affects water quality because it can result in a loss of wetlands and  adversely affect aquatic habitat as water-table levels fall during dry  weather. In addition, officials from the Charles River Watershed  Association in Massachusetts are concerned that the lack of infiltration  might cause some communities to run short of drinking water in the next  20 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Urban Runoff Has the Potential to Impair Water Quality and Disrupt Biological Integrity", "paragraphs": ["Urban runoff can adversely affect the quality of the nation\u2019s waters, and  urban storm water runoff has been identified as one of the leading sources  of pollution to rivers, streams, lakes, and estuaries.  Section 305(b) of the  Clean Water Act requires states and other jurisdictions to report on the  quality of their waters to EPA every 2 years.  The 1998 National Water  Quality Inventory Report to Congress showed that 35 percent of assessed  river and stream miles, 45 percent of assessed lake acres, and 44 percent of  assessed estuarine square miles were impaired in terms of their ability to  support uses such as aquatic life, swimming, and fish consumption.  The  report identified urban storm water runoff as one of the leading sources of  impairment to the assessed waters.", "Studies have shown that as the percentage of impervious cover increases  within a watershed, biodiversity also declines.  Research conducted by the  Center for Watershed Protection found that, generally speaking, when a  watershed has 10 percent or less impervious cover, the associated stream  can be categorized as sensitive.  Sensitive streams are characterized as  having high fish diversity and good water quality.  Once the percentage of  impervious cover exceeds 25 to 30 percent of the watershed, however,  streams tend to become nonsupporting.  Nonsupporting streams are highly  unstable, have poor diversity of fish and aquatic life, and have poor water  quality.  For example, one study evaluated the relationship between the  extent of impervious cover in watersheds to the number and diversity of  fish populations in 47 small streams in southeastern Wisconsin between the  1970s and 1990s.  The results revealed that the number of fish species per  site was highly variable for drainage areas that had less than 10-percent  imperviousness.  In contrast, sites that had greater than 10-percent  imperviousness had consistently low numbers of fish species.", "Other studies have associated urban runoff with basic changes in the  receiving body of water.  Runoff can carry sediment into surface water, and  this sediment can carry contaminants, harm aquatic plants, and smother  organisms.  Runoff can also be warmed by the impervious surfaces it flows  across.  When sufficient amounts of warmed runoff enter a water body, the  water temperature can rise.  Less oxygen is then available for aquatic  organisms because water holds less oxygen as it becomes warmer.  These  combined factors lead to the degradation of aquatic habitat.  According to  EPA, the common effects of these types of pollution on aquatic life include  a decline in biodiversity and an increase in invasive species.", "An increase in the volume of storm water runoff also increases the  likelihood of erosion, which allows for transport of eroded sediment  downstream into receiving waters.

Another federal effort to characterize urban runoff is an  ongoing joint project of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the FHWA  to evaluate guidelines for highway runoff.  As table 1 indicates, these  studies and others have shown that the principal contaminants found in  urban runoff include nutrients, solids, pathogens, metals, hydrocarbons,  organics, salt, and trash.  Water flowing over various surfaces, such as  streets, parking lots, construction sites, industrial facilities, rooftops, and  lawns, carries these pollutants to receiving waters.  The contaminants have  the potential to impair water quality, degrade aquatic ecosystems, and pose  health risks to swimmers.", "In our visits to cities with Phase I permits and their watersheds, we  identified specific instances in which these contaminants had affected  water quality.  The Chesapeake Bay, for example, has been polluted with  the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and with excess sediment caused, in  part, by urban runoff.  The excess nutrients cause algae blooms that block  sunlight from reaching bay grasses\u2014which are a source of food, shelter,  and nursery grounds for many aquatic species.  In an effort to control  nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, the Executive Council of the  Chesapeake Bay Program established a goal to reduce the nitrogen and  phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay by 40 percent, including through  control of runoff from urban areas.  In addition, an assessment of the status  of chemical contaminant effects on living resources in the bay\u2019s tidal rivers  found \u201chot spots\u201d of contaminated sediment.  As a result, the Baltimore  Harbor and the Patapsco River in Maryland; the Anacostia River in  Washington, D.C.; and the Elizabeth River in Virginia were designated as  \u201cregions of concern.\u201d  Urban storm water runoff is a significant source of  contaminants in the three regions.  The Chesapeake Executive Council has  committed to reduce by 30 percent the chemicals of concern in the regions  of concern by 2010 through pollution prevention measures and other  voluntary means.", "Pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, which are often present in urban  runoff, can pose public health problems.  For example, the Santa Monica  Bay Restoration Project conducted a study to identify adverse health  effects of untreated urban runoff by surveying over 13,000 swimmers at  three bay beaches.   The study established a positive association between  an increased risk of illness and swimming near flowing storm-drain outlets.

The study  associated these contaminants with storm water runoff.", "In addition, USGS tracked trends in the concentrations of PAHs found in  sediment in 10 lakes and reservoirs in six metropolitan areas over the last  several decades.  This study found that PAH concentrations in developed  watersheds are increasing and that these increases may be linked to the  amount of urban development and vehicle traffic in urban and suburban  areas.  For example, from 1982 to 1996, PAH concentrations in the  sediment core in Town Lake (Austin, Texas) and total miles driven in  greater Austin both increased by about 2.5 times.

For example, detention ponds temporarily hold storm water  runoff to allow solids and other constituents in the runoff to settle  before the water is released at a predetermined rate into receiving  waters.  In addition, catch-basin inserts, placed in a storm drain, catch  trash and other debris, and particle separators, placed beneath the  surface of an impervious area such as a parking lot, separate oils from  runoff and allow sediment and debris to settle.

EPA conducted a survey to estimate the nation\u2019s  future water infrastructure needs over a 20-year period\u2014from 1996 to 2016.    In its 1996 report, EPA estimated that states would require over $50 billion  to meet their current (as of 1996) water infrastructure needs.  The estimate  consists of storm water management needs (at $7.4 billion) and CSO needs  (at $44.7 billion).  EPA noted, however, that estimated storm water  management needs are likely too low and could increase following an  analysis of data collected to prepare the agency\u2019s 2000 clean water needs  survey\u2014to be released in 2002.  According to EPA, many cities have  implemented the Phase I program since EPA reported to the Congress in  1996, and municipalities should now be better able to provide documented  cost data.  As a result, EPA will need to rely less on modeled storm water  needs than it did in the 1996 needs survey.   EPA did not project the costs  and benefits of the program when it was initiated; therefore, no initial cost  estimates are available.  When EPA promulgated the Phase I program  regulations in 1990, the agency decided that the storm water program did  not meet the requirements for preparing a benefit/cost analysis.", "The costs to local governments of complying with the Phase I program  have generally been portrayed as high.  However, because of  inconsistencies in cost accounting and reporting practices, we could not  determine the cost of the program to several of the cities we visited.   Although municipalities are required to provide information on the  expenditures that they anticipate will be needed to implement their storm  water management programs for each fiscal year covered by the permit,  EPA has not issued any cost reporting guidelines.  Consequently, while the  reported fiscal year 1999 total cost to manage and treat storm water runoff  across the five municipalities in our review ranged from less than $1 million  (Milwaukee) to $135 million (Los Angeles County), these numbers are not  comparable because the municipalities did not have consistent cost  accounting and reporting practices and did not fully express storm water  management costs. For example, some cities reported only the costs of  activities that were funded by the city department that held the permit.   Significant activities funded by other city departments were not reported,  even if they were important components of the storm water program.   Officials in the Milwaukee Department of Infrastructure Services and the  Boston Water and Sewer Commission told us that other city departments  perform and fund activities such as street sweeping and flood control.  The  costs of these activities are not reported as storm water program costs  because the activities serve other purposes besides preventing storm water  pollution.", "In addition, according to some city officials, these activities were in place  before the permit was issued and, therefore, cannot be characterized solely  as storm water costs.  The cost of street sweeping can be significant\u2014for  fiscal year 1999, Baltimore City and Worcester, which did include street- sweeping costs in their storm water program\u2019s cost estimate, stated that  their street-sweeping expenses totaled about $9.5 million and $1.2 million,  respectively.  Similarly, Milwaukee did not report the cost of a significant  project related to storm water runoff because it was mostly funded by the  state of Wisconsin.", "An EPA official told us that the agency had not yet made a national effort to  analyze the information that Phase I permittees submitted on the costs of  their storm water programs.  This official cited the inconsistent formats of  the annual reports as a reason that the information was not readily  available at the national level and also indicated that adequate staff are not  available to analyze the data.  In addition, other EPA officials informed us  that the Office of Wastewater Management must divide its resources among  a number of issues that will challenge the agency\u2019s water program over the  next decade.", "Several officials in the cities we visited said that their annual costs are  likely to increase. A number of factors could affect the costs.  For example,  a Baltimore City official explained that the anticipated, future program  costs depend on several factors, including (1) requirements in watershed- management plans currently being developed, (2) pollution-reduction goals  the city will be required to achieve, (3) requirements of the state regulatory  agency in future permits, and (4) requirements the city may have to meet if  TMDLs or numeric effluent limits are incorporated into NPDES storm  water permits.  Other city officials also expressed concern about the extent  to which TMDLs could affect their future costs.  These city officials are  concerned that when and if TMDLs are established, their future storm  water permits may require that storm water runoff meet specific water  quality standards.  For example, Los Angeles County\u2019s trash TMDL could  potentially drive the county\u2019s storm water management costs upward, and  the county expects additional TMDLs to be imposed.  On the other hand,  Worcester officials estimated that their future storm water costs would be  about the same as they were at the time of our review\u2014about $4.5 million  per year.", "In a separate analysis, EPA estimated in 1999 that it will cost Phase II  municipalities about $848 million to $981 million per year (in 1998 dollars)  to manage storm water runoff.  Because Phase II permits have not been  issued as of May 2001, we did not gather any cost information on them from  these cities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for Managing Storm Water Runoff Is Available From Local and Federal Sources", "paragraphs": ["The five cities we visited had not generally obtained federal funds for their  storm water management efforts.  They used local sources, including  general revenues, bonds, revenue from specifically created storm water  utilities, state grants, and inspection and permit fees.", "While several sections of the Clean Water Act provide funding that can be  used for municipal storm water control, relatively few federal funds have  been directed to these types of projects.  The most significant source of  funds is the state revolving loan funds administered by states.  These  revolving loan funds provide loans for eligible storm water control  projects.  In some cases, nonpoint source projects may also qualify for  funding when storm water permits are not required or issued.  However,  municipal storm water management is generally a low priority in these  programs.  Specifically, in the year 2000, revolving fund loans were made in  the \u201cstorm sewers\u201d category in the amount of $38.76 million for 44 different  projects.   These funds represented less than 1 percent of the amounts  loaned from these revolving funds that year.  Activities eligible for  revolving fund loans include constructing BMPs to control runoff, but  support for ongoing operations and maintenance is not eligible.  Revolving  fund loans can also be used for eligible CSO control projects.  In 2000,  Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program loans were made in the \u201cCSO  Correction\u201d category of a national EPA database in the amount of $411.3  million for 69 different projects and could have been used for CSO or  sanitary sewer overflow projects.  This amount represented about 9  percent of the funds loaned in 2000.", "According to EPA, the agency also issues grants to universities and other  research institutions to help implement the storm water program.  Some of  these grants provide training and guidance to Phase I permittees on  watershed protection and the proper selection of BMPs.", "Other sources of funding may be available to local governments beginning  in 2002.  In December 2000, the Congress authorized programs for fiscal  years 2002 through 2004 to provide grants to local governments for (1) pilot  projects for managing municipal CSOs, sanitary sewer overflows, and  storm water discharges on a watershed basis and for testing BMPs and (2)  controlling pollutants from MS4s to demonstrate and determine cost- effective, innovative technologies for reducing pollutants from storm water  discharge.  EPA\u2019s proposed budget does not request funds for these  programs.  In addition, the Congress authorized programs for fiscal years  2002 and 2003 to provide grants to local governments for planning,  designing, and constructing treatment works to intercept, transport,  control, or treat municipal CSOs and sanitary sewer overflows.  EPA\u2019s  proposed budget requested $450 million for this program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA, States, and Local Governments Believe the NPDES Storm Water Program Is Effective, but It Has Not Been Evaluated", "paragraphs": ["EPA, state, and municipal officials generally believe that the NPDES Storm  Water Program will improve water quality.  These officials believe that the  program will result in more bodies of water that meet water quality  standards, improved aesthetic conditions, reduced risk from bacterial  contamination, and improvements attributable to the discovery and  management of pollutants in storm water that otherwise would have gone  unnoticed.   EPA attempted to put a dollar value on these benefits in its  benefit/cost analysis prepared for the Phase II storm water regulations,  estimating that such benefits could range from $672 million to $1.1 billion  per year (in 1998 dollars).", "However, little information is currently available on the benefits of the  storm water program or its general effectiveness.  There is no doubt that it  will take time for the results of the Phase I program to be demonstrated.  As  EPA notes in its February 2000 report to the Congress, pollution control  efforts under water quality management programs produce long-term  changes, and the agency expects water quality improvements attributable  to the Phase I program to become evident in the future, as the program  matures.  In this report, EPA concluded that the program has improved  storm water management at the local level, improved water quality, and  decreased pollutant loads in storm water.  However, EPA relied on a survey  of only nine Phase I cities in making these conclusions and, therefore, also  reported that the agency could not provide national estimates on water  quality protection and improvements generated by Phase I of the program.   To evaluate the entire program, EPA would have to establish goals for the  program that are based on its mission; obtain information about the  program\u2019s results; compare the results with the goals; and make changes to  the program, if warranted, to get closer to achieving the agency\u2019s goals.", "EPA and the states also have not taken advantage of information that is  available to evaluate the program.  Each city we visited was regularly  monitoring its storm water to establish baseline information on pollutant  levels and was reporting this information to EPA or the regulatory state  agency each year.  Although cities with Phase I permits are required to  report on their storm water monitoring results and changes in water  quality, overall, EPA and the states have not successfully developed  measurable goals for the program or demonstrated its effectiveness  through the review of municipal reports.  An EPA official said that some  states had requested funding to analyze program data because they did not  have the resources to do so, and that EPA had provided the funding in a few  cases.  EPA also has not established any guidelines for how these data  should be reported.  Therefore, the reports may be as variable as the cost  information we obtained in our five site visits.", "EPA has not yet taken any of these data-analysis steps because, according  to EPA officials, other program challenges within the Office of Wastewater  Management compete with storm water management efforts for priority.   For example, EPA officials stressed that available resources within the  office must address other significant wet-weather pollution problems, such  as CSOs and sanitary sewer overflows, and nonpoint source pollution  problems, such as agricultural practices, forestry, and mining.  One agency  official noted that the highest priority is addressing needs that the agency  and local governments have identified for improving wastewater  infrastructure, such as sewage treatment facilities.  The program also has  relatively few staff assigned\u2014about five in the headquarters office and  about 10 in the regional offices\u2014for the municipal, industrial, and  construction portions of the program.  In a program plan recently prepared  for the storm water program, EPA estimated that nine to 10 staff would be  needed in EPA headquarters to evaluate the program and implement other  program requirements.", "EPA officials described two efforts that may be the first steps in developing  better information about the program.  First, EPA intends to issue a grant to  the University of Alabama in June 2001 to evaluate monitoring data  submitted by a sample of municipalities with Phase I permits.  This effort  will (1) determine the different types of monitoring being conducted by  Phase I municipalities, (2) assess water quality in and around permitted  municipalities and determine any correlation between program  implementation and impacts on water quality, and (3) recommend  approaches for improving the effectiveness of municipal storm water  monitoring programs.  EPA expects the results of this study in 2003.   Second, an EPA official stated that the agency would like to establish a  system for analyzing program findings, incorporating necessary changes  that are based on these findings, and evaluating the program\u2019s  effectiveness.  The agency plans to implement a pilot project in 2001 in the  agency\u2019s Atlanta Region IV office for analyzing data reported in annual  reports and developing key indicators for the program.

Prompted by the  Congress, EPA has responded with a variety of programs, including the  NPDES Storm Water Program, which requires more than 1,000 local  governments to implement storm water management programs.  Those  municipalities that are currently involved in Phase I of the program have  been attempting to reduce pollutants in storm water runoff for several  years.  It is time to begin evaluating these efforts.  However, EPA has not  established measurable goals for this program.  In addition,  the agency has  not attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of this program in reducing  storm water pollution or to determine its cost.  The agency attributes this  problem to inconsistent data reporting from permitted municipalities,  insufficient staff resources, and other competing priorities within the  Office of Wastewater Management.  Although Phase I municipalities report  monitoring and cost data to EPA or state regulatory agencies annually,  these agencies have not reviewed this information to determine whether it  can be of use in determining the program\u2019s overall effectiveness or cost.   Our analysis shows that the reported cost information will be difficult to  analyze unless EPA and its state partners set guidelines designed to elicit  more standardized reporting.  Better data on costs and program  effectiveness are needed\u2014especially in light of the Phase II program that  will involve thousands more municipalities in 2003.
