Moreover, the number of flying hours for spray aircraft more than doubled--from about 5,450 hours in 2001 to over 11,300 hours in 2003. In general, this meant the aircraft were exposed more frequently to the threat of ground fire, although other factors came into play. In response to the increased number of ground-fire hits, the Colombian National Police began providing two or three helicopter gunships for each eradication mission; this was in addition to the two Office of Aviation gunships that already accompanied every mission. Also, since January 2003, State has taken several actions to help reduce exposure to the threat of ground fire by making greater use of information about armed insurgents' proximity to spray targets. Since fiscal year 2001, State has significantly increased resources for the aerial eradication program in Colombia. Funding for the program doubled from about $49 million in fiscal year 2001 to $100 million for fiscal year 2003. In addition, from fiscal year 2001 to May 2004, personnel in Colombia who were directly involved with the program increased from 179 to 298, and the number of aerial eradication aircraft increased from 22 to 35. However, State does not prepare budgets that address all of the Office of Aviation's program requirements. Consequently, State often moves funds from one program to another, which may adversely affect those programs. In addition, State does not plan for the longterm costs of the aerial eradication program, such as aircraft replacement.

In Colombia, the Office of Aviation and DynCorp  maintain a headquarters office at El Dorado International Airport in Bogot\u00e1  and up to three operational sites at various Colombian police or military  bases around the country. From these sites, three types of spray aircraft\u2014 the OV-10, the T-65, and the AT-802\u2014fly missions to fumigate the coca and  poppy fields in Colombia. DynCorp provides pilots, mechanics, and other  operations and maintenance personnel.", "The aerial eradication program operates in an often-hostile environment  that requires helicopter gunships and a search and rescue helicopter to  accompany each aerial eradication mission. Eradication spray planes and  the supporting helicopters are often shot at from the ground. Missions have  been canceled or redirected because NAS, Office of Aviation, or  government of Colombia officials considered the targeted locations too  dangerous.", "U.S. officials have had long-standing concerns about the threat posed to  aerial eradication activities and, in particular, the safety of operations in  Colombia. In August 2000, the Office of Aviation requested an independent  evaluation of its aviation operations and safety by the Inter-Agency  Committee for Aviation Policy. Based on its review of operations at two  forward operating locations in Colombia and the offices in Bogot\u00e1 and at  Patrick Air Force Base, the committee concluded that the Office of  Aviation program was safe but made numerous suggestions and  recommendations to enhance safety and security. In September 2001, we  reported that the Office of Aviation had taken action on or implemented  most of the committee\u2019s suggestions and recommendations. We also made  recommendations for improvement, which State acted on.", "Nevertheless, in March 2002, the U.S. Embassy/Bogot\u00e1 reported that in  spite of all of the embassy\u2019s precautions, a contractor, possibly an  American, will inevitably be hurt or killed. In June 2003, the Director of  the Office of Aviation noted that the Office of Aviation was performing a  very difficult mission in an increasingly hostile environment. In September  2003, a spray aircraft crashed because of ground fire and, for the first time,  the pilot was killed. In total during 2003, one helicopter and four spray  aircraft either crashed or were severely damaged because of ground fire.

In general, this meant the spray aircraft and accompanying  helicopters were exposed more frequently to the threat of ground fire;  although other factors also came into play, such as the proximity of  eradication areas to insurgent locations. According to the Office of  Aviation, spray aircraft flew about 5,450 hours in 2001, nearly 9,400 hours in  2002, and more than 11,300 in 2003. The increase in flying hours in 2002 and  2003 largely occurred as the Colombian government, headed by President  Uribe, took a more aggressive approach to aerial eradication. In the  19 months prior to President Uribe\u2019s inauguration in August 2002, spray  aircraft flew about 9,700 hours or 510 hours per month.

To combat this success, U.S.  Embassy/Bogot\u00e1 officials reported that the insurgents began   organizing and massing ground fire in front of the spray aircraft\u2019s flight  path to force the planes to fly though a barrage of bullets and   using a greater variety of weapons against aerial eradication aircraft,  including some larger caliber weapons capable of penetrating armor and  hitting the aircraft at higher altitudes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Taken Several Actions to Address Operational Safety Concerns", "paragraphs": ["State/INL and NAS have taken several actions to reduce the risk to the  aircraft on aerial eradication missions.

Other actions include  coordinating spray operations more closely with the Colombian Army and  the Colombian National Police and ensuring that eradication aircraft are  protected to the extent possible from ground fire.", "In response to the increased number of ground-fire hits on aerial  eradication aircraft in late 2002 and early 2003, the Colombian National  Police began providing two or three helicopter gunships for each  eradication mission; this was in addition to the two Office of Aviation  gunships that already accompanied every mission, and the NAS Director  directed spray operations away from areas where the hits were occurring.  In addition, throughout 2003 and early 2004, State/INL and NAS took  several actions to make greater use of intelligence information regarding  the ground threats to the eradication aircraft.", "In January 2003, State/INL approved a NAS request to hire two  personnel as intelligence/security advisors. Their duties include  collecting and sharing threat information with U.S. Embassy, DynCorp,  and appropriate Colombian National Police and military officials to plan  aerial eradication operations. These two individuals began work in  August 2003. However, they did not have all the necessary security  clearances to handle certain U.S. Embassy intelligence information.  Nevertheless, they collected information from a variety of Colombian  military and police sources that was used in planning operations. To  address their lack of security clearances, in September 2003, the NAS  Director tasked another NAS employee to coordinate intelligence within  the U.S. Embassy until the two individuals receive their security  clearances.", "In early 2003, the U.S. Embassy/Bogot\u00e1 began reviewing its protocol for  gathering, utilizing, and sharing intelligence information to help ensure  that aerial eradication mission planners have the best available threat  assessment information. A revised protocol was approved in June 2003.  It defines intelligence requirements and sources, frequency of  intelligence updates, intelligence dissemination, and the use of  intelligence in planning missions at forward operating locations.  According to NAS and other U.S. Embassy personnel, the revised  protocol improved information sharing within the embassy and among  the embassy, DynCorp, and the Colombian military and police.", "In September 2003, in accordance with the revised intelligence protocol,  the NAS Director began approving the areas where eradication missions  are planned. She reviews the intelligence information available and will  not allow missions in areas where insurgents are thought to be or where  large caliber weapons have been reported. Missions are not flown in  those areas until intelligence information reports that the areas are  relatively safe.", "In October 2003, the Office of Aviation authorized DynCorp to hire six  personnel to gather and analyze intelligence for use in planning  eradication missions. According to DynCorp officials, they experienced  delays in filling these positions because of uncertainties regarding its  contract with State/INL. The first position was filled in March 2004,  and, as of June 2004, all six positions had been filled.", "In November 2003, Colombian military and police at one operational site  instituted daily threat briefings before the next day\u2019s aerial eradication  missions. According to U.S. Embassy and DynCorp officials, DynCorp  obtained the briefings primarily because the eradication unit was  collocated with the Colombian military. At the time of our visit in  January 2004, the DynCorp site manager said that eradication aircraft  flying missions from this site had not incurred any ground-fire hits for  2 months.", "In addition, in late 2003, the NAS Director also approved an annual  eradication program plan showing when and where eradication missions  will occur throughout 2004 and what aircraft will be used on each of the  missions. For each target area, the plan details when intelligence on the  threat posed by insurgents and others should be collected, and when the  Colombian Army Counternarcotics Brigade may be needed to conduct  ground operations in support of eradication missions. According to NAS  and other U.S. Embassy officials, the plan was coordinated with the  Colombian military to complement its planned military actions for 2004  and, as a result, has strengthened the Colombian Army\u2019s commitment to  support the aerial eradication program.", "Moreover, to enhance the spray airplanes\u2019 ability to withstand ground fire,  the Office of Aviation has ensured that the aircraft are protected to the  extent possible. All the spray aircraft have always had protective armor  around the cockpit and covering vulnerable fuel and oil lines. In addition,  State activated the ejection seats in the OV-10 when it acquired the aircraft  from the Department of Defense. The AT-802 spray planes are undergoing  additional modifications to further protect the pilot. Finally, the helicopters  also have added armaments to better protect them from ground fire.", "To further reduce risks, NAS, Office of Aviation, and DynCorp officials told  us that eradication mission planners, site managers, or individual pilots can  cancel flights at any time without fear of reprisal if they feel the particular  mission may not be safe because of possible ground fire, maintenance  problems, or other safety concerns. During our visits to three operational  sites, we attended meetings with DynCorp pilots and mechanics where  NAS and Office of Aviation officials emphasized this point.

Although Office of  Aviation and DynCorp managers said that the resources provided in fiscal  years 2001-04 (through May) were sufficient to carry out the increased  eradication activities safely, they noted that they did not always know how  much funding would be available or when, and that this has led to last- minute decisions and informal workarounds to avoid suspending or  curtailing eradication operations.", "This situation is not new. In 1998, we reported that State and the U.S.  Embassy/Bogot\u00e1 were not adequately prepared to manage increases in  aerial eradication. Specifically, when U.S. support for aerial eradication  increased in 1997, the unanticipated costs associated with the increase led  to the reallocation of funds from other NAS programs.

DynCorp officials told us that it nearly suspended  the eradication program because of a shortage of funds in 2002. But  because of delays in training Colombian Army helicopter mechanics and  pilots, DynCorp used funds allocated for that program to continue the  aerial eradication program. Further, DynCorp officials told us they also  have had to delay ordering needed parts because of the lack of funds. Some  of these parts\u2014especially those for the older aircraft, such as the OV-10  spray planes and UH-1N helicopters that accompany the spray planes\u2014are  in short supply and could be difficult to acquire.

As a result, the Office of Aviation has to request those funds from the  respective NAS Director, which may adversely affect those programs. In  fiscal year 2003, State/INL reprogrammed more than $5 million from  programs in Bolivia, Peru, and Pakistan to fund the Office of Aviation  program in Colombia. In addition, the NAS Director in Colombia told us  that sometimes other funding priorities\u2014such as the narcotics interdiction  program\u2014conflicted with Office of Aviation program needs and delayed  funding for the aerial eradication program.", "Furthermore, State/INL often does not receive funds for its programs,  including the aerial eradication program, until months after the start of the  fiscal year. For instance, fiscal year 2004 funds were not available until mid- June 2004 because of the time needed to address congressional inquiries  about how State/INL proposed to use the funding. State/INL officials said  they have used prior year funds or moved funds from one project to  another to satisfy the most critical needs until all funds are available. These  officials stated that the safety of their operations has not been  compromised but added that the uncertainty over funding availability has  caused an administrative burden.", "In June 2004, our report on federal aircraft fleet management also noted  weaknesses in State/INL\u2019s planning process. We reported that State/INL  had not developed a long-term fleet acquisition plan or performed a cost- benefit analysis that considered long-range aircraft replacement, mission  support, and other related costs. In addition, INL had not performed a life- cycle cost analysis of its aircraft, estimated future long-term mission  requirements, or identified the aircraft best-suited to meet those  requirements. As a result, according to State/INL officials, State has  delayed requesting funding for additional aircraft.", "Finally, in October 2003, a State/INL internal review team began examining  the Office of Aviation\u2019s programs. The review team has noted that the  Office of Aviation has operated effectively in five countries with high safety  and operational success rates. Given its aged aircraft, complex logistics  requirements, and aggressive flight schedule, the team commended Office  of Aviation staff for their professionalism and continued success under  trying circumstances. However, the team also has identified many of the  same concerns that we have raised\u2014from generally poor strategic planning  to inadequate management and financial tools. The team has noted that  State/INL focuses on short-term planning to meet new missions and  changing requirements, with little input from the Office of Aviation.", "State/INL officials have begun to address the shortcomings. For example,  State/INL and the Office of Aviation are preparing a strategic plan to  identify long-term mission costs for all of the Office of Aviation programs.  As part of this strategy, State/INL and the Office of Aviation have developed  a critical flight safety plan that includes projected costs to maintain the  Office of Aviation\u2019s current aircraft and acquire additional aircraft to  sustain the program.

However, State/INL\u2019s planning and  budgeting process for the Office of Aviation did not keep pace with the  growth of the Office of Aviation and the increasing complexity of its  mission. The current process does not fully serve State/INL\u2019s or the Office  of Aviation\u2019s present-day needs. As a result, the Office of Aviation\u2019s short-  and long-term funding requirements have often been addressed through ad  hoc decisions. In particular, not having a strategic plan that identifies long- range needs, mission support, and other costs has prevented State/INL  from assessing future requirements and planning and budgeting for them.", "The Office of Aviation will likely continue its operations in Colombia for  the foreseeable future. Further, it may be called on to extend its operations  to other parts of the world as illicit drugs continue to provide income to  insurgents and terrorists who pose a security threat to the United States  and its allies. However, without a planning and budgeting process that  systematically addresses the short- and long-term requirements of the  Office of Aviation\u2019s programs, State/INL cannot ensure that the Office of  Aviation\u2019s requirements are appropriately prioritized, long-term resource  needs are addressed, and funding is sufficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve State/INL\u2019s process for providing resources to the Office of  Aviation, we recommend that the Secretary of State direct the Assistant  Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs  to develop and implement a strategic planning and budgeting process that  addresses all of the program requirements for the Office of Aviation,  including the aerial eradication program in Colombia. The strategic plan  and budget should address the day-to-day operational needs of the Office of  Aviation\u2019s programs, aircraft fleet refurbishment and eventual replacement,  and the resources needed to meet these requirements. The plan should also  be systematically updated as part of State\u2019s annual budget cycle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["State provided written comments on a draft of this report (see app. II). It  stated that the report provides a useful summary of the technical, planning,  and budgeting issues that may affect the Office of Aviation\u2019s programs in  Colombia. State also expressed concern that the report suggests that  State/INL does not manage and plan for its aviation program requirements.  However, it agreed that a more comprehensive long-term planning and  budgeting process is needed and has taken some initial steps to this end.", "We did not say that State/INL does not manage and plan for the Office of  Aviation\u2019s programs. Rather, we stated that State/INL does not prepare a  specific budget for the Office of Aviation that accounts for all of its  program needs. In fact, State notes that State/INL is beginning to  institutionalize a more formal planning and budgeting process for the  Office of Aviation to address this shortcoming. According to State,  State/INL completed an \u201cinitial cut\u201d of an Office of Aviation Strategic Plan  in April 2004, and also recently prepared a Critical Flight Safety Program to  extend the life of its aircraft fleet and an Office of Aviation Reorganization  Plan to hire more staff for strategic planning, budgeting, and financial  analysis.

Further, to determine the reliability of the funding data used in this  report, we examined State financial management activity reports and  compared some of these data with similar information from our prior  reports addressing Office of Aviation activities. However, we did not audit  the funding data and are not expressing an opinion on them. Finally, to  satisfy ourselves that the numbers of personnel and aircraft were reliable,  we examined monthly reports prepared by the Office of Aviation and  DynCorp.
