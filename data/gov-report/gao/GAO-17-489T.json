As of March 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI disagreed with three recommendations and had taken some actions to address the remainder, but had not fully implemented them.", "Privacy notices not timely. In May 2016, GAO recommended DOJ determine why privacy impact assessments (PIA) were not published in a timely manner (as required by law) and take corrective action. GAO made this recommendation because FBI did not update the Next Generation Identification-Interstate Photo System (NGI-IPS) PIA in a timely manner when the system underwent significant changes or publish a PIA for Facial Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation (FACE) Services before that unit began supporting FBI agents. DOJ disagreed on assessing the PIA process stating it established practices that protect privacy and civil liberties beyond the requirements of the law. GAO also recommended DOJ publish a system of records notice (SORN) and assess that process. DOJ agreed to publish a SORN, but did not agree there was a legal requirement to do so. GAO believes both recommendations are valid to keep the public informed on how personal information is being used and protected by DOJ components.", "GAO also recommended the FBI conduct audits to determine if users of NGI-IPS and biometric images specialists in the FBI's FACE Services unit are conducting face image searches in accordance with DOJ policy requirements. The FBI began conducting NGI-IPS user audits in 2017.", "Accuracy testing limited. In May 2016, GAO recommended the FBI conduct tests to verify that NGI-IPS is accurate for all allowable candidate list sizes to give more reasonable assurance that NGI-IPS provides leads that help enhance criminal investigations. GAO made this recommendation because FBI officials stated that they do not know, and have not tested, the detection rate for candidate list sizes smaller than 50, which users sometimes request from the FBI. GAO also recommended the FBI take steps to determine whether systems used by external partners are sufficiently accurate for FBI's use. By taking such steps, the FBI could better ensure the data from external partners do not unnecessarily include photos of innocent people as investigative leads. However, FBI disagreed with these two recommendations, stating the testing results satisfy requirements for providing investigative leads and that FBI does not have authority to set accuracy requirements for external systems. GAO continues to believe these recommendations are valid because the recommended testing and determination of accuracy of external systems would give the FBI more reasonable assurance that the systems provide investigative leads that help enhance, rather than hinder or overly burden, criminal investigation work.", "GAO also recommended the FBI conduct an annual operational review of NGI-IPS to determine if the accuracy of face recognition searches is meeting federal, state, and local law enforcement needs and take actions, as necessary. DOJ agreed and in 2017 FBI stated they implemented the recommendation by submitting a paper to solicit feedback from NGI-IPS users on whether face recognition searches are meeting their needs. However, GAO believes these actions do not fully meet the recommendation because they did not result in any formal response from users and did not constitute an operational review.

In addition, the use of face recognition technology raises questions  regarding the protection of privacy and individual civil liberties. Face  recognition technology mimics how people identify others: by scrutinizing  their face. However, what is an effortless skill in humans has proven  difficult to replicate in machines, although computer and technology  advancements over the past few decades have increased the overall  accuracy of automated face recognition. According to officials from the  FBI, these advancements in face recognition technology can help law  enforcement agencies identify criminals in federal, state and local  investigations.

Beginning in 2010, the FBI began  incrementally replacing the Integrated Automated Fingerprint  Identification System (IAFIS) with Next Generation Identification (NGI) at  an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. NGI was not only to include fingerprint  data from IAFIS and biographic data, but also to provide new functionality  and improve existing capabilities by incorporating advancements in  biometrics, such as face recognition technology. As part of the fourth of  six NGI increments, the FBI updated the Interstate Photo System (IPS) to  provide a face recognition service that allows law enforcement agencies  to search a database of about 30 million photos to support criminal  investigations.", "NGI-IPS users include the FBI and selected state and local law  enforcement agencies, which can submit search requests to help identify  an unknown person using, for example, a photo from a surveillance  camera. When a state or local agency submits such a photo, NGI-IPS  uses an automated process to return a list of 2 to 50 possible candidate  photos from the database, depending on the user\u2019s specification. Figure  1 describes the process for a search requested by state or local law  enforcement.", "In addition to the NGI-IPS, the FBI has an internal unit called Facial  Analysis, Comparison and Evaluation (FACE) Services that provides face  recognition capabilities, among other things, to support active FBI  investigations. FACE Services not only has access to NGI-IPS, but can  search or request to search databases owned by the Departments of  State and Defense and 16 states, which use their own face recognition  systems. Figure 2 shows which states partnered with FBI for FACE  Services requests, as of August 2016. Unlike NGI-IPS, which primarily  contains criminal photos, these external systems primarily contain civil  photos from state and federal government databases, such as driver\u2019s  license photos and visa applicant photos. The total number of face photos  available in all searchable repositories for FACE Services is over 411  million, and the FBI is interested in adding additional federal and state  face recognition systems to its search capabilities. Biometric images  specialists for FACE Services manually review candidate photos from  their external partners before returning at most the top 1 or 2 photos as  investigative leads to the requesting FBI agents.

For example, while the FBI drafts privacy documentation  for its face recognition capabilities, DOJ offices review and approve key  documents developed by the FBI\u2014such as PIAs and SORNs. However,  the FBI did not update the NGI-IPS PIA in a timely manner when the  system underwent significant changes and did not develop and publish a  PIA for FACE Services before that unit began supporting FBI agents.  Additionally, DOJ did not publish a SORN that addresses the collection  and maintenance of photos accessed and used through the FBI\u2019s face  recognition capabilities until after our 2016 review.", "Consistent with the E-Government Act and OMB guidance, DOJ  developed guidance that requires initial PIAs to be completed at the  beginning of development of information systems and any time there is a  significant change to the information system in order to determine  whether there are any resulting privacy issues.

DOJ and FBI officials stated  that these PIAs reflect the current operation of NGI-IPS and FACE  Services. However, as the internal drafts of these PIAs were updated, the  public remained unaware of the department\u2019s consideration for privacy  throughout development of NGI-IPS and FACE Services. This is because  the updates were not published, as required.

At that time, the FBI published a new  SORN that reported the modification of the Fingerprint Identification  Records System to be renamed the Next Generation Identification (NGI)  System. However, according to OMB guidance then in effect, the SORN  must appear in the Federal Register before the agency begins to operate  the system, e.g., collect and use the information. While the new SORN  addresses face recognition, those capabilities have been in place since  2011. Throughout this period, the agency collected and maintained  personal information for these capabilities without the required  explanation of what information it is collecting or how it is used.

We recommended that DOJ assess the PIA  development process to determine why PIAs were not published prior to  using or updating face recognition capabilities. DOJ officials did not  concur with this recommendation, and stated that the FBI has established  practices that protect privacy and civil liberties beyond the requirements  of the law. Further, DOJ stated that it developed PIAs for both FACE  Services and NGI-IPS, as well as other privacy documentation,  throughout the development of the these capabilities that reflect privacy  choices made during their implementation. For example, DOJ officials  stated that it revised the FACE Services PIA as decisions were made. We  agree that, during the course of our review, DOJ published PIAs for both  FACE Services and NGI-IPS. However, as noted in the report, according  to the E-Government Act and OMB and DOJ guidance, PIAs are to be  assessments performed before developing or procuring technologies and  upon significant system changes. Further, DOJ guidance states that PIAs  give the public notice of the department\u2019s consideration of privacy from  the beginning stages of a system\u2019s development throughout the system\u2019s  life cycle and ensures that privacy protections are built into the system  from the start\u2013not after the fact\u2013when they can be far more costly or  could affect the viability of the project.

DOJ continues to believe that its approach in  designing the NGI system was sufficient to meet legal privacy  requirements and that our recommendation represents a \u201ccheckbox  approach\u201d to privacy. We disagree with DOJ\u2019s characterization of our  recommendation. We continue to believe that the timely development and  publishing of future PIAs would increase transparency of the department\u2019s  systems. We recognize the steps the agency took to consider privacy  protection during the development of the NGI system. We also stand by  our position that notifying the public of these actions is important and  provides the public with greater assurance that DOJ components are  evaluating risks to privacy when implementing systems.", "We also recommended DOJ develop a process to determine why a  SORN was not published for the FBI\u2019s face recognition capabilities prior  to using NGI-IPS, and implement corrective actions to ensure SORNs are  published before systems become operational.

DOJ\u2019s comments on our draft report acknowledge that the  automated nature of face recognition technology and the sheer  number of photos now available for searching raise important privacy  and civil liberties considerations.", "DOJ officials also stated that the FBI\u2019s face recognition capabilities do  not represent new collection, use, or sharing of personal information.  We disagree. We believe that the ability to perform automated  searches of millions of photos is fundamentally different in nature and  scope than manual review of individual photos, and the potential  impact on privacy is equally fundamentally different.

State and local users have  been accessing NGI-IPS since December 2011 and have generated IPS  transaction records since then that would enable CJIS to assess user  compliance. In addition, the FACE Services Unit has used external  databases that include primarily civil photos to support FBI investigations  since August 2011, but the FBI had not audited its use of these  databases. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  call for federal agencies to design and implement control activities to  enforce management\u2019s directives and to monitor the effectiveness of  those controls.

As noted in the report, we understand  the FBI may not have authority to audit the maintenance or operation of  databases owned and managed by other agencies. However, the FBI  does have a responsibility to oversee the use of the information by its  own employees.

However, the  tests were limited because they did not include all possible candidate list  sizes and did not specify how often incorrect matches were returned.  According to the National Science and Technology Council and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, the detection rate (how  often the technology generates a match when the person is in the  database) and the false positive rate (how often the technology incorrectly  generates a match to a person in the database) are both necessary to  assess the accuracy of a face recognition system. The FBI\u2019s detection  rate requirement for face recognition searches states when the person  exists in the database, NGI-IPS shall return a match of this person at  least 85 percent of the time (the detection rate). However, the FBI only  tested this requirement with a candidate list of 50 potential matches. In  these tests, according to FBI documentation, 86 percent of the time, a  match to a person in the database was correctly returned. Further, FBI  officials stated that they have not assessed how often NGI-IPS face  recognition searches erroneously match a person to the database (the  false positive rate). As a result, we recommended that the FBI conduct  tests of NGI-IPS to verify that the system is sufficiently accurate for all  allowable candidate list sizes and ensure that both the detection rate and  the false positive rate are identified for such tests.", "With the recommended testing, the FBI would have more reasonable  assurance that NGI-IPS provides investigative leads that help enhance,  rather than hinder or overly burden, criminal investigation work. If false  positives are returned at a higher than acceptable rate, law enforcement  users may waste time and resources pursuing unnecessary investigative  leads. In addition, the FBI would help ensure that it is sufficiently  protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens enrolled in the  database. Specifically, according to a July 2012 Electronic Frontier  Foundation hearing statement, false positives can alter the traditional  presumption of innocence in criminal cases by placing more of a burden  on the defendant to show he is not who the system identifies him to be.   The Electronic Frontier Foundation argues that this is true even if a face  recognition system such as NGI-IPS provides several matches instead of  one, because each of the potentially innocent individuals identified could  be brought in for questioning.", "In comments on our draft report in 2016, and reiterated during  recommendation follow-up, as of March 2017, DOJ did not concur with  this recommendation. DOJ officials stated that the FBI has performed  accuracy testing to validate that the system meets the requirements for  the detection rate, which fully satisfies requirements for the investigative  lead service provided by NGI-IPS.", "We disagree with DOJ. A key focus of our recommendation is the need to  ensure that NGI-IPS is sufficiently accurate for all allowable candidate list  sizes. Although the FBI has tested the detection rate for a candidate list of  50 photos, NGI-IPS users are able to request smaller candidate lists\u2014 specifically between 2 and 50 photos. FBI officials stated that they do not  know, and have not tested, the detection rate for other candidate list  sizes. According to these officials, a smaller candidate list would likely  lower the detection rate because a smaller candidate list may not contain  a likely match that would be present in a larger candidate list. However,  according to the FBI Information Technology Life Cycle Management  Directive, testing needs to confirm the system meets all user  requirements. Because the accuracy of NGI-IPS\u2019s face recognition  searches when returning fewer than 50 photos in a candidate list is  unknown, the FBI is limited in understanding whether the results are  accurate enough to meet NGI-IPS users\u2019 needs.", "DOJ officials also stated that searches of NGI-IPS produce a gallery of  likely candidates to be used as investigative leads, not for positive  identification. As a result, according to DOJ officials, NGI-IPS cannot  produce false positives and there is no false positive rate for the system.  We disagree with DOJ. The detection rate and the false positive rate are  both necessary to assess the accuracy of a face recognition system.  Generally, face recognition systems can be configured to allow for a  greater or lesser number of matches. A greater number of matches would  generally increase the detection rate, but would also increase the false  positive rate. Similarly, a lesser number of matches would decrease the  false positive rate, but would also decrease the detection rate. Reporting  a detection rate of 86 percent without reporting the accompanying false  positive rate presents an incomplete view of the system\u2019s accuracy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Agreed to Conduct Annual Operational Reviews of NGI-IPS", "paragraphs": ["FBI, DOJ, and OMB guidance all require annual reviews of operational  information technology systems to assess their ability to continue to meet  cost and performance goals.

The FBI has entered into agreements with state and federal  partners to conduct face recognition searches using over 380 million  photos. Without actual assessments of the results from its state and  federal partners, the FBI is making decisions to enter into agreements  based on assumptions that the search results may provide valuable  investigative leads. For example, the FBI\u2019s accuracy requirements for  criminal investigative purposes may be different than a state\u2019s accuracy  requirements for preventing driver\u2019s license fraud. By relying on its  external partners\u2019 face recognition systems, the FBI is using these  systems as a component of its routine operations and is therefore  responsible for ensuring the systems will help meet FBI\u2019s mission, goals  and objectives.
