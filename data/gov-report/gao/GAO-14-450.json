Specifically, two assets, the HC-144 patrol aircraft and Fast Response Cutter, did not meet all key requirements during operational testing before being approved for full-rate production, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard guidance do not clearly specify when this level of performance should be achieved. Additionally, the Coast Guard changed its testing strategy for the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system and, as a result, is no longer planning to test the system's key requirements. Completing operational testing for the C4ISR system would provide the Coast Guard with the knowledge of whether this asset meets requirements.", "As acquisition program costs increase across the portfolio, consuming significant amounts of funding, the Coast Guard is farther from fielding its planned fleet today than it was in 2009, in terms of the money needed to finish these programs. In 2009, GAO found that the Coast Guard needed $18.2 billion to finish its 2007 baseline, but now needs $20.7 billion to finish these assets.", "To inform Congress of its budget plans, the Coast Guard uses a statutorily required 5-year Capital Investment Plan, but the law does not require the Coast Guard to report the effects of actual funding levels on individual projects and, thus, it has not done so. For example, the Coast Guard has received less funding than planned in its annual budgets, but has not reflected the effects of this reduced funding in terms of increased cost or schedule for certain projects. Without complete information, Congress cannot know the full cost of the portfolio.", "The Coast Guard has repeatedly delayed and reduced its capability through its annual budget process and, therefore, it does not know the extent to which it will meet mission needs and achieve desired results. This is because the Coast Guard does not have a long-term fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to meet mission needs over the next two decades within available resources.

Our prior work has highlighted  problems with the cost, management, and oversight of the Coast Guard\u2019s  acquisition portfolio that have led to delivery delays and other operational  challenges. For example, in a report issued in September 2012, we found  that the cost and schedule of the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition portfolio  remains unknown because of outdated baselines and uncertainty  surrounding affordability. We also found that opportunities exist to  address affordability through the requirements process. Overall, we  concluded that the Coast Guard had made strides in its efforts to improve  its acquisition management capabilities, and the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) agreed with our recommendations to conduct a portfolio  review and to identify the Executive Oversight Council as the body to  oversee the Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio management approach.", "You asked us to review the Coast Guard\u2019s current and planned  acquisition portfolio.

The  specific assets reviewed were the Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144), Fast  Response Cutter, National Security Cutter, and Command, Control,  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.

To assess the cost and schedule of the  Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio and steps taken to address affordability concerns,  we reviewed each asset\u2019s acquisition program baseline as well as the  Coast Guard\u2019s budget and discussed the acquisition portfolio with Coast  Guard, DHS, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) officials and  followed up on previous efforts to address affordability. We also reviewed  the Coast Guard\u2019s Capital Investment Plan and compared it to the  relevant law that specifies the contents of the plan. To assess what, if  any, capability gaps exist given the Coast Guard\u2019s affordability issues, we  reviewed funding needs, mission needs, future plans, and performance  data and reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2014 and 2015 budgets.

The Coast Guard is planning to use this information to conduct a full and  open competition for the remaining vessels. Our previous work has  shown that when the government owns technical data rights, it does not  need to rely on only one contractor to meet requirements. Further, the  Coast Guard has developed a warranty provision under its contract with  Bollinger Shipyards that has held the contractor responsible for  production deficiencies. While the Coast Guard does not always have  insight into how much it costs the contractor to fix these issues, after  multiple deficiencies interrupted production, officials noted they are  confident that the Coast Guard has received value from this warranty.

Operators primarily attribute the  performance improvements to better endurance and communication  capabilities, which help to position and keep these assets in high threat  areas. Specifically, these new assets have greater fuel capacity and  efficiency, engine room and boat launch automation, handling/sea- keeping, and food capacity, all of which increase endurance and  effectiveness. Operators stated that these new assets, using information  technology systems, can also share pictures and locations of vessels,  and communicate more frequently and accurately with shore-based  operational commanders than the legacy vessels being replaced. For  example, operators said they now use chat rooms on secure networks in  addition to radios. These chat rooms improve communication because  multiple parties can communicate at the same time and messages remain  available on the screen for reference.

Using this ramp,  according to operators, they launch the cutter\u2019s small boat in 10 to 15  seconds while the ship is actively pursuing a target. By comparison, the  legacy 110\u2019 patrol boat requires a significant number of personnel to  launch the cutter\u2019s small boat using a crane attached to the center of the  vessel\u2014a complex process that takes significantly longer and has  potential safety risks. The National Security Cutter also has a stern  launch ramp, which, in addition to launching and recovering small boats,  was used by the ship\u2019s crew to hold a seized boat while they dismantled it  to find drugs hidden in hard-to-reach compartments.

In addition, one National Security Cutter completed a 160-day  deployment in fiscal year 2013 during which it performed 6 drug  interdictions totaling 570 kilograms of cocaine. Cutter officers stated that  the ship\u2019s intelligence capabilities and the small unmanned aircraft  system, which are both new capabilities that are not on the 378\u2019 High  Endurance Cutter, were crucial to these drug interdictions.

The Fast Response Cutter  was found to be operationally effective (with the exception of its cutter  boat) though not operationally suitable, and the HC-144 was found to be  operationally effective and suitable. As we have previously found for  Department of Defense (DOD) programs, continuing with full-rate  production before ensuring that assets meet key requirements risks  replicating problems in each new asset until such problems are  corrected. DHS officials stated that they approved both assets for full- rate production because the programs had plans in place to address most  major issues identified during testing, such as supplying the Fast  Response Cutter with a small boat developed for the National Security  Cutter. However, DHS and Coast Guard acquisition guidance are not  clear regarding when the minimum performance standards should be  met, such as prior to entering full-rate production. For example, DHS and  Coast Guard guidance provide that the Coast Guard should determine if  the capability meets the established minimum performance standards, but  do not specify when this determination should be made. By comparison,  DOD acquisition guidance requires that specific minimum performance  standards, which are defined at the time assets are approved for system  development, be met prior to entering full-rate production.", "In addition, DHS and Coast Guard acquisition guidance do not clearly  specify how agency officials determine when a breach occurs and what  triggers the need for a program manager to submit a performance breach  memo.

Even though threshold key  performance parameters on the HC-144 and Fast Response Cutter were  not met during operational testing, the Coast Guard did not report that a  breach had occurred. Acquisition guidance is unclear as to whether or not  failing to meet key requirements during operational testing constitutes a  breach. According to Coast Guard officials, if the Coast Guard plans to re- test or re-design a deficiency in order to meet the threshold value, then a  breach has not yet occurred.

Verification of an asset\u2019s ability prior to operational  testing may be beneficial, but, as we have previously found, only  operational testing can ensure that an asset is ready to meet its  missions.", "Prior to testing, the Coast Guard encountered several issues that require  retrofits or design changes to meet mission needs based upon  operations, certifications, and non-operational testing. The total cost of  these changes is not yet known, but changes identified to date have  totaled approximately $140 million, about one-third of the production cost  of a single National Security Cutter. The Coast Guard must pay for all of  these and future changes due to the contract terms under which the first  three ships were constructed and because the warranty on the remaining  ships does not protect the Coast Guard against defects costing more than  $1 million. Table 4 lists the retrofits and design changes costing more  than $1 million. The table does not include all changes because the Coast  Guard did not have data for some of the modifications. In addition to the  $140 million in identified changes, the Coast Guard has established a  program to supply the National Security Cutter with cutter small boats for  an additional $52.1 million because the small boats originally planned to  be delivered with the vessel did not meet requirements.", "Additional changes may be needed because the Coast Guard has not  fully validated the capabilities of the National Security Cutter, though  seven vessels have been delivered or are in production. This situation  could result in the Coast Guard having to spend even more money in the  future, beyond the current changes, to ensure the National Security  Cutter fleet meets requirements and is logistically supportable. For  example, the cutter is experiencing problems operating in all intended  environments. The National Security Cutter requirements document  states that the cutter will conduct assigned missions in a full spectrum of  climate and maritime weather conditions, to include tropical, dry,  temperate, and arctic climates. This document adds that although the  National Security Cutter will operate in regions in which ice is frequently  encountered, it will not have an ice-breaking mission. However, Coast  Guard engineering reports from December 2012 discuss problems  operating in both warm and cold climates. These reports discuss several  warm weather problems, including cooling system failures, excessive  condensation forming \u201cconsiderable\u201d puddles on the deck of the ship, and  limited redundancy in its air conditioning system\u2014which, among other  things, prevents the use of information technology systems when the air  conditioning system needs to be serviced or repaired. In addition,  according to operational reports, during a recent deployment, the  Commanding Officer of a National Security Cutter had to impose speed  restrictions on the vessel because of engine overheating when the  seawater temperature was greater than 77 degrees. Cold climate issues  include the National Security Cutter not having heaters to keep oil and  other fluids warm during operations in cold climates, such as the arctic.  Further, Coast Guard operators state that operating near ice must be  done with extreme caution since the ice can move quickly and can \u201cspell  disaster\u201d if the National Security Cutter comes in contact with it.

The Coast Guard initially planned to test  the C4ISR system separately from the operational testing of its planes  and vessels, such as the HC-144 and Fast Response Cutter. Coast  Guard officials then decided to test the C4ISR system in conjunction with  the planes and vessels to save money and avoid duplication. However,  the C4ISR system was not specifically evaluated during the HC-144 and  Fast Response Cutter tests because testing the effectiveness and  suitability of the C4ISR system was not fully integrated into the assets\u2019  test plans. For example, the HC-144 was unable to meet its key  requirement for detection, which uses the C4ISR software in conjunction  with the HC-144\u2019s radar and other sensors. In addition, COTF found that  the HC-144\u2019s ability to detect and share target data was cumbersome and  time-consuming. These results were not evaluated against the C4ISR  system\u2019s requirements. While testing the C4ISR system at the same time  as the assets can work, this strategy is not consistent with Coast Guard  acquisition guidance if the C4ISR system\u2019s key performance parameters  are not tested.

The original C4ISR system, which cost  $413 million to develop and field, was designed and built as a tightly  integrated system bundling large commercial and government software  programs with contractor-proprietary software, which made it difficult and  costly to maintain\u2014primarily due to its unique characteristics and large  size. For example, according to program officials, the Coast Guard relied  on the contractor to conduct even basic system updates, which required  new software code because of how the system was integrated.", "As a result, in 2010, the Coast Guard began replacing the C4ISR  software in two steps. First, to address immediate issues, the Coast  Guard separated the weapons and command and control/navigation  portions of the software but maintained the ability to share data between  these portions of the system. Second, the Coast Guard has developed  and is now installing a new software package that shares data between  proven systems, which makes the system easier to maintain. For  example, the communication/navigation system is largely based upon the  Navy\u2019s Global Command and Control System, a long-standing system  maintained by DOD. In addition, the combat system is adapted from the  Navy\u2019s Aegis system. While the previous version of the C4ISR system  also contained this software, the Coast Guard\u2019s new configuration keeps  these systems independent to improve performance and maintenance,  while still allowing data to be passed back and forth between the software  packages within the system.", "The Coast Guard has spent nearly $2 million to develop this new system,  called Seawatch, which will have to be further developed for each asset  on which it is fielded. For example, it will cost an additional $88.5 million  in acquisition funds to purchase the software and hardware needed to  field the system on the National Security Cutters. In addition, the Coast  Guard is replacing the mission systems on the HC-144 and HC-130J  airframes with a proven Navy system to address obsolescence,  maintenance, and performance issues.

This strategy would be acceptable as long as the Coast Guard  incorporates the key performance parameters specifically related to the  C4ISR system into the vessel and aircraft test plans. In its response, DHS  disagreed in general with our description of the C4ISR system as not  meeting goals, noting that, according to the Coast Guard, the original  system was closed as a result of obsolescence and not due to  performance and maintenance problems. While it is true that much of the  original system\u2014developed as part of Deepwater\u2014is obsolete because it  was inextricably linked to the commercial vendor\u2019s proprietary software,  performance problems were also an issue. We have previously reported  on these problems, such as assets not having the capability to share data  as envisioned and the system needing to be restarted during operations.   In short, the system of systems capability that was the original intent has  not been achieved. While DHS states that the C4ISR program is one  example of where the Coast Guard made tough decisions to provide the  greatest capability of equipment while using the least amount of dollars,  the Coast Guard invested $413 million to develop and field the original  system that is now being replaced with Seawatch.", "While DHS concurred with our fourth recommendation to develop a 20- year fleet modernization plan, the response does not fully address our  concerns or set forth an estimated date for completion, as the response  did for the other recommendations.  DHS stated that the Coast Guard  values long term planning and can assemble a profile of the anticipated  service lives of the various assets and project this information to the  future.  However, the response also reaffirmed the very reason we made  this recommendation\u2014that trade-off decisions considering the cost,  schedule, and performance of acquisitions are made during the annual  budget process. There is no evidence that these short-term budget  decisions will amount to a good long-term strategy and, as we have  previously noted, the Coast Guard\u2019s annual, budget-driven approach  creates continual churn as program baselines must continually re-align  with budget realities instead of budgets being formulated to support  program baselines. In the case of the Coast Guard, this budget-driven  process is pushing tough trade-off decisions\u2014between capability and  cost\u2014into the future. Without a long-term plan, as we have  recommended, no one knows what taxpayers are ultimately going to get  for their approximately $1.5 billion annual investment in Coast Guard  acquisitions. We continue to believe that a properly constructed 20-year  plan is necessary to illuminate what is feasible in the long term and will  also provide a basis for informed decisions that align the Coast Guard\u2019s  needs and resources.", "DHS and the Coast Guard also provided technical comments that we  incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Department  of Homeland Security, Commandant of the Coast Guard, and Director of  the Office of Management and Budget.

Additional scope and methodology information on each objective of this  report follows.", "To assess how selected assets are performing operationally and to what  extent they are achieving desired performance levels in testing, we  selected key assets that are being used in operations that were a part of  the original 2007 baseline\u2014the Maritime Patrol Aircraft (HC-144), Fast  Response Cutter, National Security Cutter, and the Command, Control,  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems\u2014and reviewed test reports and  operational data for these assets. We also reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s  Major Systems Acquisition Manual and Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) Acquisition Management Directive 102-01 to review regulations  and directions for operational testing. We assessed operational test  reports for the HC-144 and Fast Response Cutter to determine what  issues were discovered during testing and interviewed officials from the  DHS\u2019s Science and Technology directorate and the Navy\u2019s Commander,  Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COTF) to discuss the results and  limitations of these tests and plans for future testing. For the National  Security Cutter and C4ISR programs, we reviewed preliminary tests and  changes being made to the systems as a result of knowledge gained  through early testing or operations that has led to retrofits or design  changes. We compared the results of these tests and operational data  with operational requirements documents for each program to determine  if these assets are performing as planned. We interviewed Coast Guard  officials with the capabilities and resource directorates, and officials and  operators with the National Security Cutter, Fast Response Cutter, HC- 144, and C4ISR programs to gain a greater understanding of operational  challenges and how they are being addressed. We met with National  Security Cutter operators at U.S. Coast Guard Base Alameda in  Alameda, California and we met with the District Commander for the  Coast Guard\u2019s Seventh District, Fast Response Cutter operators at Coast  Guard Sector Miami, and HC-144 operators at U.S. Coast Guard Air  Station Miami in Miami, Florida and discussed the C4ISR operations  aboard each of these assets to discuss how these assets are performing  operationally. We interviewed contractor representatives from Huntington  Ingalls Industries for the National Security Cutter and Bollinger Shipyards  for the Fast Response Cutter and toured their respective shipyards to  discuss issues related to the production of these assets.", "To determine the current cost of the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition portfolio as  well as plans to fund its assets, we reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s budget  and capital investment plan and identified the programs that are currently  in its acquisition portfolio. Based upon our definition, the Coast Guard\u2019s  current acquisition portfolio consists of all major acquisitions that are  planned to receive funding in the current budget year and/or within the  next 5 years. We reviewed the approved acquisition program baselines  for programs currently in the portfolio to determine their cost and  schedule. We compared current baselines to previous baselines to  evaluate whether there has been any cost or schedule growth in these  programs. In comparing original costs to revised baseline costs, if a  revised baseline presents both threshold costs and objective costs,  threshold costs were used. In determining the cost to complete, we took  the total estimated cost of the acquisition in its current baseline and  subtracted the funding that the program has received as of and including  fiscal year 2014. For some assets, such as the HC-130J which received  funding not included in the Coast Guard budget, we derived the cost to  complete by totaling the funds required to finish the program based upon  the current cost estimate. We also reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s Major  Systems Acquisition Manual for guidance on acquisition program  baselines. We interviewed officials from the Office of Management and  Budget and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Program  Accountability and Risk Management directorate and Program Analysis  and Evaluation directorate to determine what, if anything, they are doing  to balance the Coast Guard\u2019s needs with anticipated funding.", "To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is experiencing  capability gaps, if any, given known affordability issues, we assessed the  Coast Guard\u2019s performance targets and compared these targets with  acquisition plans. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Coast  Guard\u2019s acquisitions and resource directorates to identify the challenges  the Coast Guard faces reaching these targets using current funding levels  and to understand actions taken by the Systems Integration Team and  Executive Oversight Council to address these challenges. We also  reviewed actions the Coast Guard is taking to improve the affordability of  recapitalizing its assets. We interviewed officials with the Coast Guard\u2019s  acquisition directorate and the program managers for all of the programs  currently in the portfolio to discuss the cost of the portfolio and future  funding plans. To determine the condition and expected service life of  legacy assets, we reviewed Coast Guard analysis of these assets and  prior GAO work on legacy assets.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Of these 11 major acquisition programs, 8 were also a  part of the 2007 recapitalization portfolio. Over time, the composition of  the portfolio has changed.  For example, since our last review in 2012,  the Coast Guard has added 3 programs to its acquisition portfolio and  another 7 programs are ending and, therefore, will no longer need  additional acquisition funding. We excluded $3.6 billion in \u201cother costs  including project management\u201d from our analysis of the Coast Guard\u2019s  current portfolio of assets because these costs are not periodically re- baselined. Thus, the total cost of the original 2007 baseline excluding  these costs is $20.563 billion.
