DOD's overall concept is to enable data access for a variety of systems and users in the network no matter which military service owns a weapon system or where a user might be located around the world. DOD is looking to the GIG to form the basis of a network-centric or \"netcentric\" way of fighting wars and to create a decisive advantage over adversaries. DOD has taken the following two-pronged approach to building the GIG: (1) invest in key acquisitions to build a core networking capability, including new communication satellites, next-generation interoperable radios, a new ground-based communication network with significantly expanded bandwidth, and services and applications to manage and protect the network and help users locate, post, and share information; and (2) integrate other existing and planned weapon systems, information technology systems, and logistics, personnel, and other business-related systems into the GIG. To integrate other systems, DOD officials who created the concept for the GIG have developed an initial blueprint or architecture for the GIG and policies to formalize the GIG, and they are attempting to influence key acquisition and budgeting decisions to align investments and systems with the GIG. The most critical challenge ahead for DOD is making the GIG a reality. While DOD has taken steps to define its vision and objectives for the GIG on paper and in policy and is beginning to make a heavy investment in the GIG as well as systems that will be heavily dependent on the GIG, it is not fully known how DOD will meet these objectives. For example, it is not known which investments should take priority over others and how these decisions will be enforced. Moreover, it is not known how DOD will assess the overall progress of the GIG and determine whether the network as a whole is providing a worthwhile return on investment, particularly in terms of enhancing and even transforming military operations. According to DOD officials, the enhancements DOD is making to its planning and budgeting processes are meant to begin addressing these questions. Until DOD implements an investment and oversight strategy for the GIG as a whole, it is at risk of making investments that do not fit DOD's vision for the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To achieve long-term dominance over evolving, sophisticated threats, the  Department of Defense (DOD) is seeking to make transformational  improvements to military capabilities.

DOD  has said that a successful transformation hinges largely on disparate  weapon systems sharing information seamlessly, regardless of which  military service owns the system and preempting the need to retrofit  weapon systems to solve compatibility issues with other systems in the  field. Beyond the need to build new weapon systems according to a  predetermined architecture, DOD says the transformation encompasses  new doctrine and institutional changes for DOD and its partners.", "One of DOD\u2019s key initiatives to respond to this transformation is the  Global Information Grid (GIG).

Funding and cost  information was obtained from budget exhibits and other accounting  reports compiled by the DOD. We did not conduct a comprehensive  review of the financial reports or records. Also, we did not evaluate the  content and quality of the GIG architecture and standards. In addition, we  interviewed key officials responsible for the GIG in the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks Information and Integration  (DOD\u2019s Chief Information Officer); the Defense Information Systems  Agency; Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); Office of  Program Analysis and Evaluation; Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; and Office of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff.

Too often weapon and information technology  systems have been acquired by the military services and defense agencies  without regard for their ability to work in a joint operational environment.  As a result, extra layers of redundancy and common systems have been  put in place to support military operations, but without the ability to easily  and quickly exchange data.", "DOD defines the GIG as a \u201cglobally interconnected, end-to-end set of  information capabilities, associated processes, and personnel for  collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information.\u201d  The GIG is meant to improve interoperability among DOD\u2019s many  information systems and weapon systems. More important, the GIG is to  facilitate DOD\u2019s effort to transform to a more network-based, or  \u201cnetcentric,\u201d way of fighting wars and achieving information superiority  over adversaries, much the same way as the Internet has transformed  industry and society on a global scale. Netcentric operations and warfare,  according to DOD, are the combination of tactics, techniques, and  procedures that a networked force can employ to create a decisive  warfighting advantage. The GIG\u2019s role is to create an environment in which  users can access data on demand at any location without having to rely on  (and wait for) organizations in charge of data collection to process and  disseminate the information. Data could emanate from a variety of  sources, including weapon systems belonging to other military services,  space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellites, and  DOD logistics, financial, and other systems that carry out business  operations. Ultimately, DOD expects that most of these systems will  become part of the GIG.", "With greater data access and a more robust communications  infrastructure, DOD expects the GIG to enable more timely execution of  military operations, collaborative mission planning and execution,  common views of the battlespace, and more timely assessments of the  condition of equipment and the levels of supplies. For example, according  to DOD officials, greater information sharing could dramatically increase  capabilities to rapidly identify and strike time-critical targets, such as  mobile surface-to-air missile sites. In the past, such targets have proved to  be elusive because the enemy is able to move them to safety in a shorter  time frame than it takes U.S. military forces to detect, assess, and attack  the targets. By having greater command of a battle situation, DOD expects  that lethality and survivability of equipment and personnel would be  increased. Armor protection could be scaled down in favor of more agility.  In addition, the GIG would reduce the substantial resources and logistics  needed to bring command, control, and communications systems to the  war-fighting environment. Table 1 illustrates how DOD envisions the GIG  will help transform military operations.", "The GIG is to be much like the Internet, but with less dependence on  ground-based and fixed systems and equipment to transmit and route data  and more dependence on space-based and mobile, ad hoc systems to carry  out these functions. Figure 1 shows the various layers of the GIG\u2019s overall  concept. At the core are communications satellites, next-generation  radios, and an installations-based network with significantly expanded  bandwidth. These will provide the basic infrastructure through which data  will be routed and shared. In addition, the GIG would employ a variety of  information technology services and applications to manage the flow of  information and ensure the network is reliable and secure. Various  information technology tools would be available to help users determine  what information is available, where to find it, and how best to use it. DOD  envisions that communities of interest would be developed, linking users  with common interests who would collaborate on analyzing and sharing  information. Ultimately, most of DOD\u2019s sensors, weapon systems, business  systems, and systems belonging to decision makers, military units, and  allies would be tied into the GIG network\u2014serving as both users and  providers of data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken a two-pronged approach to build the GIG: (1) invest in a  set of core enterprise programs and initiatives to build a core network and  information capability and (2) bring other existing and planned weapon  systems, command, control, and communications systems, information  technology systems, and logistics, personnel, and other business-related  systems into the GIG network. The core network acquisitions are to be  developed incrementally over time, with the aim of fielding the first  increment of the GIG by 2010. The GIG is primarily being developed under  the leadership and direction of DOD\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Networks and Information Integration in coordination with  other components in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff.  The Defense Information Systems Agency, military services, combatant  commands, and other defense agencies also play roles in implementing the  GIG. In addition, DOD\u2019s Strategic Command has responsibilities for  eventually operating the GIG. Table 2 shows the key acquisitions for the  GIG\u2019s core network and examples of additional acquisitions that must be  integrated with the GIG.", "According to DOD, the key acquisitions underway to build the GIG  network capability include 1) Transformational Satellite (TSAT), a new  constellation of communications satellites to transmit and route larger  volumes of data; 2) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), a new family of  interoperable radio systems; 3) Global Information Grid-Bandwidth  Expansion (GIG-BE), which includes state of the art optical network  technologies and upgraded routers and switches to increase bandwidth for  greater voice, data, and video transmissions as well as improvements in  network services at about 90 DOD installations; 4) Network Centric  Enterprise Services (NCES), a common set of services and applications to  manage the network and help users locate and share information; 5)  Cryptography Transformation Initiative, tools to protect sensitive  information transmitted across the network and protect the network from  attack; and 6) Horizontal Fusion, which is a portfolio of initiatives focused  on developing and demonstrating data applications and tools for  information sharing and netcentric operations.", "Table 3 reviews each of the key acquisitions for the GIG\u2019s core capability,  including the purpose, the financial investment between fiscal years 2004  and 2009, the military service or defense agency responsible for managing  the acquisition, and the current status. Some of these acquisitions will  require funding, including sustainment costs, beyond 2009 but amounts are  not yet known.", "In developing the GIG\u2019s core capability, DOD intends to build upon and  enhance ongoing terrestrial and space-based networks and systems, such  as the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite communication  system and the Defense Information Systems Network. The new programs  underway are intended to improve communications and networking  capabilities significantly. For example, according to DOD officials, current  telecommunication lines are not robust enough to handle the volume of  information needed to facilitate optimal, strategic decision making. The  GIG-BE is designed to remove current bandwidth constraints. The GIG-BE  is to use advanced fiber-optic backbone and switching technology to  upgrade telecommunications lines and provide initially up to 10 gigabytes  per second of bandwidth at selected defense installations around the  world. Also, unlike DOD\u2019s legacy radio systems that cannot interoperate  with one another, JTRS is software-based, meaning that the radios are  essentially computers that can be programmed to imitate other types of  radios and thus be readily configured to operate in different networks and  waveforms based on common standards. JTRS is expected to act as a  gateway for users with different hardware radios\u2014a capability that speeds  the transition to universal interoperability for DOD military operations.  Also, unlike current communication satellites, TSAT is to be equipped with  laser-optical payloads for high-capacity links to other air and space  platforms. By using laser-optics, TSAT is intended to operate above the  radiofrequency spectrum and provide relief to current military bandwidth  constraints. NCES is to make use of commercial products and tools to  manage messaging, storage, search, and other capabilities across  platforms, but also require new and possibly customized services to  ensure the sharing of information based on mission demands and  priorities. Tools to allow users to \u201csmartly\u201d pull and fuse information will  require investing in new data content and management techniques.  Enhanced security (information assurance) capabilities will need to be  developed, including encryption mechanisms and devices, intrusion  detection systems, and secure network management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Acquisitions That Must Be Integrated with the GIG Core Network", "paragraphs": ["Most ongoing and planned weapon systems; command, control and  communications systems; and business systems will need to be integrated  with the GIG network, because they will be the primary providers and  receivers of data needed to support future military operations.", "DOD plans to integrate most weapon systems into the GIG. In fact,  some \u201ctransformational\u201d weapon systems now under development  require a more advanced communications infrastructure to perform as  intended and to support voice, data, videoconferencing, and imagery  transmissions. Without an integrated network that ties together  different systems and enables information to flow freely across the  battlefield, the high-paced warfare that DOD envisioned is likely to be  constrained, according to DOD. For example, the Army is developing  the Future Combat Systems, a new generation of manned and  unmanned ground vehicles, air vehicles, and munitions that are to be  lighter and more mobile yet lethal and survivable. Rather than rely on  heavy armor to withstand an enemy attack, the Future Combat Systems  will depend on superior information to see and kill the enemy before  being detected. According to DOD, the ability to make this leap  depends on (1) a network to collect, process, and deliver vast amounts  of information, such as imagery and data, and (2) the performance of  the individual systems themselves. Not only must systems within the  Future Combat Systems interoperate effectively, they also must  interoperate with the GIG. The GIG must perform at a level that  enables the Future Combat Systems to quickly collect, process, and  deliver data. DOD is also developing a new constellation of satellites\u2014 known as Space-Based Radar\u2014to provide a near continuous, all- weather global capability of collecting intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance information. Space-Based Radar is expected to be a  critical data provider to transformational systems, such as those within  the Future Combat Systems. Like the Future Combat Systems, the  satellites will require a more robust communications infrastructure to  send massive amounts of imagery data in a timely fashion. According to  DOD, if TSAT, a key GIG component, is not ready in time or cannot  provide the capability originally planned, DOD may need to build  additional capability into Space-Based Radar satellites and ground  stations to reduce the dependency on the communications  infrastructure to transmit data.", "DOD intends to integrate virtually all command, control, and  communications, systems into the GIG. At the same time, DOD intends  to develop and modify these systems to provide military commanders  and forces with near-real time descriptions of the location and  disposition of U.S. military forces and adversaries operating on the  ground and in the air and to provide the ability to communicate across  all elements involved in military operations. Each of the military  services has major architectural initiatives underway (the Air Force\u2019s  C2 Constellation and ConstellationNet, the Army\u2019s LandWarNet, and  the Navy\u2019s ForceNet) to transform their command, control, and  communications systems and information infrastructures into the GIG.  For example, the Army\u2019s Warfighter Information Network-Tactical  (WIN-T) program (part of LandWarNet) is intended to be the  integrating communications network that links Future Combat Systems  units with higher Army echelons and with the GIG. In addition, DOD  considers numerous other systems to be important in achieving the  GIG, including the Mobile User Objective System (satellite  communications), Global Command and Control System/Joint  Command and Control, Deployed Joint Command and Control, and  Teleports (information transport system). DOD has further identified  the need to eventually link the GIG to coalition, allied, and non-DOD  users and systems.", "DOD also intends to integrate its business systems into the GIG.

DOD also has developed a  reference model so program managers of various architectures and  systems can ensure GIG compliance. According to DOD, the reference  model\u2019s key purpose is to provide users with an understanding of the GIG  through common definitions and terms of reference, standards, and  templates for developing more detailed architectures. Future versions of  the GIG architecture are to include more complete views of DOD\u2019s  operational environment and existing enterprise requirements.  Furthermore, DOD is modifying its Joint Technical Architecture, which  sets standard technologies and protocols to better ensure interoperability  and to complement the GIG architecture.", "DOD is also in the process of issuing new policies, standards, and  guidance to formalize the architecture. Specifically, DOD has created  policy that requires all departmental architectures to be GIG compliant.  DOD also has developed specific policies, standards, and guidance to  implement the GIG and help ensure that the military services acquire  systems that integrate with the GIG. Several policies establish the GIG as a  cornerstone for enabling DOD to achieve information superiority, formally  define the objectives and key elements of the GIG, and assign roles and  responsibilities for the GIG on an enterprise basis. Others assign  responsibility and define waiver procedures for specific aspects of the  GIG, such as ground-based telecommunications networks and NCES. For  example, DOD formalized a waiver process to assess network and  telecommunications systems (such as local area networks) that are not  GIG-compliant. In addition, DOD has set standards to address data  connectivity. To provide a common format for the transmission of  information across the GIG, DOD recently mandated that GIG systems  must be Internet Protocol Version 6 capable, as well as Internet Protocol  Version 4 (the Internet currently is based on version 4.), or obtain a  waiver. Furthermore, DOD developed a netcentric data strategy,  standardizing the way data will be described and used in systems that  make up the GIG.

Over  the past couple years, DOD has revised its three primary decision-making  processes for determining and delivering military capabilities\u2014 requirements setting, acquisition, and budgeting\u2014to focus acquisitions  and investment decisions on meeting joint mission needs, particularly with  regard to interoperability. In revising these processes, DOD has  emphasized compliance with the GIG architecture. DOD officials have  taken further action intended to strengthen these decisions by developing  tools and criteria for actively participating in the decision-making  process\u2014by assisting military services in preparing for major acquisition  reviews (as part of integrated product teams) and/or by providing input to  decision-making boards. The revisions DOD has made to its requirements  setting, acquisition, and budgeting process are all fairly recent. Therefore,  it is too early to assess whether they will be successful in achieving their  goals.", "For example, DOD revised its requirements-setting process to shift the  focus to a more capabilities-based approach for determining joint war- fighting needs rather than a threat-based approach focused on individual  systems and platforms. Under the threat-based approach, the services  were primarily responsible for defining requirements, selecting  alternatives, and developing systems, which frequently resulted in the  fielding of stovepiped systems and duplicating capabilities. DOD\u2019s  rationale for shifting to capabilities-based requirements is a recognition  that there is greater uncertainty in future military conflicts without a  clearly defined adversary and it will need to respond across a broader  range of military operations. The new Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System, established in October 2003, is organized around  key functional concepts and areas\u2014command and control, force  application, battlespace awareness, focused logistics, and force  protection--aimed at improving joint warfighting capabilities. In addition, a  sixth area has been established\u2014netcentric operations\u2014to enable  planning across functional areas and support integration of netcentric  capabilities. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks  and Information Integration and Joint Staff officials believe the joint  concept will provide a more coherent framework for identifying  capabilities gaps, comparing alternatives, aligning requirements to the  GIG, and reduce the potential for stovepiped, duplicative capabilities.", "DOD officials also indicated that the department has begun revising its  planning and budgeting process in an effort to instill more collaboration  among different components of the department in investment decisions.  For example, DOD is asking the military services to plan budgets around  guidance that takes a joint perspective. Data collection and management  processes are intended to be merged into a portfolio management  approach that enables program reviews and budget reviews to occur in a  more integrated manner rather than sequentially. To complement this  process, DOD is planning to develop an investment portfolio management  structure to better manage its information technology resources where  decisions about what information technology investments to make,  modify, or terminate, are based on the GIG architecture and other  objectives, such as mission area goals. Other recent policies have focused  on establishing more effective investment processes for information  technology systems that need to integrate with the GIG.", "DOD has developed several mechanisms to complement the decision  making that occurs within the Joint Capabilities Integration and  Development System, planning and budgeting, and acquisition processes.  For example, in November 2003, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Networks and Information Integration, in consultation with  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition Technology and Logistics, and U.S. Joint Forces Command,  established a new Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter and review  process to focus greater attention on systems interoperability for joint  operations as well as the information-sharing requirements of the GIG. The  Net-Ready Key Performance Parameter is built around compliance with  the GIG architecture, and the reference model will be used to assess  system information needs, information assurance, and the technical  exchange of information. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Networks and Information Integration has also developed a netcentric  checklist to guide the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development  System and acquisition reviews. The checklist is based on the GIG  architecture and will be used to assess whether key standards and  protocols are being considered and built into particular capabilities and  systems being acquired. In addition, the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Network and Information Integration has established a  systems engineering and evaluation capability to support the reviews. A  team of systems engineers will provide end-to-end technical support to the  office and funding has been requested to create a facility to test key GIG- related systems and components. DOD will be conducting specific  netcentric reviews of major acquisition programs to assess whether they  are transitioning to integrate with the future network. About 129  information technology, weapon systems, and business systems have been  selected to participate in the initial round of assessments.

Addressing these questions is a daunting task. DOD must find  ways to make and enforce trade-off decisions for literally thousands of  information technology systems, weapon systems, command and control  systems, intelligence systems, and other systems. These decisions will  need to span a wide range of organizations, including the military services  and their respective major commands and functional activities, numerous  large defense agencies and field activities, and various combatant and joint  operational commands that are responsible for military operations for  specific geographic regions or theaters of operations. Having accurate and  reliable visibility over spending on systems that must integrate with the  GIG will be necessary as well as having effective mechanisms for  identifying and deciding which systems should be pursued and which  should not. In 2003, we reported (as part of a survey of federal agencies  enterprise architecture programs) that DOD had made progress in  developing the GIG architecture, however, the department had not  completed some essential architecture products that describe the desired  (target) technology environment and provide a sequencing plan for  transitioning to it. More specifically, at this point, DOD is largely leaving  it up to its components and services to decide how best to migrate their  systems to the GIG. There is no well-defined strategy that  identifies what capabilities DOD will invest in and what it will not  invest in;  identifies how investments will align with the goals and objectives of  the GIG architecture;    determines what is affordable, particularly in light of near-term and    sets out criteria for determining what legacy systems should remain or  be phased out; and    specifies by whom and how decisions will be enforced.", "In addition, it is unknown how senior leaders within DOD will be able to  focus on the progress of the GIG as a whole, that is, whether it is being  developed and fielded within cost and schedule, whether risks are being  adequately mitigated, and whether the GIG is providing a worthwhile  return on investment, particularly in terms of enhancing military  operations. Until DOD implements an investment and oversight strategy  for the GIG as a whole, it is at risk of making investments that do not fit its  vision for the future.", "According to DOD officials, the enhancements DOD is making to its  planning and budgeting processes are meant to begin addressing these  questions. However, these changes may be difficult to implement for a  number of reasons. First, to some degree because of the broad scope and  crosscutting nature of the GIG concept, no office or single program is in  charge of the GIG, making it more difficult to make and enforce trade-off  decisions. Moreover, while key acquisition, budgeting, and requirements  setting processes have been modified, they still largely operate under the  same organizational structure, where it has been difficult to link  acquisition and investment decisions to joint concepts like the GIG.", "Additionally, previous efforts that have been undertaken in past years to  foster interoperability among DOD systems have had limited success,  principally because management tools and leadership attention were not  strong enough to provide sufficient oversight and overcome resistance by  the military services to forgo their unique requirements in favor of  requirements that would benefit the department, as the following  examples illustrate:  In our 2001 report on DOD\u2019s efforts to improve its ability to attack  time-critical targets, we noted that DOD had undertaken numerous  efforts to achieve system interoperability, including the development of  guidance, oversight controls, directives and policies, and technology  demonstrations. However, success was limited because DOD had not  yet overcome resistance from the military services, it lacked an  architecture to guide interoperability efforts and some current  oversight and control mechanisms, such as the interoperability  certification process, were not working or were not being enforced.", "In 2003, we reported that two joint acquisition programs lacked  mechanisms to overcome parochialism and stovepipes at the military  service level. The JTRS program lacked a strong management structure  to resolve operational requirements and funding issues among the  services and DOD\u2019s approach to planning Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  lacked an effective strategic plan to ensure the military services and  other defense agencies focus their development efforts on systems that  complement each other.", "In 2004, we reported that DOD was making limited progress with its  business modernization initiative\u2014a departmentwide effort focused on  transforming DOD business operations, including standardizing and  optimizing business systems across DOD and reducing duplication.  After 3 years of effort, we reported that we have not seen any  significant change in the content of DOD\u2019s business systems  modernization architecture (which is to be integrated into the GIG  architecture) or in DOD\u2019s approach to investing billions of dollars in  existing and new business systems. Further, DOD had not yet  implemented an effective management structure and processes to  provide adequate control and accountability over its $5 billion annual  investment in business systems modernization. In particular, we  reported that DOD had not yet clearly defined the roles and  responsibilities for its new business investment domains, established  common investment criteria, and conducted a comprehensive review  of its existing business systems to ensure that they are consistent with  the business modernization architecture. DOD acknowledged that it  still had much more to do, including developing the business systems  modernization architecture to a necessary level of detail, defining  specific performance metrics, and clarifying the roles and  responsibilities associated with managing the domains of portfolios of  business systems and ensuring that these systems comply with the  architecture.", "Several recent studies sponsored by DOD recognize that developing an  investment strategy and adopting better management tools is critical for  the success of the GIG. For example, a 1999 Defense Science Board study  assessed DOD\u2019s strategies and processes for attaining information  superiority and advocated that (1) an executive office be established to  lead and implement the GIG and that (2) the office develop an  implementation plan, including technical milestones and measurable  interim goals, and identify resources to permit the transition to and  completion of the GIG. A 2004 report by the U.S. Joint Forces Command,  documenting the processes and planned activities underway to achieve  transformational improvements in joint military capabilities,  recommended, among other things, that the GIG should include a time- phased plan for how future capabilities will link to current investments. In  addition, the report recommends that such a plan should show how  network development efforts underway by each of the military services  will contribute to and be compatible with the GIG.", "Other studies have pointed to the need to strengthen current management  processes to ensure warfighters themselves have more input into  investment decisions. For example, a 2003 study chartered by the  Secretary of Defense to examine how DOD develops, resources and  provides joint capabilities, recommended moderate to more radical  actions to streamline existing processes and/or establish alternative  organizations to better integrate defense capabilities in support of joint  military objectives. Organizational alternatives for strengthening the  acquisition process ranged from the establishment of joint program  executives for each of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development  System\u2019s functional capabilities areas that would provide input and  oversee resources on joint programs, to capability acquisition executives  for each of the capability areas who would have direct oversight and  decision authority over all programs. A 2004 study by the Center for  Strategic and International Studies identified defense reforms needed to  meet the challenges of a new strategic era and made a number of  recommendations, including several to improve the acquisition of joint  capabilities and establish a more effective resource allocation process. For  example, the study recommended that the Joint Staff (J-6\u2014Command,  Control, Communications, and Computers) be expanded into a  departmentwide, joint task force with budgetary and acquisition authority  for joint command and control capabilities. In addition, to improve trade- off decisions across mission areas, the study advocates building capacities  in the combatant commands for a stronger role in the resource allocation  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Challenges", "paragraphs": ["There are also many unknowns concerning how DOD will meet its  requirements and vision in terms of people, processes, and, ultimately,  operations. First, DOD has yet to determine how much information should  be posted on the network; when it should be posted; and how and where it  should be used. Once these factors are determined, DOD must develop  rules of operation to ensure the network can work as intended without  precluding the benefits that can be derived from more flexible and  dynamic information sharing. Currently, various offices within DOD are  working through questions on whether unlimited amounts of data should  be made available through the GIG, including unprocessed intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance data, without the benefit of some  assimilation and analysis. These are important questions that need to be  addressed in the near future because they could affect the direction of  investments in netcentric systems and non-network systems as well as  changes that need to be made in how the intelligence community operates.", "Even after these questions are settled, significant operational challenges  remain. Joint commanders and the military services may need to find ways  to adapt to an environment where data can be more readily obtained and  shared by lower levels in the chains of command. New operational  concepts are being developed to guide how military operations are to be  conducted in this enhanced technology environment. They will need to be  followed by associated doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Developing joint operational concepts is one of the key tenets under the  Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System; however, it is  unclear how the concepts will be developed and translated by these  boards into more detailed tactics, techniques and procedures. We recently  reported that DOD had been proceeding with the JTRS program for  several years without clear definition of how JTRS capabilities should be  used in an operational environment and that the program\u2019s concept of  operations did not reflect the joint vision of JTRS but instead the service- centric radio-replacement perspective. If DOD is to achieve its long-term  goals for netcentric warfare, it is imperative that it develop concepts and  processes for how individual systems, such as JTRS, can be used to  leverage DOD\u2019s new network infrastructure and maximize interoperability  and collaboration in military operations.", "Moreover, DOD must successfully persuade data owners to accept the  value of sharing data with a broader audience and to trust the network  enough to post data. We spoke with several officials in charge of GIG  programs who acknowledged that facilitating these cultural changes\u2014 particularly with the intelligence community\u2014will be difficult.", "In addition, DOD also faces a formidable task in persuading the military  services and other users of the network to rely on information technology  applications and services being developed by the Defense Information  Systems Agency. This agency has been tasked with developing and  providing key voice, video, and data connectivity through core enterprise  services for the GIG, such as data query (search or discovery) capabilities  and information assurance. However, the military services and defense  agencies have historically been reluctant to rely on the Defense  Information Systems Agency for these services. We have reported in the  past that the military services have regularly bypassed Defense  Information Systems Agency, preferring instead to procure their own  telecommunications networks and commercial satellites bandwidth  services because they were dissatisfied with the level of service provided  by the agency as well as the cost and length of time it took to procure  these services centrally."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Building a reliable, secure network that will operate on the move, virtually  anywhere and provide the necessary information and services to enable  netcentric military operations presents considerable technical challenges.  While DOD intends to utilize existing commercial communications and  networking technologies, which have advanced significantly in recent  years, the GIG requires DOD to advance a number of key technologies,  develop a series of complex systems and software, field them without  delay so schedules for other dependent systems are not disrupted, and  develop the means to effectively manage and protect the network and its  data.", "At this time, however, DOD is pushing ahead on several programs with  immature technologies and with aggressive development and fielding  schedules. As a result, DOD is at risk of not delivering required capabilities  within budgeted resources. This, in turn, may affect schedules and funding  for other systems depending on the GIG. For example, two key GIG- related programs\u2014JTRS and TSAT\u2014are facing schedule and performance  risks, which are largely rooted in attempts to move these programs into  product development without sufficient knowledge that their technologies  can work as intended. In March 2004, we reported that none of the 20  critical hardware and software technologies for the Army\u2019s initial JTRS  radio development for ground vehicles and helicopters were sufficiently  mature according to best practice standards. When product development  began in June 2002, the Army determined that while many of the  technologies within the program had been used in other radio  applications, they could not be assessed as mature because they had not  been integrated into a complex radio, such as JTRS. Mature backup  technologies exist for some critical technologies, but program officials  have cautioned that substituting them could complicate integration or  result in degraded performance. Moreover, the program recently  experienced a 4-month schedule slip that officials attribute to short-term  technology deviations affecting size, weight, and power requirements for  the radio sets. Further, the program entered product development with an  ambitious schedule that program officials recognized as high risk. In  particular, the program has a compressed test and evaluation phase that  leaves little room for error and rework.", "We also recently reported that the TSAT program entered into product  development with only one of its six critical technologies sufficiently  mature. The remaining five technologies are not expected to reach  maturity until 2006. Backup technologies exist for three of the five  immature technologies, but they would degrade system performance. The  other technology\u2014single access laser communications\u2014has no backup  and program officials indicated any delay in maturing this technology  would cause the first satellite launch date to slip significantly. DOD  believes it has adequate measures to mitigate these risks, however,  concern over TSAT technology readiness led the Air Force to schedule an  interim review for November 2004, which will determine whether the  program\u2019s technology development has progressed sufficiently or whether  alternative action should be taken.", "Similar risks extend to the systems that must be integrated with the GIG  and on which DOD is dependent for achieving its vision for netcentric  warfare. For example, our review of the Future Combat Systems  determined that the program is at significant risk, in part because more  than 75 percent of its critical technologies were immature at the start of  development and many will not be sufficiently mature until the production  decision. First prototypes for the systems that make up the Future  Combat Systems will not be delivered until just before the production  decision, and full demonstration of the Future Combat Systems\u2019 ability to  work and meet its goals will not occur until after production has begun. If  the lessons learned from best practices and the experiences of past  programs have any bearing, the Future Combat Systems program is likely  to encounter \u201clate-cycle churn,\u201d a phrase used by private industry to  describe the discovery of significant problems late in development and the  resulting search for fixes when costs are high and time is short.", "Networking, network management, and secure network management  challenges are considerable. Currently, mobile networking is limited,  mainly to narrowband, fixed infrastructures, and relatively stable user  groups. The GIG network will require new wideband waveforms that can  handle the expected high data rates, throughput of information, and ability  to transmit integrated voice, data, and video simultaneously. In addition,  dynamic networking capabilities that can automatically adjust to changing  circumstances, such as intrusions or node failures, are needed; however,  the scalability of network management technologies for a network like the  GIG with such a large number of nodes is unproven. To facilitate timely  and prioritized access to information from a wide variety of sources, the  network will require enhanced quality of service mechanisms and  algorithms to manage bandwidth allocation and handle the flow of  information and security. Furthermore, advances will be needed in several  other technological areas, such as antennas, power sources, and the  miniaturization of components to facilitate mobile communications. For  example, current antennas do not support all of the portions of the radio  frequency spectrum where the GIG network will operate and are limited to  specific communications waveforms. Advanced multiband antennas will  be needed to support mobile and simultaneous communications across  different portions of the spectrum.", "Integrating other elements of the network will also be challenging. The  increased bandwidth capability provided by the GIG-BE program may not  be fully realized if the military services and defense agencies do not use  compatible technologies and protocols in upgrading their networks. Even  if the technologies and protocols are compatible, bandwidth may be  limited if these networks are not properly designed and integrated to  manage voice, data, and imagery transmissions. Network management  policies may pose challenges if common agreement cannot be reached  across the military services and defense agencies on standards and  information assurance requirements. For example, DOD and the  intelligence community have not yet reached agreement on how they will  exchange information and verify security credentials on the GIG network.", "Information assurance itself may be one of the most critical challenges  facing DOD. While building a network based on Internet protocols is  expected by DOD to provide a more viable path to achieve interoperability  and enable more dynamic and flexible information sharing, it also exposes  DOD to the same vulnerabilities that face all users of the Internet, and it  increases the opportunity for potential attackers with limited knowledge  and technical skills to cause a great deal of damage. Establishing network  and system security safeguards\u2014such as firewalls, identifying the sender  and recipient of information, protecting information from unauthorized  access, and safeguarding data to prevent accidental and deliberate  alterations\u2014will be essential but difficult given the size the network and  the thousands of systems and users that will be linked to it.", "Moreover, if the network is to be used to provide warfighters on the move  with access to intelligence and other sensitive information on demand,  information will need to be encrypted to safeguard data from misuse.  However, the technologies needed to secure communications, such as  software programmable encryption devices are still in their infancy.  Further, the complexity and magnitude of enabling hundreds of systems  and applications to operate in a secure, Web-based environment will  require careful planning and coordination. Comprehensive plans will be  needed to ensure that sensitive data and communications are safeguarded  across diverse platforms. This will require DOD to identify sensitive data  as well as applications, databases, storage subsystems, and media used to  process and store the data. Once systems have been examined, data  access models must be applied to determine proper security levels for  information and how integration can occur across platforms without  disrupting network and near-real time operations. No one security solution  likely will address GIG requirements.", "Lastly, the enterprise information services planned for the GIG pose timing  challenges. For example, in the near-term, DOD has established a goal to  complete the transition to Internet Protocol Version 6 by fiscal year 2008.  According DOD officials, the commercial industry may not be able to  provide the necessary products for Internet Protocol Version 6 by the  targeted milestone. Also, the transition will not be completed until a Joint  Staff developed set of performance and technical criteria can be met. In  addition, because of the enormous amount of data that will become  available, new data fusion methods will need to be developed to help users  rapidly identify, access, and make sense of available information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is depending on the GIG to enable a fundamental transformation in  the way military operations are conducted. While DOD\u2019s vision of the GIG  is compelling, the breadth and depth of the GIG and DOD\u2019s objectives for  netcentric warfare, present enormous challenges and risks\u2014many of  which have not been successfully overcome in smaller-scale efforts and  many of which require significant changes in DOD\u2019s culture. Moreover,  even though DOD has begun to make heavy investments to implement the  new network and to ask the military services to accept its vision for the  GIG, important questions as to how DOD will make the GIG a reality and  how it will oversee progress as a whole and ensure the GIG is providing an  adequate return on DOD\u2019s investment are only just beginning to be  addressed, leaving DOD at risk of making investments that may not fit in  with its vision for the future. Moreover, many new weapon systems and  sensors, which are costing DOD tens of billions of dollars, are critically  dependent on the future network to successfully achieve their own  capabilities. Any disruptions in the schedule for key systems that support  the network, therefore, can have significant ramifications. As such, it is  important that DOD ensure it has sufficient knowledge about these  systems (e.g., requirements, technologies, security) as it makes additional  commitments to them and that it has effective risk mitigation plans to  ensure that they can deliver promised capability on time.
