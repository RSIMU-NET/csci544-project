None of the programs GAO assessed were able to fully accomplish their asset delivery and capability goals for the year. Flight test failures, an anomaly, and delays disrupted the development of several components and models and simulations challenges remain.

Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap between technology development and product development or between product development and production. While some concurrency is understandable, committing to product development before requirements are understood and technologies mature or committing to production and fielding before development is complete is a high-risk strategy that often results in performance shortfalls, unexpected cost increases, schedule delays, and test problems. It can also create pressure to keep producing to avoid work stoppages. In contrast, as shown in the notional graphic below, successful programs that deliver promised capabilities for the estimated cost and schedule use a disciplined knowledge-based approach.", "High levels of concurrency were present in MDA\u0092s initial efforts and are present in current efforts, though the agency has begun emphasizing the need to follow knowledge-based development practices. During 2011, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense, the Aegis Standard Missile 3 Block IB, and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense experienced significant ill effects from concurrency. For example, MDA\u0092s discovery of a design problem in a new variant of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program\u0092s interceptors while production was underway increased costs, may require retrofit of fielded equipment, and delayed delivery. Flight test cost to confirm its capability has increased from $236 million to about $1 billion.

The system includes space-based sensors as well as  ground- and sea-based radars, ground- and sea-based interceptor  missiles, and a command and control, battle management, and  communications system providing the warfighter with the necessary  communication links to the sensors and interceptor missiles. A typical  engagement scenario to defend against an intercontinental ballistic  missile would occur as follows:   Since  Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume  of a missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible  attack.", "Upon receiving the cue, land- or sea-based radars are directed to  track the various objects released from the missile and, if so  designed, to identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors,  decoys, and debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a kill vehicle mounted atop  a booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat.

This new  approach, referred to as the European Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA),  consists primarily of Aegis BMD sea-based and land-based systems and  interceptors, as well as various sensors to be deployed over time as the  various capabilities are matured.", "The European PAA policy announced by the President articulates a  schedule for delivering four phases of capability to defend Europe and  augment current protection of the U.S. homeland in the following time  frames: Phase 1 in 2011, Phase 2 in 2015, Phase 3 in 2018, and Phase 4  in 2020.

At the  same time, several critical test failures as well as a test anomaly and  delays disrupted MDA\u2019s flight test plan and the acquisition strategies of  several components. Overall, flight test failures and an anomaly forced  MDA to suspend or slow production of three out of four interceptors  currently being manufactured. The GMD program, in particular, has been  disrupted by two recent failures, which forced MDA to halt flight testing  and restructure its multi-year flight test program, halt production of the  interceptors, and redirect resources to return-to-flight activities.  Production issues forced MDA to slow production of the THAAD  interceptors, the fourth missile being manufactured.", "Table 3 presents a summary of selected MDA goals for fiscal year 2011  that details how well these goals were accomplished. Appendixes IV  through XI further detail MDA\u2019s progress in each of the major programs.", "Highlights of progress and challenges this year include the following:", "Targets: In prior years, we reported that problems with availability and  reliability of targets had caused delays in MDA\u2019s test program;  however, in fiscal year 2011, MDA delivered 11 short- or intermediate- range targets, and all performed successfully. The targets launched  during the year supported tests of several different BMDS elements,  including Aegis BMD, GMD, and Patriot systems without causing  major delays or failures in flight tests. Among these successful flights  was FTX-17, the return-to-flight of MDA\u2019s short-range air-launched  target in July 2011. This was the target\u2019s first launch since an  essential mechanism that releases it from the aircraft failed in a  December 2009 THAAD flight test. After the failure, the agency  identified shortcomings in the contractor\u2019s internal processes that had  to be fixed before air-launched targets could be used again in BMDS  flight tests. Nineteen months later, these deficiencies appeared to be  overcome when the target missile was successfully air-launched in  FTX-17. To reduce risk, the flight was not planned as an intercept  mission but as a target of opportunity for several emerging missile  defense technologies including the Space Tracking Surveillance  System.", "Aegis BMD: In April 2011, the Aegis BMD program demonstrated  capability for the first time to intercept an intermediate-range target,  used remote tracking data provided by an Army/Navy Transportable  Radar Surveillance \u2013 Model- 2 radar, and demonstrated support for  European PAA Phase I. While the Aegis BMD program successfully  conducted this test, there was an anomaly in a critical component of  the SM-3 Block IA interceptor. Despite the anomaly, the interceptor  was able to successfully intercept the target. In September 2011, the  Aegis BMD program failed in its first attempted intercept of its SM-3  Block IB missile. During this test\u2014named FTM-16 Event 2\u2014a  problem occurred in the interceptor and it failed to intercept the target.  The Aegis program has had to add an additional flight test and delay  multiple additional flight tests. Program management officials stated  the SM-3 Block IA deliveries were suspended and the SM-3 Block IB  production was slowed while the failure reviews are conducted.", "THAAD: The THAAD program also had some noteworthy testing  accomplishments in 2011, successfully conducting its first operational  flight test in October 2011. This test was a significant event for the  program as it was designed to be representative of the fielded system  with soldiers conducting the engagement. During the test, the THAAD  system engaged and nearly simultaneously intercepted two short- range ballistic missile targets. However, THAAD also experienced a  delay in its planned flight test schedule for fiscal year 2011. A flight  test originally scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011  was delayed until fiscal year 2012 due to the availability of air- launched targets and then subsequently was canceled altogether.  This cancellation has delayed verification of THAAD\u2019s capability  against a medium-range target.", "GMD: As has been the case since 2005, testing failures continue to  affect the GMD program in fiscal year 2011. Specifically, as a result of  the failed flight test in January 2010, MDA added a retest designated  as FTG-06a. However, this retest also failed in December 2010 due to  a failure in a key component of the kill vehicle. The GMD program has  added two additional flight tests in order to demonstrate the Capability  Enhancement II (CE-II) interceptor. However, since fiscal year 2009  MDA has already manufactured and delivered 12 interceptors, 2 of  which have been used in flight tests, prior to halting further deliveries.  The manufacture of components related to the failure and delivery of  interceptors has been halted while the failure review and resolution  actions are ongoing. MDA conducted a failure review investigation  throughout fiscal year 2011 and concluded that the CE-II interceptor  design does not work as intended and therefore required redesign  and additional development. MDA is currently undergoing an  extensive effort to overcome the design problem and return to  intercept flight tests.", "According to a GMD program official, the program has already  conducted over 50 component and subcomponent tests to develop a  fix and verify the design. MDA also realigned resources from planned  2011 testing activities to fund the investigation and fund return-to- intercept activities including redesign efforts. For example, the  program delayed funding the rotation of older fielded interceptors into  flight test assets, delayed funding interceptor manufacturing, and  delayed purchasing ground-based interceptor (GBI) upgrade kits.  However, the agency did continue its efforts to increase reliability of  the interceptors through upgrades and its repair of five interceptors to  help mitigate the effects on the production line. MDA is planning on  upgrading 15 interceptors between fiscal years 2013 to 2017.  Additionally, MDA plans to refurbish five older interceptors between  2014 and 2017 to support flight tests.", "SM-3 Block IIA: MDA recognized that the program\u2019s schedule  included elevated acquisition risks and, as such, took actions in fiscal  year 2011 to reduce those risks as well as potential future cost  growth. The program planned to hold its system preliminary design  review (PDR)\u2014at which it would demonstrate that the technologies  and resources available for the SM-3 Block IIA would result in a  product that matched its requirements\u2014but subsystem review  problems for key components meant the system review had to be  adjusted by 1 year. The program appropriately added time and money  to its program by revising its schedule to relieve schedule  compression between its subsystem and system-level design reviews  and incorporated lessons learned from other SM-3 variants into its  development to further mitigate production unit costs.

The complex nature of the BMDS, with its wide range of connected  elements, requires integrated system-level models and simulations to  assess its performance in a range of system configurations and  engagement conditions. Assessing BMDS performance through flight  tests alone is prohibitively expensive and faces safety and test range  limitations that can best be dealt with through sound, realistic models and  simulations.", "Ensuring that the models and simulations are sound and realistic requires  a rigorous process to accomplish two main tasks: (1) developing  individual system models and realistically linking those models and  simulations and (2) gathering data from MDA\u2019s ground and flight tests to  feed into the models. MDA attempts to confirm that the models re-create  the actual performance found in BMDS test events. The Operational Test  Agency (OTA) independently assesses how realistic the models are in a  formal process called accreditation. When a model is accredited it means  that it can be trusted to produce high-confidence results for its intended  use, and the limitations of the model are known. The development of  reliable MDA models depends upon the collection of test data upon which  to anchor the models. Because MDA had made very limited progress in  identifying and collecting needed data, MDA\u2019s test program was  reoriented beginning in 2010 to enable the collection of data to support  the development of BMDS models.", "With hardware-in-the-loop models, simulations are conducted with actual mission  components/hardware in a laboratory environment, and the physical  environment/conditions are simulated, under the control of computer equipment.", "MDA officials highlight that the framework is being used to evaluate  BMDS performance in increasingly complex and realistic scenarios,  employing greater numbers of BMDS assets.", "The process of developing and linking these models is extremely complex  and difficult and will take many years to accomplish.

Resolution of these 39  limitations, OTA maintains, would permit MDA\u2019s models and simulations  to provide more realistic representations of BMDS performance using the  full complement of fielded BMDS assets. OTA officials have noted that  since August 2009, MDA has partially or fully resolved 7 of these issues  and identified technical solutions for 15 more. According to OTA officials,  most of the resolved limitations are issues that are more easily  addressed, such as the installation of improved communications systems  and the provision of separate workstations for simulation controllers. No  technical solutions have yet been identified for the remaining 17 of the 39  issues and OTA officials maintain that they are still awaiting an MDA  timeline for the complete resolution of these remaining limitations.", "We reported, in 2009, problems with MDA\u2019s model development and the  lack of flight test data. In 2009, MDA undertook a new approach to test  planning to focus the test program on gathering critical test data needed  for modeling and simulation. Since 2009, MDA has bolstered efforts to  collect test data for the BMDS model and simulation program; however,  considerable effort and time are required to address all known shortfalls.  Through its ongoing test data collection activities, MDA has collected 309  critical variables since 2009; however, those represent only 15 percent of  the total needed. Flight test failures, anomalies and delays have reduced  the amount of real-world data MDA expected. Additionally, some required  data are difficult to collect, posing challenges even when a flight test is  properly executed. When tests are carried out, considerable post-test  data analysis is required for model development. Under the current plan,  MDA does not foresee complete collection of data on these critical  variables until sometime between 2017 and 2022.", "MDA has also made some limited progress in achieving partial  accreditation for some BMDS models\u2014ensuring that they are realistic  and can be trusted and that their limitations are known.

For example, large-scale acquisition efforts were initiated before critical  technologies were fully understood and programs were allowed to move  forward into production without having tests completed to verify  performance. Such practices enabled MDA to quickly ramp up efforts in  order to meet tight presidential deadlines, but they were high risk and  resulted in problems that required extensive retrofits, redesigns, delays,  and cost increases. A program with high levels of concurrency   (1) proceeds into product development before technologies are mature or  appropriate system engineering has been completed or (2) proceeds into  production before a significant amount of independent testing is  conducted to confirm that the product works as intended.

Developmental  challenges and delays are to be expected in complex acquisitions, such  as those for missile defense. However, when concurrency is built into  acquisition plans, any developmental challenges or delays that do occur  exacerbate the cost, schedule, and performance effects of those  problems, particularly when production lines are disrupted or assets have  already been manufactured and must be retrofitted. In 2009, we  recommended that MDA synchronize the development, manufacturing,  and fielding schedules of BMDS assets with the testing and validation  schedules to ensure that items are not manufactured for fielding before  their performance has been validated through testing. In response, DOD  partially concurred with our recommendation, maintaining that MDA was  pursuing synchronization of development, manufacturing, and fielding of  BMDS assets with its established testing and validation requirements.  However, because MDA continues to employ concurrent strategies, it is  likely that it will continue to experience these types of acquisition  problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Highly Concurrent Acquisition Strategies Often Lead to Cost, Schedule, and Performance Consequences", "paragraphs": ["Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap between technology  development and product development or between product development  and production of a system. The stated rationale for concurrency is to  introduce systems in a timelier manner, to fulfill an urgent need, to avoid  technology obsolescence and to maintain an efficient industrial  development and production workforce. While some concurrency is  understandable, committing to product development before requirements  are understood and technologies mature as well as committing to  production and fielding before development is complete is a high-risk  strategy that often results in performance shortfalls, unexpected cost  increases, schedule delays, and test problems. At the very least, a  highly concurrent strategy forces decision makers to make key decisions  without adequate information about the weapon\u2019s demonstrated  operational effectiveness, reliability, logistic supportability, and readiness  for production. Also, starting production before critical tests have been  successfully completed has resulted in the purchase of systems that do  not perform as intended. These premature commitments mean that a  substantial commitment to production has been made before the results  of testing are available to decision makers. Accordingly, they create  pressure to keep producing to avoid work stoppages even when problems  are discovered in testing. These premature purchases have affected the  operational readiness of our forces and quite often have led to expensive  modifications.", "In contrast, successful programs that deliver promised capabilities for the  estimated cost and schedule follow a systematic and disciplined  knowledge-based approach. This approach recognizes that development  programs require an appropriate balance between schedule and risk and,  in practice, programs can be executed successfully with some level of  concurrency.  For example, it is appropriate to order long-lead production  material in advance of the production decision, with the pre-requisite that  developmental testing is substantially accomplished and the design  confirmed to work as intended. We have found that, in this approach, high  levels of product knowledge are demonstrated at critical points in  development. This approach is not unduly concurrent because  programs take steps to gather knowledge that demonstrates that their  technologies are mature, their designs are stable, and their production  processes are in control before transitioning between acquisition phases.  This knowledge helps programs identify risks early and address them  before they become problems. It is a process in which technology  development and product development are treated differently and  managed separately. The process of technology development culminates  in discovery\u2014the gathering of knowledge\u2014and must, by its very nature,  allow room for unexpected results and delays. The process of developing  a product culminates in delivery and therefore gives great weight to  design and production. If a program is falling short in technology maturity,  it is harder to achieve design stability and almost impossible to achieve  production maturity. It is therefore key to separate technology from  product development and product development from production\u2014in other  words, it is key to avoid concurrency when these transitions are made.  The result of a knowledge-based approach is a product delivered on time,  within budget, and with the promised capabilities.", "See figure 1 for depictions of a concurrent schedule and a schedule that  uses a knowledge-based approach.", "In fiscal year 2011, due to flight test failures and a flight test anomaly,  MDA suspended production of two interceptors\u2014one in the GMD  program and one in the Aegis BMD program\u2014and slowed production of a  third\u2014in the Aegis BMD program.

To do so, the GMD element concurrently matured  technology, designed the system, tested the design, and produced and  fielded a system. While this approach allowed GMD to rapidly field a  limited defense that consisted of five CE-I interceptors and a fire control  system, the concurrency resulted in unexpected cost increases, schedule  delays, test problems, and performance shortfalls. Since then, MDA has  produced and emplaced all of its planned CE-I interceptors. To address  issues with the CE-I interceptors, MDA has undertaken an extensive  retrofit and refurbishment program.", "Prior to MDA fully completing development and demonstrating the  capability of the initial interceptor, MDA committed in 2004 to another  highly concurrent development, production, and fielding strategy for an  enhanced version of the interceptor\u2014CE-II\u2014as shown in figure 2.", "MDA proceeded to concurrently develop, manufacture, and deliver 12 of  these interceptors before halting manufacture of components and delivery  of interceptors in 2011 due to the failure in FTG-06a.had not successfully tested this interceptor, failing in both its attempts, it  manufactured and delivered 12 of these interceptors.", "The discovery of the design problem while production is under way has  increased MDA costs, led to a production break, may require retrofit of  fielded equipment, delayed delivery of capability to the war-fighter, and  altered the flight test plan. For example, the flight testing cost to confirm  the CE-II capability has increased from $236 million to about $1 billion.", "In addition, the program will have to undertake another retrofit program,  for the 10 CE-II interceptors that have already been manufactured.  According to a GMD program official, although the full cost is currently  unknown, he expects the cost to retrofit the CE-II interceptors to be  around $18 million each or about $180 million for all 10. Intended to be  ready for operational use in fiscal year 2009, it will now be at least fiscal  year 2013 before the warfighter will have the information needed to  determine whether to declare the variant operational.", "The GMD flight test program has been disrupted by the two back to back  failures. For example, MDA has restructured the planned multiyear flight  test program in order to test the new design prior to an intercept attempt.  MDA currently plans to test the new design in a nonintercept test in fiscal  year 2012.", "Because MDA prematurely committed to production before the results of  testing were available, it has had to take steps to mitigate the resulting  production break, such as accelerating retrofits to 5 of the CE-I  interceptors. Program officials have stated that if the test confirms that the  cause of the failure has been resolved, the program will restart the  manufacturing and integration of the CE-II interceptors. According to  MDA, because of the steps taken to develop and confirm the design  change, a restart of the CE-II production line at that time will be low risk.  However, while MDA has established a rigorous test plan to confirm that  the design problem has been overcome, the confirmation that the design  works as intended through all phases of flight, including the actual  intercept, will not occur until an intercept test\u2014FTG-06b\u2014currently  scheduled for the end of fiscal year 2012 or the beginning of fiscal year  2013.", "High levels of concurrency will continue for the GMD program even if the  next two flight tests are successful.

Meanwhile, testing has yet to validate the missile\u2019s  performance, the cause of the test failures is not yet determined, and  remaining tests may not be completed until 2013. Consequently,  purchasing additional interceptors beyond those needed for development  remains premature. The first SM-3 Block IB developmental flight test  failed in September 2011, and an anomaly occurred in an April 2011 flight  test of the SM-3 Block IA. The flight test failure and the test anomaly  occurred in components that are shared between the SM-3 Block IA and  IB. Program officials are still investigating the reason for these failures.  The program was unable to validate initial SM-3 Block IB capability during  the failed September test, and program officials hope to conduct a series  of three intercept tests in fiscal year 2012 needed to validate SM-3 Block  IB capability. Depending on the timing and content of the failure review  board results, this schedule could change further.", "Any SM-3 Block IB missiles ordered in fiscal year 2012 before mitigations  for the anomaly and the failure, if needed, are determined and before the  three flight tests confirm the design works as intended would be at higher  risk of cost growth and schedule delays. In addition, SM-3 Block IB  missiles already manufactured but not delivered also are at higher risk of  requiring a redesign depending on the results of the failure review.  Program management officials stated MDA has slowed SM-3 Block IB  manufacturing until the outcome of the failure review board is known. It  remains unclear whether the additional 46 missiles will be ordered before  the failure reviews are complete and the interceptor is able to  demonstrate that it works as intended. Recognizing the critical importance  of the completing the planned fiscal year 2012 intercept tests, the  operational need for SM-3 missiles, the relative success of the SM-3  Block IA, as well as the potential for a production break, the Senate  Committee on Appropriations directed MDA to use the fiscal year 2012  SM-3 Block IB funds for additional Block IA missiles should the test and  acquisition schedule require any adjustments during fiscal year 2012.  However, a decision to purchase additional SM-3 Block IA missiles in  fiscal year 2012 to help avoid a production break may be affected by the  SM-3 Block IA failure investigation that has not yet been completed.

Concurrency can  enable rapid acquisition of critical capabilities but at a high risk,  particularly if technologies are not well understood at the outset of a  program, requirements are not firm, and decisions are made to keep  moving a program forward without sufficient knowledge about issues,  such as design, performance, and producibility. In MDA's case, many of  its highly concurrent acquisition programs began with many critical  unknowns. While the developmental problems that have been discovered  in these acquisitions are inherent in complex and highly technical efforts,  the effects were considerably magnified due to the high levels of  concurrency, including questions about the performance of fielded assets,  significant disruptions to production, and expensive retrofits. While MDA  has embraced the value of reducing unknowns before making key  decisions in some of its newer programs, such as the SM-3 Block IIA, and  adopted good practices, such as awarding competitive contracts to  multiple contractors in the SM-3 Block IIB program, it has continued to  plan and implement highly concurrent approaches in others. In fact,  today, MDA is still operating at a fast pace, as production and fielding of  assets remains, in many cases, ahead of the ability to test and validate  them.", "As we recommended in 2009, these disruptions can only be avoided  when the development, manufacture, and fielding schedules of BMDS  assets are synchronized with the testing and validation schedules to  ensure that items are not approved to be manufactured for fielding before  their performance has been validated through testing. Moreover, as we  have concluded for several years, while concurrency was likely the only  option to meet the tight deadlines MDA has been directed to work under,  having an initial capability in place should now allow the agency to  construct acquisition approaches that are less risky from a cost, schedule  and performance perspective. Near-term steps MDA can take to reduce  cost, schedule, and performance risks include actions such as  demonstrating the second GMD interceptor can work as intended before  resuming production and verifying that the SM-3 Block IB completes  developmental flight tests before committing to additional production.  Longer-term solutions require the Office of the Secretary of Defense to  assess the level of concurrency that currently exists within MDA programs  and where that concurrency can be reduced.

Our position is not  unique in this regard. In recent testimony, the Acting Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics confirmed that  excessive concurrency can drive cost growth and result in major schedule  disruptions that produce further inefficiency.

Further, while early intercept with shoot-look- shoot capability could be part of a cost-effective defense of the U.S.  homeland if a sufficiently fast missile was available, the size of the  battlespace and not early intercept capability is the key driver of cost- effectiveness.

The program began  product development early, included high levels of concurrency in its  construction and procurement plan, and has not aligned its testing  schedule with component procurement and construction. As we have  reported previously, an acquisition strategy for accelerated fielding, such  as that of Aegis Ashore, will likely accept higher risk primarily through  concurrent development and production.problems are more likely to be discovered in production, when it is either  too late or very costly to correct them.", "Under such a strategy, major  The program began product development and established the Aegis  Ashore cost, schedule, and performance baseline in June 2010, which  was 14 months before completing its preliminary design review. This  concurrent sequencing can increase technical risks and the possibility of  cost growth by committing to product development with less technical  knowledge than needed by acquisition best practices and without  ensuring that requirements are defined, feasible, and achievable within  cost and schedule constraints. In addition, the program has a concurrent  schedule for constructing deckhouses and procuring Aegis Ashore  components. Since committing to product development and establishing  the product development baseline, the acquisition strategy for deckhouse  construction has been revised twice. The current plan, called the dual  deckhouse plan, is to construct two deckhouses\u2014first, an operational  deckhouse planned for installation in Romania and a second for  developmental testing in Hawaii. The test deckhouse will begin  construction a quarter later than the operational deckhouse and will be  installed for testing at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii. Aegis  BMD program management officials stated that a third deckhouse, for the  Aegis Ashore installation in Poland, will be constructed at a later date to  be set based on funding availability. The program also has initiated  procurement of equipment, such as the VLS and SPY-1 radar that are  needed for the Aegis Ashore installations.", "This plan means that knowledge gained from testing the Hawaiian  installation cannot be used to guide the construction of the Romanian  deckhouse or procurement of components for operational use. Any  design changes that arise from testing in Hawaii will have to occur on a  complete deckhouse and on already procured components intended for  operational use.

The Director of  MDA has stated that the sea-based system and Aegis Ashore will share  identical components. According to program documentation, the dual  deckhouse plan reduces risk and creates fabrication and construction  efficiencies. Aegis BMD program management officials noted that the  dual deckhouse plan has significant advantages over prior plans, all of  which had the operational deckhouse built before the test deckhouse. For  example, they noted that prior Aegis Ashore deckhouse construction  plans required testing a different deckhouse design in Hawaii than the  one that would be used at the operational sites. Constructing two  deckhouses concurrently provides for greater efficiency in purchasing  material and equipment and allows for one contractor to build both  deckhouses. The Director of MDA stated that the deckhouse construction  methodology is the most cost effective and efficient under the program\u2019s  time constraints. In addition, the program expects to be able to modify the  operational deckhouse prior to its installation in Romania if flight tests  reveal that a modification is needed. The program management officials  also stated that the dual deckhouse plan provides more time for testing  the equipment that goes in the deckhouse. Aegis BMD program  management officials stated that this plan allows them to test the  electrical system in the Romanian deckhouse and to complete these tests  more than 1 year earlier than previously scheduled. Finally, they noted  that constructing two deckhouses also facilitates testing, including  conducting Aegis Light Off events that consist of preflight test verification  of the integration of Aegis Ashore components.", "Aegis BMD program management officials told us that the schedule does  contain more risk before the first controlled test vehicle flight test, which is  the first time all of the Aegis Ashore components will be integrated, and  less risk between that test and the fielding in Romania.
