This report examines (1) how NRC implements its processes for overseeing the safety of commercial nuclear power reactors; (2) the extent to which NRC consistently identifies and resolves findings through these processes; and (3) NRC's methods for developing lessons learned to improve its oversight and challenges, if any, NRC faces in doing so. GAO reviewed NRC policies and guidance; visited five nuclear power plants located in multiple NRC regions; analyzed NRC data on findings, violations, licensee performance, and inspection hours; interviewed NRC officials and industry representatives; and observed demonstrations of NRC's database search tools."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) relies on its staff's professional judgment in implementing its processes for overseeing the safety of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors. In implementing this oversight, NRC allocates specific roles and responsibilities to resident inspectors assigned to each plant, regional officials at one of four regional offices responsible for most oversight activities, headquarters officials, and the nuclear power industry. NRC also builds into its processes incentives for plant managers to identify concerns about reactor safety, report those concerns to NRC, and take prompt actions to correct them. NRC's processes for identifying and assessing findings and violations are based on prescribed agency procedures and include several points where NRC staff must exercise their professional judgment, such as determining whether issues of concern identified during physical inspections constitute findings or violations and the risk significance of any findings or the severity of any violations, among other things.", "NRC is aware of differences across regional offices in identifying and resolving findings that result from physical inspections. GAO's analysis of NRC's data indicated that the number of escalated findings had fewer differences across regions than nonescalated findings, which are lower-risk findings and less severe violations. According to NRC officials, several factors, such as the hours spent on inspections, may explain the differences in nonescalated findings. However, GAO found that the regional office with the fewest reactors and the fewest inspection hours had the most nonescalated findings. NRC officials and industry representatives have raised concerns that the differences may also be due to differences in how NRC staff identify and resolve findings. NRC has taken some steps to examine the consistency of its oversight. For example, in 2009, the four regional offices implemented an initiative to explore how the regional offices identify and assess inspection findings. However, NRC has not conducted a comprehensive analysis of the causes of the differences in the number of nonescalated findings across regions. Under federal standards for internal control, managers are to compare actual performance with planned or expected results throughout the organization and analyze significant differences. Without such an analysis, NRC does not know whether its regional offices are applying regulations and guidance consistently.", "NRC has both formal and informal methods for developing lessons learned to improve its oversight. Formal methods include agencywide programs, annual and biennial assessments, and special initiatives. Informal methods include reaching out to peers and technical experts across the agency and accessing various agency databases. Although NRC guidance directs inspectors to use information in agency databases on past experiences to plan and conduct inspection activities, inspectors face challenges accessing this information, which may limit their ability to use it. For example, several NRC inspectors reported contacting other inspectors informally because NRC's database search tools contain limited instructions and do not ensure thorough results. Without better search tools, inspectors may overly rely on information available through informal channels."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that NRC analyze the causes of differences in identifying and resolving findings across regional offices and address these differences, and that it improve its database search tools.

According to the Japanese parliament\u2019s formal investigation, the damage  to the Fukushima reactors could have been avoided and resulted, in part,  from a failure of regulatory oversight in Japan. This event heightened  concerns about the safety of commercial nuclear power plants worldwide  and the ability of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)\u2014the  independent federal agency responsible for licensing and regulating U.S.  civilian nuclear activities\u2014to oversee the safe operation of commercial  nuclear power reactors in the United States. In response to these  concerns, NRC convened a Fukushima Near-Term Task Force, which in  a July 2011 report concluded that a similar accident is unlikely to occur in  the United States and identified many opportunities for improving NRC\u2019s  oversight.", "NRC\u2019s mission is, in part, to ensure adequate protection of public health  and safety from accidents involving commercial nuclear power reactors.  In fiscal year 2012, the licensing and regulating of commercial reactors  comprised over 75 percent\u2014or approximately $800 million\u2014of NRC\u2019s  budget, of which the vast majority (87 percent) is collected in the form of  fees from industry. One of NRC\u2019s stated goals is to ensure that its  oversight of reactor safety is objective, predictable, and understandable,  and according to NRC\u2019s strategic plan, a key strategy in achieving its  mission is to conduct this oversight openly to inform the public and  maintain confidence in reactor safety. However, NRC\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General (IG) reported in 2010, 2011, and 2012, that one of the  most serious management and performance challenges facing NRC is  the ability to effectively carry out its oversight responsibilities while  responding to emerging demands associated with licensing and  regulating new reactors.", "NRC\u2019s oversight will soon likely take on even greater importance as many  commercial reactors in the United States are reaching or have reached  the end of their initial 40-year operating period. Nuclear power\u2019s  contribution to the nation\u2019s supply of electricity\u2014about 20 percent in  2012\u2014will depend, in large part, on the continued operation of the  nation\u2019s 100 operating commercial reactors. Most of these reactors have  had their licenses renewed to operate for another 20 years. However, as  we recently reported, NRC\u2019s license renewal process primarily considers  issues related to the negative effects of aging on reactors and their  components. Other ongoing safety matters are not explicitly covered in  the license renewal process because NRC considers its ongoing  oversight processes as adequate to ensure that reactors are operated  safely and will continue to be in the future.", "We and others have reported on NRC\u2019s oversight of reactor safety. In  September 2006, we reported that NRC had taken several steps to  improve its oversight of nuclear reactors but had been slow to act on  needed improvements, in particular, in improving the agency\u2019s ability to  identify and address early indications of declining safety performance. In  2008, NRC\u2019s IG found that NRC\u2019s regional offices were not consistently  implementing the agency\u2019s enforcement program. Additionally, the  National Academy of Sciences is conducting a study and preparing a  report to NRC and Congress on lessons learned from the Fukushima  nuclear accident for improving the safety and security of U.S. nuclear  power plants. According to the National Academy of Sciences, this report  is expected to be issued publicly by the summer of 2014.", "In this context, you asked us to review NRC\u2019s oversight of the U.S.  commercial nuclear power industry.

In addition, we reviewed previous GAO and  NRC IG reports that identified safety-related challenges or made  recommendations to improve NRC oversight. We also reviewed NRC\u2019s  efforts to update its oversight processes. We interviewed NRC  headquarters officials, regional officials, and inspectors. We also visited a  nonprobability sample of five selected nuclear power plants and  conducted interviews with the NRC inspectors and plant managers and  operators at the plants. To select the five plants we visited\u2014Calvert  Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Maryland, Byron Station in Illinois, Palisades  Nuclear Plant in Michigan, Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska, and Wolf  Creek Generating Station in Kansas\u2014we used multiple criteria, including  whether a plant\u2019s performance (as determined by NRC) has changed  (i.e., by improving or declining) in the past 2 years, and whether,  collectively, plants were located in multiple NRC regions, operated by  different companies that hold licenses to operate reactors (i.e., licensees),  and included different reactor types. We also analyzed NRC performance  data for all 65 plant sites from 2000 through 2012. To assess the  reliability of NRC\u2019s data, we reviewed existing information about the data  and the system that produced them and interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data.

NRC is headed by a five-member Commission. The  President appoints these Commission members, who are confirmed by  the Senate, and designates one of them to serve as the Chair and official  spokesperson.

NRC is authorized to conduct inspections and  investigations, to enforce its requirements, such as by issuing orders and  imposing civil (monetary) penalties, and to revoke licenses. To oversee  the activities of licensed commercial reactors, NRC has established  regulations, as well as guidance, including regulatory guides, standard  review plans, and NRC\u2019s Inspection Manual. These regulations and  guidance, along with plant-specific licenses and technical specifications,  form the basis by which NRC provides continuous oversight of reactor  operations.", "NRC\u2019s oversight of commercial nuclear reactors includes monitoring their  performance in three strategic areas: (1) reactor safety, that is, avoiding  accidents and reducing the consequences of accidents if they occur; (2)  radiation safety, that is, ensuring safety from radiation for both plant  workers and the public during routine operations; and (3) safeguards, that  is, protecting of the plant against sabotage or other security threats.  These areas comprise seven cornerstones of NRC\u2019s oversight (see table  1). According to NRC, reactors\u2019 satisfactory performance in these  cornerstones provides reasonable assurance of safe operation.

According to NRC documents, performance indicators are  designed to illustrate a long-term view of a licensee\u2019s performance\u2014over  multiple quarters. Currently, NRC uses 17 performance indicators it  developed collaboratively with the industry to measure licensee  performance. Each performance indicator is designed to help gauge a  licensee\u2019s performance within the different cornerstones outlined above.  For example, a performance indicator under the \u201cInitiating Events\u201d  cornerstone measures the number of unplanned reactor shutdowns  during the previous four quarters. Appendix III provides a list of the  safety-related (nonsecurity) performance indicators and related  cornerstones.", "Each licensee voluntarily submits data quarterly for each performance  indicator, and NRC measures licensee performance from these data  against established numerical thresholds; assigning a color\u2014green,  white, yellow, or red\u2014to reflect increasing risk to reactor safety based on  these performance data. Specifically, a green indicator reflects  performance within an expected range, but white, yellow, and red  represent decreasing levels of a licensee\u2019s performance (see table 2).", "Physical inspections are one of the main tools NRC uses to oversee  licensee performance. During these inspections, NRC inspectors are to  verify the accuracy of the quarterly data for each performance indicator  supplied by the licensee and to assess aspects of licensee performance  that are not directly measured by the performance indicator data\u2014for  example, confirming that fire protection equipment is in place and that  certain maintenance operations have occurred. These inspections cover  a wide variety of major systems and technical areas of nuclear power  reactors that NRC considers most critical to meeting the overall agency  mission of ensuring nuclear power plant safety. NRC currently has 52  different inspection procedures, and they are divided into three broad  types of inspections\u2014baseline (46), supplemental (3), and reactive (3)\u2014 that vary by depth and objective. Appendix IV provides a list of inspection  procedures.", "Baseline inspections. Baseline inspections are the minimum level of  inspections performed at all nuclear power reactors, regardless of  performance, and are designed to detect declining safety performance in  each of the cornerstones and to review licensee effectiveness at  identifying and resolving safety problems. NRC resident inspectors, who  are located at each plant, and regional technical specialists, who travel to  each plant from NRC regional offices, conduct 46 baseline inspection  procedures both as needed and at intervals ranging from quarterly to  triennially, involving physical observations of licensee activities and plant  performance, reviewing and verifying licensee reports, and interviewing  licensee personnel. Each of the baseline procedures specifies a range of  sample activities to inspect. Within the scope and requirements of each  procedure, inspectors select the type and number of activities to review  on the basis of factors, such as the sample activities available; their risk  significance; and the amount of time since a particular system or  component was last inspected. NRC assesses any issues of concern  and determines whether to elevate them to a finding based on certain  criteria. To determine whether an issue of concern constitutes a finding,  inspectors must first decide whether it is associated with a performance  deficiency, which NRC guidance defines as \u201can issue that is the result of  a licensee not meeting a requirement or standard where the cause was  reasonably within the licensee\u2019s ability to foresee and correct, and  therefore should have been prevented.\u201d NRC guidance defines a finding  as an issue of concern associated with a performance deficiency that  inspectors or regional officials then determine to be more than minor.  NRC then assesses\u2014through its ROP Significance Determination  Process\u2014the finding\u2019s risk significance. Similar to performance  indicators, NRC assigns the finding one of four colors to reflect increasing  risk to reactor safety. Green findings\u2014also called nonescalated  findings\u2014equate to very low risk significance, while white, yellow, and red  findings\u2014considered to be escalated findings\u2014represent increasing  levels of risk (see table 3). Appendix V provides select examples of NRC  findings and related information that illustrate the varying levels of risk  significance.", "Supplemental inspections. When NRC identifies one or more escalated  findings or a performance indicator exceeding the green threshold at a  reactor, regional officials conduct supplemental inspections, which  expand the scope beyond baseline inspection procedures and focus on  diagnosing the cause of the finding. There are three levels of  supplemental inspections that increase in breadth and depth of analysis,  depending on the number and type of performance problems identified.  The first and lowest level of supplemental inspection assesses the  licensee\u2019s corrective actions to ensure they were sufficient in both  correcting the problem and addressing the root and contributing causes to  prevent recurrence. The second level of supplemental inspection has an  increased scope that includes independently assessing the extent of the  condition for both the specific and any broader performance problems.  The third and highest level of supplemental inspection is more  comprehensive and includes determining whether the reactor can  continue to operate and whether additional regulatory actions are  necessary. The highest level of supplemental inspection is usually  conducted by a multidisciplinary team of NRC inspectors and may take  place over several months. Also, as a part of this inspection, NRC  inspectors assess the adequacy of the licensee\u2019s overall programs for  identifying, evaluating, and correcting performance issues.", "Reactive inspections. NRC conducts reactive inspections of licensee  performance when specific events occur that are of particular interest to  NRC because of their potential safety significance or because of potential  generic safety concerns important to multiple licensees. Reactive  inspections determine the cause of the event and assess the licensee\u2019s  response to the event. Reactive inspections have three levels that are  normally determined by an event\u2019s safety, or risk significance. According  to NRC officials, recent reactive inspections have focused on issues such  as an automatic reactor shutdown following a loss of offsite power, and a  flaw discovered in a weld on a reactor component. To conduct reactive  inspections, a team of experts is formed and an inspection charter issued  that describes the scope of the inspection efforts.", "NRC inspectors assess all of the findings that result from physical  inspections to determine if any of the three cross-cutting areas  contributed to a performance problem. If regional officials determine that  one of the cross-cutting areas contributed to a finding, NRC assigns what  it calls a cross-cutting aspect within that area to the finding. More than  one cross-cutting aspect may be assigned to a finding, but this does not  occur often, according to NRC officials. Every 6 months, NRC regional  officials analyze all findings issued at each plant during the prior 12- month assessment period. In general, if a nuclear plant has four findings  with the same cross-cutting aspect assigned during the previous year,  and NRC is concerned about the licensee\u2019s progress in addressing them,  NRC determines that the nuclear plant has what NRC calls a substantive  cross-cutting issue. According to NRC documents, the agency identifies  substantive cross-cutting issues to inform the licensee that it has a  concern with its performance and to further encourage it to take  appropriate actions before more significant performance issues emerge.", "NRC assesses its reviews of performance indicators and all findings that  result from its physical inspections to determine what actions, if any, to  take in response to signs of declining performance, including violations of  NRC requirements. The significance of any violations associated with a  finding is incorporated into the color coded risk assessment made during  the Significance Determination Process. For enforcement of violations  associated with nonescalated findings, NRC establishes a public record  of the violations and requires the licensee to take steps to correct the  violations, but it does not usually require the licensee to document its  responses. For enforcement of violations associated with escalated  findings, NRC issues written notices of violation (to which licensees are  typically required to respond), civil penalties, or orders.", "Based on NRC\u2019s assessment of licensee performance under the ROP,  NRC places each of the licensee\u2019s reactors into one of five performance  categories on its action matrix, which corresponds to graded, or  increasing, levels of oversight. The action matrix is NRC\u2019s formal method  of determining how much additional oversight\u2014mostly in the form of  supplemental inspections\u2014is required on the basis of the number and  risk significance of performance indicators and inspection findings. NRC  considers licensee performance to be acceptable until it reaches column  5 (see table 4).", "On the basis of the results of the ROP, NRC provides licensees and the  public with an overall assessment of each reactor\u2019s performance. At the  end of each 6-month period, NRC issues an assessment letter to each  plant to describe what level of oversight the plant\u2019s reactors will receive  according to their placement on the action matrix, what actions NRC is  expecting the licensee to take as a result of the performance issues  identified, any specific enforcement actions NRC has taken, and any  documented substantive cross-cutting issues. If a substantive cross- cutting issue is identified, the letter will describe what actions NRC  intends to take to monitor the issue. If the issue persists, NRC can  request a number of actions from the licensee, including a written  response describing the corrective actions the licensee intends to take.  NRC also holds an annual public meeting at or near each plant to review  its performance and address questions from members of the public and  other interested stakeholders. Additionally, NRC has other mechanisms  to make available its oversight results, such as a website that provides  summaries of each reactor\u2019s current overall performance.

If NRC\u2019s preliminary assessment of a  licensee-identified finding indicates that the finding is green, NRC does  not consider it when assessing licensee performance, does not consider it  to count toward substantive cross-cutting issues, and does not apply  additional oversight or require additional response from the licensee.  According to NRC officials, licensee-identified findings demonstrate that  the licensee is taking a proactive approach and can identify and correct  problems before NRC identifies them; therefore NRC gives licensees  credit for identifying potential problems during their own inspection  processes. Regarding licensee-identified violations, according to NRC\u2019s  enforcement policy, NRC should normally give the licensee \u201ccredit\u201d when  assessing for civil penalties\u2014that is, the violation should be issued with  no civil penalty\u2014for identifying the violation and taking prompt and  comprehensive corrective actions. On the other hand, the policy states  that NRC should issue a civil penalty, regardless of whether the violation  is licensee-identified, if NRC officials determine that the corrective actions  have not been prompt and comprehensive.", "Conversely, according to its enforcement policy, NRC considers some  findings and violations\u2014whether identified by a licensee or an inspector\u2014 to be \u201cself-revealing.\u201d For example, according to an agency official, a  licensee may discover a pool of oil on the floor next to a diesel generator,  indicating that something is wrong with the equipment. NRC may consider  such a finding to be self-revealing, even if the licensee identified it.

NRC officials told us that performance deficiency was defined broadly to  allow officials to use their professional judgment when assessing issues  of concern. If NRC inspectors determine that there is a performance  deficiency, they and regional staff then determine whether the  performance deficiency is more than minor. In doing so, these officials  have NRC-established questions and guidance and use their professional  judgment in applying them. If inspectors and regional staff determine that  a performance deficiency is not more than minor, then it is not considered  a finding and the matter is not pursued any further under the ROP. To  help in making these determinations, inspectors can request additional  information from licensees and consult NRC inspectors assigned to other  nuclear plants, according to NRC officials. If resident inspectors conclude  they cannot adequately assess an issue of concern, they can seek  assistance from their regional office or NRC headquarters\u2014typically from  technical specialists or branch chiefs who supervise resident inspectors at  two to three plants\u2014to help make a determination. As we previously  reported, inspectors also select the type and number of activities to  review during inspections, in part, on the basis of an inspector\u2019s  professional judgment, which is based on information such as reviews of  the licensee\u2019s corrective action program, allegations, or interviews with  plant employees.", "Professional judgment also plays a key role in regional officials\u2019  determining the risk significance of a finding and the severity of a  violation. If NRC determines that a performance deficiency is more than  minor, it is considered a finding, and NRC regional officials assess its  significance using the Significance Determination Process, which also  requires the staff to exercise their professional judgment, according to  NRC officials. This process provides an initial screening to identify those  nonescalated findings\u2014that is, those findings that do not result in a  significant increase in plant risk and thus need not be analyzed further.  Remaining findings are subjected to additional reviews to determine their  risk significance, using the next phase of the Significance Determination  Process\u2014the Significance and Enforcement Review Panel (SERP).  According to NRC guidance, this more detailed assessment may involve  NRC risk experts from the appropriate regional office or NRC  headquarters and further review by the licensee\u2019s plant staff. The final  outcome of the ROP review\u2014evaluating whether the finding is green,  white, yellow, or red\u2014is used to determine NRC actions that may be  needed. For any escalated violations identified during the ROP that are to  go through the Traditional Enforcement Process, the severity level of  violations is determined using a combination of NRC\u2019s enforcement  policy, professional judgment, and information obtained from the licensee  during a conference with them, if necessary. NRC officials initially  determine enforcement actions during an enforcement panel, and then  make a final determination during a meeting, or caucus, both of which  loosely correspond to the SERP.", "Regarding violations, NRC\u2019s enforcement policy states that, because the  regulation of nuclear activities does not lend itself to a mechanistic  treatment in many cases, judgment and discretion must be exercised in  determining the severity levels of violations and the appropriate  enforcement sanctions. According to this policy, the use of judgment and  discretion includes the decision to issue a notice of violation or to propose  or impose a civil penalty and the amount of the penalty, after considering  the general principles of NRC\u2019s enforcement policy and the significance of  the violation, as well as the surrounding circumstances. According to its  enforcement policy, NRC may choose to exercise discretion and either  escalate or mitigate enforcement sanctions or otherwise refrain from  taking enforcement action within the Commission\u2019s statutory authority.  According to this policy, NRC may exercise judgment and discretion to  determine the severity levels of violations and the appropriate  enforcement sanctions to be taken. For example, NRC may refrain from  issuing a notice of violation or a proposed civil penalty for a Severity Level  II, III, or IV violation that is identified after NRC has taken enforcement  action, if the violation is identified by the licensee as part of the corrective  action for the previous enforcement action and the violation has the same  or similar root cause as the violation for which enforcement action was  previously taken, among other things.", "In addition, according to NRC guidance, inspectors should also use their  professional judgment when assessing whether a finding is associated  with any cross-cutting aspects. For example, as we reported, in  analyzing the failure of a valve to operate properly at one plant, NRC  inspectors determined that plant employees had not followed the correct  maintenance procedures; thus, the finding was associated with the  human performance cross-cutting area.", "Both opening and closing a substantive cross-cutting issue requires the  use of professional judgment. According to NRC guidance, before  opening a substantive cross-cutting issue, regional officials must  determine, among other things, whether the licensee is already taking  actions to address the issue and, if so, whether these actions are timely,  are commensurate with its significance, and will be effective in  substantially mitigating it. Once a substantive cross-cutting issue has  been opened, the regional office that opened it is responsible for  establishing the criteria for closing it. These criteria may include having  fewer findings with the same cross-cutting area in a subsequent  assessment period or the regional staff\u2019s increased confidence in the  licensee\u2019s ability to address the substantive cross-cutting issue. The  decision to close a substantive cross-cutting issue is made by regional  staff, including the senior resident inspector, branch chief, and other  regional management, but NRC headquarters officials told us they also  participate.", "NRC can require licensees to take several actions to close substantive  cross-cutting issues. According to NRC guidance, after first issuing a  letter identifying a substantive cross-cutting issue to a licensee, NRC staff  may follow up on these issues in multiple ways, including semiannual  evaluations or additional inspections. In the second consecutive  assessment letter identifying the same substantive cross-cutting issue,  the regional office may consider requesting the licensee provide a  response at a public meeting or provide a written response or hold a  separate meeting. In the third consecutive letter, according to NRC  guidance, the regional office would typically request that the licensee  perform an independent assessment of safety culture, although the  regional office could decide that a safety culture assessment is not  necessary if the licensee has made reasonable progress addressing the  issue. If the substantive cross-cutting issue continues beyond the third  letter, the regional office may consider additional actions not prescribed  by the action matrix developed in consultation with the Director of NRC\u2019s  Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and its Executive Director of  Operations.", "Figure 2 outlines NRC\u2019s processes for identifying and assessing findings  and violations and key points where professional judgment plays a role."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Differences Exist across NRC Regions in Identifying and Resolving Findings, and NRC Has Taken Some Steps to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["NRC is aware of differences across regions in identifying and resolving  the findings that result from its oversight processes and has taken some  steps to address them.

NRC officials stated that differences in  the number of hours regions spent inspecting reactors may have  contributed to the differences in the number of nonescalated findings  across regions, because more inspection hours would lead to more  findings. However, according to 2000 through 2012 NRC data, while the  total number of inspection hours has varied across the regions, the  number of inspection hours has been fairly consistent across regions  when accounting for the number of reactors in each region. When  comparing the number of nonescalated findings in each region to the  number of inspection hours and accounting for the regional differences in  the number of reactors, we found that the number of nonescalated  findings per inspection hour varies widely. Specifically, Region II identified  the least number of nonescalated findings per inspection hour per reactor,  and Region IV identified the most, with more than 3.5 times as many  nonescalated findings per 1,000 inspection hours per reactor as Region II  (see table 6).", "Differences in the amount of time reactors are under increased oversight.  NRC officials stated that differences in the amount of time reactors are  under increased oversight as a result of performance deficiencies\u2014 defined as being in column 2 or higher on NRC\u2019s action matrix\u2014may  contribute to differences in the number of nonescalated findings across  regions, because increased oversight results in more scrutiny and more  findings. However, according to 2001 through 2012 NRC data, the  number of quarters that reactors in each region were under increased  oversight were fairly consistent across regions when accounting for the  number of reactors in each region. When comparing the number of  nonescalated findings in each region to the number of quarters that  reactors in each region were under increased oversight, and accounting  for the regional differences in the number of reactors, we found that the  results varied widely.

NRC officials stated that differences in  the age of reactors may contribute to the differences in the number of  nonescalated findings across regions because nonescalated findings  become more prevalent as reactors age. We analyzed the age of reactors  across the regions and identified regional differences in their age.  However, we found that reactors in Region II, which had the fewest  nonescalated findings from 2000 through 2012, have been in commercial  operation, on average, more years than, and have collectively been in  commercial operation for almost twice as long as, reactors in Region IV,  which had the most nonescalated findings over that period (see table 8).", "Differences in resources available to plants. NRC officials stated that,  when one licensee owns or manages multiple plants (collectively referred  to as a licensee\u2019s \u201cfleet\u201d), benefits derived from plants\u2019 combined  resources may contribute to the differences in the number of  nonescalated findings across regions, because some regions have more  plants in fleets than others. For example, according to NRC officials,  licensees often require all plants that they manage or own to make  improvements in response to findings made at only one of their plants,  which could lead all the plants in this fleet to experience fewer findings  over time. NRC officials told us that plants associated with fleets typically  perform better because the licensee holds all plants to the same  performance levels and provides resources and shares what would  otherwise be proprietary information to make that happen. Some  independent plants\u2014those not part of a fleet\u2014share resources by  forming alliances with other plants, entering into management contracts  with larger companies, or both. However, NRC officials stated that  independent plants are limited in how much information they can share  because some information is considered to be proprietary. We analyzed  whether individual plants were associated with licensee fleets and found  that being associated with a fleet may be a factor in the number of  nonescalated findings a region identifies. For example, Region II, which  had the fewest nonescalated findings from 2000 through 2012, had the  highest percentage of its reactors located at plants associated with fleets.  Conversely, Region IV, which had the most nonescalated findings during  the same period, had the lowest percentage of its reactors located at  plants associated with fleets (see table 9). However, because NRC has  not conducted a comprehensive analysis of several potential factors, it is  not clear to the extent this factor influences the differences in the number  of findings across regions.", "In addition, NRC officials stated that the quality of reactor maintenance  may contribute to the regional differences in the number of nonescalated  findings.

These officials told  us that, in their view, this autonomy and discretion is a good and  desirable part of the ROP. Nonetheless, in 2008, NRC\u2019s IG reported that  NRC was inconsistently resolving findings across its regional offices due,  in part, to not having clear and comprehensive guidance needed to  facilitate consistency.", "NRC officials told us they survey industry annually as part of a ROP self- assessment process and have received feedback since the  implementation of the ROP in 2000 about concerns from the appearance  of differences in identifying and resolving findings across regions.

NRC officials  provided the example of two findings at two different plants that appeared  similar but that led to different assessments. Specifically, both findings  dealt with problems with certain components of auxiliary feedwater pumps  that rendered the pumps inoperable. Even though these findings  appeared similar, they resulted in different risk significance levels\u2014one  green and one white\u2014because they affected the safety of the two plants  differently. NRC officials told us the process of assessing the risk  significance of a finding is inherently complex and includes several  factors, such as design of the plant, including availability of backup equipment and  whether the site uses cooling towers or lakes or rivers for its ultimate  source of cooling water;  the effect that the finding had on the performance and availability of  safety equipment;  the amount of time the equipment was inoperable;  criticality of the safety equipment associated with the finding; and historical reliability of the equipment in question for that plant design,  among others.", "Once NRC accounts for these factors, similar findings may result in  different assessments because the risk that a finding poses is plant- specific, according to NRC officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Regions Also Differed in the Cross-cutting Aspects They Assigned to Findings", "paragraphs": ["The four NRC regions also differed in the number of cross-cutting aspects  they assigned to findings and the percentage of findings assigned cross- cutting aspects.

Therefore, according to NRC  officials, the greater the number of findings with cross-cutting aspects, the  greater the chance that NRC could assign a substantive cross-cutting  issue to the plant. Once NRC assigns a substantive cross-cutting issue to  a plant, closing the issue requires additional efforts by the licensee and  additional oversight from NRC. The number of plants assigned  substantive cross-cutting issues at some time during calendar years 2001  through 2012 varied across the regions (see table 12). In Region II, less  than half the plants were assigned a substantive cross-cutting issue,  whereas a substantial majority of plants in other regions were assigned  substantive cross-cutting issues.

However, to  review this information, users must search a link for each plant on a  quarterly basis. Since the ROP has been in place for more than 12 years,  users may have to search dozens of links per plant and read many  different documents to get complete information on individual findings. In  addition, while descriptions in each document contain information about  whether a finding was associated with a cross-cutting issue, the website  itself does not provide information on those plants that had open  substantive cross-cutting issues prior to the most recent assessment  period. This information can be found on the website by linking to each  plant\u2019s individual assessment letters. NRC program officials  acknowledged that it is difficult for users of the website to determine  which plants had substantive cross-cutting issues open in the past.  Therefore, it is difficult to identify, over time, those that NRC views as  having potentially more significant problems.", "NRC also makes publicly available its official recordkeeping system, the  Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS).  ADAMS contains more than 730,000 documents dating back to  November 1999, and several hundred new documents on NRC\u2019s reactor  oversight processes\u2014as well as other NRC activities\u2014are added each  day. However, we found ADAMS difficult to navigate. For example, using  an inspection report as our starting point, we tried to retrace the steps in  NRC\u2019s response to the findings in the report using ADAMS; however, our  searches resulted in numerous unrelated documents as well as  documents with ambiguous names that had to be opened to determine  whether they were related to the findings. Further, we had no way of  determining whether our searches returned a complete set of results and  had identified all the documents related to the findings. NRC officials  acknowledged that, while ADAMS can be used to conduct searches on  specific words or other criteria, such searches may produce a large  number of unrelated documents, in addition to relevant documents.", "We asked NRC officials how we could track a finding through its  resolution, and they told us that doing so is difficult because findings and  enforcement actions are recorded in separate databases and that these  databases are not linked. The officials told us that users with expertise in  both databases\u2019 search capabilities could craft a data search that linked  inspection and enforcement records. However, because external users  cannot craft such a search, they cannot independently track NRC\u2019s  identification and resolution of findings. NRC\u2019s Chairman reiterated the  agency\u2019s support for transparency in prepared remarks before the annual  NRC Regulatory Information Conference in March 2013, stating that the  agency must have a continued commitment to openness and  transparency and communicate with interested parties in ways they  understand, and that clear, consistent communication is a principle of  good regulation. However, because external users cannot independently  track findings and their resolution, NRC cannot ensure that the public,  Congress, and others are kept informed of licensee performance, as  specified in guidance, to enhance confidence that NRC is accomplishing  its mission and following its oversight processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NRC Uses Numerous Methods to Develop Lessons Learned for Improving Oversight, but Challenges Remain in Accessing This Information", "paragraphs": ["NRC has both formal and informal methods for developing lessons  learned to improve its oversight.

NRC evaluates any adverse trends to  determine whether regulatory action is appropriate, and reports  statistically significant trends to Congress.", "Monthly ROP working group meetings, which, according to NRC  officials, NRC hosts and include the Nuclear Energy Institute, other  industry representatives, and members of the public to discuss  operating experience, inspection and performance assessment topics,  potential changes and questions regarding performance indicator  guidance, and other topics.", "Additionally, according to NRC documents, NRC identifies lessons  learned during its annual self-assessments to determine whether the  ROP met goals and during its biennial ROP realignment process. For  example, the ROP realignment process assesses feedback from  inspectors and other NRC officials submitted through the ROP Feedback  Program.", "NRC has also undertaken special initiatives, such as the Fukushima  Near-Term Task Force, to develop lessons learned from the accident at  the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan that it could apply in  its oversight of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors. NRC convened  the task force in 2011 to review its processes and regulations and  determine whether lessons learned from the accident could inform its  oversight processes. The task force concluded that a sequence of events  like the Fukushima accident is unlikely to occur in the United States and  that the continued operation of the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear reactors  does not pose an imminent risk to public health and safety. In addition, in  2011 the task force made 12 recommendations, such as for NRC to  clarify its regulatory framework and to require licensees to reevaluate and  upgrade seismic and flooding protection of reactors and related  equipment, strengthen capabilities at all reactors to withstand loss of  electrical power, and take other actions to better protect their plants for a  low-probability high-impact event. NRC accepted these recommendations  and is in the process of implementing them (see app. X).", "To follow up on the task force\u2019s recommendations, in 2011, NRC  established the Japan Lessons Learned Project Directorate\u2014a group of  over 20 NRC staff focused on implementing the lessons the task force  identified. As part of this effort, NRC issued the following three orders to  licensees in March 2012:  improve capability to reliably and remotely monitor a wider range of  conditions in the pools that contain spent fuel;  install vent systems for certain types of reactors to help prevent an  excess buildup of hydrogen gas in the reactor buildings; enhance plants\u2019 capabilities to maintain or restore core cooling,  containment, and spent fuel pool cooling in the case of external  events, such as an earthquake, that exceeds plants\u2019 design  capabilities.", "NRC has also undertaken special initiatives in response to other unique  events. For example, following the terrorist attacks on September 11,  2001, NRC issued orders to licensees to enhance security measures to  protect their reactors against an increased terrorism threat. In addition, in  2002, after extensive degradation was discovered in the reactor vessel  head at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in Ohio, NRC  established a lessons learned task force and implemented many of its  recommendations, including inspection procedure changes, enhancing its  training program, and enhancing aspects of program management of the  ROP. In May 2004, we made several recommendations to ensure that  NRC addresses weaknesses that contributed to the Davis-Besse incident,  which NRC has since implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC Also Has Informal Methods for Collecting and Analyzing Information to Develop Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["NRC officials told us they also have more informal methods of collecting  and analyzing information to develop lessons learned for improving  reactor oversight. These informal means include reaching out to peers by  telephone or e-mail, reaching out to regional or headquarters technical  experts by telephone or e-mail, and informal gatherings during peer group  meetings. For example, several resident inspectors told us they typically  rely on a small group of fellow resident inspectors\u2014often within the same  branch overseeing a small number of plants\u2014that they call periodically  for updates on issues about which they are known to have prior  experience.", "Inspectors told us that this type of outreach is especially important  because it allows them to tap into other inspectors\u2019 different experiences  performing inspections and unique engineering expertise, given that  resident inspectors come from a variety of engineering backgrounds.  They also told us that this form of outreach can have a large influence on  an inspector\u2019s perspective about potential findings. Resident inspectors  stated that they hold many informal discussions about lessons learned\u2014 including sharing findings and reviewing changes to guidance\u2014during  their semiannual conferences with peers from across their region and  during periodic visits to plants in other regions. NRC uses e-mail to  distribute updates agencywide to its guidance and other policy statements  on how to respond to lessons learned from different plants; however,  according to inspectors, individual inspectors are responsible for  incorporating these lessons learned into their oversight activities. In  addition, according to NRC officials, each region determines its policy for  e-mailing lessons learned from across the region or lessons learned with  generic safety implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Accessing Information on Past Experiences May Limit Inspectors\u2019 Ability to Benefit from It", "paragraphs": ["Although NRC guidance directs inspectors to use information on past  experiences to plan and conduct future inspection activities, inspectors  reported facing challenges in accessing information on past experiences,  which may limit their ability to benefit from it. Under NRC guidance,  inspectors are to use information on past plant experiences to prepare  for, conduct, and document inspection activities. According to several  inspectors, this information can be important for helping them choose  inspection samples. Some inspectors we interviewed also stated that  complete access to lessons learned from past plant experience is  important to help them understand how NRC identified and resolved  similar findings at other plants. In addition, industry representatives have  stated that information on past experiences is beneficial because the  industry is mature and there is a robust body of information on past  experiences to learn from.", "However, several NRC officials told us that the Reactor Operating  Experience (ROE) Gateway\u2014the agency\u2019s internal website for the  Operating Experience Program\u2014and its search tools are not user- friendly. For example, they noted that the website provides links to more  than a dozen search tools that all contain different information but does  not explain how to use them. The officials said that providing instructions  on how to use these tools would be helpful. Moreover, they told us that  conducting a thorough search on a specific topic may require multiple  keyword searches because different reactor equipment manufacturers  use different terms to describe the same type of equipment. For example,  one manufacturer of commercial nuclear reactors calls certain pumps  Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps, while another manufacturer calls them  Emergency Feedwater Pumps, although both serve the same function\u2014 removing heat from the reactor core when the plant experiences a  complete loss of electrical power. As a result, inspectors and other  agency users\u2014including officials in the Operating Experience Program  and technical specialists in the regional offices\u2014have to conduct  searches on several possible keywords in each of the various search  tools. NRC officials told us the various terms used to describe the same  equipment are not officially documented so staff must learn about them  through their own experiences. For example, if an NRC official  encountered a problem at a plant with a particular type of pump, using  ROE Gateway to search for past experiences with this pump would  require the official to know that this piece of equipment had more than  one name and to search on both names in each of the search tools. At  least one of the search tools on ROE Gateway now uses drop-down lists  to eliminate the need to conduct multiple keyword searches, but the  remaining search tools do not have this capability.", "Given the challenges in navigating ROE Gateway, several resident  inspectors told us they prefer contacting other inspectors informally or  requesting assistance from NRC headquarters staff when trying to obtain  information on past experience. They also told us they have developed  informal \u201cworkarounds\u201d to facilitate searches, such as creating and  sharing slide presentations with one another on keyword searches for  various common inquiries. We have previously reported that informal  relationships could end once personnel move to their next assignments.  Thus an informal workaround cannot substitute for a user-friendly,  searchable system. Without better search tools, inspectors could overly  rely on information available through informal channels rather than the  more comprehensive information located in agency databases. NRC  guidance states that the efficient retrieval of information on past  experiences is a basic requirement for meeting agencywide objectives  and that such information is necessary to improve safety assessments  and NRC decisions. Further, NRC officials noted that inspectors have  varied backgrounds\u2014that is, some may have expertise in mechanical  engineering, while others have expertise in electrical engineering\u2014 therefore they depend on NRC\u2019s network of information to assess most  issues and determine their importance. Past inspection results and  related information are crucial parts of that network. NRC officials have  acknowledged the difficulty of using ROE Gateway and noted at their  most recent annual meeting in March 2013 that NRC has struggled to  make information about past experiences accessible and distribute this  information efficiently.", "Several resident inspectors also told us that e-mail updates on past  experiences could be managed more effectively. For example, once  resident inspectors receive an e-mail, it is their responsibility to  incorporate the information on past experiences at their plant. However,  these resident inspectors noted that not all e-mail updates apply to all  plants; for example, an update may apply to a certain type of reactor that  is not in use at all plants. Some resident inspectors stated that one way to  improve this system would be to prioritize the e-mail notices and indicate  the extent to which they are relevant to the inspectors. In addition, some  resident inspectors noted that nonurgent e-mail updates should be  compiled, whereas now they are included alongside all e-mail updates.", "Resident inspectors play an essential role in ensuring that reactors are  operating safely because they have the opportunity and authority to, at  any time, physically inspect plant equipment and operations, review plant  records, and verify the accuracy of licensee-reported quantitative  measures or indicators of plant performance. NRC officials told us that,  because of their essential role in NRC\u2019s oversight, inspectors need  complete and efficient access to all the information necessary to do their  jobs effectively. In addition, information on past plant performance and  oversight actions helps inspectors know where to begin looking for  potential issues of concern, and NRC guidance states that inspectors  should consider this information in preparing for, conducting, and  documenting inspection activities. For example, prior to the reactor  damage found at the Davis-Besse plant in 2002, inspectors did not  regularly focus on identifying reactor vessel head corrosion; however, as  a result of this incident, NRC inspectors now focus on this issue regularly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NRC oversees the safety of commercial nuclear power reactors using  established, ongoing processes.

NRC is aware of differences across  its regions in the identification and resolution of findings that result from  its oversight processes and has taken some steps to address them,  particularly in the differences of nonescalated findings. However, while  NRC has undertaken these steps, NRC has not conducted a  comprehensive analysis of these differences consistent with federal  standards of internal control. Without a comprehensive analysis of the  differences in the number of nonescalated findings across regions and  their causes, NRC cannot ensure that oversight efforts are objective and  consistent, as specified in its enforcement manual, or know whether its  regional offices or individual inspectors are not applying regulations and  guidance consistently.", "Furthermore, NRC policy states that the agency\u2019s mission includes  promoting transparency and openness for all stakeholders.

We  also toured several of the sites with the resident inspectors and observed  areas and equipment related to previous findings, in addition to current  issues of concern being assessed for potential findings. Because this was  a nonprobability sample, the information we gathered from these site  visits is not generalizable to all U.S. nuclear power plants but provides  important illustrative information for understanding the oversight of  reactors at the selected plants. To select these sites, we applied the  following criteria to capture a variety of characteristics: whether NRC\u2019s  assessment of the plant\u2019s safety significance has changed in the past 2  years, and whether, collectively, they were located in multiple NRC  regions, operated by different licensees, and included different reactor  types.

The task force  concluded that a sequence of events like the Fukushima accident is  unlikely to occur in the United States and that the continued operation of  the nation\u2019s commercial nuclear reactors does not pose an imminent risk  to public health and safety. To improve NRC\u2019s oversight, the task force  recommended:  1.  Establishing a logical, systematic, and coherent regulatory framework  for adequate protection that appropriately balances defense-in-depth  and risk considerations.  2.  NRC require licensees to reevaluate and upgrade as necessary the  design-basis seismic and flooding protection of structures, systems,  and components for each operating reactor.  3.  As part of the longer term review, that NRC evaluate potential  enhancements to the capability to prevent or mitigate seismically  induced fires and floods.  4.  NRC strengthen station blackout mitigation capability at all operating  and new reactors for design-basis and beyond-design-basis external  events.  5.  Requiring reliable hardened vent designs in boiling water reactor  facilities with Mark I and Mark II containments.  6.  As part of the longer term review, that NRC identify insights about  hydrogen control and mitigation inside containment or in other  buildings as additional information is revealed through further study of  the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident.  7.  Enhancing spent fuel pool makeup capability and instrumentation for  the spent fuel pool.  8.  Strengthening and integrating onsite emergency response capabilities  such as emergency operating procedures, severe accident  management guidelines, and extensive damage mitigation guidelines.  9.  NRC require that facility emergency plans address prolonged station  blackout and multiunit events.  10. As part of the longer term review, that NRC pursue additional  emergency preparedness topics related to multiunit events and  prolonged station blackout.", "11.
