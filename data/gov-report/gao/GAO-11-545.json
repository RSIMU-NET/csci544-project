Most efforts designed to meet these shortfalls have struggled with cost, schedule, and performance challenges and are rooted in systemic problems that most space acquisition programs have encountered over the past decade. Consequently, in the past 5 fiscal years, DOD has not delivered significant new SSA capabilities as originally expected. To its credit, the Air Force recently launched a space-based sensor that is expected to appreciably enhance SSA. However, two critical acquisition efforts that are scheduled to begin development within the next 2 years--Space Fence and the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS)--face development challenges and risks, such as the use of immature technologies and planning to deliver all capabilities in a single, large increment, versus smaller and more manageable increments. It is essential that these acquisitions are placed on a solid footing at the start of development to help ensure their capabilities are delivered to the warfighter as and when promised. GAO has consistently recommended that reliable acquisition business cases be established, such as maturing technologies prior to development start, utilizing evolutionary development, and stabilizing requirements in order to reduce program risks. For efforts that move forward with less mature technologies, assessments of the cost, schedule, and performance implications of utilizing backup technologies, if they exist, could provide the knowledge needed to determine whether the efforts are worth pursuing or the investment trade-offs that may need to be made. DOD plans to begin delivering other new capabilities in the coming 5 years, but it is too early to determine the extent to which these additions will address capability shortfalls. There are significant inherent challenges to executing and overseeing the SSA mission, largely due to the sheer number of governmentwide organizations and assets involved in the mission. Additionally, while the recently issued National Space Policy assigns SSA responsibility to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary does not necessarily have the corresponding authority to execute this responsibility. However, actions, such as development of a national SSA architecture, are being taken that could help facilitate management and oversight governmentwide. The National Space Policy, which recognizes the importance of SSA, directs other positive steps, such as the determination of roles, missions, and responsibilities to manage national security space capabilities and the development of options for new measures for improving SSA capabilities. Furthermore, the recently-issued National Security Space Strategy could help guide the implementation of the new space policy. GAO has recommended since 2003 that such a strategy be issued. Finally, though the commercial sector and the international community are to play a pivotal role in the SSA mission, it is too early to tell whether DOD's efforts to expand and make permanent its Commercial and Foreign Entities SSA data-sharing pilot program will be effective in integrating efforts to develop SSA capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD assure--in approving the Space Fence and JMS acquisition efforts to initiate product development--that all critical technologies are identified and matured, and that other key risks have been fully assessed.

These  threats range from adversary attacks such as antisatellite weapons, signal  jamming, and cyber attacks, to environmental threats such as harsh  temperatures, radiation, and collisions with debris and other man-made or  natural objects, which have been increasing rapidly over the past several  years. While the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) space surveillance  network tracked about 4,600 objects in 1980, it currently tracks more than  22,000.

In doing so, we  analyzed documentation and interviewed officials on the status and  progress of SSA development efforts in areas such as requirements,  budgets, cost, funding, schedule, contracting, technology maturation,  testing, and personnel. Using criteria we developed through our best  practices work on commercial sector acquisitions, we assessed the levels  of knowledge acquisition efforts had attained at their current development  stages and related risks. For example, we have found that fully maturing  technologies critical to the success of an acquisition program prior to  beginning product development, following an incremental development  path toward meeting user needs, and matching available resources (that is,  technology, time, money, and people) to requirements at program start can  significantly reduce risks to achieving cost, schedule, and performance  goals.

The government\u2019s SSA efforts are designed to  mitigate these threats via a variety of space- and ground-based sensors and  systems that detect, track, and characterize space objects and space- related events and forecast which assets may be at risk. Recent events,  such as the January 2007 Chinese antisatellite weapon test\u2014when China  used a missile to destroy one of its old weather satellites\u2014and the  February 2009 collision between an operational Iridium commercial  communications satellite and a nonfunctioning Russian communications  satellite, have created thousands of additional debris objects and called  attention to the need for better SSA capabilities.

The SSN, primarily operated and  maintained by the Air Force, consists of a worldwide network of 29  ground-based radars and optical sensors, data processing capabilities, and  supporting communication systems. DOD started to build the SSN  subsequent to the former Soviet Union\u2019s launch of its first Sputnik satellite  in 1957. Some of the sensor systems built in the 1960s and 1970s have  undergone modernization and sustainment efforts and are still operational  today. Appendix II discusses the composition of the SSN.", "The JSpOC uses SSN data to accomplish the following: maintain the space  object catalog; analyze new space launches; detect new man-made objects  in space, perform conjunction assessments (predict potential collisions  between space objects and inform NASA and other government,  commercial, and foreign entities if objects may interfere with the orbits of  the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and operational satellite  platforms); and conduct space object atmospheric reentry assessments  (predict when and where a space object will reenter the Earth\u2019s  atmosphere, determine who owns the object, prevent a returning space  object\u2014which to radar looks like a missile\u2014from triggering a false alarm  in missile-attack warning sensors of the United States and other countries,  and predict surface impacts of reentering objects). SSN information is  also used for developing space intelligence, which, in turn, is used to  support SSA operations.", "The JSpOC also relies on ground- and space-based sensors that make  space weather observations to detect and forecast solar storms that may  be harmful to space system operations. These sensors are owned,  operated, and developed by DOD, NASA, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and foreign providers. Examples of  space weather observations include bursts of solar energy called solar  flares, solar winds, geomagnetic activity associated with solar storms,  solar X-ray images and fluctuations, and solar ultraviolet images and  fluctuations. These observations are associated with geomagnetic storms,  electromagnetic radiation, ionospheric scintillation, high-energy particles,  and solar radio bursts that can adversely impact space and ground assets  and operations, terrestrial communications, and transmissions between  Global Positioning System satellites and ground-based receivers.

Our past work has identified a number of causes behind  the cost growth and related problems, but several consistently stand out.  First, DOD often takes a schedule-driven versus a knowledge-driven  approach to the acquisition process. As a result, activities essential to  containing costs, maximizing competition among contractors, and testing  technologies are shortchanged. Second, on a broad scale, DOD starts more  weapon programs than it can afford, creating a competition for funding  that encourages low cost estimates, overly optimistic scheduling,  overpromising, suppressing bad news, and for space programs, forsaking  the opportunity to identify and assess potentially more executable  alternatives. Third, DOD has tended to start its space programs too early,  that is, before it has the assurance that the capabilities it is pursuing can  be achieved within available resources and time constraints. This  tendency is caused largely by the funding process, since acquisition  programs attract more dollars than efforts concentrating solely on proving  technologies. Nevertheless, when DOD chooses to extend technology  invention into acquisition, programs experience technical problems that  require large amounts of time and money to fix. Moreover, there is no way  to accurately estimate how long it would take to design, develop, and build  a satellite system when critical technologies planned for that system are  still in relatively early stages of discovery and invention. Fourth, programs  have historically attempted to satisfy all requirements in a single step,  regardless of the design challenge or the maturity of the technologies  necessary to achieve the full capability. This has stretched technology  challenges beyond current capabilities in some cases and vastly increased  the complexities related to software. Fifth, we have reported that space  programs are particularly affected by the wide disparity of users with  competing interests, including DOD, the intelligence community, other  federal agencies, and in some cases, other countries, U.S. businesses, and  citizens.", "In addition, we have reported in the past that shortages of skilled and  experienced space acquisition personnel, and personnel who are  technically proficient to meet security space needs, have magnified the  challenge of developing complex and intricate space systems. These  shortages are the result of a combination of factors including funding  limitations, recruiting challenges, and limited training and education  opportunities. Moreover, problematic implementation of an acquisition  strategy in the 1990s, known as Total System Performance Responsibility,  for space systems resulted in losses of technical expertise (including cost  estimating and systems engineering staff) and weaknesses in contracting  strategies\u2014the effects of which space programs are still dealing with. The  existence of these problems was confirmed by a congressionally directed  independent assessment panel (also known as the Allard Commission),  which cited the reduced availability of technically competent government  personnel as a major factor that has reduced the government\u2019s capability  to acquire space systems and a likely cause of acquisition program  failures.", "Our work\u2014which is largely based on best practices in the commercial  sector\u2014has recommended numerous actions that can be taken to address  the problems we identified. Generally, we have recommended that DOD  separate technology discovery from acquisition, follow an incremental  path toward meeting user needs, match resources and requirements at  program start, and use quantifiable data and demonstrable knowledge to  make decisions to move to next phases. DOD has generally concurred with  our recommendations and has modified its acquisition guidance to  incorporate them. One exception for space systems is that DOD has not  adopted our recommendation that critical technologies be matured to a  point where they are demonstrated in a realistic (for hardware) or  operational (for software) environment (TRL 7) because it is exceedingly  expensive to test technologies in space. However, it does require that  space systems demonstrate that critical technologies can operate in a  relevant environment (TRL 6). We have also identified practices related  to cost estimating, program manager tenure, quality assurance, technology  transition, and an array of other aspects of acquisition program  management that could benefit space programs. These practices are  highlighted in table 2.", "We have found that when DOD chooses to extend technology  development into acquisition, programs generally experience technical  problems that require large amounts of time and money to fix. Moreover,  there is no way to accurately estimate how long it would take to design,  develop, and build a weapon system when critical technologies planned  for that system are still in relatively early stages of discovery and  invention. Most of the major space programs we have studied over the  past decade, for example, have incurred substantial cost increases and  schedule delays because they were approved without demonstrating that  their technologies could work as intended in a relevant or realistic  environment. In fact, at the time DOD made multibillion-dollar  commitments to start certain programs, technologies were sometimes still  in a proof-of-concept or component validation phase (TRL 3 and 4), that is,  components had not yet been built or integrated beyond a laboratory  environment. As a result, significant technology-related rework was  needed in the costlier and more complex phases of the acquisition  process. In addition, most of the programs we studied could not reliably  estimate costs because there were too many unknowns about technology  and requirements. A factor that contributed to the tendency to extend  technology invention into later phases of acquisition is that programs have  historically attempted to satisfy all requirements in a single step,  regardless of the design challenge or the maturity of the technologies  necessary to achieve the full capability, stretching technologies beyond  current capabilities in some cases and vastly increasing the complexities  related to software.", "Given the early stages of the Space Fence and JMS acquisition efforts, the  high estimated acquisition costs, and the challenges and risks they face,  opportunities exist to help ensure the acquisition problems that have  affected or are affecting other SSA development efforts are avoided. For  example, utilizing an incremental development approach that would  facilitate, prior to beginning product development, (1) the identification  and assessment of all critical technologies and (2) the inclusion of only  fully mature technologies, would significantly increase the reliability of,  and chances of meeting, program cost, schedule, and performance goals.  Because both the Space Fence and JMS are to be ground-based systems,  technologies developed to a level they can be demonstrated in a realistic  or operational environment (TRL 7) would be considered mature  according to our best practices criteria. One way to mitigate technology  maturity risk is to rely on backup technologies, should newer technologies  not mature in time or otherwise be problematic during product  development. However, the use of backup technologies would likely  present cost, schedule, and performance implications, such as with the  Space Fence effort. Additionally, establishing comprehensive plans to  mitigate other key risks, such as those relating to protecting national  security information, would also help ensure acquisition success. DOD has  already adopted similar practices for its newest major space acquisition\u2014 the Global Positioning System IIIA program\u2014and has embraced the  knowledge-based concepts behind our previous recommendations as a  means of preventing large cost overruns and schedule delays."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Space Situational Awareness Faces Significant Governmentwide Management and Oversight Challenges", "paragraphs": ["There are significant inherent challenges to executing and overseeing the  SSA mission, largely due to the sheer number of organizations and assets  involved in the mission, and the fact that, while the new National Space  Policy assigns SSA responsibility to the Secretary of Defense, the  Secretary does not necessarily have the corresponding authority to  execute this responsibility.

The NSSO and Air Force Space Command have developed a draft  national SSA Initial Capabilities Document to highlight the capabilities  required to satisfy national-level SSA needs called for in the National  Space Policy. The development of this document has a  governmentwide perspective. Specifically, according to NSSO  documentation, development efforts have included input from DOD  and intelligence community organizations (including ODNI), as well as  civilian government agencies, such as NASA, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department  of Energy, the Department of State, and the Department of  Transportation. According to ODNI, the intelligence community plays  a critical role in SSA, especially for analytical support. The draft SSA  Initial Capabilities Document was submitted to U.S. Strategic  Command in August 2010. The U.S. Strategic Command, responsible  for planning and conducting space operations including SSA, is to  review and sponsor this document through the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System review process. Due to common  interests between DOD and the intelligence community for SSA, the  document will be processed in accordance with joint DOD and ODNI  guidelines.", "National SSA architecture. A national SSA architecture is under  development to highlight the required capabilities to satisfy national- level SSA needs identified in the SSA Initial Capabilities Document. In  April 2008, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and  Information Integration (ASD/NII)\u2014the principal staff assistant for  SSA capabilities responsible for assuring SSA efforts track toward top- level architecture end states\u2014tasked the Air Force and the Executive  Agent for Space to develop an interim SSA architecture to support the  fiscal year 2010 to 2015 program and budget review. Subsequently,  the Joint Requirements Oversight Council requested further action  from the Air Force, which tasked NSSO to serve as the architecture  integrator across DOD and to coordinate with ODNI in the  development of a more broadly focused national SSA architecture.  NSSO and Air Force Space Command cochair the current architecture  development effort initiated in November 2008. As with the  development of the initial capabilities document, the architecture has a  governmentwide perspective. According to NSSO, in light of the new  National Space Policy, one of the biggest challenges in developing the  national SSA architecture is the amount of limited analyses available to  support the broader Presidential direction to have an SSA system that  uses commercial and foreign data. Subsequent iterations of the  national SSA architecture are expected to address commercial and  foreign capabilities. Drafting of the national SSA architecture was  slated for completion in the October/November 2010 time frame, after  which the document was to be approved through the DOD\u2019s and the  intelligence community\u2019s requirements review processes.", "National Security Space Strategy.

Moreover, the Air Force  successfully launched its SBSS satellite\u2014after several years of delays\u2014 which is anticipated to appreciably enhance SSA. However, most other  SSA acquisition efforts that focus on fielding major additions in capability  over the next 5 years have or are facing significant challenges and risks,  such as the use of immature technologies; planning to deliver all  capabilities in a single, large increment, versus smaller and more  manageable increments; technical requirements instability; operations in a  multiple security level environment; and data integration issues. If these  efforts do not progress as planned, risk of continuing or worsening SSA  capability gaps will result. Therefore, while it is too early to determine the  extent to which these new capabilities will address existing shortfalls, it is  essential that new SSA system acquisitions are placed on a solid footing at  the start of development to help ensure capabilities from these systems  are delivered to the warfighter as and when promised. Should DOD decide  to proceed on a path that leaves open important questions, including those  about technologies, then it is important that this footing be based on  thorough analyses of the risks involved\u2014such as with the use of backup  technologies\u2014including cost, schedule, and performance implications.  Such analyses could provide the knowledge needed to determine whether  the acquisition program is worth pursuing or what trade-offs would need  to be made with other investments should additional resources be  required.

While DOD guidance and law  require acquisition efforts to mature technologies to a level commensurate  with TRL 6\u2014demonstration in a relevant environment\u2014our  recommendation is based on our best practices work which has shown  that achieving a TRL 7\u2014demonstration in a realistic or operational  environment\u2014is the level of technology maturity that constitutes low risk  for starting a product development program. We ordinarily regard satellite  technologies that have achieved TRL 6 as fully mature because of the  difficulty and expense of demonstrating maturity in a realistic  environment\u2014space\u2014which is what would be required to reach TRL 7;  however, this does not apply to programs such as Space Fence and JMS  which are ground-based. Additionally, we remain concerned that the JMS  effort does not intend to identify all critical technologies prior to starting  development. Although our best practices work and DOD guidance call for  critical technologies to be identified and matured by development start,  the JMS plans are only to identify and assess critical technologies prior to  and specific for each release.

We analyzed documentation and interviewed  officials on the status and progress of SSA development efforts in areas  such as requirements, budgets, cost, funding, schedule, contracting,  technology maturation, testing, and personnel. We assessed, using criteria  we developed through our best practices work on commercial sector  acquisitions, the levels of knowledge the acquisition efforts had attained at  their current development stages and related risks. For example, we have  found that fully maturing technologies critical to the success of an  acquisition program prior to beginning product development, following an  incremental development path toward meeting user needs, and matching  available resources (that is, technology, time, money, and people) to  requirements at program start can significantly reduce risks to achieving  cost, schedule, and performance goals. In assessing whether programs are  adopting this practice, we reported the readiness of critical technologies  (as assessed by DOD), using technology readiness levels, a metric  originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) and used across space programs. We also analyzed  program-specific cost performance data obtained from various SSA  acquisition program offices for which we did not perform data reliability  assessments. For past and future DOD SSA-related investment amounts,  we used DOD budget request documentation for fiscal years 2006 through  2011.
