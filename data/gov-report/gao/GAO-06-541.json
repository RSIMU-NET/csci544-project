In response to a request from the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, this study compares trends in Puerto Rico's principal economic indicators with those for the United States; reports on changes in the activities and tax status of the corporations that have claimed the possessions tax credit; explains how fiscal relations between the federal government and Puerto Rico differs from the federal government's relations with the states and other insular areas; and compares the taxes paid to all levels of government by residents of Puerto Rico, the states, and other insular areas. GAO used the latest data available from multiple federal and Puerto Rican government agencies. Data limitations are noted where relevant.

Puerto Rico's per capita gross national product (GNP, which covers income earned only by residents of the Commonwealth) was even lower relative to the United States. Concerns about Puerto Rico's official price indexes make it difficult to say whether the per capita GNP of Puerto Rican residents has grown more rapidly than that of U.S. residents; however, the absolute gap between the two has increased. U.S. corporations claiming the possessions tax credit dominated Puerto Rico's manufacturing sector into the late 1990s. After the tax credit was repealed in 1996 beginning a 10-year phaseout period, the activity of these corporations decreased significantly. Between 1997 and 2002 (the latest data available) valued added in these corporations decreased by about two-thirds. A variety of data indicates that much of this decline was offset by growth in other corporations, so that some measures of aggregate activity remained close to their 1997 levels. For example, value added in manufacturing remained fairly constant between 1997 and 2002. Most of the offsetting growth was in the pharmaceutical industry. Residents of Puerto Rico pay considerably less total tax per capita than U.S. residents. However, because of lower incomes they pay about the same percentage of their personal income in taxes. The composition of taxes differed between Puerto Rico and the states with federal taxes being a larger share of the total in the states. This difference reflects the facts that (1) residents of Puerto Rico generally do not pay federal income tax on income they earn in the Commonwealth and (2) the Commonwealth government has a wider range of responsibilities than do U.S. state and local governments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report provides information on the Puerto  Rican economy, including corporate activity, during the phaseout of the  possessions tax credit, as well as descriptions of the application of federal  tax law and federal social policy programs in Puerto Rico.", "As we agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this letter.

Historically, the  centerpiece of these policies has been the combination of the possessions  tax credit in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and extensive tax  incentives in the Puerto Rican tax code for U.S. and foreign businesses. In  the early 1990s Congress became dissatisfied with the effectiveness of the  credit and introduced restrictions to better target employment-generating  activities. Then in 1996 Congress repealed the credit but allowed existing  possessions corporations to earn either the possessions credit or a  replacement credit during a 10-year phaseout period ending in 2006.  Various proposals have been placed before Congress for some form of  replacement assistance to the Puerto Rican economy. Congress could  better assess the merits of the various proposals if it had more complete  information relating to the recent performance of the Puerto Rican  economy, the current treatment that Commonwealth residents receive  under both federal tax policies and federal social programs, and  information relating to the burden of taxes that residents of Puerto Rico  pay, relative to those paid by residents of the states and the other U.S.  insular areas.", "To provide a basis for future decisions regarding legislation on Puerto  Rican economic issues, this report  explains how the U.S. federal tax treatment of individuals and  businesses in Puerto Rico and of the insular government differs relative  to the treatment of governments, businesses, and individuals in the  states and the other U.S. insular areas;  compares trends in Puerto Rico\u2019s principal economic indicators since  the early 1980s with similar indicators at the national level for the  United States and provides what is known about capital flows between  Puerto Rico and the United States and between Puerto Rico and foreign  countries;  reports on changes in the activities and tax status of the corporations  that have claimed the possessions tax credit since 1993;  provides information on the distribution of private-sector economic  activity in Puerto Rico by type of business entity;  describes the total amount of tax paid by individuals and businesses in  the states and the U.S. insular areas and shows percentage breakdowns  by type of tax; and  describes how the principal U.S. federal social programs apply to Puerto  Rican residents, relative to residents of the states and the other U.S.  insular areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico is one of the two nonstate Commonwealths associated with  the United States. The other is the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands (CNMI). The United States also has three major territories under  the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Interior. The major territories are  Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. The three major  territories plus the two nonstate Commonwealths are referred to in this  report as \u201cthe insular areas.\u201d These areas are often grouped together in this  manner for the purpose of federal legislation. For this reason, and when  necessary for the purpose of comparison to Puerto Rico, this report  provides a limited discussion on the other insular areas.", "With the exception of American Samoa, those born in the insular areas are  U.S. citizens; however, insular area residents are not afforded all of the  rights of citizens residing in the states. More than four million U.S. citizens  and nationals live in the insular areas. These areas vary in terms of how  they came under the sovereignty of the United States and also in terms of  their demographics, such as median age and education levels. Each of the  insular areas has its own government and maintains a unique diplomatic  relationship with the United States. General federal administrative  responsibility for all insular areas but Puerto Rico is vested in the  Department of the Interior. All departments, agencies, and officials of the  executive branch treat Puerto Rico administratively \u201cas if it were a state\u201d;  any matters concerning the fundamentals of the U.S.-Puerto Rican  relationship are referred to the Office of the President.", "Residents of all the insular areas enjoy many of the rights enjoyed by U.S.  citizens in the states. But some rights that, under the Constitution, are  reserved for citizens residing in the states have not been extended to  residents of the insular areas. For example, residents of the insular areas  cannot vote in national elections, nor do their representatives have full  voting rights in Congress. Residents of all of the insular areas receive  federally funded aid for a variety of social programs. Although residents of  an insular area do not pay federal income taxes on income earned in that  insular area, federal tax policy does play an important role in the  economies of the insular areas. Historically, the federal government has  used tax policy as a tool to encourage investment and increase employment  in the insular areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Relationship with the United States", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution of 1952 defines Puerto Rico as a self-governing  Commonwealth of the United States.

Puerto Rican residents are  required to pay local income taxes on income earned from Puerto Rican  sources, but not federal income taxes. Puerto Rican residents, however, do  contribute to the U.S. national Medicare and Social Security systems.  Generally, federal labor, safety, minimum wage laws and standards also  apply in Puerto Rican to the same extent they apply to the states. The  federal government plays a pervasive role in Puerto Rico that stems not  only from the applicability of the United States Constitution, laws and  regulations, but from the transfer to the island of more than $13 billion in  federal funds every year to fund social programs to aid Puerto Rican  residents, including earned benefits such as Social Security and  unemployment benefits.", "Chapters 2 and 7 of this report discuss in detail the how the U.S. federal tax  code applies to residents of Puerto Rico and how the principal U.S. federal  social programs are applied in Puerto Rico, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Puerto Rico", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico occupies a central position in the West Indies. It comprises six  main islands with a land area of 3,421 square miles and a population of  almost four million people. Puerto Rico is thought to have one of the most  dynamic economies in the Caribbean region, an economy in which  manufacturing, driven by the pharmaceutical industry, has surpassed  agriculture as the primary sector in terms of domestic income. Over 40  percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s domestic income since the mid-1980s has been  derived from manufacturing. Pharmaceuticals accounted for almost 40  percent of total value added in manufacturing in 1987; that share rose to  over 70 percent by 2002. Table 2 describes some of the demographic  characteristics of Puerto Rico and compares them to national averages in  2000. possessions has been subject to special tax provisions. The Tax Reform Act  of 1976 modified the form of the preferential tax treatment by establishing  the possessions tax credit under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The stated purpose of this tax credit was to \u201cassist the U.S. possessions in  obtaining employment-producing investments by U.S. corporations.\u201d Prior  to 1994, the possessions tax credit was equal to the full amount of the U.S.  income tax liability on income from a possession. The credit effectively  exempted two kinds of income from U.S. taxation:  income from the active conduct of a trade or business in a possession,  or from the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets used by the  corporation in the active conduct of such trade or business and  certain income earned from financial investments in U.S. possessions or  certain foreign countries, generally referred to as qualified possession  source investment income (QPSII).", "In order for the income from an investment to qualify as QPSII, the funds  for the investment must have been generated from an active business in a  possession, and they must be reinvested in the same possession. Dividends  repatriated from a U.S. subsidiary to a mainland parent have qualified for a  dividend-received deduction since 1976, thus allowing tax-free repatriation  of possession income.", "The possessions tax credit was criticized on the grounds that the  associated revenue cost was high compared to the employment it  generated, that a large share of the benefits of the credit were not reaped  by Puerto Rican residents and that it distorted debate over Puerto Rico\u2019s  political status. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 placed  caps on the amounts of possessions credits that corporations could earn  for tax years beginning in 1994 or later. The Small Business Job Protection  Act of 1996 repealed the possessions tax credit for taxable years beginning  after 1995. However, the act provided transition rules under which a  corporation that was an existing credit claimant was eligible to claim  credits with respect to possessions business income for a period lasting  through taxable years beginning before 2006.

The trends we present are commonly used measures of overall  economic activity and important components of economic activity, such as  saving, investment, labor force participation, and unemployment. We  reported on many of these indicators in our previous report on economic  trends in Puerto Rico. The data shown are largely drawn from the National  Income and Product Account series produced annually by economic  statistics agencies in the United States and Puerto Rico. Most of the data  we used for the U.S. economic series are produced by the Bureau of  Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are publicly  available from the Internet. When we compared U.S. data to Puerto Rican  data that are based on the Puerto Rican July 1\u2013June 30 fiscal year, we  computed annual U.S. figures using monthly or quarterly data to match the  Puerto Rican fiscal year.", "Most of the annual data we used for Puerto Rican economic trends are  produced by the Planning Board of Puerto Rico and are also publicly  available. In some instances, the methodologies used by the Planning  Board to produce certain data series are outdated relative to the  methodologies now used by the United States. For example, the  methodology used in calculating certain price indices in Puerto Rico is  outdated and the methods used to obtain unemployment data have been  somewhat less rigorous than in the United States. In these cases, we  reviewed literature concerning the limitations of various series and  interviewed Puerto Rican officials about the methods they use to collect  and develop their data. These limitations are noted in the report. Wherever  possible, we used alternative assumptions and data sources to determine if  any conclusions drawn from the data are sensitive to the particular data  series used. For example, we applied both U.S. and Puerto Rican price  indices to Puerto Rican gross domestic product (GDP) data to see if  applying different measures of price changes would lead to different  conclusions about whether the Puerto Rican economy has been growing  faster or slower than the U.S. economy. Puerto Rico\u2019s Planning Board has  recently contracted with several consultants for a review of their entire set  of methodologies for preparing the Commonwealth\u2019s income and product  accounts, including the deflators. The Board has also been negotiating a  memorandum of agreement with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for  the latter to provide advice on this effort.", "For some indicators of interest, annual data are not available for Puerto  Rico. In some of these cases, we used decennial census data. The decennial  census covers both the United States and Puerto Rico and produces  comparable statistics on educational attainment and poverty levels. We  also used data from the Economic Census of Puerto Rico and the  Economic Census of the United States, also produced by Census. These  data included detailed information on employment, investment, and value  added broken down by sector of the economy. These data, produced by  Census every 5th year, are of particular relevance to the possible effects of  phaseout of the possessions tax credit.", "To provide information on what is known regarding the flow of capital into  and out of Puerto Rico, we interviewed Puerto Rican government officials  and private sector experts to help us to ascertain what data were available.  We determined that the available data would not allow us to present a  comprehensive picture of the trends in capital flows. The most significant  gap in that picture is data relating to direct investment by corporations  incorporated outside of Puerto Rico, which is financed from within their  own affiliated groups, rather than through financial institutions. We can,  however, report on changes over the years between 1995 and 2004 in the  amount of funds that nonresidents hold in the Puerto Rican banking system  and the amount of funds that the banking system invests within and outside  of the Commonwealth. In order to identify where the assets held in the  Puerto Rican banking system are invested and where the owners of the  banks\u2019 liabilities reside, we analyzed institution-specific data that the Office  of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions (OCFI) collects for oversight  purposes. Banks and certain other financial institutions in Puerto Rico are  required to report detailed information regarding their assets, liabilities,  and capital to the OCFI through a computerized \u201cCALL report\u201d data system.

The consensus of the government and private sector  financial experts whom we interviewed was that all Puerto Rican  government bonds that qualify for tax exemption under Section 103 of the  IRC, such as bonds that are issued for the purpose of capital improvement  projects, are sold in the U.S. market. All other Puerto Rican government  bonds that are taxable in the United States but tax exempt in Puerto Rico  are sold in the local market.

Our principal source of data was  IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income unit (SOI), which compiles comprehensive data  on possessions corporations every other year. We obtained the complete  set of these biennial databases from 1993 through 2003 and used  information from SOI to identify those possessions corporations that  operated in Puerto Rico. For the first stage of our analysis, we linked the  biennial records for each individual corporation by its employer  identification number (EIN) so that we could identify any data gaps for  specific corporations in particular years and so we could complete a  second, more complicated data analysis (described below). We filled in  missing data for individual corporations to the extent possible from other  IRS files and through imputations based on surrounding-year data. The  extent of the imputations were minimal relative to the population totals we  report. We used the final database on 656 possessions corporations that  operated in at least 1 year between 1993 and 2003 to report on changes over  time in the aggregate income, tax credit, and total assets of this population  of corporations and to show how these particular variables were  distributed across different industries. We also used data from the past four  Economic Censuses of Puerto Rico (1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002) compiled  by Census to show how the importance of possessions corporations in  Puerto Rico\u2019s manufacturing sector has changed over time.", "For the second stage of our analysis, we focused on a subpopulation of the  largest groups of affiliated possessions corporations operating in Puerto  Rico. For each of these groups we compiled data on other affiliated  corporations (i.e., those sharing the same ultimate parent corporations)  that also operated in Puerto Rico, but were not possessions corporations.  The objective of this analysis was to assess the extent to which the large  corporate groups that accounted for most of the activity of possessions  corporations remained active in Puerto Rico, even as the operations of  their possessions corporations were being phased out. We started by  identifying the 77 largest groups of possessions corporations in terms of  the amount of credit they earned, their total income, and their total assets.  These large groups gave us a subpopulation that accounted for over 90  percent of the tax credit and income earned and over 90 percent of the  assets owned by possessions corporations between 1993 and 2003, and at  the same time reduced the number of corporations we had to work with  from 656 to 172. This reduction in the number of corporations we had to  work with was important because data limitations caused some of the  steps in our database development to be very labor intensive.", "We used two key data sources to identify and obtain data for the members  of the large groups that operated in Puerto Rico but which were not  possessions corporations. The first source was the database in which IRS  maintained the records of all forms 5471 that had been filed between 1996  and 2002. (The owners of controlled foreign corporations  must file a  separate form 5471 every year for each CFC that they own.) The second  source was a database that the Puerto Rican Department of Treasury (with  the assistance of the Government Development Bank) had recently  transcribed from all Puerto Rican tax returns for tax years 1998 through  2001 filed by all corporations or partnerships that received tax incentives  from the Government of Puerto Rico. Officials from the Department of  Treasury and from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company  (PRIDCO) told us that almost all U.S.- or foreign-owned manufacturing  corporations operating in Puerto Rico receive tax incentives, as do  corporations in designated service industries that export products or  services from Puerto Rico. A total of 1,758 different taxpayers appeared in  the database for at least 1 of the tax years. We used a series of both  automated and manual search and matching approaches to link the CFCs  and other types of companies from these two databases to our 77 large  corporate groups. We also used information from both databases to  determine which of the CFCs had operations in Puerto Rico and, in the  case of CFCs with operations in multiple countries, to make a range of  estimates for the amount of income they earned in Puerto Rico. The data  on income, assets, taxes paid, and place of incorporation that we extracted  from the two databases for these linked corporations allow us to provide a  more complete picture of the trends in activities of the corporate groups  that have taken advantage of the possessions tax credit over the years.", "Through interviews with officials from the agencies providing the data and  our own computer checks for internal consistency in the data, we  determined that the quality of the data was sufficient for the purposes of  our report when viewed with the cautions we raise at various points in the  text. One problem that afflicted all of the databases to some degree was  missing values arising from the fact that IRS and the Puerto Rican  Department of Treasury could not always obtain every tax return that  should have been in their databases in a particular year and the fact that  taxpayers did not always accurately fill in every line of the return that they  should have. Our access to multiple databases that overlapped to some  extent enabled us to address this problem by filling in gaps with data from  an alternative file, making reasonable imputations, or at a minimum  assessing whether missing values would have made a significant difference  to our results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Business Activity", "paragraphs": ["In order to show how economic activity in Puerto Rico is distributed across  different forms of businesses, we negotiated a special arrangement with  IRS and Census that enabled us to disaggregate the data from Census\u2019s  recently completed 2002 Economic Census of Puerto Rico by categories of  business entities that are more specifically relevant to tax policymakers  than the categories Census uses for its own publications. The 2002  Economic Census collected data on employment, payroll, and other  economic measures from all nonfarm, private sector employers in Puerto  Rico, making it a comprehensive enumeration of Puerto Rican businesses.  We used taxpayer data from IRS and Puerto Rico to determine, in as many  cases as possible, the type of federal or Puerto Rican income tax return  each of these employers filed and, in the case of corporations, where they  were incorporated. We then used this information to place each employer  into a business entity group, such as possessions corporation, CFC  incorporated in Puerto Rico, CFC incorporated elsewhere, sole proprietor,  and so forth. Census then provided us with tabulations of their data for  each of these groups, disaggregated by industry to the extent that their  disclosure rules would permit. We developed a coding system and a data- exchange procedure that enabled us to link tax and Census data for  specific employers in such a way that Census did not have to view  restricted IRS data and we did not have to view confidential Census data  for specific survey respondents. (See app. III for details.)", "The data that we used to determine the tax filing status and place of  incorporation for the employers in the Census database came from the IRS  and Puerto Rico databases described above, plus a couple of additional  sources. Another important new source of data was IRS\u2019s National  Accounts Profile (NAP) database, which contains selected information for  all individuals and businesses that have an EIN. Each employer in Puerto  Rico has a federal EIN because it must collect Federal Insurance  Contributions Act (FICA) taxes on behalf of its employees. Consequently,  we were able to access NAP data for a very high percentage of the  employers included in the Census. For those employers we were able to  determine what, if any, federal income tax form they were required to file,  whether they were included in their parent corporation\u2019s consolidated  return, and whether or not IRS had identified them as being sole  proprietors.", "The other data sources that we used for this particular analysis included  sets of income tax returns for some of the businesses operating in Puerto  Rico that IRS had provided to Census, and a list of CFCs operating in  Puerto Rico that PRIDCO had compiled.

GDP is a broad  measure of overall income or economic activity occurring within a nation\u2019s  borders in a given year. According to the Puerto Rican and U.S. national  income and product accounts, this measure has grown more rapidly in  Puerto Rico than in the United States since 1980, when viewed on a per  capita basis after adjustments for inflation. However, for a number of  reasons, the growth rate of real (meaning inflation-adjusted) GDP likely  does not represent a very accurate measure of changes in the economic  well-being of Puerto Rican residents.", "First, as a result of U.S. tax provisions and a development strategy pursued  by successive Puerto Rican governments to use local tax incentives to  attract investment by U.S. and foreign firms, a significant amount of the  investment income included in GDP is paid out to U.S. and foreign  investors. In figure 9, the income earned by nonresidents is approximately  represented by the gap between Puerto Rican GDP and Puerto Rican GNP.  GNP is a measure of the total amount of income earned by residents in a  given year from sources within and from outside of the country. In contrast  to Puerto Rico, GDP has been consistently about the same as GNP in the  United States, which indicates that the amount of income earned abroad by  U.S. residents is close to the amount of income earned by foreign owners of  assets located in the United States. As of 2005, Puerto Rico\u2019s per capita  GNP of about $14,000 remained well below the U.S. level of about $41,000.", "Second, using the possessions tax credit, U.S.-based groups of affiliated  corporations (i.e., those owned by a common U.S. parent corporation) with  certain types of operations in Puerto Rico have had incentives to attribute  as much net income to those operations as is legally permissible, rather than to related operations in the United States. Moreover, the nature of  these incentives has changed during the period covered by our review.  Consequently, the income reported by these corporations to have been  earned in Puerto Rico in a given year may overstate the actual economic  importance of their Puerto Rican production, and changes in income over  the years may reflect not only changes in the economic activity of these  corporations, but also changes in how corporations have computed their  Puerto Rican source income. Some of the data reported later in this chapter  suggest that this so-called \u201cincome shifting\u201d has taken place. This particular  issue affects data on GDP and income and possibly value added for  corporations owned by U.S. parent corporations; it should not affect GNP  or income and value added for Puerto Rican-owned corporations.", "Third, as is the case for any country, the scale of the informal, or  underground, economy in Puerto Rico is difficult to measure. If the  informal economy in Puerto Rico is large relative to the informal economy  in the United States, as some analysts believe, a relatively large amount of  economic activity in Puerto Rico may not be reflected in national income  and labor market statistics. As discussed below, the presence of a large  informal economy may be one explanation of low reported labor force  participation rates in Puerto Rico. Analysts who have recently looked at  this issue disagree on the size of the informal economy and on whether it  has been growing as a share of the total economy. The size and any growth  in the informal economy in Puerto Rico, relative to that in the United  States, would affect comparisons between levels and growth in per capita  income earned in the two jurisdictions.", "Lastly, as acknowledged by the Puerto Rico Planning Board, there are  problems with some Puerto Rican price indices, which cause an unknown  degree of inaccuracy in the inflation adjustments to the long-term trend  data on the Puerto Rican economy and, therefore, some imprecision in the  real growth rates of key economic indicators that are stated in terms of  dollar values. Most concerns center on the Puerto Rican consumer price  index (CPI, a measure of prices on consumer goods) and the fact that the  market basket of goods used to compute the index has not been updated  since the 1970s. This means that the index will tend to overstate price  changes. In the analysis in this chapter, we have used the Puerto Rican  gross product deflator\u2014a broad measure of how prices have changed on  average for goods and services in the economy\u2014for our inflation  adjustments. Although analysts within and outside of Puerto Rico\u2019s  Planning Board, which produces the deflator, consider it to be less  problematic than the CPI, they still have concerns relating to fact that the  CPI is one of the components used in estimating the deflator and the fact  that methodologies for other components are also outdated.", "Given the concerns with the Puerto Rican deflator, there is a question as to  whether that measure or the U.S. gross product deflator more accurately  accounts for the changes in prices in Puerto Rico. The U.S. deflator shows  slower price increases over this period than does the Puerto Rican deflator.  For this reason, we also report some results based on the use of the U.S.  deflator in cases where they differ notably from those based on the Puerto  Rican deflator.", "When comparing the trends in real per capita GNP in Puerto Rico and the  United States from 1980 to 2005, the choice of deflators does make a  difference. Over that period, inflation-adjusted per capita income increased  at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent in the United States, while it rose at  1.5 percent in Puerto Rico if the Puerto Rican deflator is used. However, if  the U.S. deflator is applied to Puerto Rican GNP, annual real per capita  GNP rose by 2.5 percent annually, faster than the growth in the United  States. Real per capita GDP rose more rapidly in Puerto Rico than in the  United States, regardless of which deflators are used. U.S. GDP rose at an  annual average rate of 1.9 percent from 1980 to 2005, while the average  annual growth rate for Puerto Rico was 2.1 percent using the Puerto Rican  deflator and 3.2 percent using the U.S. deflator.", "Figure 10 shows the composition of Puerto Rican GDP over time and the  trend in net income payments abroad. GDP consists of expenditures on  personal consumption, investment, government consumption of goods and  services, and net exports (the value of exports minus the value of imports).  The figure shows that net exports have risen substantially from 1980 to  2005 as a share of GDP, and consumption, which is largely determined by  Puerto Rican income, has fallen as a share of GDP.", "Figure 10 also shows net income payments abroad, expressed as a share of  GDP. This series represents the amount of income paid to foreign owners  of capital located in Puerto Rico, minus income earned by Puerto Ricans  from investments outside of Puerto Rico.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to know the extent of any  overstatement in these economic variables. Evidence is mixed as to  whether the extent of the overstatement increased as the pharmaceutical  operations of possessions corporations were shifted over to other types of  businesses. Other measures of economic activity, such as employment and  capital spending, should not be affected by income shifting and, therefore,  can be used to either support or challenge conclusions based on measures  of value added and income.", "Census data on value added and Puerto Rican Planning Board data on  domestic income both show steady and significant growth in the  pharmaceutical industry. Figure 17 shows that value added in the  pharmaceutical industry more than doubled in real terms from 1992 to  2002, while value added in all other manufacturing industries, as a whole,  declined. Figure 18 shows that the chemical industry, which consists  mainly of pharmaceuticals, saw its share of net manufacturing domestic  income increase from around 50 percent in 1992 to over 60 percent in 2005.", "The strong reported performance of the pharmaceutical sector is the  reason that the manufacturing sector has been able to slightly increase its  share of domestic income, while the share of income of most other  manufacturing industries has declined. Manufacturing\u2019s share of income,  shown in figure 19, greatly exceeds its share of employment, as shown in  figures 23 and 24. Some of the difference may be attributable to a higher  level of labor productivity in manufacturing than in other sectors. Recent  research suggests, however, that reported levels of value added in Puerto  Rican manufacturing are implausible. For example, the official data imply  that labor\u2019s share of value added in manufacturing fell from an average of 50 percent from 1950 to 1970 to only 14 percent in 2004. Similar declines  are not evident in data for other sectors or in U.S. manufacturing statistics.", "Over the years, several analysts have concluded that the incentives  provided by the possessions tax credit have led U.S. corporate groups to shift income to Puerto Rican affiliates. Until the mid-1990s, the credit  essentially allowed profits earned from qualified Puerto Rican operations  to be returned to the mainland free of federal tax (even when largely  exempted from Puerto Rican income taxes). In addition, one option under  the credit allowed the U.S. corporate parent to apply a 50-50 split of their  combined taxable income from the sale of products to third parties if the  products were derived from an intangible asset, such as a patent, invention,  formula, or trademark. Although a substantial portion of this income can be  attributed to manufacturing intangibles developed and owned by the U.S.  corporate parent, there is no requirement that the allocation of income  from such manufacturing intangible assets reflect where costs were  actually generated, or where value was actually added to the products.  Consequently, corporate groups that produced pharmaceuticals, or other  products whose final values are largely based on the value of intellectual  property, were given flexibility under the law to shift net income to the  possession corporations operating in Puerto Rico or another insular area.  This shifting of income and value added to the Puerto Rican operations of  possessions corporations ultimately gets reflected in economic data  compiled by the Puerto Rican government, which is based heavily on data  pulled from samples of corporate tax returns, and possibly in data that  Census collects in its surveys of employers for the economic censuses, if  the economic data the employers provide are based on their tax accounts.", "The nature of income shifting changed significantly after 1995, when the  phaseout of the possessions tax credit began. Some of the corporate  groups that owned possessions corporations in Puerto Rico began to close  or reduce operations in those corporations and shift production to CFCs  located on the island. Corporate groups still have some incentives to retain  operations in Puerto Rico rather than shift that production to the United  States. First, Puerto Rico responded to the phaseout of the credit by  increasing the generosity of its own tax incentives. Second, manufacturing  income earned from an active trade or business by the CFCs is not subject  to federal tax unless it is repatriated to the United States. A change in  income shifting has also occurred because the rule for arbitrarily splitting  net income 50-50 between Puerto Rican and U.S. operations does not apply  to CFCs. Nevertheless, corporate groups may be able to shift income to  Puerto Rico through the manner in which they set prices on goods and  services transferred among affiliated corporations.", "Data from the last four economic censuses of manufacturing in Puerto  Rico, presented in figure 20, show that valued added per employee in the  pharmaceutical industry was already at least twice as high as the ratio for  all other industries in 1987 and 1992. The difference between the  pharmaceutical industry and the other industries grew larger in 1997 and  then broadened dramatically by 2002. The 2002 figure of $1.5 million for  value added per employee in Puerto Rican pharmaceutical manufacturing  was three times as high as the ratio for the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for  the same year. Moreover, while the U.S. ratio grew only 8 percent in real  terms between 1997 and 2002, the Puerto Rican ratio grew by 65 percent  over that same period.", "The data on value added per employee by type of business in figure 21  suggest that the sharp increase in that measure between 1997 and 2002 may  have been a direct result of the shift in pharmaceutical operations from  possessions corporations to CFCs. (These data are derived from a special  research effort in which we obtained assistance from Census and IRS to  aggregate data from the 2002 Economic Census of Puerto Rico by  particular types of business entities, including possessions corporations  and CFCs.) The value added per employee of $4.2 million for  pharmaceuticals CFCs incorporated outside of Puerto Rico was  dramatically higher than for any other type of business in Puerto Rico.

The survey is  designed to be similar to the U.S. Current Population Survey (CPS), from  which the U.S. data are derived, but the questions regarding labor market  activity in the surveys differed and the question asked by the Puerto Rico  household survey may not have captured work activity in the informal  sector of the economy as well as the question asked in the CPS.

Many corporate groups have chosen to  operate in Puerto Rico through CFCs, possibly to take advantage of the  federal tax deferral on income earned there. Some may have rejected this  choice because their possessions subsidiaries owned valuable intangible  assets, such as drug patents or food recipes, and the transfer of these assets  to a non-U.S. entity, such as a CFC, could have been treated as a taxable  exchange, possibly resulting in a substantial, one-time tax liability.  Affiliated groups can avoid this tax if they keep the intangible assets in  their U.S. firms, rather than transferring them to their new CFCs. However,  in order for those CFCs to use those intangibles in their production  processes, they must pay royalties to the U.S. owners and those royalties  would be subject to federal income tax.", "IRS officials have expressed concern that the repeal of section 936 has not  had its intended effect. Congress repealed section 936 because it was  viewed as providing an overly generous tax benefit to taxpayers with  operations in Puerto Rico. However, IRS officials believe that despite the  repeal of section 936, many taxpayers with operations in Puerto Rico could  be incurring approximately the same or even lower tax liabilities than they  did under section 936 by restructuring their activities through CFCs.  Taxpayers who converted into CFCs may have avoided the tax  consequences typically associated with such a conversion, namely, tax  liabilities arising from the transfer of intangibles from possessions  corporations to CFCs or a significant increase in royalty payments from  Puerto Rico. One private sector tax expert familiar with the practices of  U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico could not recall any case in which  a taxpayer reported a transfer of intangibles of any significant value from a  possessions corporation to a CFC. The expert also told us that the reason  why the IRS has not seen a notable increase in royalty payments from CFCs  to U.S. firms holding intangibles is that, well before the expiration of the  possessions tax credit, corporate groups had their existing or newly  formed CFCs enter into research cost-sharing arrangements with their  possessions corporations so that they would be codevelopers of new  intangibles and, thereby, would have certain ownership rights to use the  technology without paying royalties.

The gross profits of those CFCs grew from $2.4 billion to  $7.1 billion between 1997 and 2001.

The combined profits of these two sets of businesses, therefore,  grew by about $8.7 billion. If we use the \u201ctax ratio\u201d estimate for all CFCs,  the combined growth in profits grew by about $12.5 billion. The gross profit  of the \u201cother affiliated\u201d businesses is likely to be understated relative to  those of the possessions corporations because of differences in the income  definitions used for federal and Puerto Rican tax purposes. For those  possessions corporations for which we had both federal and Puerto Rican  returns, the gross profit from the Puerto Rican return averaged about 70  percent of the gross profit on the federal return. For this reason figure 33  may understate the extent to which the decline in possessions  corporations\u2019 Puerto Rican operations has been offset by these other  affiliates.", "Data from recent economic censuses on value added in Puerto Rican  manufacturing lend additional support to the conclusion that we draw from  figure 33\u2014that much, if not all, of the decline in income of possessions  corporations in Puerto Rico between 1997 and 2001 was largely offset by  increases in the incomes of other types of businesses.

For this reason it is difficult to know how accurately  trends in reported income and value added represent trends in actual  economic activity in Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, data on capital  expenditures, total assets, and employment (which should not be distorted  by income shifting) support the conclusion that a substantial amount of  possessions corporation activity has been continued by other types of  businesses. Much of this continued activity is concentrated in the chemical  industry, which is dominated by pharmaceutical producers.", "The economic census data on capital expenditures on manufacturing plant  and equipment in figure 36 show that this investment increased  dramatically between 1997 and 2002 after having dropped from 1992 to  1997. We cannot divide this time series of capital spending data between  possessions corporations and other forms of business; however, figure 36  shows that most of the spending increase was in the pharmaceutical  industry, which was the source of about two-thirds of total possessions  corporations profits in 1997. Consequently, it appears that any overall  decline in possessions corporations\u2019 capital spending that may have  occurred since 1997 must have been more than offset by the investment of  other businesses.", "The tax data for our 77 large corporate groups show that the $12.1 billion  decline in the total assets of the possessions corporations in these groups  between 1997 and 2001 was largely offset by an increase of at least $9.4  billion in the total assets of affiliated corporations operating in Puerto Rico  (see table 15 in app. IV). The decline in assets may have been more than  fully offset, depending on the growth in the Puerto Rican assets of the  CFCs that we were not able to include in our estimates. However, as was  the case with income and value added, there were significant differences  across industries behind the trends for the manufacturing sector as a  whole. The decline in assets of possessions corporations in the chemical  and medical equipment industries between 1997 and 2001 was more than  offset by the increased assets of their affiliates even if we use just our  lower-bound estimates for CFCs. In comparison, a little over half of the  decline in possessions corporations\u2019 assets in the computer, electronics,  and electrical equipment industries between 1997 and 2001 was offset by  the growth in affiliated CFCs\u2019 assets. (See tables 16 and 17 in app. IV.)", "The economic census data on employment in Puerto Rico\u2019s manufacturing  sector in figure 37 shows that the decline in employment by possessions  corporations between 1997 and 2002 was not as drastic as the declines in  their profits or value added over that period (shown previously in figs. 33  and 34); however, there was no offsetting increase in overall employment  by other types of manufacturing firms. Figure 38, which decomposes the  last two columns of figure 37 into the chemical industry and all other  industries, shows that employment by possessions corporations in the  chemical industry did, in fact, fall sharply between 1997 and 2002, but other  types of businesses in the industry more than made up for that decline. In  the remaining industries as a whole, there was a smaller percentage  decrease in employment by possessions corporations but there was also a  decrease, rather than an offsetting increase, in the employment by other  types of businesses. The chemical industry is much less important in terms  of overall employment in manufacturing than it is in terms of value added.

The estimates presented in figure 41 are  based on our tax ratio approach for attributing portions of the income of  multilocation CFCs to Puerto Rico. The estimates indicate that 70 percent  of the gross profit and 73 percent of net income that CFCs earned in Puerto  Rico in 2001 were earned by CFCs incorporated outside of Puerto Rico.  Using the tax data, we estimate that more than three-quarters of the total  gross and net income earned by the CFCs incorporated outside of Puerto  Rico in 2001 is attributable to CFCs incorporated in the Cayman Islands,  Ireland, the Netherlands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "A comparison of figures 42 and 43 shows that the value added of CFCs in  2002 was concentrated in the pharmaceutical industry. These firms  accounted for over half of the value added in that industry, or almost three  times as much as the value added of possessions corporations.

If the value added of these entities was distributed across industries in  approximately the same manner as their employment, then pass-through  entities would have accounted for between 3 percent and 7 percent of value  added in pharmaceuticals.", "Data in table 20 of appendix V show that possessions corporations and  CFCs were approximately equal in importance in terms of employment in  the pharmaceutical industry in 2002 and, together, they accounted for 61  percent of the industry\u2019s employment.
