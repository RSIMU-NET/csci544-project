Past management practices, including a concerted federal policy in the 20th century of suppressing fires to protect communities and ecosystem resources, unintentionally resulted in steady accumulation of dense vegetation that fuels large, intense, wildland fires. While such fires are normal in some ecosystems, in others they can cause catastrophic damage to resources as well as to communities near wildlands known as the wildland-urban interface. In 1999, GAO recommended that the Forest Service develop a cohesive strategy for responding to wildland fire threats. As a follow-up, 5 years later, GAO was asked to identify the (1) progress the federal government has made in responding to wildland fire threats and (2) challenges it will need to address within the next 5 years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 5 years, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture and land management agencies in the Department of the Interior, working with the Congress, have made important progress in responding to wildland fires. The agencies have adopted various national strategy documents addressing the need to reduce wildland fire risks; established a priority for protecting communities in the wildland-urban interface; and increased efforts and amounts of funding committed to addressing wildland fire problems, including preparedness, suppression, and fuel reduction on federal lands. In addition, the agencies have begun improving their data and research on wildland fire problems, made progress in developing long-needed fire management plans that identify actions for effectively addressing wildland fire threats at the local level, and improved federal interagency coordination and collaboration with nonfederal partners. The agencies also have strengthened overall accountability for their investments in wildland fire activities by establishing improved performance measures and a framework for monitoring results. While the agencies have adopted various strategy documents to address the nation's wildland fire problems, none of these documents constitutes a cohesive strategy that explicitly identifies the long-term options and related funding needed to reduce fuels in national forests and rangelands and to respond to wildland fire threats. Both the agencies and the Congress need a comprehensive assessment of the fuel reduction options and related funding needs to determine the most effective and affordable long-term approach for addressing wildland fire problems. Completing a cohesive strategy that identifies long-term options and needed funding will require finishing several efforts now under way, each with its own challenges. The agencies will need to finish planned improvements in a key data and modeling system--LANDFIRE--to more precisely identify the extent and location of wildland fire threats and to better target fuel reduction efforts. In implementing LANDFIRE, the agencies will need more consistent approaches to assessing wildland fire risks, more integrated information systems, and better understanding of the role of climate in wildland fire. In addition, local fire management plans will need to be updated with data from LANDFIRE and from emerging agency research on more cost-effective approaches to reducing fuels. Completing a new system designed to identify the most cost-effective means for allocating fire management budget resources--Fire Program Analysis--may help to better identify long-term options and related funding needs. Without completing these tasks, the agencies will have difficulty determining the extent and location of wildland fire threats, targeting and coordinating their efforts and resources, and resolving wildland fire problems in the most timely and cost-effective manner over the long term."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The national trend in recent years of increasing wildland fire threats to  communities and ecosystems has been continuing.

While an increase in wildland fires may often be necessary to restore  ecosystems, some fires also can cause catastrophic damages to  communities and ecosystems. Experts believe that catastrophic damages  from wildland fires likely will continue to increase until an adequate  long-term federal response, coordinated with others, is implemented and  has had time to take effect. In this context, you asked us to report on the  progress that the federal government has made over the last 5 years and the  key challenges it faces in developing and implementing a response to  wildland fire problems.", "This report is primarily based on over 25 reviews dealing with federal  wildland fire issues that we have conducted in recent years.

Such fires periodically consume excess vegetation and  renew the productivity of our nation\u2019s ecosystems. However, in ecosystems  that are adapted to frequent small, low-intensity fires, uncharacteristically  large and intense wildland fires increasingly threaten catastrophic damage  to such ecosystems. Large intense fires in these and other ecosystems also  increasingly threaten human lives, health, property, and infrastructure in  the wildland-urban interface.", "Uncharacteristically large, intense fires often are fueled by abnormally  dense accumulations of vegetation in many forest and rangeland  ecosystems. This excess vegetation is the result of several human land use  and management practices, including several decades of effective fire  suppression activities that have reduced the normal frequency of wildland  fires that nature had periodically used to clear undergrowth and small  trees. This vegetation, in turn, provides abnormally large amounts of fuel  for fires, causing some to spread more rapidly, burn larger areas, and burn  more intensely than normal. Such uncharacteristic fires are more common  in warmer, drier climates such as the interior western United States and  during periods of drought. Federal researchers estimate that these  vegetative conditions exist on approximately 190 million acres (or more  than 40 percent) of federal lands in the contiguous United States, but could  vary from 90 million to 200 million acres, and that these conditions also  exist on many nonfederal lands."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Wildland Fire Has Continued to Increase in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["The acreage burned by wildland fire\u2014after having declined nationally  throughout most of the 20th century due to land management practices,  including fire suppression\u2014increased in the latter decades of the century.

The trend toward increased  acreage burned by wildland fire has continued into the 21st century as  illustrated in figure 1.

Such a strategy was needed by the agencies to  address numerous policy, programmatic, and budgetary factors that  presented significant barriers to accomplishing fuel reduction goals.  Among these barriers were program incentives that tended to focus on  areas that may not present the greatest wildland fire hazards and very high  costs for removing hazardous fuels. We also reported in 2003 that the  Forest Service and Interior had issued national guidance on fuel reduction,  but it was not specific enough for prioritizing fuels reduction projects.  Lacking such guidance, agencies could not ensure that local land  management units were implementing the highest-priority fuels reduction  projects nationwide.", "Our reviews also found shortcomings in the federal government\u2019s  implementation at the local level of various wildland fire management  activities, such as preparedness, suppression, and rehabilitation. Over half  of all local federal land management units had no fire management plans  that met the requirements of the 1995 Federal Wildland Fire Management  Policy. This national policy, jointly adopted by Agriculture and Interior and  updated in 2001, established a goal to restore fire\u2019s natural role in  ecosystems consistent with human health and safety. The fire management  plans are intended to help ensure the effective integration of local wildland  fire management activities with planned uses of agencies\u2019 lands so that  unwanted wildland fire does not impair accomplishment of desired future  conditions on these lands. The Forest Service and Interior also lacked basic  data, such as the amount and location of lands needing fuel reduction, and  research on the effectiveness of different fuel reduction methods on which  to base their fire management plans and specific project decisions.  Furthermore, coordination among federal agencies and collaboration of  these agencies with nonfederal entities were ineffective. Such coordination  and collaboration are needed because wildland fire is a shared problem  that transcends land ownership and administrative boundaries, requiring  cooperation among all parties.", "Finally, we found that better accountability in federal wildland fire  management efforts was needed. Although the agencies had begun  developing results-oriented performance measures to assess the  effectiveness of treatments in reducing the risk of catastrophic wildland  fires, they had no baseline from which to assess program performance.  They also could not establish any meaningful performance measure and  goal for reducing fuels because they lacked sufficient data on the location  of lands at high risk of catastrophic fires as well as data on the  cost-effectiveness of fuel reduction methods and their effects on other  ecosystem resources.

To address this priority, the agencies, working with the  states, identified a list of communities nationwide that are considered most  at risk of wildland fire damage. While the recently enacted Healthy Forests  Restoration Act of 2003 addresses risks to both communities and  ecosystems, it emphasizes a priority for protecting wildland-urban  interface communities by directing that at least 50 percent of funding for  fuel reduction projects authorized under the act be allocated to  wildland-urban interface areas. Although we have raised concerns about  how the agencies have defined these interface areas, the accuracy and  process they used in designating these communities and wildland-urban  interface areas, and the specificity of their prioritization guidance, the act\u2019s  clarification of the priority for protecting communities provides a starting  point for identifying and prioritizing funding needs.", "Forest Service and Interior appropriations for fuel reductions, as well as  for other wildland fire management activities such as preparedness and  suppression, have increased substantially over the past 5 years. In 1999, the  Forest Service had not requested increased funding to meet the growing  fuel reduction needs it had identified. As shown in table 1, overall  appropriations for wildland fire management activities for both the Forest  Service and Interior have nearly tripled in the past 5 years, from about $1  billion in fiscal year 1999 to over $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2004.

In particular,  significant improvements in federal data and research on wildland fires  have been made during the past 5 years. In 1999, the federal government  lacked adequate data on the location and extent of hazardous fuels to use  in selecting and designing fuel reduction projects. Since then, the  agencies have jointly completed a mapping of fuels nationwide that  classifies lands by differing fuel hazard levels. Although this mapping is not  done at a small enough geographic scale to support decisions on the  location and design of individual fuel reduction projects, it nevertheless  represents a significant improvement over the information that was  available in the past.", "In 2003, Agriculture and Interior approved funding for development of a  geospatial data and modeling system, called LANDFIRE, to identify  wildland fire hazards with more precision and uniformity than the existing  hazardous fuels mapping and to enable comparisons of conditions between  different field locations nationwide. When operational, LANDFIRE data  and enhanced models of likely fire behavior thus will help identify the  nature and magnitude of the wildland fire risks confronting numerous  community and ecosystem resources, such as residential and commercial  structures, species habitat, air and water quality, and soils. The agencies  plan to use this information to better support their strategic decisions on  preparedness, suppression, the location and design of fuel reduction  projects, and other land management activities. Initial results from  LANDFIRE have been promising. For example, a Forest Service official,  who had used LANDFIRE to choose an approach for suppressing a fire in  an area of Montana where the prototype system was developed, said he  found it much better at identifying suppression options and their  consequences than any other currently available data. LANDFIRE\u2014  estimated to cost $40 million\u2014is scheduled for nationwide implementation  in 2009.", "Local fire management planning also has been strengthened.

The  agencies also adopted a common interagency template for preparing these  plans to ensure greater consistency in their contents.", "Other critical improvements have been made in coordination among  federal agencies responsible for wildland fire management and in  collaboration with nonfederal partners. In 2001, as a result of  congressional direction to the agencies to involve the states as full partners  in their efforts, Agriculture and Interior jointly adopted a 10-Year  Comprehensive Strategy with the Western Governors Association. This  strategy, and an implementation plan adopted in 2002, detail goals, time  lines, and responsibilities of the different parties for various actions related  to a wide range of activities, including collaboration at the local level to  identify fuel reduction priorities in different areas.

To rectify this shortcoming, the agencies adopted a  performance measure that identifies the amount of acres moved from  high-hazard to low-hazard fuel conditions. This measure will allow them to  better determine the extent to which their fuel reduction efforts  accomplish the key goal of reducing risks to communities and ecosystems.", "The agencies also made progress in developing a system to monitor the  effects of wildland fires. Without such information, they cannot determine  the nature of threats or the likely effectiveness of different actions taken to  address threats.

LANDFIRE is also needed to better  reconcile the effects of fuel reduction activities with the agencies\u2019 other  stewardship responsibilities for protecting ecosystem resources, such as  air, water, soils, and species habitat. Fuel reduction activities, such as  controlled burning or mechanical treatments (using chainsaws and heavy  equipment), can adversely affect these ecosystem resources if not done at  the proper time and place. For example, mechanically removing fuels with  heavy equipment can adversely affect wildlife habitat and water quality in  many areas and controlled burning can cause air quality problems. The  agencies also need LANDFIRE to help them better measure and assess  their performance. For example, such data will enable the agencies to  better identify the relative importance of reducing fuels on the  highest-hazard lands versus maintaining conditions on low-hazard lands.

Recent research suggests that the  effects of climate change on wildland fire might more adversely affect the  nature, extent, and geographical distribution of hazards identified in  LANDFIRE, as well as the costs for addressing them, than previously  understood. In August 2004, a panel\u2014appointed by the Wildland Fire  Leadership Council to investigate escalating suppression costs\u2014reported  that recent agency research suggested that climate change could have  significant implications for the occurrence of wildland fire and the costs  required to contain it.

Additionally, other agency research being field-tested in  California and elsewhere suggests that placing fuel reduction treatments in  specific geometric patterns can more effectively reduce the spread rate and  intensity of wildland fires. As a result, agency officials believe the approach  could provide more protection across the landscape than other approaches  to locating and designing treatments, such as placing fuel breaks around  communities and ecosystems resources.

Their analysis also considered the impacts of fuels reduction  activities on likely future costs for other principal wildland fire  management activities, such as preparedness, suppression and rehabilitation, if fuels were not reduced. The team concluded that  reducing the risks to communities and ecosystems across the nation could  require an approximate tripling of current fuel reduction funding to about  $1.4 billion for an initial period of a few years. These initially higher costs  would decline after fuels had been reduced enough to use less expensive  controlled burning methods in many areas and more fires could be  suppressed at lower cost, with total wildland fire management costs, as  well as risks, being reduced after 15 years. Alternatively, the team said that  not making a substantial short-term investment using a landscape focus  could increase costs, as well as risks to communities and ecosystems, in  the long term. More recently, however, Interior has said that the costs and  time required to reverse current increasing risks may be less when other  vegetation management activities are considered that were not included in  the interagency team\u2019s original assessment but also can influence wildland  fire. The interagency experts said their estimates of long-term costs could  only be considered an approximation because the data used for their  national-level analysis were not sufficiently detailed. They said a more  accurate estimate of the long-term federal costs and consequences of  different options nationwide would require applying this national analysis  framework in smaller geographic areas using more detailed data, such as  that produced by LANDFIRE, and then aggregating these smaller-scale  results.", "Agency officials told us that another management system under  development\u2014Fire Program Analysis (FPA)\u2014also could be used to help  identify long-term fuel reduction options and related funding needs. FPA,  which is being developed in response to a congressional committee  direction to improve budget allocation tools, is designed to identify the  most cost-effective allocations of annual preparedness funding for  implementing agency field units\u2019 local fire management plans. Eventually,  FPA will use LANDFIRE data and provide a smaller geographical scale for  analyses of fuel reduction options. Thus, like LANDFIRE, FPA will be  critical for updating fire management plans.

We interviewed officials from the  Forest Service and Department of the Interior agencies that are responsible  for wildland fire management and obtained data on acres burned from the  National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. We also interviewed and  obtained data from Forest Service and Interior officials responsible for  developing long-term fuel treatment options and costs, LANDFIRE, the Fire  Program Analysis system, climate change estimates, fire management  plans, performance measures, and the Quadrennial Fire and Fuels Review.  In addition, we interviewed officials and obtained data from the National  Academy of Public Administration and the Brookings Institution.

We did not change our characterization of the period over which  progress was made because efforts made earlier than 4 years ago  provided an important basis for subsequent progress, including (1) the  September 8, 2000, report to the President from the Secretaries of  Agriculture and the Interior that was used to inform the 2001  appropriation request and (2) the Forest Service\u2019s formulation of its  own fuel reduction strategy that was initiated in 1999.  2. We clarified the language of our report to make clearer our meaning  that, although national guidance was issued, this guidance\u2014as we have  previously reported\u2014was not specific enough for prioritizing fuels  reduction projects.  3. We clarified the language in our report to make clearer our meaning  that, by identifying landscape fuel hazards, LANDFIRE will help  identify the risks to those resources.  4. We have included this observation in our report. However, we note that  the agencies will need to ensure this is done because of (1) the likely  impacts that the LANDFIRE and FPA systems will have on the fire  management plans, (2) the importance of the plans for identifying  aggregate national fuel reduction options and costs, and (3) agencies\u2019  past failures to keep these plans up-to-date, as our report notes.  5. We did not recommend that the long-term options and associated costs  be identified in the joint tactical plan. Rather, we said that this joint  tactical plan should specify the steps and related time frames that the  agencies will take in completing a cohesive strategy containing options  and costs. In addition, we did not recommend that the joint tactical  plan be provided concurrently with the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2006  budget submissions, but only that it be provided in time for the  Congress\u2019s deliberation of the agencies\u2019 appropriations for fiscal year  2006. Should the agencies subsequently identify adjustments that need  to be made to the tactical plan because of evolving LANDFIRE and FPA  processes, they can so inform the Congress of those adjustments and  the reasons for them. Because this is a long-term effort in which each  year\u2019s progress can have significant long-term fiscal, resource, and  human safety consequences, we believe it is important from this point  forward that the agencies more transparently identify for the Congress  the specific steps they will undertake, and their associated time frames,  for identifying long-term options and costs.

We  neither are criticizing the emphasis that the agencies previously placed  on protecting wildland urban interface areas nor are making an  assessment of the act\u2019s priorities, since our report notes that further  analysis is needed to determine the most cost-effective allocation  among priorities. 4. We clarified the language in our report to make clearer our meaning  that, by identifying landscape fuel hazards, LANDFIRE will help  identify the risks to those resources.  5. We agree these factors should be among those raised by climate change  research that our report says should be considered in identifying long- term options and associated costs. 6. We have modified our draft to include the observation that Interior  believes inclusion of this additional acreage would have substantially  changed the outcome the team reported.  Our report already noted the  interagency team\u2019s view that the accuracy of the assessment\u2019s  outcomes will be improved by use of more detailed data such as from  LANDFIRE.  However, we are encouraged by the departments\u2019  commitment, expressed in both of their comments on our draft report,  to use this type of analysis to identify and communicate to the Congress  long-term fuel reduction options and costs, reversing a June 2002  decision by the Wildland Fire Leadership Council not to do so.  We  believe that the fulfillment of this commitment is needed to provide the  Congress with a sufficiently informed understanding of the long-term  consequences of different appropriation choices that it will need to  make over the coming years and decades to adequately and cost- effectively address wildland fire management issues. 7.
