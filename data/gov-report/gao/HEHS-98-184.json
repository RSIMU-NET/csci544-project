Concerned about insurers\u2019 willingness to offer policies to small employers and certain individuals, the Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (P.L. 104-191, Aug. 21, 1996) to improve access to health insurance. HIPAA contains provisions related to initial coverage, renewability, and portability of private health insurance. These provisions vary in their application to large and small employers who buy or wish to buy coverage for their employees and individuals attempting to purchase health insurance on their own. For example, HIPAA requires health insurance carriers operating in the \u201csmall group\u201d market to accept any small employer that applies for coverage, regardless of the group\u2019s health status. This guaranteed-access provision does not extend to medium and large firms\u2014those employing more than 50 employees. In addition, HIPAA does not directly address premium rates.", "To help the Congress gain a better understanding of access issues in the larger group market, HIPAA required that we report on the extent to which classes of large employers in the different states have access to health insurance and the circumstances surrounding the lack of access (if any) to coverage. This report provides the results of our study. As agreed with your offices, we examined (1) the extent to which medium and large employers (those with 51 or more employees) in different categories and states have access to health insurance and the barriers (if any) these employers face in seeking health insurance, (2) major factors that affect employers\u2019 decisions to offer health insurance, and (3) the extent to which employees are eligible for their employer-provided health plans.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed government and private sector survey data on (1) the number of employers that offer health insurance to their employees by firm size, industry sector, and location and (2) employee eligibility rates by employment status, such as full-time versus part-time schedules and permanent and temporary work arrangements. These data pre-dated the implementation of HIPAA\u2019s provisions concerning access, renewability, and portability of private health insurance. We used the percentage of employers that offer health insurance\u2014employers\u2019 offer rate\u2014as a proxy for the extent of employers\u2019 access to the health insurance market. The offer rate is a widely used indicator of employers\u2019 access to health insurance but it is incomplete in that it measures only \u201crealized\u201d access. Some employers that do not currently offer health coverage nonetheless would be able to obtain coverage if they chose to purchase it; they have potential access that is not realized. In contrast, other employers that do not offer coverage to their employees may in fact lack access to health insurance. Existing government and private sector surveys of employee health benefits do not contain information that would permit employers with potential but unrealized access to be distinguished from those lacking access. To fill this gap, we interviewed industry experts and representatives from insurance agencies and brokers, state regulatory agencies, and employers in different states. Information from these interviews also supplemented our literature review on factors influencing employers\u2019 decisions to provide employer-based health insurance coverage.

In contrast, the estimated offer rate among employers with fewer than 50 employees averaged less than 50 percent, according to a recent KPMG Peat Marwick health benefits survey. Medium employers that do not offer health coverage generally have access to health insurance but may decide for various reasons that they do not need to offer health benefits as part of their employee compensation package or may consider the cost of providing health coverage to be too high relative to their profits or employees\u2019 wages.", "The most recent data available that permit analysis of health insurance offer rates by industry sector and states across firm sizes come from the 1993 National Employer Health Insurance Survey (NEHIS), managed by HHS\u2019 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These data show modest variation in the percentage of employers offering health insurance across industry sectors. Among medium and large employers in different industries, the estimated offer rates in 1993 ranged from 88 to 99 percent. The industries with the highest estimated offer rates (more than 95 percent) were wholesale trade; mining; manufacturing; finance, insurance, and real estate; and transportation, communications, and utilities. As shown in figure 3, slightly lower offer rates (between 88 and 94 percent) prevailed in the retail trade; construction; services; and agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries. The industries with estimated lower offer rates are characterized by higher rates of labor turnover and prevalence of temporary and part-time workers. A similar relationship between offer rates and type of industry was found among small employers, but small employers\u2019 offer rates were markedly lower across all industries, ranging from 29 to 56 percent.", "Variation by state is wider than by industry. At the state level, the estimated offer rate among medium and large employers ranged from a low of about 72 percent in Wyoming and Texas to almost 100 percent in 14 states. The higher offer rates were concentrated in the Northeast, including the six New England states, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Because these estimates are based on survey data, the estimate derived from the sample may be higher or lower than the true percentage of all employers in the state that offer health insurance. Because of the small number of establishments surveyed in certain states, the degree of imprecision for these estimates, as measured by their confidence intervals, can be quite large. Details on the estimated offer rates by firm size in each state and associated confidence intervals for each firm size grouping are in appendix II.", "Survey data on offer rates presented above estimate the extent of realized access to insurance, but employers that do not offer health coverage often have potential access. That is, such employers have a choice. According to insurers, insurance brokers, and employers that we interviewed, employers with more than 50 workers generally can get an insurer to write a policy covering their workforce. However, insurers and brokers we interviewed pointed out that the price of such coverage for employers that have close to 50 employees might differ substantially\u2014from employer to employer and from insurer to insurer.", "Survey data, studies, and interviews with market participants indicate that variations in health insurance offer rates by firm size, industry, and state reflect decisions that medium and large employers make about offering health coverage, not difficulties they face in obtaining access to health insurance. As discussed below, multiple factors, including the characteristics of a firm and its workforce and the cost of health insurance, influence employers\u2019 health insurance decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Offer Rates Reflect Firms\u2019 Wage Levels and Other Traits", "paragraphs": ["Although the likelihood of a firm\u2019s offering health insurance is strongly linked with its size, whether an employer offers health coverage to its workers also depends on the characteristics of its workforce, the cost of providing health insurance, the firm\u2019s financial condition, and the competitive environment in which it operates. Many of these factors are interrelated, and while research studies we reviewed do not estimate the separate effect of these factors, our analysis of survey data and research studies illustrates the relationship between offer rates and certain characteristics of a firm\u2019s workforce such as employee earnings and labor turnover.", "Our analysis of 1993 NEHIS data supports other studies\u2019 findings that employers\u2019 offer rates are lower when their workforces are characterized by low wages and high labor turnover. In addition, the price of health coverage is likely to contribute to decisions that some medium firms make regarding whether to offer health insurance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Role of Wages", "paragraphs": ["NEHIS data show that employers with predominantly low-wage employees\u2014those earning less than $10,000 per year\u2014are less likely to offer health insurance to their workers. The effect is generally stronger the smaller the firm. The difference in estimated health insurance offer rates between employers whose workers typically earned less than $10,000 and those whose workers typically earned $10,000 or more a year in 1993 ranged from 10 percentage points among employers with more than 200 employees to 33 percentage points among employers with 51 to 100 employees. (See table 2.)", "The relatively low offer rate among employers with typically low-wage employees is partly because the cost of health insurance represents a substantial expense for both employers and employees. According to Mercer/Foster-Higgins\u2019 1997 national survey of employers, the nationwide average cost of providing health insurance to an employee ranged from $3,200 per year for a health maintenance organization plan to about $3,500 per year for an indemnity plan. For the employer, paying a significant portion of such premiums would add considerably to the compensation of lower-wage workers or could lead the employer to offset the cost of health insurance by reducing wages. For employees earning lower wages, paying the required share of premium costs may be prohibitive.", "Contributions employers make toward employees\u2019 health benefits are excluded from employees\u2019 taxable income. However, this tax exclusion is of lesser value to lower-wage employees who have a lower tax rate than to high-wage employees. Because low-wage workers do not benefit as much as high-wage workers from the tax advantage associated with employer-sponsored health insurance, many low-wage workers are likely to prefer cash wages over health coverage. As a result, lower-wage workers may decline to enroll in an employer-based plan if one is offered. If few workers choose to participate in a plan, the firm may decide not to offer coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Labor Turnover", "paragraphs": ["Although NEHIS data do not measure the degree of labor turnover, various studies have cited it as predictor of the likelihood that a firm will offer health insurance. Some research literature indicates that firms with high labor turnover rates are less likely to offer health insurance. Quantitative analyses of the link between labor turnover and firms\u2019 decisions to offer health insurance are rare, but several health insurance industry experts we interviewed indicated that this relationship exists. Because labor turnover varies by industry, this relationship can be illustrated by examining industry data. U.S. Bureau of the Census data show that industries that have labor turnover rates higher than the national average such as agriculture, forestry and fishing; services; construction; and retail trade had lower offer rates than industries with low turnover rates. This relationship is illustrated in figure 4, which shows that industries with average monthly labor turnover rates around 10 percent or more had health insurance offer rates below 55 percent. In contrast, industries with average monthly turnover rates below 7 percent had offer rates greater than 60 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Premium Costs", "paragraphs": ["In health benefits surveys that examine reasons some employers (especially those in smaller firms) do not offer health insurance, employers have frequently cited high premium costs as a key factor in their decisions. However, data needed to determine the extent to which costs affect the decisions medium and large employers make regarding health coverage are lacking. Although data are available on premiums charged to employers who offer health coverage, data are lacking on premium rates that firms not offering health insurance would face if they sought to offer health coverage. To address the lack of data on actual premiums faced by non-offering firms, researchers have developed various indirect methods but have applied them only to data on small employers, the group with the lowest percentage of employers offering health insurance.", "Moreover, available data on average premiums may mask important differences in the premiums charged to some medium firms that share some of the characteristics of small employers. For example, recent data collected by a health benefits consulting firm show that health insurance premiums do not vary greatly by employer size. By contrast, some older studies found that insurance companies charged higher premiums to small companies because of the higher risks and higher cost of marketing and claims administration involved in providing coverage to small companies. In addition, research based on data from the 1980s showed that smaller employers have less power to negotiate price discounts than larger employers. However, some studies that report recent data generally do not adjust for differences in the depth and breadth of health benefits offered. Although smaller firms may be paying premiums similar to those paid by larger firms, smaller firms (including those near the 50-employee threshold) generally have less-generous health benefit packages with higher deductibles. In effect, these smaller firms are paying more per dollar of benefits provided or claims reimbursed.", "Some insurance brokers we interviewed said that some medium employers (those closer to the 50-employee threshold) face greater variability in health insurance claims cost and in premiums than larger employers. The extent of premium variation depends on how premiums are set. For example, a firm with 55 employees whose premiums are based on experience rating\u2014the group\u2019s historical medical costs\u2014may be charged higher per capita premiums in the future if an employee or dependent were to incur catastrophic medical costs than a firm with 500 to 1,000 employees that also had a single very expensive case. In practice, the extent to which the premium increases for such a firm depends, among other things, on whether the firm can negotiate with its insurer for lower premium costs, the pressures of state regulation that may limit premium variation or restrict premium increases, and the rating practices of the insurer."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Gaps in Eligibility Limit Many Employees\u2019 Access to Health Insurance From Their Employers", "paragraphs": ["Although most medium and large businesses offer health coverage, many employees lack access to the health benefits their employers sponsor.

The main reason for the discrepancy between eligibility and coverage rates is that over half of part-time employees were able to obtain health insurance coverage through other sources, such as other jobs, family members, the individual insurance market, and Medicare or Medicaid. Nonetheless, about one-fourth of the part-time workforce (or 5.4 million employees) was uninsured as of February 1997, according to data from BLS.

The majority of the uninsured part-time employees were between the ages of 16 and 34, a group that generally has lower earnings compared with most older workers.", "Similar disparities between the eligibility of part-time and full-time workers are observed when looking at data for different firm sizes. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) data for 1996 show that full-time employees were offered health insurance from their current main employers at more than twice the rate of part-time employees for firms with up to 200 employees.
