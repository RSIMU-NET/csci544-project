In developing its reform agenda, WHO consulted with member states, employees, and other parties to gather their views and feedback. In addition, WHO has commissioned three ongoing evaluations to provide input into the reform process. The first stage of one of the planned evaluations was conducted by WHO's External Auditor, which concluded in March 2012 that WHO's reform proposals are comprehensive in addressing challenges faced by the organization. WHO continues to consult with member states on priority-setting and governance proposals, which generally require extensive deliberation and consensus from member states. In November 2011, the WHO Executive Board approved WHO's management reform proposals in several areas, and requested further development of proposals in other areas. In May 2012, WHO developed a high-level implementation and monitoring framework that includes reform objectives, selected activities, 1-year and 3-year milestones, and intended impacts. Certain factors could impede WHO's ability to successfully implement its reform proposals, including the availability of sufficient financial and technical resources and the level of sustained support from internal and external stakeholders.", "The United States has provided input into WHO's reform agenda, particularly in the areas of transparency and accountability, but the Department of State's (State) tool for assessing progress in the area of management reform could be enhanced.

In consultations on governance, the U.S. delegation to WHO has commented on a range of proposals WHO has put forth, including those on engagement with other global health stakeholders. On management reforms, the United States has supported an agenda for greater transparency and accountability. The U.S. delegation has advocated for a number of reforms to improve WHO's internal and external oversight mechanisms and supported reforms in budgeting, planning, and human resources. Additionally, State has established an assessment tool to measure progress on transparency and accountability mechanisms, which is a useful tool for guiding U.S. priorities and engagement with WHO, and could be helpful for monitoring WHO's progress in implementing certain management reforms. However, we found weaknesses in State's assessment tool, including an unclear basis for State's determinations on certain elements in its assessment of WHO, as well as a lack of clarity in the definitions used in the assessment.

WHO  experts produce health guidelines and standards and assist countries in  addressing public health issues. WHO membership is comprised of 194  countries and associate members that meet every year at the World  Health Assembly, WHO\u2019s supreme governing body, to set policy and  approve the budget. The work of the World Health Assembly is  supported by an Executive Board that meets at least twice a year and is  composed of 34 members who are technically qualified in the field of  health and who hold 3-year terms. The main functions of the Executive  Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the World Health  Assembly, provide advice, and facilitate its work. WHO is headed by the  Director-General, who is appointed by the World Health Assembly every 5  years. WHO is staffed by approximately 8,000 health and other experts  and support staff, working at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland;  six regional offices; and 147 country offices. Each WHO region has a  regional committee comprised of representatives from the region\u2019s  member states, which formulates policies and programs and supervises  the work of the regional offices. The regional committees also provide  input into global policy and program development through regional  consultations. WHO country offices support host countries in policy  making, capacity building, and knowledge management, among other  things, in the public health sector.

For the  2010-2011 program budget, the portion of assessed contributions was  about 21 percent of the total (approximately $900 million), while voluntary  contributions accounted for about 79 percent of the total (approximately  $3.6 billion). Voluntary contributions have increased from about 69  percent in 2004 to 2005 to 79 percent in 2010 to 2011 (see fig. 2).", "During the 2010-2011 biennium, the largest annual assessed  contributions from member states came from the United States  ($219 million), Japan ($135 million), Germany ($77 million), United  Kingdom ($62 million), and France ($59 million). While member states  are the only entities that provide assessed contributions to WHO\u2019s  program budget, voluntary contributions come from a diverse group of  more than 400 entities, including member states, foundations,  nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies, and private sector  companies. During the 2010-2011 biennium, the United States was the  largest donor of voluntary contributions to the WHO, followed closely by  the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. During this time period, the top 10  donors to the WHO provided over two-thirds of its total voluntary  contributions (see table 1).", "According to WHO officials, most of WHO\u2019s voluntary contributions  budget is designated by donors for specific diseases and projects.

WHO\u2019s program  budget for 2010 through 2011 was about $4.5 billion. More than half of  that amount was allocated for communicable diseases, HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis, and malaria, and WHO\u2019s enabling and support functions.", "In January 2010, the WHO Director-General convened representatives of  member states for a high-level consultation on the predictability and  flexibility of WHO\u2019s financing, and other global health challenges such as  WHO\u2019s changing role in the international health arena and WHO  priorities. While discussions to reform WHO initially began with a focus on  its lack of predictable and flexible financing and the need for better  alignment between its objectives and resources, WHO\u2019s reform efforts  have evolved to address more fundamental questions about its priorities,  internal governance, role and engagement with other actors in the global  health arena, and the managerial reforms needed to make the  organization more effective and accountable. In 2010, WHO became  concerned with its financial position, particularly due to increased costs  resulting, in part, from a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. In  response, the organization implemented several cost-saving measures,  such as reducing travel and publications costs. WHO\u2019s financial  concerns at the time and the results of two external evaluations of the  organization served as additional rationales for WHO to undertake a  broad management reform agenda.

Accordingly, WHO  aims to establish a clear set of priorities to guide its resource allocation  processes and results-based planning activities. Over 90 member states  convened at a session on priority-setting in February 2012. They reached  consensus on the criteria and the categories of work that will serve as  guidance for the development of WHO\u2019s priorities, as laid out in its  strategic framework and program budget to be approved by the World  Health Assembly in May 2013. Agreed-upon criteria for determining  WHO\u2019s priorities include current health problems, including the burden of  disease at the global, regional, or country levels; the needs of individual  countries as articulated in their WHO country strategies; and WHO\u2019s  comparative advantage, including its capacity to gather and analyze data  in response to current and emerging health issues. WHO has also  established five technical categories that will provide the primary structure  of its program budget and include (1) communicable diseases; (2)  noncommunicable diseases; (3) promoting health through the life course;  (4) strengthening of health systems; and (5) preparedness, surveillance,  and response. WHO will define priorities in each of these categories.  However, according to WHO, even when priorities are identified, there is  no guarantee that funding for priority areas will be available in part due to  the common practice of specifying voluntary funds for particular activities.", "WHO has developed proposals for some of its governance reforms;  however, other areas will require further development, consultation, and  member state consensus.

According to WHO, the Executive Board is currently  prevented from fully exercising its oversight and executive role due to the  demands it faces in preparing the agenda and work of the World Health  Assembly. According to WHO, the number of agenda items before the  World Health Assembly has risen over time, and a large number of  resolutions have been adopted, some in areas that are not high priorities  for global health. To increase the strategic decisionmaking of WHO  governing body meetings, WHO proposals include structuring debate  around its priorities. WHO proposals for harmonizing the operations of its  regional committees include aligning their meeting agendas and  connecting their work more closely with that of the Executive Board. WHO  also plans to strengthen the oversight role of its committee that reviews  program, budget, and administrative issues.", "Although WHO aims to strengthen its engagement with the many  stakeholders directly involved in the global health sector and to improve  the coherence of their efforts, it lacks a current proposal on how to  achieve these aims. WHO\u2019s constitution describes two of its functions as  (1) acting as the directing and coordinating authority on international  health work and (2) establishing and maintaining effective collaboration  with the UN, specialized agencies, and other global health organizations.  Given the growing number of institutions\u2014including foundations,  partnerships, civil society organizations, and the private sector\u2014that have  a role in influencing global health policy, WHO reports that it is trying to  determine how it can engage with a wide range of stakeholders.  According to WHO, at the same time, it does not want to undermine its  intergovernmental nature or open itself to undue influence by parties with  vested interests.", "In 2011, WHO proposed a forum to explore ways in which the major  actors in global health could work more effectively together; however,  WHO stakeholders did not support this proposal. WHO\u2019s concept paper  proposed the idea of a \u201cWorld Health Forum,\u201d an informal, multi- stakeholder body composed of representatives of governments, civil  society organizations, private sector entities, and other relevant  stakeholders. However, according to WHO, feedback from member states  on this proposal was generally unsupportive because they did not want to  create a forum that could potentially impinge upon the intergovernmental  nature of WHO. In addition, some nongovernmental organizations were  concerned that the proposed forum would allow private sector interests to  influence decision-making in WHO. However, pharmaceutical industry  representatives stated that the private sector has an important role to play  in public health policy-making decisions. In May 2011, a group of  nongovernmental organizations wrote a letter to WHO expressing  concerns regarding the role of private bodies in the financing and  governance of WHO. The nongovernmental organizations also expressed  concern that the WHO reform proposals at the time did not adequately  address the issue of how WHO planned to manage potential conflicts of  interest for private institutions.", "According to WHO, more discussion and consultation is necessary to  identify how it will strengthen its engagement with external stakeholders.  Since WHO set aside its World Health Forum proposal, WHO plans to  consult with nongovernmental organizations on how it can effectively  interact with them. In May 2012, member states requested that WHO  present a draft policy document on its engagement with nongovernmental  organizations to the Executive Board in January 2013. WHO also plans to  hold a series of structured consultations concerning its relationship with  private commercial entities and to develop a draft policy document on its  guidelines for interacting with private entities to be presented to the  Executive Board in May 2013.", "WHO concerns in the area of global health governance also include a  concern that, in light of the growing expansion of the number of global  health initiatives and partnerships, a number of global health  organizations have overlapping roles and responsibilities. For example,  WHO recognizes a need to delineate the roles and responsibilities  between itself; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;  and the GAVI Alliance, particularly in the area of providing technical  assistance at the country level. WHO is involved in several formally  structured partnerships, some hosted by WHO and others by independent  entities that include WHO as part of their governing bodies.

According to WHO, the provision of stronger and more effective  support to countries is a key outcome of its management reforms. At the  November 2011 special session of the Executive Board, the Board  approved WHO\u2019s management reform proposals in several areas and  requested the development of proposals in other areas. To improve the  predictability and flexibility of its financing, WHO proposed setting up a  dialogue with donors after the approval of its program budget by the  World Health Assembly, followed by a financing dialogue in which donors  publicly make funding commitments that are aligned with the budget. To  improve its human resource policies and practices, WHO proposed the  development of a revised workforce model and contract types;  streamlined recruitment and selection processes; improved performance  management processes; a staff mobility and rotation framework; and  enhanced staff development and learning opportunities. To strengthen  WHO\u2019s accountability, and transparency systems, WHO proposed a  strengthened internal control framework and conflict of interest policy;  increased capacity of its audit and oversight office; improved monitoring  and reporting; and the establishment of an information disclosure policy  and an ethics office. WHO has begun implementing some of its  management reform proposals. For example, according to WHO, it took  steps to strengthen the staffing of its internal audit and oversight office  and developed a draft formal evaluation policy for consideration and  approval by the WHO Executive Board.

For example, to improve WHO\u2019s  human resources practices, WHO set a 1-year milestone of conducting  regular reviews of its staffing levels and a 3-year milestone of  comprehensively integrating its human resources planning into its  program planning and budgeting processes. WHO\u2019s intended result for  these efforts is staffing that is more closely matched to needs at all levels  of the organization.

According  to State officials, the United States encouraged the reestablishment of an  independent audit committee for WHO. The previous audit committee  was disbanded in 2005 amid concerns about its effectiveness, and a  revamped audit committee was established in 2009. Officials also noted  that State supports WHO in establishing a dedicated ethics office, which  is currently under consideration as part of the proposed reforms.

State officials at the mission carry  out the assessments, either by completing the tool themselves, or  providing it to the UN organization to complete. For example, State  officials at the mission can collect information to complete the  assessment by interviewing officials from the UN agency, such as  representatives of an ethics or management office. In some cases, the  UNTAI assessment tool is provided to UN agency representatives as a  self-assessment exercise. According to State officials, the mission vets  the completed assessments and sends them to Washington for review.  For example, the most recent UNTAI assessment for WHO, covering  fiscal year 2011, was completed by WHO representatives and verified by  officials from USUN-Geneva and State in Washington, D.C.", "According to State officials, State has provided some general guidelines  for completing UNTAI assessments to State officials at the mission in  addition to providing technical and agency-specific advice on an as- needed basis. State provided information on the UNTAI goals and  benchmarks through cables to officials in the field in 2008 and 2011.  State officials noted that questions about the assessment tool are  answered through correspondence between the missions and State in  Washington. In addition, some State officials at the mission choose to  provide additional information with the assessment; however, State does  not require that supporting documentation accompany the assessments.  State officials at the mission completing the assessments are asked to  defend the assigned ratings to State officials in Washington and make an  evidence-based case for the assigned scores.

State officials also noted that the process of reviewing the UNTAI reports  in Washington helps to minimize errors, omissions, and inconsistencies,  but that this process does not fully mitigate risks to data reliability. State  officials mentioned that they are considering distributing a list of  frequently asked questions to officers in the field to aid in completing the  assessment in the upcoming fiscal year. In addition, State officials we  spoke with stated that the UNTAI tool was updated for 2011 and that they  recognize that areas for improvement and clarification may still exist, as  they often do with surveys and data collection instruments.

In reviewing State\u2019s WHO UNTAI assessment, we could not  find support for State\u2019s scoring on 14 of 50 benchmarks. For example, we  could not find support for State\u2019s determination that WHO\u2019s evaluation  and management functions are autonomous. The comments submitted  with the UNTAI assessment stated that most evaluation is decentralized  and commissioned under individual technical areas. Therefore, the  evaluation function is not functionally separate at an organizational level  from those responsible for the design and implementation of the  programs and operations evaluated, as specified in the UNTAI  benchmarks. In addition, State\u2019s WHO UNTAI assessment concluded that  WHO consistently and objectively applied its policy on program support  costs, which was approved by the member states; however, this policy  does not appear to be consistently applied. The program support cost  policy requires that 13 percent of all voluntary funding contributions are  allocated to reimburse WHO for administering projects of voluntarily  funded programs. However, according to WHO officials, many donors  negotiate a program support charge averaging around 7 percent, rather  than the standard rate of 13 percent, for their voluntary contributions.", "We also found that State\u2019s definitions of certain benchmarks used in  State\u2019s UNTAI tool were unclear and may lead to data reliability concerns.  We analyzed State\u2019s UNTAI tool to assess whether the tool is likely to  gather accurate and consistent data. We found that 15 of 50 benchmarks  in the UNTAI assessment tool required the judgment of the reviewer, due  to the subject matter expertise required to complete the assessment, the  lack of clarity on the benchmark definitions, or both. Certain benchmarks  require an understanding of specific subject areas to accurately  determine whether the benchmark has been met, and not all State  officials completing the assessments have the required expertise in each  area to make an accurate judgment. For example, the benchmark  indicating whether or not the organization has an independent,  transparent, effective, and fair bid protest process requires some  knowledge related to acquisition and procurement rules to make such a  determination. In addition, certain benchmarks use ambiguous or  indefinite terminology, requiring the assessor to define the meaning of the  terms before they can assess whether the benchmark has been met. For  example, the determination of whether the organization has adequate  staff and financial resources allocated to the evaluation function requires  some judgment about the definition of adequate in this context. The  UNTAI tool does not provide sufficient guidance to reviewers to assist in  making these judgments and does not require documentation from the  assessor to explain how such a judgment was made.

Of the  remaining 15 benchmarks, 5 (10 percent) require both definitional  judgment and subject matter expertise to be assessed, 4 (8 percent)  require subject matter expertise, and 6 (12 percent) require definitional  judgment, which may affect the accuracy and consistency of the results  for those benchmarks.", "Of the nine benchmarks where subject matter expertise was required, we  found knowledge would be needed in five relevant areas to complete the  assessment: training and development, acquisitions and procurement,  UN policies and practices, auditing and evaluation, and accounting  standards. The accuracy and consistency of the individual determinations  will depend, in part, on the assessors\u2019 expertise in these five areas, and  on their definitional judgment relative to other assessors. For example,  one benchmark asks whether \u201cfunding arrangements facilitate effective  and independent evaluations of the organization\u2019s activities.\u201d This  benchmark requires subject matter expertise related to auditing and  evaluation and definitional judgment about effectiveness to accurately  assess the relevant UN agency. This judgment creates the potential that  two assessors with different levels of subject matter expertise and who  apply different definitional judgments could rate the same program  differently. The potential variation in judgment and knowledge of the  assessor could make the overall score of the UN agency vary from 2 to 5  points on UNTAI\u2019s 5-point scale. Guidance on how to assess each of  these benchmarks would serve to mitigate the need for judgment and  reduce the risk of inconsistency in the assessments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We recognize that some officers in the field completing the assessment  may benefit from the expertise of those in the Bureau of International  Organization Affairs. However, we maintain that the UNTAI tool does not  provide sufficient guidance to reviewers to assist in making these  judgments and that this could lead to potential data reliability concerns.  Furthermore, according to an official at USUN-Geneva, improved  guidance would be welcome and would help officials in the field complete  the assessment tool.  2.
