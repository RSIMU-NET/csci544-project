To receive such payments, providers must meet both (1) eligibility requirements that specify the types of providers eligible to participate in the programs and (2) reporting requirements that specify the information providers must report to CMS or the states, including measures that demonstrate meaningful use of an EHR system and measures of clinical quality. For the Medicare EHR program, CMS has implemented prepayment processes to verify whether providers have met all of the eligibility requirements and one of the reporting requirements. Beginning in 2012, the agency also has plans to implement a risk-based audit strategy to verify on a postpayment basis that a sample of providers met the remaining reporting requirements. For the Medicaid EHR Program, the four states GAO reviewed have implemented primarily prepayment processes to verify whether providers met all eligibility requirements. To verify the reporting requirement, all four states implemented prepayment processes, postpayment processes, or both. CMS officials stated that the agency intends to evaluate how effectively its Medicare EHR program audit strategy reduces the risk of improper EHR incentive payments, though the agency has not yet established corresponding timelines for doing this work. Such an evaluation could help CMS determine whether it should revise its verification processes by, for example, implementing additional prepayment processes, which GAO has shown may reduce the risk of improper payments. In addition, CMS has opportunities to improve the efficiency of verification processes by, for example, collecting certain data on states\u0092 behalf.", "CMS allows providers to exempt themselves from reporting certain measures if providers report that the measures are not relevant to their patients or practices. Measures calculated based on few patients may be statistically unreliable, which limits their usefulness as tools for quality improvement.

Historically, patient health  information has been scattered across paper records kept by many  different providers in many different locations. When this occurs, health  care professionals may lack ready access to critical information needed to  make the most informed decisions on treatment options, potentially  putting the patient\u2019s health at risk or leading to inappropriate or duplicative  tests and procedures that increase health care spending. To help address  these issues, EHRs can be used, for example, to electronically collect,  store, retrieve, and transfer clinical information related to patients\u2019 care,  allowing ready access to this information by multiple providers in different  locations.

The largest of these  activities, in terms of potential federal expenditures, are the Medicare and  Medicaid EHR programs. These programs aim to increase the  meaningful use of EHR technology by providing incentive payments and,  later, penalties for providers\u2014that is, certain hospitals and professionals,  such as physicians and nurse practitioners, who participate in Medicare  or Medicaid. To receive incentive payments under the EHR programs,  providers must meet two types of requirements: (1) eligibility  requirements that specify the types of providers eligible to participate in  the programs and (2) reporting requirements that specify the information  providers must report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), an agency within HHS, or the states to demonstrate that they  have adopted or meaningfully used the EHR technology. For example, in  2011, Medicare professionals had to report 20 meaningful use measures  to CMS which encompass a variety of activities related to the delivery of  health care and encourage providers to consistently capture information  in their EHR systems, such as patient demographics and clinical  conditions. In contrast, during the first year professionals participate in the  Medicaid EHR program, they need only report having adopted,  implemented, or upgraded to a certified EHR system. However, in  subsequent years, Medicaid professionals will have to report on  meaningful use measures.", "The Congressional Budget Office estimated total spending for the  Medicare and Medicaid EHR programs to be $30 billion from 2011, the  year incentive payments began, through 2019.

As a result, the  programs have the potential to affect the millions of people who receive  care through Medicare or Medicaid. Since the programs began in 2011,  CMS has issued $3.1 billion in incentive payments to providers. As a new  program with particular complexities\u2014such as the number and types of  measures providers must report\u2014there are risks to program integrity, and  CMS could take steps, beyond those already taken, to assess and  mitigate the risk of improper payments and to improve program efficiency.  It is encouraging that CMS has awarded contracts to evaluate states\u2019  implementation of the Medicaid EHR program, including their efforts to  prevent improper payments. However, CMS, while planning to assess its  audit strategy for the Medicare EHR program, has not yet specified time  frames for implementing this assessment. As CMS moves forward, it is  important that the agency assess whether verifying additional reporting  requirements on a prepayment basis could improve the integrity of the  Medicare EHR program. Conducting prepayment verifications may be  more effective in minimizing improper payments because CMS\u2019s planned  postpayment audits will be conducted for only a small sample of  providers, whereas CMS\u2019s prepayment verification processes are  conducted for all providers that apply for incentive payments. In addition,  prepayment verifications help to avoid the difficulties associated with the  \u201cpay and chase\u201d aspects of recovering improper payments.", "We identified two opportunities for CMS to improve the efficiencies of the  Medicare and Medicaid EHR programs. First, CMS identified and took  action to improve the efficiency of audits under the Medicaid EHR  program but did not take a similar action in the Medicare EHR program.  Specifically, although CMS suggested that states collect additional  information from providers at the time of attestation to improve the  efficiency of the postpayment audit process, CMS has not done so for the  Medicare EHR program, but acknowledged that this action would be  beneficial. Doing so would improve the efficiency of the postpayment  audit process for the Medicare EHR program. Second, CMS could offer  states the option of having CMS collect Medicaid providers\u2019 meaningful  use attestations on their behalf rather than requiring states to collect this  information on their own. CMS, by offering to collect this information from  all Medicaid providers on behalf of states, as the agency currently does  for some Medicaid providers, could alleviate the need for many states to  create and maintain similar web-based attestation tools and could  potentially yield cost savings at both the federal and state levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of processes to verify  whether providers meet program requirements for the Medicare and  Medicaid EHR programs, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS  take the following four actions:", "Establish time frames for expeditiously implementing an evaluation of  the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s audit strategy for the Medicare EHR  program.", "Evaluate the extent to which the agency should conduct more  verifications on a prepayment basis when determining whether  providers meet Medicare EHR program\u2019s reporting requirements.", "Collect the additional information from Medicare providers during  attestation that CMS suggested states collect from Medicaid providers  during attestation.", "Offer states the option of having CMS collect meaningful use  attestations from Medicaid providers on their behalf."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment. In its written  comments (reproduced in app. V), HHS concurred with three of our  recommendations to CMS. Specifically, we are encouraged that HHS said  that to help implement these recommendations, CMS will evaluate the  effectiveness of the audit strategy for the Medicare EHR program on an  ongoing basis and document results quarterly, beginning approximately   3 months after the audits begin. In addition, CMS will evaluate the  feasibility of conducting additional prepayment verifications under the  Medicare EHR program. Further, CMS will explore collecting additional  information from Medicare providers during attestation that CMS has  suggested that states collect under the Medicaid EHR program.", "HHS disagreed with our fourth recommendation that CMS offer to collect  meaningful use attestations data from Medicaid providers on behalf of the  states, citing two reasons. First, HHS does not believe there are  significant barriers to states implementing attestation tools. It stated that  the 43 states participating in the Medicaid EHR program have established  a means for providers to attest to eligibility requirements and the  adoption, implementation, or upgrade of their EHR. In HHS\u2019s view,  incorporating the meaningful use attestations tools into the states\u2019 existing  systems does not pose a barrier in part because HHS says CMS has  taken steps to help the states design their attestation tools and has  approved designs developed by vendors that the states can use. Second,  HHS does not believe that implementing this recommendation would  create a streamlined attestation process for Medicaid providers. It states  that Medicaid providers would have to provide certain information to CMS  and other information to the states, requiring providers to submit data to  multiple sites. HHS believes this change could result in confusion and  payment delays. In addition, HHS believes a more compelling challenge  is designing a way for providers to report clinical quality measures  electronically from their EHRs to the states and CMS. HHS stated that  CMS established pilots that are intended to help providers leverage  existing infrastructure to electronically exchange data on clinical quality  measures directly from their EHRs to CMS.", "Despite HHS\u2019s objections, we continue to believe that our  recommendation should be implemented. In response to HHS\u2019s first  reason, we believe that while some states have created tools to collect  Medicaid attestation data, over the long run implementing our  recommendation could improve the efficiency of the Medicaid EHR  program and thereby minimize additional administrative costs, especially  in the program\u2019s future years. Currently, both CMS and states create and  maintain meaningful use attestation tools. The Medicaid EHR program  requirements in the second year of the program and through the rest of  the decade will become increasingly similar to the requirements for the  Medicare EHR program as will the information collected from providers by  the states and CMS. Having both CMS and states design and maintain  systems to collect much of the same information is inefficient. Further, it is  expected that in future years, to demonstrate meaningful use, Medicare  and Medicaid providers will be required to report additional information,  and both CMS and the states will need to expend resources to update the  attestation tools used to collect this information, a point we clarified in our  report. By collecting meaningful use attestations on behalf of some states  and U.S. insular areas, CMS could help ensure effective use of the   $300 million that Congress provided for administrative costs of the  Medicaid EHR program from 2009-2016.", "In response to HHS\u2019s second reason, the report notes that under the  current process for registering for the Medicaid EHR program, providers  must already submit information on eligibility to both CMS and the states.  Therefore, providers are familiar with submitting information to multiple  sites. Furthermore, CMS currently collects meaningful use attestations for  some Medicaid providers and has not reported that the transfer of this  information to the states has delayed payments.", "We agree with CMS that designing a means to electronically transmit  meaningful use information, including clinical quality measures, directly  from providers\u2019 EHRs to CMS and the states may present challenges. It is  encouraging that the agency is attentive to electronic data exchange  issues and is working with providers in the Medicare program to identify  ways to leverage existing infrastructure to accomplish this goal. However,  it is important for CMS to consider all approaches, including collecting  meaningful use data on behalf of states, to ensure the Medicare and  Medicaid EHR programs are administered as efficiently as possible.", "As part of HHS\u2019s written response, the department also provided other  general comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, the Administrator of CMS, the National Coordinator for  Health Information Technology, and other interested parties.

In contrast, the data we analyzed for professionals did not include  full-year information because CMS permitted them to submit these data  through February 29, 2012, to receive a Medicare EHR incentive payment  for 2011. We included all hospitals and professionals that, according to  data from CMS\u2019s National Level Repository, had successfully  demonstrated meaningful use even though some of those providers had  not received Medicare EHR program incentive payments from CMS as of  December 8, 2011.", "As a result, the data we analyzed for hospitals included full-year  Specifically, we analyzed meaningful use and clinical quality measures  providers reported to CMS and which we obtained from CMS\u2019s National  Level Repository to identify the following:", "Frequency of measures reported.

Six measures allow  professionals to claim exemptions and three measures allow hospitals  to claim exemptions if, according to the providers, those measures are  not relevant to their patient populations or clinical practices.", "Extent to which providers claimed allowable exemptions from  reporting certain mandatory measures. We determined the  percentage of providers that claimed an exemption from reporting at  least one mandatory meaningful use measure. As part of this  analysis, we examined whether a greater percentage of certain types  of providers reported at least one exemption compared to other types  of providers.", "Extent to which providers had patients who could be included in the  calculation of clinical quality measures. We examined the extent to  which providers had few patients who could be included in the  calculation of at least one clinical quality measure. Measures that  capture a small number of patients may be unreliable measures of  quality because relatively small changes in the number of patients  who experienced the care processes or outcomes targeted by the  measure can generate large shifts in the calculated percentage for the  measure. CMS has recognized in other programs that including a  small number of patients in the calculation of a measure is a reliability  issue. For example, on the agency\u2019s Hospital Compare website, which  publicly reports clinical quality measures by hospital, CMS indicates  whether the number of patients included in a particular measure  calculation was based on less than 25 patients and thus too small to  reliably tell how well the hospital was performing. For our analysis, we  identified clinical quality measures as unreliable if fewer than   seven patients met inclusion criteria for the calculation. The reporting  period for the first year a provider demonstrates meaningful use is any   90 consecutive days during the year; for subsequent years, the  reporting period is the full year. Assuming a steady patient population,  providers that had fewer than seven patients meet inclusion criteria for  calculating clinical quality measures during the 90-day reporting  period would have fewer than 25 patients meet these criteria during  the full-year reporting period. As part of this analysis, we examined  whether a greater percentage of certain types of providers reported at  least one clinical quality measure based on few patients compared to  other types of providers.", "We also analyzed other data sources to determine whether the reporting  of meaningful use and clinical quality measures varied based on  providers\u2019 characteristics, such as whether critical access hospitals were  more likely than acute care hospitals to claim an exemption from reporting  at least one mandatory meaningful use measure.
