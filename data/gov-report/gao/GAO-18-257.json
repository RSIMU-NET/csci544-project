Instead, officials from these agencies said they typically identified unneeded property as a result of a \u201ctriggering event,\u201d such as an office space reduction. Executive agencies are required by law to continuously review property under their control to identify unneeded personal property and then dispose of it promptly. Without such policies or processes, agencies may not be routinely identifying unneeded property that could be used elsewhere, and efforts to maximize federal personal property use and minimize unnecessary storage costs may not be effective. GSA has issued regulations establishing a government-wide disposal process for unneeded personal property. However, according to GSA officials, the agency lacks the authority to promulgate regulations or formal guidance on management of in-use agency property, and there is no government-wide guidance to agencies on identifying unneeded personal property. Agencies are required to have internal control activities\u2014such as policies and procedures\u2014for reasonable assurance of efficient operations and minimal resource waste, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to agencies on implementing such activities. Guidance from OMB that emphasizes agencies' internal control responsibilities could help ensure that agencies are proactively and regularly identifying property that is no longer needed.", "The selected agencies reported little difficulty in following GSA's personal property disposal process, reporting over 37,000 items as unneeded property in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. This property was disposed of through transfers to other agencies, donations to authorized recipients, sales, or discarding. When disposing of personal property from space reduction projects at locations GAO visited, agencies also reported using GSA's process (see figure). Overall, agencies said they have not experienced major challenges with disposing of personal property from space reduction efforts. This lack of challenges could be because projects are geographically dispersed and spread over several years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies' policies or processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and identify unneeded personal property.

In fiscal year 2016, federal civilian  agencies reported $206 billion in personal property assets, but the actual  amount owned is considerably higher. Each year, agencies identify  thousands of items that are no longer needed, or \u201cexcess.\u201d  In some  cases, this classification is because the items are broken and cannot be  repaired, or obsolete; however, many items are in good working order but  are no longer needed to meet agencies\u2019 missions. Because this property  was originally purchased with federal funds and represents a significant  investment, the government seeks to promote its reuse by other federal  agencies, to minimize new procurement costs, and by non-federal  entities, in order to maximize the property\u2019s public benefit. The General  Services Administration (GSA) plays a central role in the process of  reusing and disposing of excess property and has issued regulations  which govern agencies\u2019 personal property disposal. In fiscal year 2016,  agencies reported disposing of more than 160,000 items (with an original  acquisition cost reported at nearly $2 billion in nominal dollars) using  GSA\u2019s disposal process. However, reports that we and others have  previously issued have shown that this process is not always effective in  maximizing use of property because, for example, agencies have retained  property that they no longer need and that others could have used.  Furthermore, government-wide space reduction initiatives\u2014such as  Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint\u2014have encouraged  agencies to reduce their domestic office and warehouse space and could  have implications for how agencies identify and dispose of unneeded  personal property. As agencies reduce office and warehouse space, they  will also likely have to make arrangements for the personal property  inside these spaces.", "You asked us to review agency processes for managing and disposing of  federal personal property, including preparations to address excess  personal property resulting from space reduction efforts. This report  examines (1) how selected federal agencies assess whether personal  property is needed and (2) how selected federal agencies dispose of  unneeded personal property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts  have affected these disposals.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed applicable federal statutes,  regulations, and guidance regarding personal property management; our  prior work; and reports by other federal agencies\u2019 offices of inspectors  general on personal property issues. In addition, to determine how  selected federal agencies assess whether personal property is needed,  we selected five federal agencies and reviewed pertinent agency  documents, such as personal property policies, and interviewed agency  officials about their processes for managing personal property assets,  such as their inventory procedures and asset management systems.  These agencies are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the  Forest Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), GSA\u2019s  Office of Administrative Services (GSA OAS), the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  within the Department of the Treasury. In order to select agencies that  were more likely to have relevant, recent experience with excess personal  property from space reduction efforts, we ranked the 23 non-Defense  agencies based on their Freeze the Footprint square footage reduction  results, Reduce the Footprint space reductions goals, and the amount of  declared excess personal property over the last 5 years, and eliminated  the bottom third of the agencies. We selected GSA as our first agency  due to its central role in personal property disposal and randomly selected  four additional agencies from the remaining agencies. The information we  obtained from these agencies about their personal property management  is not generalizable to all federal agencies. We compared existing federal  guidance related to personal property management and the selected  agencies\u2019 policies and processes with federal internal control standards  related to designing control activities. We also conducted literature  searches to identify best practices in personal property or asset  management. To identify criteria and examples of a formal process for  assessing property for continued need, we reviewed federal regulations  and agency policies on personal property management from the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) based on our prior work.  We also interviewed GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy (GSA  OGP) officials and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff to  discuss regulations and policies pertaining to personal property and their  role in personal property management.", "To determine how selected federal agencies dispose of excess and  surplus personal property and how, if at all, space reduction efforts have  affected disposals, in addition to the above, we conducted site visits to a  non-generalizable selection of 2 locations\u2014Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,  and Denver, Colorado\u2014to meet with regional and local officials from each  of our agencies responsible for managing and disposing of excess  personal property. We selected locations that had the highest number of  our selected federal agencies present, the largest amount of personal  property declared as excess, and space reduction projects. We discussed  any impacts space reductions had on excess property and requested  supporting documentation on the amount of property declared as excess  and the disposition outcomes of that property. We did not independently  verify the information that was provided because data reported as excess  from space reduction projects is not always tracked separately from other  property disposed of for other purposes. We also reviewed documents  and interviewed officials from GSA\u2019s Office of Personal Property  Management (GSA OPPM) in GSA\u2019s headquarters, in Philadelphia, and  in Fort Worth, Texas. The GSA OPPM offices in these two cities have  responsibility over the locations we selected to visit. We did not assess  agencies\u2019 inventory processes and generally excluded certain types of  personal property, such as aircraft and vehicles, from our review because  we have reviewed or are reviewing these types of property in prior or  ongoing work.

See figure 1 for examples of federal  personal property.", "Federal agencies manage personal property while they are using it.  Specifically, executive agencies are required by law to: maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for  property under their control;   continually survey property under their control to identify excess; promptly report excess property to GSA and dispose of it in  accordance with GSA regulations; and use existing agency property or obtain excess property from other  federal agencies before purchasing new property.", "GSA assists agencies when they no longer need personal property and  has established a government-wide personal-property disposal process in  federal regulation. The process generally begins when an agency  declares a personal property item as \u201cexcess\u201d\u2014that is, the agency  determines it no longer needs the item to carry out its mission. Agencies  are to make this determination only after ensuring the property is not  needed elsewhere within the agency. Once property is declared excess,  there are four potential property disposal methods: transfer to another  federal agency or certain non-federal entities, donation, sale, and  abandonment or destruction. Federal agencies and some non-federal  entities have the priority to acquire excess property, through transfer. If  none of these eligible entities have requested the property for transfer  after 21 days, the property becomes \u201csurplus\u201d\u2014that is, GSA determines  that federal agencies no longer need the item to carry out their missions.  Surplus property may be donated to eligible entities through a State  Agency for Surplus Property, representing the state of the prospective  donee. Property not donated within 5 days after the close of the 21-day  screening period may be sold to the general public and, finally, unsold  property may be abandoned or destroyed. See appendix II for an  expanded description of the personal property disposal process.", "OMB is responsible for establishing government-wide management  policies and requirements and provides guidance to agencies to  implement them. OMB has issued guidance for specific types of personal  property, such as for government aircraft and information technology  systems. OMB also implemented the Freeze the Footprint and Reduce  the Footprint initiatives, starting in 2012, to reduce the amount of  domestic office and warehouse space needed by the federal government,  in part, through consolidations and improved space utilization. As a result,  federal agencies have reported achieving space reductions, and they  have goals for additional reductions in the future. Although these  reductions are a relatively small part of the federal government\u2019s overall  footprint, according to OMB, through this and other efforts agencies  collectively reduced their office and warehouse space by about 25 million  square feet from fiscal years 2012 through 20156.

Four of the five selected agencies\u2019 policies do not require  property custodians or other property users to assess property for  continued need. Furthermore, these four agencies\u2019 policies did not have  specific criteria for the property custodian or user to assess property for  continued need. Only IRS\u2019s personal-property management policy  specifies that the property custodian is responsible for identifying excess  property and provides criteria to be applied in doing so, such as whether  property is still needed in its location and the feasibility of transferring it to  other locations, taking into account the property\u2019s condition and  transportation charges. An official at one of the selected agencies  identified several specific criteria that should be used to assess property  for continued need, including the item\u2019s serviceability, whether it poses a  safety hazard, and the feasibility of relocating it. However, the official  acknowledged that these or any other criteria are not part of the agency\u2019s  formal policy.", "The personal property policy of an agency not included in our review\u2014 NASA\u2014includes requirements and criteria to review NASA property for  continued need in multiple ways. For example, it requires a high-level  NASA official to conduct a walk-through inspection annually to identify  idle or underused equipment that is no longer needed and report it as  excess. It also requires, as part of an annual property inventory, that  property that appears to be excess, worn out, or in obvious need of repair  be noted as such and that guidance on identifying unneeded property be  provided to personnel involved in conducting the inventories as well as  employees assigned to use the property.", "In addition to not having policies on identifying and assessing property for  continued need, agencies we reviewed also did not have a systematic  process for doing so. Instead, when describing situations in which they  declared property as excess, officials said they typically did so as a result  of a \u201ctriggering event.\u201d The types of triggering events the officials cited  include an office move or consolidation or a lifecycle replacement of  laptops. For example, officials from field locations of three of these  agencies reported declaring most of their existing furniture as excess as  the result of an office relocation or renovation. Agency officials said they  were unable to use their existing furniture and had to declare it excess  because it did not conform to new space utilization standards. At  another agency, officials were disposing of a large number of laptop  computers that had been declared excess because they had been  replaced by new computers. Officials at two agencies said an assessment  of property for continued need is an assumed practice that is part of the  inventory for accountable property. However, an official from one of these  agencies acknowledged that assessing need is not addressed in the  written instructions provided to those conducting the inventory. Officials  from two other agencies acknowledged that they continue to retain  unneeded property that should be declared excess in storage on-site but  had not pursued disposal due to other competing responsibilities with  higher priorities.", "Proactively assessing personal property for continued need instead of  responding to a triggering event can help agencies achieve both effective  and efficient operations by ensuring that only needed property is retained  and unneeded property is identified and declared excess. Federal internal  control standards require that agencies design and maintain internal  control activities\u2014such as policies and procedures\u2014to identify risks  arising from mission and mission-support operations, and to provide  reasonable assurance that agencies are operating in an efficient manner  that minimizes the waste of resources. Such a system also provides  reasonable assurance that agency property is safeguarded against  waste, loss, or unauthorized use. OMB staff and GSA officials agreed that  assessing all types of property\u2014accountable and non-accountable\u2014for  continued need is important and called-for by internal control standards.  Because the agencies we reviewed did not have systematic processes for  assessing the continued need for personal property, they may not be  aware of potential risks of maintaining property that may no longer be  needed for operational purposes.", "Furthermore, previous work others have performed has shown that  inaction on unneeded or idle property can limit efficient use of the  government\u2019s personal property, unnecessarily use an agency\u2019s  resources, or miss opportunities for potential cost savings, for example:", "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General found that  the U.S. Coast Guard could not ensure that personal property was  efficiently reutilized or properly disposed of to prevent unauthorized  use or theft because the Coast Guard did not have adequate policies,  procedures, and processes to identify and screen, reutilize, and  dispose of excess personal property properly, including criteria for  identifying such property.", "The EPA\u2019s Inspector General estimated EPA could save $8.9 million  in reduced warehouse costs through improved management of stored  personal property.", "GSA personal property asset management studies conducted in 2003  and 2005 found, among other things, that personal property is not  being used to its fullest extent in some agencies and that no  government-wide usage assessment or standard exists to detect  whether property is no longer needed and can be reported as  excess.", "Without a triggering event, agencies may not be seeking out or identifying  property that is no longer needed and declaring it excess as often as they  should. Such unneeded property may be put to better use elsewhere  within the agency or the federal government, or agencies may purchase  or lease new property instead of using another agency\u2019s property that is  unneeded but not reported as excess. In addition, agencies may be  missing opportunities to realize cost savings by identifying and disposing  of unneeded property, such as property stored in warehouses, to reduce  or make better use of that space.", "While the requirements for agencies to continually survey property under  their control to identify excess is established in law, according to GSA  officials, there are no government-wide regulations on managing personal  property or fulfilling this specific requirement. According to GSA OGP officials, GSA does not have the authority to promulgate regulations or  issue formal guidance on personal property that is in use by executive  agencies. Furthermore, according to the officials, GSA is only authorized  by law to prescribe regulations on excess and surplus personal property.  OMB staff stated that they could issue a notification, such as a controller  alert to agencies\u2019 chief financial officers, to reinforce the statutory  requirement that agencies conduct assessments of personal property for  continued need. OMB periodically issues such alerts to highlight  emerging financial management issues for agencies and also issues  guidance to agencies through bulletins, circulars, and memorandums. By  issuing a controller alert or other guidance, OMB can help ensure that  agencies are proactively taking steps to evaluate their property for  continued need, including developing appropriate policies for doing so,  and can thereby improve efforts to promote maximum use of excess  personal property."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Used GSA\u2019s Disposal Process to Dispose of Unneeded Property, Including Property from Space Reductions Selected Agencies Used a Structured Disposal Process for Personal Property", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the five agencies we reviewed reported that they followed  GSA\u2019s automated process to dispose of property once they had made the  determination it was no longer needed to support their agency\u2019s mission.  As previously described, GSA regulations on disposing of property  establish a specific process for all executive agencies to follow, and GSA  has also issued guidance to help agencies dispose of property under this  process. In particular, once an agency has determined that the property it  has is no longer needed within the agency, the agency is required to  promptly report the property to GSA as excess, typically by entering  information about it into GSAXcess, GSA\u2019s web-based system for  facilitating personal property disposal. This method requires agency  employees to manually enter information using data entry screens that  include help screens and error messages. GSA encourages agencies to  provide a complete description of the property and to include multiple  photographs of it. Officials from the five agencies we reviewed reported  no significant difficulties with entering information into GSAXcess;  collectively, these agencies reported over 37,000 items as excess  property from fiscal year 2012 through 2016. Figure 2 indicates the  number of items each selected agency reported to GSA as excess during  that period.", "Once information entry is completed, the disposal process begins. If the  property is not disposed of during one stage, it advances to the next  stage. The disposal process is shown in figure 3.", "Agency officials we interviewed told us that responsibility for disposing of  property is decentralized and typically occurs at the property\u2019s location,  whether at an agency headquarters, regional office, or lower level.  Because of the large federal government presence in the Washington,  D.C., area, agency offices in that area may have access to resources to  facilitate the disposal process that are unavailable elsewhere, such as  transferring excess property to certain entities that complete some or all  aspects of the disposal process for a fee. Two such entities are GSA\u2019s  Personal Property Center in Springfield, Virginia, which takes full  accountability and control of an agency\u2019s excess property for a fee and  handles all the details of the disposal process, and USDA\u2019s Centralized  Excess Property Operation in Beltsville, Maryland. According to USDA\u2019s  Agriculture Property Management Regulations, property not needed by  USDA or its bureau offices in the Washington, D.C., area must be  transferred to this office for final disposal actions. It also provides these  same services to some non-USDA agencies.", "Agencies also use GSAXcess to search for and select available excess  property. Agency officials told us that the system also sends disposition  instructions to the property-holding agency, when the property is to be  transferred to other federal agencies, donated, or sold and that the  agencies follow these instructions. For example, when an agency  requests an excess item in GSAXcess and GSA approves the request,  the system notifies the requesting agency and the property-holding  agency and provides contact information to arrange to complete the  transaction. None of the selected agency officials reported difficulties  completing a transfer or donation transaction. For property not  transferred, donated, or sold, GSA notifies the agency that the property  has no commercial value and can be abandoned or destroyed. All of our  selected agencies reported trying to recycle such property."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Reported Little Difficulty Disposing of Personal Property from Space Reduction Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Selected agency officials told us they disposed of property from space  reduction efforts, such as Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint,  the same way as other personal property\u2014using GSA\u2019s disposal process.  To meet space reduction goals, selected agencies are undertaking  projects at dozens of locations. Projects have primarily involved leased  space for offices and warehouses and have included office moves,  consolidations, and closures.", "As federal agencies carry out these space reduction projects, they must  also address any personal property in the project spaces. Selected  agencies reported several factors that affected their decisions about this  property, which for three of the agencies was primarily office furniture.  Four agencies reported needing less space than they previously occupied  because of changes in agency missions or staffing levels. Furthermore,   officials from GSA OAS and IRS noted that workplace trends, including  teleworking and decreased staffing, reduced the space needed. Finally,  agencies also reported that the office furniture itself was mostly  unsuitable because it was old and because it could not be configured for  use in more efficient office space designs. As a result, some selected  agency locations that completed an office move or renovation project  reported that most of their existing furniture was not needed in their new  space. For example, in its Reduce the Footprint plan for fiscal years 2017  through 2021, HUD noted that many of its locations were designed and  furnished when it had a much larger staffing level and reported that in  2016, its usable square feet per employee was 356. Subsequently, HUD  revised its space design standards, requiring future office spaces to  adhere to a utilization rate of 175 square feet or less. At the HUD project  we visited, an official told us the furniture in use before the project was old  and was generally too large to be used to achieve space design  standards.", "In 2017, Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) reduced its Denver regional office  space by 30 percent. HUD\u2019s lease was  expiring and it needed less space because it  had fewer employees in the office, in part due  to increased telework. Adhering to new space  utilization standards in its office and furniture  design further reduced HUD\u2019s overall required  space. An example of a new workstation is  shown above. Before the project, the agency  occupied about five floors of a commercial  building. HUD renovated in place, one floor at  a time, and replaced its existing office  furniture with new. Personal property at this  office included primarily office furniture, such  as desks and 25-year old modular systems,  and equipment, such as telephones. As each  floor was completed and employees moved to  new workstations, the property official on-site  disposed of their old furniture and  workstations by entering its information in  GSAXcess. The official reported selling some  of the excess furniture after completing the  first floor but recycled or discarded excess  furniture in subsequent rounds.", "In some cases, agencies did not dispose of all the personal property after  a space reduction project but instead were able to retain it for other uses  within the agency. For example, IRS officials reported closing an office in  Englewood, Colorado, and transferred its furniture to Ogden, Utah, for  storage for an upcoming project. GSA OAS officials in Denver said that  after a space reduction project in which GSA decreased the size of its  regional office, it retained the unneeded furniture and office space for  temporary use by other agencies. For property that was declared excess  following a space reduction project, agencies reported transferring,  donating, and selling property to dispose of it, using GSA\u2019s process. For  example, officials in GSA OAS, Forest Service, and IRS locations told us  they transferred some excess property to other federal agencies. The  Forest Service in Denver transferred some modular office furniture to the  Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Postal Service. The Forest  Service and IRS also reported donating property, such as office furniture  and equipment, through the State Agencies for Surplus Property program.  Four agencies reported selling some of their property from a space  reduction project. For example, HUD\u2019s regional office in Denver sold  some of its excess office furniture, which dated to 1992, and recycled or  discarded the remainder.", "When disposing of property from a space reduction project, some  agencies sought assistance from GSA. GSA\u2019s Office of Personal Property  Management (GSA OPPM) assists agencies, when requested, in  disposing of personal property, and officials at selected agency locations  reported receiving assistance and training. In one example, GSA  officials told us that a regional office of a selected agency needed to  dispose of an office full of furniture and, in addition to using the disposal  process, contacted GSA OPPM for additional assistance. Because of the  large amount of property, GSA OPPM took steps to make other agencies  in the area aware of the available property and facilitated access to allow  agencies to view the property. In another example, GSA OPPM officials  met with officials from another agency in the planning stages of a  relocation to answer questions and provided advice and guidance for  disposing of personal property.", "When the Forest Service\u2019s lease on its  Denver-area office expired, the agency leased  space in another location, requiring a move  but reducing its office by over 21,000 square  feet. The agency sought to conform to new  space utilization standards, which required  more efficiently-designed furniture than its  existing office furniture. Because the Forest  Service did not reuse most of its old furniture  in its new space, it no longer had a need for it.  The Forest Service retained some of the  furniture for use in other Forest Service offices  within the region and declared the remainder  as excess. Through GSAXcess, the Forest  Service transferred some of its excess  furniture to other federal agencies, such as  the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S.  Postal Service. The Forest Service sold some  furniture at auction; broken items were  recycled.", "Agencies may dispose of large amounts of property during a space  reduction project, but overall, agency officials reported few challenges in  doing so. This may be in part because any effects from space reductions  are distributed across an entire agency. Although selected agencies\u2019  average Reduce the Footprint space reduction goals ranged from 97,000  square feet to 662,000 square feet each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020,  each agency\u2019s efforts consisted of dozens of geographically dispersed  projects of various sizes to be completed over several years. For  example, as of fiscal year 2016, EPA had 21 space reduction projects  planned from fiscal years 2016 through 2021, with individual anticipated  reductions ranging from less than 1,000 square feet to more than 140,000  square feet. At least one project is present in 8 of EPA\u2019s 10 regions.  Agencies\u2019 ability to pay for space reduction projects may also have  affected these projects\u2019 effects. Two selected agencies said they delayed  projects because of a lack of funding. Agencies may reduce costs over  the long term because of lower rent for smaller spaces but they may have  to pay some expenses upfront, such as for moving, renovations, and new  furniture.", "Although officials from all five agencies told us they have been able to  manage personal property disposals from space reductions, they  identified factors that can impact the efficient use of the disposal process  during a space reduction project and some strategies taken to address  them:  Inventorying non-accountable property: As a space reduction project  commenced at a location, most selected agencies reported that they  did not have a complete list of the personal property affected by the  project. As previously described, selected agencies do not maintain  an itemized list of non-accountable personal property and for four  agencies, office furniture is generally non-accountable. During a  space reduction project, property personnel had to develop some type  of inventory to identify property that would be needed and property  that should be disposed of. Selected agencies had various methods  for conducting such an inventory. For example, officials from two  agencies said they walked through the affected space and created a  list of all the items. Officials from one agency said a contractor was  hired for this purpose. Most agencies reported using the inventory  they created to enter information on excess property into GSAXcess.  Officials at GSA\u2019s OPPM offices in Philadelphia and Fort Worth said  that they offer training and guidance to agencies in conducting  inventories.", "Managing disposals within time frames: Agencies generally are not  able to begin the disposal process until the property is no longer in  use. For example, agency staff continue to use their old workspaces  until they can move to new workspaces. Agencies also face  deadlines, such as vacating space due to a lease expiration or  commencement of renovation work. Officials from three agencies  described challenges completing the disposal process\u2014reporting  excess personal property as well as completing transactions to  transfer, donate, sell or abandon or destroy it\u2014within required time  frames. Some agency officials reported using different strategies to  address this timing challenge. For example, one agency official was  able to enter information about the excess property items into  GSAXcess while employees were still using them. According to the  official, this was possible because a note could be included in the  property item\u2019s description in GSAXcess, with the date when the  property would be available. When the property was no longer in-use  within the agency, the transfers or other transactions were completed.  Additionally, an agency may conduct an on-site screening of its  unneeded property to allow other federal agencies or authorized  parties to physically view and identify any furniture they want. For  example, GSA OPPM officials in Philadelphia conducted an on-site  screening of unneeded office furniture resulting from the agency\u2019s  regional office relocation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies collectively have billions of dollars\u2019 worth of personal  property, ranging from office furniture to highly specialized equipment  that, when in use, supports agency missions. However, the agencies in  our review did not have policies and systematic processes for identifying  unneeded property. Furthermore, other\u2019s previous work has shown that  agencies across the government may not be effectively assessing their  property for continued need, leading to idle property that could be put to  better use elsewhere within the agency or the federal government and  potential unnecessary storage costs. Consequently, agencies may be  retaining property that is no longer needed. GSA has recognized that  opportunities may exist for agencies to more effectively manage property  under their control, but according to GSA OGP officials, GSA\u2019s authority  is limited to agency property that has been declared excess or surplus.  According to OMB staff, OMB has the authority to issue guidance, such  as controller alerts, emphasizing agencies\u2019 property management  obligations, and thus, it is well-positioned to assist agencies to more  effectively manage their property and to ensure unneeded property is  made available to others, as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Director of OMB should provide guidance to executive agencies on  managing their personal property, emphasizing that agencies\u2019 policies or  processes should reflect the requirement to continuously review and  identify unneeded personal property.

We  excluded certain types of personal property, such as aircraft and vehicles,  from our review because of our prior or ongoing work. To address our  objectives, we reviewed applicable federal statutes and regulations  pertaining to personal property management and disposal, our prior work,  and reports by federal agencies\u2019 Offices of Inspector General on personal  property issues.", "In addition, to determine how selected federal agencies assess whether  personal property is needed, we conducted background searches to  inform our understanding of key practices for personal property and asset  management through a search of databases containing peer-reviewed  articles, government reports, general news, hearings and transcripts, and  association and think tank papers. We also reviewed relevant asset  management practices, such as ASTM standards and the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Asset Management Evaluation  and Personal Property Asset Management Study. In order to select  agencies that may have had recent experiences with excess personal  property, we selected 5 of the 24 agencies that were included in the  Freeze the Footprint and Reduce the Footprint initiatives.  We selected  agencies based on their overall Freeze the Footprint results, in terms of  the amount of square feet reduced, and Reduce the Footprint goals for  reducing domestic office and warehouse space, and the amount of  personal property declared excess over the last 5 years, as reported to  GSA\u2019s GSAXcess system from fiscal years 2012 to 2016, to coincide with  the Freeze the Footprint time frame. Specifically, we obtained  information on the Freeze the Footprint results and Reduce the Footprint  goals from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s public website and  from Performance.gov. We limited our scope to civilian federal agencies  with personal property within the United States. Although we have  previously reported that the overall accuracy of data that agencies  reported on office and warehouse space reductions could be improved,  we found that the data were generally reliable for our purposes. After  reviewing the data for any inconsistencies and discussing the information  with selected agency officials to ensure that the reported numbers for the  Reduce the Footprint initiative were current, we determined that the  quality of the data were sufficient for our use in selecting agencies. In  order to select agencies that were more likely to have relevant, recent  experience with excess personal property from space reduction efforts,  we ranked these agencies based on their Freeze the Footprint results,  Reduce the Footprint goals, and the amount of declared excess personal  property, and eliminated the bottom third of the agencies. We selected  GSA as our first agency due to its central role in excess personal property  disposal, and randomly selected four additional agencies from the  remaining agencies. These agencies were the Environmental Protection  Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing  and Urban Development, and the Department of the Treasury. The  organizational structure of two selected agencies, the Department of  Agriculture and the Department of the Treasury, is different than the other  three agencies in that they are comprised primarily of sub-agencies.  Therefore, we selected the largest sub-agency for both departments\u2014the  Forest Service within the Department of Agriculture and the Internal  Revenue Service within the Department of the Treasury.", "We obtained information from the five selected federal agencies on the  total value and number of items in their asset management systems in  2017 to understand the size and scope of personal property assets they  manage. As we used the information to describe the scope of the  agencies\u2019 property holdings, we did not verify the data. We also analyzed  documents, such as the selected agencies\u2019 personal property  management policies, along with policies from the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration and Department of Energy, to understand how  they addressed requirements for managing personal property. We  included these agencies\u2019 policies based on our review of prior work  related to personal property. We interviewed officials from the selected  agencies about their processes for managing personal property assets,  such as their inventory procedures. However, we did not independently  assess agencies\u2019 inventory practices. We also interviewed staff from the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to discuss regulations and  policies pertaining to personal property and OMB\u2019s role in personal  property management.", "To determine how selected federal agencies dispose of excess and  surplus personal property and how space reduction efforts may have  affected disposals, in addition to the above, we obtained information from  each selected agency on its space reduction projects and interviewed  officials about their roles and responsibilities in the agency\u2019s space  reduction planning efforts and personal property disposal process. We  also conducted site visits to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Denver,  Colorado to meet with regional and local officials from each selected  agency responsible for managing and disposing of personal property.  These locations were chosen based on the number of our selected  federal agencies present, the amount of excess personal property  declared, and the existence of space reduction projects. We discussed  property accountability policies, overall personal property disposal  processes, and how the disposal processes were affected by  government-wide space savings initiatives, such as Freeze the Footprint  and Reduce the Footprint, and any efforts to prepare for them, and  requested supporting documentation on the amount of property declared  as excess and the disposition outcomes of that property. We did not  independently verify the information that was provided, as data reported  as excess from space reduction projects are not always tracked  separately from other property disposed of for other reasons. We  reviewed documents and interviewed officials from GSA\u2019s Office of  Personal Property Management (GSA OPPM) in GSA\u2019s headquarters, in  Philadelphia and in Fort Worth, Texas, to discuss their role in assisting  agencies in disposing of personal property and to obtain their views on  how personal property disposals have been affected by space  reductions. Finally, we interviewed GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide  Policy (GSA OGP) officials about the Interagency Committee on Property  Management and the Property Management Executive Council  regarding their personal property and asset management efforts and met  with officials and representatives from the following: the U.S. Department  of Agriculture\u2019s Centralized Excess Property Operation, the Users and  Screeners Association\u2013Federal Excess Personal Property, and the  National Association of State Agencies for Surplus Property to discuss  their roles in the reuse and disposal of Federal personal property.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to February 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
