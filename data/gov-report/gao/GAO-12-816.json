Threats to active devices\u0097that is, devices that rely on a power source to operate\u0097that also have wireless capability can be unintentional, such as interference from electromagnetic energy in the environment, or intentional, such as the unauthorized accessing of a device. Several experts consider certain threats to be of greater concern than others; for example, experts noted less concern about interference from electromagnetic energy than other threats. Incidents resulting from unintentional threats have occurred, such as a malfunction resulting from electromagnetic interference, but have since been addressed. Although researchers have recently demonstrated the potential for incidents resulting from intentional threats in two devices\u0097an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and an insulin pump\u0097no such actual incidents are known to have occurred, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Medical devices may have several such vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to unintentional and intentional threats, including untested software and firmware and limited battery life. Information security risks resulting from certain threats and vulnerabilities could affect the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. These risks include unauthorized changes of device settings resulting from a lack of appropriate access controls.

We evaluated  FDA\u2019s responses to the questionnaire about its prior review of the two  PMA supplements as well as supporting documentation, such as FDA\u2019s  review memorandums and other documents submitted by the  manufacturer. For one supplement, FDA provided responses and  documentation for a defibrillator that has been exploited by researchers  as well as the related programming wand (wand) and programmer, a  specialized computer, that are used together to adjust the defibrillator.  For the second supplement, FDA provided responses and documentation  for the exploited insulin pump. We also evaluated additional  documentation for another defibrillator reviewed by FDA in 2012 that has  not been intentionally exploited by researchers, to obtain a more current  perspective on FDA\u2019s review process for information security issues.

These concerns  prompted FDA to release guidance on electromagnetic energy and  medical devices. In the late 1990s, FDA became aware of interference  between electromagnetic energy generated from antitheft systems and  metal detectors with other implanted devices, such as neurostimulators,  potentially resulting in an inappropriate jolt or shock (see fig. 3).

However,  there have been four separate demonstrations in controlled settings,  showing that the intentional exploitation of vulnerabilities in certain  medical devices is possible. Each of these demonstrations involved  laboratory tests and did not result in patient harm or death. The first  demonstration occurred in 2008, when a team of academic researchers,  working in a controlled setting, showed that they could remotely exploit a  defibrillator by delivering a command, using the associated wand and  programmer. A second demonstration occurred in 2010, when a team of  academic researchers remotely exploited an insulin pump, preventing it  from operating properly. Two additional demonstrations occurred in  2011, when two security experts, also working in controlled settings,  showed on separate occasions that they could also remotely exploit an  insulin pump.

Similarly, for the information security  risk associated with using older versions of software, a potential  mitigation strategy would be to have these medical devices operate using  newer versions. However, according to FDA officials, software in  implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers, typically is not  frequently updated; rather, the software is updated on an as-needed  basis. As with any device that uses software, such updates or other  modifications could introduce unanticipated software problems that could  adversely affect the functionality of a device, particularly if the software  had not been properly tested prior to being used. According to FDA, the  majority of software-related medical device problems occur because  devices are using software that has been revised since the medical  device was reviewed by FDA.

Additionally, FDA did not consider  information security risks resulting from intentional threats for any of the  eight information security control areas. Specifically, on the basis of the  support the agency provided for these two PMA supplements, FDA did  not demonstrate that it had considered the potential benefits of mitigation  strategies to protect devices against information security risks from  certain unintentional or intentional threats in light of the appropriate level  of acceptable risk for medical devices with known vulnerabilities.", "FDA officials told us that since the agency reviewed these PMA  supplements in 2001 and 2006, respectively, their consideration of  information security has changed. To support this, FDA provided  additional examples from an original PMA application for a defibrillator  reviewed in 2012. This additional evidence showed that the agency had  generally enhanced its consideration of information security during its  PMA review for those four information security control areas previously  identified\u2014software testing, verification, and validation; risk assessments;  access control; and contingency planning. For example, FDA conducted a  more comprehensive review of the manufacturer\u2019s software verification  and validation documentation, and included software-testing  documentation, electromagnetic-compatibility testing, electromagnetic- interference testing, and frequency testing. FDA also provided evidence  of its consideration of a fifth information security control area\u2014risk  management\u2014in this newer PMA application.", "However, FDA did not provide any evidence showing its consideration of  security-specific tests. For example, FDA did not provide evidence  showing testing of attempts to enter incorrect or invalid data in the device  or the use of fuzzing, an information security-related testing technique  that uses random data to discover software errors and security flaws.  FDA also did not demonstrate its consideration of information security  risks resulting from unintentional threats related to the remaining three  information security controls we selected, including patch and  vulnerability management, despite guidelines from NIST and other  sources on the importance of these issues. Additionally, when reviewing  the manufacturer\u2019s risk management plan, FDA did not consider  information security risks resulting from intentional threats. Thus, while it  continues to consider some information security risks resulting from  unintentional threats, such as interference, FDA has not begun to  consider risks resulting from intentional threats.", "FDA officials acknowledged the limitations of their review process for  information security issues. They explained that, as part of the agency\u2019s  PMA review process, they consider various risks with a focus on the most  relevant risks that could result in harm to patients. According to officials,  they tend to consider the most relevant risks to be clinical risks, such as  an increased risk of heart failure from having an implanted defibrillator,  and not information security risks, such as the reprogramming of a device  by a malicious actor. FDA officials said they also consider the intended  use of the device and the type of setting in which the device will be used,  both of which are determined by the manufacturer. For example, FDA  officials would review a scalpel for potential clinical risks resulting from its  intended use in a clinical setting. However, the agency cannot control  how devices are used in other settings, or if devices are misused. They  noted that a scalpel could become a dangerous weapon if misused by a  malicious actor.", "FDA officials also noted that they consider information security risks in the  context of a clinical situation. For example, officials said they have long  considered information security risks resulting from unintentional threats,  such as from interference or from defective software. However, they  acknowledged they have only recently considered information security  risks resulting from intentional threats because they did not previously  consider such threats as reasonable and likely at the time of their earlier  reviews in 2001 and 2006. They noted that, although conducted in  controlled settings, researchers\u2019 recent demonstrations of vulnerabilities  in two medical devices support the possibility that incidents caused by  information security risks resulting from intentional threats could occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Intends to Enhance Its Efforts Related to Information Security", "paragraphs": ["FDA officials said that in the future the agency intends to enhance its  efforts related to information security.

Officials said  the review of its approach will be conducted by a contractor and will  involve an analysis of how the agency considers software in medical  devices during premarket reviews. This review is to include an  examination of FDA\u2019s resources and evaluative tools. It will also include a  comparison of FDA\u2019s approach to reviewing software in medical devices  to the approaches of other sectors that also make or use high-risk and  complex software products, such as the aviation and nuclear industries.  According to officials, this effort is also intended to identify external  resources the agency can draw upon for evaluating information security  risks, such as those supported by other federal agencies.

One of these efforts is its  adverse event reporting system, MAUDE. MAUDE stores adverse event  reports submitted by reporters, which include manufacturers, user  facilities (e.g., hospitals), and voluntary reporters. FDA requires  manufacturers and user facilities to submit information regarding adverse  events involving medical devices and submit reports on these events to  FDA. However, FDA does not have these same requirements for other  medical device users, including consumers and health care providers.  Regardless of whether reporters are required to submit adverse event  reports, FDA must wait for reporters to recognize and submit information  on suspected adverse events before the agency can become aware of  and identify device problems through this system.", "For those adverse events that are reported, FDA stated that it is able to  conduct systematic reviews and searches of these reports. According to  FDA, it systematically reviews all information that it receives in the  MAUDE database and follows up with reporters when the agency  believes that such follow-up is necessary or would provide additional,  useful information. Additionally, FDA can search within MAUDE to  determine if any of the reporters cited information security issues when  submitting details about the adverse events. Searches can be conducted  using categories of codes that FDA has developed. These codes are  used by reporters to describe types of adverse events. These codes  include device-problem codes that are used to describe details such as  the reason behind a device\u2019s failure.", "According to FDA officials, there are 10 codes in MAUDE that reporters  primarily could select when reporting an adverse event to indicate\u2014and  allow FDA to subsequently identify\u2014that an information security problem  had occurred. For example, 3 of these codes are used to describe  adverse events that resulted from (1) an application issue, (2) the  unauthorized access to a computer system, or (3) a computer-security  issue. Using these 10 codes, FDA had not identified any information  security problems involving active implantable medical devices, as of April  2012.", "In addition to these 10 codes, we identified additional codes that could  indicate an information security problem had occurred due to an  unintentional threat. Using these additional codes, FDA has identified  potential information security problems involving active implantable  medical devices. For example, one adverse event involved a pacemaker  and a computer-software issue. Specifically, the pacemaker\u2019s  programmer was slow to start and experienced some errors, but no  patient involvement or complications were reported and the programmer  was returned for repair. Thus, although FDA does not categorize its  codes as specifically related to information security problems, it has  codes in place that could potentially identify information security problems  resulting from both unintentional and intentional threats.", "A second postmarket effort that FDA has in place to identify problems is  its process for requiring manufacturers to conduct postmarket  surveillance studies. Manufacturers may be required to conduct  postmarket surveillance studies to continue to systematically evaluate  device performance while the device is in commercial distribution. For  example, FDA officials could order a postmarket surveillance study for a  defibrillator because its failure would have serious adverse health effects  for a patient. It is possible these studies could identify vulnerabilities or  unintentional threats that might adversely affect medical devices, but  postmarket surveillance studies typically focus on clinical outcomes that  might affect patients. At the time of our review, FDA officials said that,  while they could require manufacturers to conduct postmarket studies to  focus on information security risks, they did not currently have plans to  request that any manufacturers do so. FDA officials explained that these  studies are intended to address residual questions from clinical trials for a  medical device. These lingering questions typically relate to the medical  device\u2019s clinical risks to patients, such as whether the use of a particular  device is appropriate for a specific patient population, rather than to its  information security risks.", "A third postmarket effort is FDA\u2019s requirement for manufacturers to  prepare annual PMA postapproval reports (annual reports). Among the  issues manufacturers must include in these reports are the rationales for  any changes they made to the medical device during the preceding year,  including changes made because of an adverse event. For example,  these annual reports could potentially include information related to a  problem due to an information security risk if the problem led the  manufacturer to change the device, such as a modification to the device\u2019s  software. Manufacturers are also required to include any information  about defects related to their medical devices that have been identified in  scientific literature\u2014including published reports on clinical studies of  similar devices or unpublished reports of data from clinical investigations  involving their devices\u2014that are known or that reasonably should be  known to them. We reviewed the annual reports for the two active  medical devices with known vulnerabilities to determine if the  manufacturer had noted the research conducted by information security  researchers demonstrating the devices\u2019 susceptibility to intentional  threats.", "For the defibrillator, we found references to other published reports  discussing adverse events resulting from unintentional threats, such as  from the adverse effect electromagnetic interference had on the  defibrillator\u2019s functionality. However, no potential information security  problems due to intentional information security threats were included in  these reports, including any references to the 2008 exploitation by  researchers. Additionally, no potential information security problems were  included in the annual reports we reviewed for the insulin pump exploited  by researchers in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Faces Challenges in Using Its Adverse Event Reporting System to Identify Information Security Problems", "paragraphs": ["Despite having postmarket efforts in place, FDA faces challenges with  identifying information security problems, should they occur. We have  previously reported on some challenges associated with adverse event  reporting, such as the inherent weaknesses associated with passive  surveillance systems. For example, MAUDE is a passive system and  FDA relies upon reporters to recognize and submit information on  suspected adverse events. According to FDA, because of this  dependence upon reporters, significant underreporting occurs. This  underreporting affects FDA\u2019s ability to estimate the magnitude of a  problem because the number of reports submitted might not be  representative of the total number of patients that experienced the  adverse event.", "Underreporting can also occur because individuals are either unfamiliar  with reporting requirements for devices or because reporting can be time- consuming. Additionally, FDA and other experts told us that  underreporting of information security problems in medical devices could  result from a lack of understanding or awareness among adverse event  reporters about how information security problems apply to these devices.  They noted that information security is a relatively new issue area with  respect to its applicability to medical devices, which could make it a  difficult type of problem to understand and report to FDA. Some health  care providers might not fully understand, and therefore may not report,  information security problems whether resulting from unintentional or  intentional threats, as providers have instead been trained to focus on  clinical problems associated with medical devices. FDA officials said that  they were uncertain if reporters would recognize that an information  security problem was relevant or even had occurred. For example, an  adverse event report could note that a patient complained of chest pains  and experienced an increase in heart rate, but the report might not  include any indication that a possible information security issue was a  factor; that is, the reporter might not note that the patient\u2019s device had  recently been programmed because the health care provider did not  consider this information relevant or necessary.", "Besides underreporting, another weakness inherent in MAUDE is FDA\u2019s  inability to establish causality because reporters might submit insufficient  or inadequate information about an adverse event. For example, a  reporter might fail to include specific details about an adverse event\u2014 such as that the event occurred while a medical device was being  reprogrammed. Because the manufacturer generally conducts any follow- up investigation, if FDA wanted more information about an adverse event,  FDA could notify manufacturers in writing that the agency required  additional information about manufacturers\u2019 reports. However, FDA  officials told us that the more time passes from the time an adverse event  occurred to the actual investigation, the more difficult it is to obtain  detailed information. Also, officials request additional information from  manufacturers on a case-by-case basis. In addition to the challenge of  establishing causality, FDA officials told us it would also be difficult to  determine the motivation behind an adverse event, such as if it was  caused by a malicious actor. Without such details and contextual  information related to the cause of and motivation behind an adverse  event, FDA would be limited in its ability to later identify the problem as  related to information security and determine if it resulted from an  intentional threat. Because of these inherent weaknesses associated with  MAUDE as a passive surveillance system, it is possible that information  security problems involving medical devices could have occurred but not  have been reported to FDA or have not been identified as information  security problems by the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Planned Postmarket Improvement Initiatives Might Strengthen Its Ability to Identify Information Security Problems", "paragraphs": ["FDA has two planned initiatives that are intended to improve its  postmarket efforts in order to more accurately identify and analyze  problems associated with medical devices. According to FDA, these  initiatives are not specifically intended to improve FDA\u2019s ability to identify  information security problems; however, these initiatives might strengthen  FDA\u2019s ability to do so by providing the agency with additional information.  One initiative is the Unique Device Identification effort for the postmarket  surveillance of devices, which, according to FDA, will allow the agency to  aggregate adverse event reports in order to more accurately analyze  them when conducting signal analyses. The initiative will also allow FDA  to identify specific devices included in adverse event reports, allowing for  more rapid and effective corrective actions that can focus on specific  devices, according to one agency official.us that although this effort was not specifically designed to help FDA  identify information security problems involving medical devices, it will  help FDA identify specific device models that could encounter information  security problems.", "Once operational, this new system will replace MAUDE as FDA\u2019s passive surveillance  system for devices and will be compatible with FDA\u2019s drug and vaccine adverse event  reporting systems to allow for cross-center communication within the agency. Such  communication may be useful in handling drug-device or biologic-device issues that may  be found in combination products. the capacity or complexity of medical device adverse event information  that exists today. FDA expects the new system\u2014the FDA Adverse Event  Reporting System\u2014to perform similar functions as MAUDE but also allow  for greater capacity for storing adverse events and enhanced search  capability compared to MAUDE. However, according to FDA, transitioning  from MAUDE to this new system will not automatically make it easier to  identify information security problems because, like MAUDE, the system  is designed to collect information that indicates that a medical device has  caused or contributed to a serious injury or death, which is more closely  associated with clinical risks than information security risks. Because this  new system will also be a passive surveillance system, FDA will still rely  on reporters to recognize and submit information on information security  problems involving medical devices before the agency can search for and  subsequently identify them. Still, FDA officials told us that this new  system will also include the 10 codes that reporters currently can use to  indicate that an information security problem has occurred.

Serious injuries are defined as life-threatening events, events that result in permanent impairment of  a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, and events that require medical or surgical  intervention to preclude permanent impairment or damage. Malfunctions are defined as the failure of  a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise not perform as intended.", "User facilities are required to file annual reports that summarize their adverse event reports.   21 C.F.R. pt. 803, Subpart C.", "In addition to MAUDE, FDA has other adverse event reporting systems in  place to capture adverse events associated with medical devices. One of  these is the Medical Product Safety Network (MedSun) system. MedSun  collects voluntary report information from a limited number of hospitals  and user facilities. All reports received through MedSun are entered into  the MAUDE system. Launched in 2002, the primary goal of MedSun is to  enable FDA to work collaboratively with specific device-user facilities in  the clinical community to identify, understand, and solve problems with  the use of devices. MedSun user facilities are required to report device  problems that result in serious illness, injury, or death. MedSun user  facilities are also encouraged to voluntarily report other types of problems  with devices, such as \u201cclose-calls,\u201d potential for harm, and other safety  concerns. Once a problem has been identified, FDA works with the  MedSun user facilities\u2019 representatives to clarify and understand the  problem. Subsequent reports and lessons learned from these  collaborations are then shared with the greater clinical community so that  all clinicians may take necessary preventative actions to address device  problems. Currently, 350 user facilities participate in the MedSun network.  Participants are recruited from all regions of the country using the  American Hospital Association Membership Listing.", "FDA\u2019s voluntary adverse event reporting system, MedWatch, was created  in 1993 to encourage voluntary reporting by interested parties, such as  consumers of medical devices, and health care professionals, such as  physicians. These parties can use MedWatch to report serious adverse  reactions, product quality problems, therapeutic failure, and product-use  errors associated with human medical products, including drugs, biologic  products, and medical devices, among other things. Consumers can  submit information about their experiences either online or by fax, mail, or  phone. Consumers can also request that their physicians either complete  the MedWatch form for them or help them complete the form, given that  these providers have test results and other clinical information that will  help FDA better evaluate the MedWatch reports.", "Adverse event reports submitted to FDA through MedSun or MedWatch  are eventually entered into MAUDE. MAUDE data consist of voluntary  reports since June 1993, user-facility reports since 1991, distributor  reports since 1993, and manufacturer reports since 1996. MAUDE may  not include reports made according to exemptions, variances, or  alternative reporting forms authorized by regulation. FDA is in the process  of developing a new system to replace MAUDE, the FDA Adverse Event  Reporting System, which the agency plans to implement by September  2013. According to FDA, this new system will perform similar functions as  MAUDE, but will also allow for (1) greater capacity for storing adverse  event data, and (2) greater search capability than MAUDE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: OCR and ONC Responsibilities Related to Information Security", "paragraphs": ["Two federal entities that have specific responsibilities related to  developing and implementing policies with respect to the confidentiality  aspect of information security in terms of protected health information.

OCR enforces the Privacy and  Security Rules by investigating complaints that individuals have filed with  the Office in instances where they believe a covered entity violated health  information privacy rights or committed another violation of the rules.  OCR may also conduct periodic audits to ensure that covered entities are  in compliance with Privacy and Security Rules. In calendar year 2011,  OCR conducted a total of 3,898 investigations. Of these investigations,  OCR determined no violation had occurred in 33 percent of them (1,303  investigations) and, for the remaining 67 percent (2,595 investigations),  obtained corrective action.

It is charged  with promoting the development of a nationwide health information  technology (IT) infrastructure that allows the secure exchange of health  information. For example, ONC has developed a federal health IT  strategic plan for working with the private and public sectors to implement  different health IT efforts. In this plan ONC addresses, among other  things, privacy and security issues related to health IT. The plan also  includes strategies related to identifying health IT system security  vulnerabilities as well as health IT privacy and security requirements and  best practices. ONC has also developed the Nationwide Privacy and  Security Framework for Electronic Exchange of Individually Identifiable  Health Information in order to establish a policy framework for electronic  health information exchange to help guide nationwide adoption of health  IT and help improve the availability of health information and health care  quality. ONC also assesses gaps and weaknesses in current privacy and  security policies in light of evolving technology, and works with federal  entities to address these issues. Additionally, ONC incorporates privacy  and security in its programs, which are designed to implement HITECH  initiatives, including certification of electronic health records, as well as  supporting the efforts of several related initiatives to facilitate nationwide  adoption of health IT.
