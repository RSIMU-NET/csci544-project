These programs have provided over $1.3 billion in military and nonmilitary aid to 62 countries and are due to expire in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Congress mandated that GAO assess the programs. This report addresses the extent to which the programs (1) are consistent with U.S. strategic priorities, (2) are distinct from other programs, (3) address sustainment needs, and (4) incorporate monitoring and evaluation. GAO analyzed data and program documents from the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and interviewed U.S. and host country officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Section 1206 and 1207 programs have generally been consistent with U.S. strategic priorities. The Section 1206 program was established to build the military capacity of foreign countries to conduct counterterrorism and stabilization operations. DOD and State have devoted 82 percent of this program's funds to address specific terrorist threats, primarily in countries the U.S. intelligence community has identified as priorities for the counterterrorism effort. The Section 1207 program was established to transfer DOD funds to State for nonmilitary assistance related to stabilization, reconstruction, and security. DOD, State, and USAID have devoted 77 percent of this program's funds to countries at significant risk of instability, mostly those the United States has identified as vulnerable to state failure. Based on agency guidelines, the Section 1206 program is generally distinct from other programs, while the Section 1207 program is not. In most cases, Section 1206 projects addressed urgent and emergent counterterrorism and stabilization priorities of combatant commanders and did so more quickly than other programs, sometimes in a year, whereas Foreign Military Financing (FMF) projects can take up to 3 years to plan. DOD and embassy officials GAO spoke to consistently explained why projects do not overlap those of FMF and other programs, although project proposals GAO reviewed did not always document these distinctions. Section 1207 projects are virtually indistinguishable from those of other foreign aid programs in their content and time frames. Furthermore, the Section 1207 program has entailed additional implementation costs and funding delays beyond those of traditional foreign assistance programs, while the 1206 program has not. The uncertain availability of resources to sustain Section 1206 projects poses risks to achieving long-term impact. Enabling nations to achieve sustainable counterterrorism capabilities is a key U.S. policy goal. The long-term viability of Section 1206 projects is threatened by (1) the limited ability or willingness of partner nations to support new capabilities, as 76 percent of Section 1206 projects are in low- or lower-middle-income countries, and (2) U.S. legal and policy restrictions on using FMF and additional Section 1206 resources for sustainment. In contrast, sustainment risks for Section 1207 projects appear minimal, because State, USAID, and DOD are not restricted from drawing on a variety of overlapping funding sources to continue them. DOD and State have incorporated little monitoring and evaluation into the Section 1206 and 1207 programs. For Section 1206 projects, the agencies have not consistently defined performance measures, and results reporting has generally been limited to anecdotal information. For Section 1207 projects, the agencies have defined performance measures and State requires quarterly reporting on project implementation. However, State has not fully analyzed this information or provided it to DOD to inform program management. As a result, agencies have made decisions to sustain and expand both Section 1206 and 1207 projects without documentation of progress or effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the threats of terrorism and instability continually emerging and  evolving overseas, the Departments of Defense (DOD) and State (State)  have recognized the need for more flexibility in the tools used to address  these challenges.

Through this process, DOD and State have defined  common outcomes and joint strategies for achieving them, two key  practices for interagency collaboration. Second, the relevant regional U.S.  geographic combatant commander and ambassador have approved each  proposal before officially submitting them to the Joint Staff for  consideration. Once a proposal is submitted, a DOD-State working group  reviews it and considers how Section 1206 projects will support U.S.  foreign policy and foreign assistance goals.

For  example, Colombia\u2019s Section 1207 project in fiscal year 2007, which aimed  to stabilize regions of that country recently freed from insurgent control,  supported an interagency body of the Colombian government that the U.S.  Southern Command had funded 3 years earlier. In addition, Tajikistan\u2019s  Section 1207 project in fiscal year 2008, intended to reduce the potential  for conflict in unstable areas, supports community policing and local  government development activities that build upon previous and  continuing USAID and State initiatives. Finally, Uganda\u2019s Section 1207  project in fiscal year 2009, aimed at reestablishing the rule of law in the  north of the country, includes training for police and construction of  community justice centers, which have both been implemented under  previous and current USAID initiatives.", "In December 2009, the Congress established the Complex Crises Fund,  which provides greater flexibility to USAID to prevent or respond to  emerging or unforeseen complex crises overseas.

Furthermore, in its proposed budget for fiscal year  2011, released in February 2010, State requested another $100 million in  flexible contingency funding to meet unforeseen reconstruction and  stabilization needs.

In the Philippines, when faced with an initial delay in receiving  approved Section 1207 funds in fiscal year 2007 for police training in  Mindanao, State reprogrammed International Narcotics Control and Law  Enforcement funds for this purpose. Furthermore, our review of Section  1207 project proposals shows that the proposals for projects in Lebanon in  fiscal year 2006 and Kenya in fiscal year 2009 describe using  reprogrammed funds from conventional accounts alongside Section 1207  funds to help achieve similar stabilization goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Implementation Costs and Funding Delays", "paragraphs": ["Using Section 1207 funding for reconstruction, stabilization, and security- related projects has created a new layer of program management through  State\u2019s Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization  (State/S/CRS)\u2014the office responsible for oversight of the Section 1207  program\u2014which has entailed additional implementation costs and funding  delays with negative consequences.", "In addition to State and USAID\u2019s normal administrative costs for  implementing an assistance project, State/S/CRS charges a fee for  oversight of Section 1207 projects to cover the cost of program support  and coordination from Washington, D.C., and in the field. For fiscal years  2008 and 2009, this fee totaled nearly $2.5 million, which State/S/CRS  deducted from the project funds DOD transferred to State. When added to  State and USAID administrative costs of nearly $5.4 million during the  same period, the State/S/CRS fee represents an increase of 46 percent for  overall administrative costs for Section 1207 projects during these 2 years.  Furthermore, according to embassy officials we spoke to in Haiti, Georgia,  and the Philippines, State/S/CRS oversight over Section 1207 has not  necessarily improved project implementation or effectiveness. State and  USAID officials at these embassies questioned the added value of  State/S/CRS\u2019s oversight of the Section 1207 program. According to the  officials, State/S/CRS offers to coordinate interagency efforts and facilitate  interagency collaboration within the country teams to help develop and  execute Section 1207 projects. However, the embassy officials stated that  interagency collaboration is already a part of how their country teams  operate, through country team working groups and the development of  mission strategic plans, and that the ambassador or deputy chief of  mission can encourage such collaboration when necessary. In our  discussions with State/S/CRS officials, they identified their ability to  facilitate a whole-of-government approach for embassy country teams as  their key added value and cited six countries\u2014Lebanon, Nepal, Panama,  Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Uganda\u2014where their involvement brought  benefits.

In two countries we visited, funding for  State/INL-implemented activities was significantly delayed compared with  funding for USAID activities within the same project. In the Philippines,  U.S. embassy officials told us that State borrowed funds from an existing  police assistance project in order to start its Section 1207-funded police  training on time, with an understanding that Section 1207 funds would  arrive quickly for reimbursement. However, the Section 1207 funds took 6  months longer than expected to arrive, which subsequently delayed the  existing police assistance project by 18 months and decreased the overall  quantity of equipment procured. According to officials at the U.S. embassy  in Georgia, a 6-month delay in receiving State\u2019s Section 1207 funds for law  enforcement activities interfered with the embassy\u2019s goal of  simultaneously improving the security and economy in the conflict zone.  We also found in our review of quarterly reporting documents for all  Section 1207 projects that funding delays for State activities was an issue  in at least three other countries\u2014Bangladesh, Kenya, and Malaysia. For  example, in Kenya, U.S. embassy officials reported that the delay of  Section 1207 funds for State\u2019s police assistance resulted in the  postponement of a State/INL assessment visit necessary to begin providing  assistance.", "In contrast, DOD and State implement the 1206 program within the  existing management structure of FMF, under the auspices of the Defense  Security Cooperation Agency.

DOD officials  have noted that some Section 1206 projects are intended to address an  immediate threat and may not require long-term sustainment.  Nevertheless, according to Section 1206 project proposal instructions,  proposals must explain how projects will be sustained in future years.", "However, we found that the availability of sustainment funds from the U.S.  government is uncertain. DOD and State policy has potentially constrained  the use of U.S. government funding for Section 1206 project sustainment.  According to fiscal year 2009 program guidelines, the Section 1206  program should not fund projects that must be continued over long  periods (more than 3 years) to achieve a capability for a partner nation.  However, Section 1206 projects are highly dependent on U.S. funding for  long-term sustainment. Prior to fiscal year 2009, 62 (56 percent) of 110  approved Section 1206 proposals we reviewed indicated that FMF  resources would be used to sustain projects.

However, several SAOs were not certain that State would award the funds  they had requested. State determines FMF allotments to recipient  countries based on congressional direction and availability of funds, and at  the time of our interviews, State had not finalized fiscal year 2010  allotments. Moreover, in fiscal years 2006 through 2009, 18 (34 percent) of  the 53 Section 1206 recipient countries did not receive any FMF funding.  While proposals continue to cite FMF for Section 1206 project  sustainment, a provision of the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations  Act potentially further constrains the use of FMF to sustain Section 1206  projects. This provision, which prohibits the use of FMF funds to support  or continue any Section 1206 projects unless the Secretary of State  justifies such use to the Committees on Appropriations, may limit the  availability of FMF for Section 1206 project sustainment.", "The ability of partner nations to sustain Section 1206 projects in the  absence of U.S. funding is also uncertain. DOD and State have not required  countries to sign formal commitments to sustain Section 1206 projects,  and only 35 (26 percent) of the 135 proposals we reviewed for fiscal years  2007-2009 projects explicitly address the recipient country\u2019s ability or  willingness to bear sustainment costs. Furthermore, only 9 (7 percent) of  those 135 proposals provided estimates of the project\u2019s maintenance,  operation, or other sustainment costs. Moreover, DOD and State have  implemented 113 (76 percent) of 149 Section 1206 projects in low- or  lower-middle-income countries, as classified by the World Bank, where  funding for sustainment efforts may be scarce. Only 1 of the SAOs we  interviewed in 15 countries indicated that he believed his partner nation  had the ability to sustain its Section 1206 projects independently; 6 SAOs  said that they did not believe their partner nations had this ability, and 8  were uncertain. For example, the SAO in Nigeria was concerned about  that country\u2019s ability to support long-term maintenance activities for the  vehicles, surveillance, and other Section 1206-funded equipment. Similarly,  the SAO in Mali noted that sustainment of the Section 1206 project to train  and equip that country\u2019s light infantry units would be problematic if the  country had to find its own funding. Only the SAO in Malaysia believed  that the partner nation would fund the necessary sustainment of its  maritime surveillance projects, based on that government\u2019s stated  intention to do so. Furthermore, Section 1206 program managers at U.S.  geographic combatant commands also questioned the likelihood of  partner nations to sustain Section 1206 projects.

State noted that this new  fund will solve many of the issues outlined in our report, including an  unwieldy funds transfer process that has sometimes prevented as rapid a  response to immediate needs as State would have preferred. State also  indicated that our findings regarding the limited monitoring and evaluation  for the Section 1207 program and additional administrative costs entailed  by the program were contradictory, noting that State has increasingly  developed and refined its monitoring and evaluation of Section 1207  projects, requiring adequate administrative costs to carry out. We disagree.  While State/S/CRS had taken some steps to increase its monitoring of  Section 1207 projects, it had neither systematically analyzed embassy  reports on the effectiveness of Section 1207 projects nor provided these  reports to its DOD counterparts responsible for the projects\u2019 funding.  Accordingly, we do not believe that these efforts justified the additional  fees this office charged beyond those that State and USAID already  charged to implement the projects.", "USAID noted in its written comments that our report highlights several  issues of interest to all agencies participating in the Section 1207 process  and that USAID looks forward to continuing to refine its business  processes based on our review.", "We are sending copies of the report to the Secretaries of Defense and State  and other interested parties or interested congressional committees.

For more in-depth project review, we focused on  18 of the 62 countries receiving assistance under these programs: Albania,  the Bahamas, Georgia, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and the Philippines,  where we visited with U.S. embassy officials and host country officials, as  well as implementing partner representatives in Section 1207 recipient  countries; Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Uganda, where we interviewed U.S.  embassy officials in conjunction with other GAO work; and Honduras,  Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine, where we  conducted interviews with security assistance officers (SAO) or other  project managers via telephone. To select countries to visit, we ranked all  62 countries based on the following criteria: (1) the amount of Section  1206 and 1207 program funding a country had received in order to include  countries representing a significant portion of total funding, as well as  both large and small individual projects from each program; (2) the year  when a country\u2019s projects began, in order to visit mature projects; (3) the  presence of both Section 1206 and Section 1207 projects in a country, in  order to use our time efficiently in visiting projects from both programs in  single country visits; (4) DOD and State suggestions; (5) recent GAO or  DOD and State Inspectors General visits, to reduce the burden on  embassies; (6) congressional interest; (7) security considerations; and (8)  opportunities to consolidate the fieldwork of multiple GAO engagements.  We selected the highest-ranking countries within the areas of  responsibility of each of the six U.S. geographic combatant commands.  For telephone interviews, we selected the next-highest-ranking country  within the area of responsibility of each combatant command and four  additional countries of strategic importance. The results of our work for  the 18 countries we selected are not necessarily generalizable to all 62  countries receiving assistance under these programs.", "To assess the extent to which the Section 1206 and 1207 programs have  been consistent with U.S. government strategic priorities, we conducted  the following work.", "We interviewed DOD, State, and U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID) officials involved in implementing Section 1206 and  1207 programs and documented their views on how ongoing projects  relate to U.S. strategies and priorities. At DOD we spoke to officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and Joint Staff and the  Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in Washington, D.C.; the U.S.  Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida; the six geographic  combatant commands\u2014the U.S. Africa Command and the U.S. European  Command in Stuttgart, Germany; the U.S. Central Command in Tampa,  Florida; the U.S. Northern Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado (by  telephone); the U.S. Pacific Command in Honolulu, Hawaii; and the U.S.  Southern Command in Miami, Florida; and the Africa Command Navy  component, in Naples, Italy. At State we spoke to officials in the Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs and the Office of the Coordinator for  Reconstruction and Stabilization (State/S/CRS) in Washington, D.C. At  USAID we spoke to officials from the Office of the Chief Operating Officer  and the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance in  Washington, D.C. We also interviewed U.S. embassy officials (by telephone  or in person) in all 18 countries we selected. To identify U.S. strategic  priorities, we also obtained and analyzed documents, such as mission  strategic plans and lists of priority countries identified by the U.S.  intelligence community.", "We analyzed Section 1206 program funding data and DOD\u2019s priority  country list to determine the percentage of funding that has been allotted  for countries on this list. We calculated this amount overall and for each  year to identify any trends over time. Since the list of priority countries is  classified, we aggregated the information we reported from our analysis to  avoid disclosing classified information. We used funding data based on  allotments for each Section 1206 project, in line with DOD\u2019s notifications  to the Congress, which we determined were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "We analyzed all written project proposals for approved Section 1206  program-funded projects to determine how many of them described  specific terrorist threats. DOD officials consistently identified these  proposals as the most authoritative and detailed documents about each  project\u2019s purpose and objectives. In all, DOD and State have approved 92  proposals, accounting for 149 projects. No formal proposals had been  submitted for the 11 projects approved in fiscal year 2006 and 3 projects  approved in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. We analyzed the proposals for 135  projects from fiscal years 2007-2009: 62 projects approved in 2007, 48  projects approved in 2008, and 25 projects approved in 2009. We  determined that a project proposal addressed a specific threat if it (1)  provided information indicating that some terrorist act had occurred, had  been attempted, or had been or was being planned for in the  country/region of the project, or (2) referred to a terrorist organization or  individual in the country/region of the project that posed a threat that was  being targeted by the proposed project. If project proposals did not meet  these criteria, we determined that they addressed a nonspecific threat.  Projects that we determined fell into this second category included those  that addressed the global threat of terrorism, the existence of ungoverned  territory, illegal fishing, smuggling, narcotics trafficking, human  trafficking, piracy, or other illegal activities not specifically tied to  observable terrorist-related activity in the country/region in question. Two  analysts independently reviewed all the proposals according to these  criteria, and any disagreements in the determinations both made were  resolved through discussion.", "We reviewed applicable Section 1207 program guidelines to identify the  requirements related to meeting U.S. stabilization priorities. We then  analyzed Section 1207 program funding data and a U.S. government  watchlist identifying countries vulnerable to state failure to determine the  percentage of program funding that has been allotted for countries on this  list. Since the watchlist is classified, we did not present specific data from  our analysis to avoid disclosing classified information. We also analyzed  political risk data compiled by IHS Global Insight, a private forecasting  firm, to determine the percentage of project funds that were allotted to  countries categorized as having high, very high, or extremely high short- term, internal political risk. This political risk score is a weighted average  summary of probabilities that different political events, both domestic and  external, such as civil war and trade conflicts, will reduce gross domestic  product growth rates. The subjective probabilities are assessed by  economists and country analysts at Global Insight on the basis of a wide  range of information, and are reviewed by a team to ensure consistency  across countries. The measures are revised quarterly; the measure we used  comes from the first quarter of the year after each project proposal for the  corresponding country was approved, except in the case of fiscal year  2009 projects, for which we used data from the third quarter of 2009  because data from the first quarter of 2010 were not yet available at the  time of our review. We combined the results for all years to indicate what  percentage of total funding was allotted to countries within each political  risk category. To assess the reliability of the risk rating data, we  interviewed officials of IHS Global Insight and reviewed related  documents describing the methods used to gather these data and the  internal control mechanisms employed to ensure consistency and  reliability. We also compared the risk scores of similar sources of data  related to country political risk to assess overall consistency. We  determined that these risk rating data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of assessing the general level of political stability of countries  receiving Section 1207 program assistance. In addition, we reviewed all 28  approved proposals relating to 25 projects in the Section 1207 program in  fiscal years 2006 through 2009 and assessed the extent to which proposals  were for projects to help countries recover from or prevent instability. We  considered that a project proposal addressed the prevention of instability  if (1) the project objectives described an attempt to prevent, deny,  counter, or reduce threat(s) to stability, such as armed conflict, violence,  extremism, or terrorism/terrorists, or (2) the project objectives described  an attempt to strengthen or enhance stability, and (3) the project did not  address recovery from a specific event or occurrence of instability. We  considered that a project proposal addressed the recovery from instability  if (1) the project objectives described a specific event or occurrence of  instability (e.g., insurgency, war, or episodic or recurring violence) and  supported postconflict reconstruction or rebuilding efforts, or (2) the  project objectives described efforts to help foreign governments regain or  reestablish control over territories or institutions that were previously  ungoverned or under the control of criminals, terrorists, or insurgents.  Two analysts independently reviewed all the proposals according to these  criteria, and any disagreements in the determinations both made were  resolved through discussion.

We then reviewed all  available written proposals for projects to which these requirements  applied (e.g., we compared projects approved in fiscal year 2009 with  fiscal year 2009 guidelines) and analyzed the information that the  proposals provided to distinguish the proposed project from those funded  by other security assistance programs. We categorized each proposal  based on whether the proposal (1) explained the reason(s), other than the  lack of available funds, that another program could not be used; (2) did  not address whether the proposed project was distinct from projects  funded by other programs, other than the lack of available funds; or (3)  identified one or more similar or related projects funded by another  program but did not explain how the proposed project was distinct. Two  analysts independently reviewed all the proposals according to these  criteria, and any disagreements in the determinations both made were  resolved through discussion. We considered only those proposals meeting  the first criterion to have documented that the proposed project was  distinct.", "We also interviewed relevant staff\u2014at OSD; State\u2019s Bureau for Political- Military Affairs; all six geographic combatant commands; the Africa  Command Navy component; and the U.S. embassies in Albania, the  Bahamas, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Ethiopia,  Pakistan, Honduras, Lebanon, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and  Ukraine\u2014in person or by telephone, and documented their views on the  factors that distinguish Section 1206 projects from other train and equip  projects that they help implement under other programs. To determine  whether funding assistance under Section 1206, instead of other  traditional security assistance programs, entailed additional costs or  funding delays, we asked an official from the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency overseeing the Section 1206 program about the fees  and implementation timing under this program and Foreign Military  Financing (FMF).", "We reviewed applicable Section 1207 program guidelines to identify the  requirements relating to project distinctness.

We considered a proposed project to be distinct from other  projects if (1) no other related projects were identified in the proposal, or  (2) the proposed project did not fund a continuation of a prior or existing  program in that country, through expansion of its geographic scope or an  increase in the number of identical or closely related activities. For  example, we did not consider an initiative to increase funding for an  existing school construction program to build additional schools in other  regions of a country to be distinct. We did not consider projects to be  undertaken using existing contracting mechanisms, grants, or cooperative  agreements to be distinct unless the type of proposed activity funded was  described as being substantially different from ongoing activities. Two  analysts independently reviewed all the proposals according to these  criteria, and any disagreements in the determinations both made were  resolved through discussion.", "We reviewed quarterly reports from countries that received Section 1207  program funding for State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law  Enforcement activities to determine if funding delays were an issue. We  also reviewed Section 1207 program funding data to determine the  administrative costs charged by State/S/CRS, State (at U.S. embassies),  and USAID. In addition, we interviewed cognizant officials at the U.S.  embassies in Georgia, Haiti, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Uganda, and  documented their views of the factors that distinguish respective Section  1207 projects from other assistance activities that they help implement  under other programs.

We identified all the sources of funding that each proposal indicated  would be used to sustain the project and categorized them as Foreign  Military Financing, U.S. programs other than FMF, or host country funds.
