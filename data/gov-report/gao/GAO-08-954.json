Specifically, pharmacy and drug allergy data on about 18,300 patients who receive care from both departments are exchanged at the highest level of interoperability--that is, in computable form; at this level, the data are in a standardized format that a computer application can act on (for example, to provide alerts to clinicians of drug allergies). In other cases, data can be viewed only--a lower level of interoperability that still provides clinicians with important information. However, not all electronic health information is yet shared, and information is still captured on paper at many DOD medical facilities. According to the departments, a DOD/VA Information Interoperability Plan (targeted for approval in August 2008) is to address these and other issues and define tasks required to guide the development and implementation of an interoperable electronic health record capability. If properly developed and implemented, the plan could help the departments achieve the goal of seamless sharing of health information. DOD and VA have agreed upon numerous common standards that allow them to share health data, which include standards that are part of current and emerging federal interoperability specifications. This collaboration provided the essential foundation for the departments to begin sharing computable health data. The departments are currently participating in recent initiatives led by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (within the Department of Health and Human Services) that are aimed at promoting the adoption of federal standards and broader use of electronic health records. These initiatives include identifying relevant existing standards, identifying and addressing overlaps and gaps in the standards, and developing interoperability specifications and certification criteria based on these standards. The involvement of the departments in these activities is an important mechanism for aligning their electronic health records with emerging federal standards. In establishing the joint interagency program office, Congress directed the departments to develop an implementation plan for setting up the office and carrying out related activities (such as validating and establishing requirements for interoperable health capabilities). The departments' effort to set up the program office is still in its early stages. Leadership positions in the office are not yet permanently filled, staffing is not complete, and facilities to house the office have not been designated. Further, the implementation plan is currently in draft, and although it includes schedules and milestones, dates for several activities have not yet been determined (such as implementing a capability to share immunization records), even though all capabilities are to be achieved by September 2009. Without a fully established program office and a finalized implementation plan with set milestones, the departments may be challenged in meeting the required date for achieving interoperable electronic health records and capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the last decade, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have been pursuing initiatives to  share data between their health information systems.

Critical health information for  a patient seeking treatment (such as allergies, current treatments or  medications, and prior diagnoses) has, historically, been scattered across  paper records kept by many different caregivers in many different  locations, making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a patient\u2019s  health information at the time of care. Lacking access to these critical data  makes it challenging for a clinician to make the most informed decisions  on treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at greater  risk. The use of electronic health records can help provide this access and  improve clinical decisions.", "Electronic health records are particularly crucial for optimizing the health  care provided to military personnel and veterans. While in military status  and later as veterans, many DOD and VA patients tend to be highly mobile  and may have health records residing at multiple medical facilities within  and outside the United States. Making such records electronic can help  ensure that complete health care information is available for most military  service members and veterans at the time and place of care, no matter  where it originates.", "Key to making health care information electronically available is the  ability to share that data among health care providers\u2014that is,  interoperability. Interoperability is the ability for different information  systems or components to exchange information and to use the  information that has been exchanged. This capability is important because  it allows patients\u2019 electronic health information to move with them from  provider to provider, regardless of where the information originated. If  electronic health records conform to interoperability standards, they can  be created, managed, and consulted by authorized clinicians and staff  across more than one health care organization, thus providing patients and  their caregivers the necessary information required for optimal care.  (Paper-based health records\u2014if available\u2014also provide necessary  information, but unlike electronic health records, paper records do not  provide decision support capabilities, such as automatic alerts about a  particular patient\u2019s health, or other advantages of automation.)", "Interoperability can be achieved at different levels. At the highest level,  data are in a format that a computer can understand and operate on,  whereas at the minimum type of interoperability, the data are in a format  that is viewable, so that information is available for a human being to read  and interpret. Figure 1 shows various levels of interoperability and  examples of the types of data that can be shared at each level.", "As the figure shows, paper records can be considered interoperable in that  they allow data to be read and interpreted by a human being. In the  remainder of this report, however, we do not discuss interoperability in  this sense; instead, we focus on electronic interoperability, for which the  first level of interoperability is unstructured, viewable electronic data.  With unstructured data, a clinician would have to find needed or relevant  information by scanning uncategorized information. The value of viewable  data is increased if the data are structured so that information is  categorized and easier to find. At the highest level, as shown, the computer  can interpret and act on the data.", "Not all data require the same level of interoperability. For example, in  their initial efforts to implement computable data, VA and DOD focused on  outpatient pharmacy and drug allergy data because clinicians gave priority  to the need for automated alerts to help medical personnel avoid  administering inappropriate drugs to patients. On the other hand, for such  narrative data as clinical notes, viewability may be sufficient. Achieving  even a minimal level of interoperability is valuable for potentially making  all relevant information available to clinicians."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Adopt and Implement Federal Interoperability Standards Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["Any type of interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon standards  to ensure that information can be shared and used.

The National  Coordinator indicated that such participation is important and stated that  it would not be advisable for DOD and VA to move significantly ahead of  the national standards initiative; if they did, the departments might have to  change the way their systems share information by adjusting them to the  national standards later, as the standards continue to evolve.", "In addition, according to DOD officials, the department is taking steps to  ensure that the electronic health records produced by its modernized  health information system, AHLTA, which is a customized commercial  software application, are compliant with standards by arranging for  certification through the Certification Commission for Healthcare  Information Technology. Specifically, version 3.3 of AHLTA, which is still  undergoing beta testing, was conditionally certified in April 2007 against  2006 outpatient electronic health record criteria established by the  commission. DOD officials stated that AHLTA version 3.3 has been  installed at three DOD locations for beta testing and has met specific  functionality, interoperability, and security requirements. The commission  cannot fully certify this version of AHLTA until it has verified that the  system has been in operational use at a medical site.", "The departments\u2019 efforts to share data and to be involved in  standardization activities are important mechanisms for ensuring that their  electronic health records are both interoperable and aligned with  emerging standards and specifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and VA Have Taken Steps to Establish the Joint Interagency Program Office, but the Office Does Not Yet Have Permanent Leadership, Staff, or Facilities", "paragraphs": ["To accelerate the departments\u2019 ongoing interoperability efforts, Congress  included provisions establishing a joint interagency program office in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Under the act,  the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs were  required to jointly develop schedules and benchmarks for setting up the  DOD/VA Interagency Program Office, as well as for other activities for  achieving interoperable health information (that is, establishing system  requirements, acquisition and testing, and implementation of interoperable  electronic health records or capabilities). The schedules and benchmarks  were due 30 days after passage of the act (February 28, 2008).", "The departments developed a draft implementation plan defining fiscal  years 2008 and 2009 schedules and milestones; the date of the draft was  April 25\u2014almost 2 months after the due date. In the effort to set up the  program office, the departments appointed an Acting Director from DOD  and an Acting Deputy Director from VA on April 17, 2008. According to  the Acting Director, they have also detailed staff and provided temporary  space and equipment to a transition team.", "According to this official, through the efforts of the transition team, the  departments are currently developing a charter for the office, defining and  approving an organizational structure, and preparing to begin recruiting  permanent staff for the office, who are expected to number about 30.  According to the implementation plan, the departments expect to appoint  a permanent Director and Deputy and begin recruiting staff by October  2008. According to the Acting Director, program staff are expected to be in  place, and the office is expected to be fully operational by December 2008.  According to the departments, $4.94 million was requested to fund the  office for fiscal year 2008, which is expected to be received this July.  Funding requirements of $6.94 million for fiscal year 2009 were submitted  in June.", "The draft implementation plan includes schedules and milestones for  achieving interoperable health information in two stages. The first stage\u2014 Interoperability I, to be completed by September 2008\u2014is to address those  health data most commonly required by health care providers, as validated  by the Joint Clinical Information Board. The first milestone for  Interoperability I, sharing vital signs information, has been achieved. The  remaining milestones (sharing questionnaires and forms, family history,  social history, and other history) are all due September 2008.", "The second stage\u2014Interoperability II, to be completed by September  2009\u2014is to address additional health information enhancements.  However, the information to be covered by these enhancements has not  yet been fully defined, and milestone dates are not fully established:    According to the plan, the requirements for the Interoperability II  enhancements are to be validated by the Joint Clinical Information Board,  which sets the clinical priorities for what electronic health information  should be shared next. This validation, followed by approval by senior  department leadership, was to be complete by June 2008. However,  according to department officials, the completion date is now expected to  be the end of July 2008.", "Of 52 milestone dates for Interoperability II, 19 are yet to be determined.", "For example, milestone dates have not been identified regarding  capabilities to share data on exposures to health hazards, immunization  records and history, family history, and psychological health treatment  and care records.", "Officials stated that decisions on these milestone dates will depend on  clinical priorities, technical considerations, and policy decisions. For  example, the exchange of psychological health treatment and care records  requires policy decisions regarding appropriate access. Further, according  to the implementation plan draft, the plan is intended to serve as a \u201cliving  document\u201d that will be updated and refined as more detailed information  becomes known on planned fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009  initiatives, and as health care information needs change.", "According to the Acting Director, the draft implementation plan has not  been finalized because of remaining uncertainties regarding such issues as  space and staffing needs. For example, although the scope of the office\u2019s  responsibility is to be for electronic health records and capabilities, the  departments\u2019 leadership may broaden its scope to include sharing of  personnel and benefits data, which would affect the number of staff  required. However, although the implementation plan (as a planning tool)  is appropriately a living document, it is nonetheless important to complete  the planning and make the decisions needed to finalize the initial plan,  particularly in view of the fast approaching September 2009 deadline.", "Further, according to department officials, the joint interagency program  office will play a crucial role in coordinating the departments\u2019 efforts to  accelerate their interoperability efforts. An important aspect of this  coordination will be managing the further development and  implementation of the DOD/VA Information Interoperability Plan,  currently under review by senior management. According to these  officials, having a centralized office to take on this role will be a primary  benefit. However, the effort to set up the program office is still in its early  stages. The positions of Director and Deputy Director are not yet  permanently filled, permanent staff have not yet been hired, and facilities  have not yet been designated for housing the office.

However, it is not  expected to be fully set up until the end of the year, after which only 9  months will remain to meet the goal of full interoperability between the  departments by September 2009. The implementation plan, which was  almost 2 months late, remains in draft, with many milestone dates yet to  be determined.
