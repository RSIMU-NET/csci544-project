GAO has identified a number of deficiencies at federal agencies that pose threats to their information and systems. For example, agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, have weaknesses with the design and implementation of information security controls, as illustrated by 19 of 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act declaring cybersecurity as a significant deficiency or material weakness for fiscal year 2014.

Federal agencies rely on computer systems to transmit  proprietary and other sensitive information, develop and maintain  intellectual capital, conduct operations, process business transactions,  transfer funds, and deliver services.", "Ineffective protection of these information systems and networks can  impair delivery of vital services, and result in  loss or theft of computer resources, assets, and funds; inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information; disruption of essential operations supporting critical infrastructure,  national defense, or emergency services; undermining of agency missions due to embarrassing incidents that  erode the public\u2019s confidence in government; use of computer resources for unauthorized purposes or to launch  attacks on other systems; damage to networks and equipment; and high costs for remediation.", "Recognizing the importance of these issues, Congress enacted laws  intended to improve the protection of federal information and systems.  These laws include the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of  2014 (FISMA), which, among other things, authorizes the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) to (1) assist the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) with overseeing and monitoring agencies\u2019 implementation  of security requirements; (2) operate the federal information security  incident center; and (3) provide agencies with operational and technical  assistance, such as that for continuously diagnosing and mitigating cyber  threats and vulnerabilities. The act also reiterated the 2002 FISMA  requirement for the head of each agency to provide information security  protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm  resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction of the agency\u2019s information or information  systems.", "In addition, the act continues the requirement for federal agencies to  develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security  program. The program is to provide security for the information and  information systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency, including those provided or managed by another agency,  contractor, or other source."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cyber Threats to Federal Systems Continue to Evolve Amid Increasing Numbers of Incidents", "paragraphs": ["Risks to cyber-based assets can originate from unintentional or  intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused by, among other  things, natural disasters, defective computer or network equipment,  software coding errors, and the actions of careless or poorly trained  employees. Intentional threats include both targeted and untargeted  attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups, hackers,  disgruntled employees and other organizational insiders, foreign nations  engaged in espionage and information warfare, and terrorists.", "These adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, willingness to act,  and motives, which can include seeking monetary or personal gain or  pursuing a political, economic, or military advantage. For example,  organizational insiders can pose threats to an organization since their  position within the organization often allows them to gain unrestricted  access and cause damage to the targeted system, steal system data, or  disclose sensitive information without authorization. The insider threat  includes inappropriate actions by contractors hired by the organization, as  well as careless or poorly trained employees.", "As we reported in February 2015, since fiscal year 2006, the number of  information security incidents affecting systems supporting the federal  government has steadily increased each year: rising from 5,503 in fiscal  year 2006 to 67,168 in fiscal year 2014, an increase of 1,121 percent.  Furthermore, the number of reported security incidents involving PII at  federal agencies has more than doubled in recent years\u2014from 10,481  incidents in fiscal year 2009 to 27,624 incidents in fiscal year 2014. (See  fig 1.)", "These incidents and others like them can adversely affect national  security; damage public health and safety; and lead to inappropriate  access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of sensitive  information. Recent examples highlight the impact of such incidents:  In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management reported that an  intrusion into its systems affected the personnel records of about 4.2  million current and former federal employees. The Director stated that  a separate but related incident involved the agency\u2019s background  investigation systems and compromised background investigation  files for 21.5 million individuals.", "In June 2015, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service  testified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to taxpayer  information from its \u201cGet Transcript\u201d application. According to officials,  criminals used taxpayer-specific data acquired from non-department  sources to gain unauthorized access to information on approximately  100,000 tax accounts. This data included Social Security information,  dates of birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015 update, the  agency reported this number to be about 114,000 and that an  additional 220,000 accounts had been inappropriately accessed,  which brings the total to about 330,000 accounts.", "In April 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector  General reported that two contractors had improperly accessed the  agency\u2019s network from foreign countries using personally owned  equipment.", "In February 2015, the Director of National Intelligence stated that  unauthorized computer intrusions were detected in 2014 on the  networks of the Office of Personnel Management and two of its  contractors.

We and agency inspectors general  have identified numerous weaknesses in protecting federal information  and systems. Agencies continue to have shortcomings in assessing risks,  developing and implementing security controls, and monitoring results.  Specifically, for fiscal year 2014, 19 of the 24 federal agencies covered by  the Chief Financial Officers Act reported that information security control  deficiencies were either a material weakness or a significant deficiency in  internal controls over their financial reporting. Moreover, inspectors  general at 23 of the 24 agencies cited information security as a major  management challenge for their agency.", "As we reported in September 2015, for fiscal year 2014, most of the 24  agencies had weaknesses in the five major categories of information  system controls. These control categories are: (1) access controls,  which limit or detect access to computer resources (data, programs,  equipment, and facilities), thereby protecting them against unauthorized  modification, loss, and disclosure; (2) configuration management controls,  intended to prevent unauthorized changes to information system  resources (for example, software programs and hardware configurations)  and assure that software is current and known vulnerabilities are patched;  (3) segregation of duties, which prevents a single individual from  controlling all critical stages of a process by splitting responsibilities  between two or more organizational groups; (4) contingency planning,  which helps avoid significant disruptions in computer-dependent  operations; and (5) agencywide security management, which provides a  framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that effective  controls are selected, implemented, and operating as intended. (See fig.  2.)", "Access controls: For fiscal year 2014, we, agencies, and inspectors  general reported weaknesses in the electronic and physical controls  to limit, prevent, or detect inappropriate access to computer resources  (data, equipment, and facilities), thereby increasing their risk of  unauthorized use, modification, disclosure, and loss. Access controls  involve the six critical elements described in table 1.", "For fiscal year 2014, 12 agencies had weaknesses reported in protecting  their networks and system boundaries. For example, the access control  lists on one agency\u2019s firewall did not prevent traffic coming or initiated  from the public Internet protocol addresses of a contractor site and a U.S.  telecom corporation from entering its network. Additionally, 20 agencies,  including DHS, had weaknesses reported in their ability to appropriately  identify and authenticate system users. To illustrate, agencies had weak  password controls, such as using system passwords that had not been  changed from the easily guessable default passwords or did not expire.", "Eighteen agencies, including DHS, had weaknesses reported in  authorization controls for fiscal year 2014. For example, one agency had  not consistently or in a timely manner removed, transferred, and/or  terminated employee and contractor access privileges from multiple  systems. Another agency also had granted access privileges  unnecessarily, which sometimes allowed users of an internal network to  read and write files containing sensitive system information. In fiscal year  2014, 4 agencies had weaknesses reported in the use of encryption for  protecting data.", "In addition, DHS and 18 other agencies had weaknesses reported in  implementing an effective audit and monitoring capability. For instance,  one agency did not sufficiently log security-relevant events on the servers  and network devices of a key system. Moreover, 10 agencies, including  DHS, had weaknesses reported in their ability to restrict physical access  or harm to computer resources and protect them from unauthorized loss  or impairment. For example, a contractor of an agency was granted  physical access to a server room without the required approval of the  office director.", "Configuration management: For fiscal year 2014, 22 agencies,  including DHS, had weaknesses reported in controls that are intended  to ensure that only authorized and fully tested software is placed in  operation, software and hardware is updated, information systems are  monitored, patches are applied to these systems to protect against  known vulnerabilities, and emergency changes are documented and  approved. For example, 17 agencies, including DHS, had  weaknesses reported with installing software patches and  implementing current versions of software in a timely manner.", "Segregation of duties: Fifteen agencies, including DHS, had  weaknesses in controls for segregation of duties. These controls are  the policies, procedures, and organizational structure that help to  ensure that one individual cannot independently control all key  aspects of a computer-related operation and thereby take  unauthorized actions or gain unauthorized access to assets or  records. For example, a developer from one agency had been  authorized inappropriate access to the production environment of the  agency\u2019s system.", "Continuity of operations: DHS and 17 other agencies had  weaknesses reported in controls for their continuity of operations  practices for fiscal year 2014. Specifically, 16 agencies did not have a  comprehensive contingency plan. For example, one agency\u2019s  contingency plans had not been updated to reflect changes in the  system boundaries, roles and responsibilities, and lessons learned  from testing contingency plans at alternate processing and storage  sites. Additionally, 15 agencies had not regularly tested their  contingency plans.", "Security management: For fiscal year 2014, DHS and 22 other  agencies had weaknesses reported in security management, which is  an underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at  federal agencies. An agencywide security program, as required by  FISMA, provides a framework for assessing and managing risk,  including developing and implementing security policies and  procedures, conducting security awareness training, monitoring the  adequacy of the entity\u2019s computer-related controls through security  tests and evaluations, and implementing remedial actions as  appropriate.", "We have also identified inconsistencies with the government\u2019s approach  to cybersecurity, including the following:  Overseeing the security controls of contractors providing IT  services. In August 2014, we reported that five of six agencies we  reviewed were inconsistent in overseeing assessments of contractors\u2019  implementation of security controls. This was partly because agencies  had not documented IT security procedures for effectively overseeing  contractor performance. In addition, according to OMB, 16 of 24 agency  inspectors general determined that their agency\u2019s program for managing  contractor systems lacked at least one required element.", "Responding to cyber incidents. In April 2014, we reported that the 24  agencies did not consistently demonstrate that they had effectively  responded to cyber incidents. Specifically, we estimated that agencies  had not completely documented actions taken in response to detected  incidents reported in fiscal year 2012 in about 65 percent of cases. In  addition, the 6 agencies we reviewed had not fully developed  comprehensive policies, plans, and procedures to guide their incident  response activities.", "Responding to breaches of PII. In December 2013, we reported that  eight federal agencies had inconsistently implemented policies and  procedures for responding to data breaches involving PII. In addition,  OMB requirements for reporting PII-related data breaches were not  always feasible or necessary. Thus, we concluded that agencies may not  be consistently taking actions to limit the risk to individuals from PII- related data breaches and may be expending resources to meet OMB  reporting requirements that provide little value.", "Over the last several years, we and agency inspectors general have  made thousands of recommendations to agencies aimed at improving  their implementation of information security controls. For example, we  have made about 2,000 recommendations over the last 6 years. These  recommendations identify actions for agencies to take in protecting their  information and systems. To illustrate, we and inspectors general have  made recommendations for agencies to correct weaknesses in controls  intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computer  resources, such as controls for protecting system boundaries, identifying  and authenticating users, authorizing users to access systems, encrypting  sensitive data, and auditing and monitoring activity on their systems. We  have also made recommendations for agencies to implement their  information security programs and protect the privacy of PII held on their  systems.", "However, many agencies continue to have weaknesses in implementing  these controls in part because many of these recommendations remain  unimplemented. For example, about 42 percent of the recommendations  we have made during the last 6 years remain unimplemented. Until  federal agencies take actions to implement the recommendations made  by us and the inspectors general\u2014federal systems and information, as  well as sensitive personal information about the public, will be at an  increased risk of compromise from cyber-based attacks and other threats.", "In conclusion, the dangers posed by a wide array of cyber threats facing  the nation are heightened by weaknesses in the federal government\u2019s  approach to protecting its systems and information. While recent  government-wide initiatives, including the 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint,  hold promise for bolstering the federal cybersecurity posture, it is  important to note that no single technology or set of practices is sufficient  to protect against all these threats. A \u201cdefense in depth\u201d strategy that  includes well-trained personnel, effective and consistently applied  processes, and appropriately implemented technologies is required.  While agencies have elements of such a strategy in place, more needs to  be done to fully implement it and to address existing weaknesses. In  particular, implementing our and agency inspectors general  recommendations will strengthen agencies\u2019 ability to protect their systems  and information, reducing the risk of a potentially devastating cyber  attack.", "Chairman Lankford, Chairman Perry, Ranking Members Heitkamp and  Watson Coleman, and Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes  my statement.
