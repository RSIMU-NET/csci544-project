Specifically, the biodefense enterprise lacks institutionalized leadership enterprise-wide to provide strategic oversight and coordination. In 2011, GAO reported, there are more than two dozen presidentially appointed individuals with biodefense responsibilities and numerous federal agencies with mission responsibilities for supporting biodefense activities, but no individual or entity with responsibility for overseeing the entire biodefense enterprise. In 2011, GAO reported that the Homeland Security Council (HSC) should consider establishing a focal point for federal biodefense coordination. In December 2014, National Security Council (NSC) staff, which supports the HSC, told GAO that two of its directorates work together as the focal point for federal biodefense efforts. This is an important step in promoting a comprehensive and coordinated approach to biodefense, but strategic leadership issues persist. In October 2015, a report by the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense stated strategic leadership issues persist and called for a focal point to provide strategic leadership, noting that elevating authority above the agency-level can help overcome the challenges faced by the biodefense enterprise. The Study Panel found that White House councils and offices generally only become involved when a specific biodefense issue affects a prominent ongoing responsibility\u2014a method which is not consistent with our call for a strategic approach.", "In 2011, GAO also reported that while some high-level biodefense strategies have been developed, there is no broad, integrated national strategy that encompasses all stakeholders with biodefense responsibilities that can be used to guide the systematic identification of risk; assess resources needed to address those risks; and prioritize and allocate investment across the entire biodefense enterprise. GAO reported that the overarching biodefense enterprise would benefit from strategic oversight mechanisms, including a national strategy, to help ensure efficient, effective, and accountable results, and suggested the HSC take action. However, as of February 2016, such a strategy had not been developed.", "Biosurveillance, an aspect of biodefense, also faces key challenges at all levels of government that transcend what any one agency can address on its own, and our more recent and ongoing work continues to highlight these challenges. In 2010, GAO recommended the HSC establish a focal point to lead the development of a national biosurveillance strategy that clarifies roles and responsibilities, provides goals and performance measures, and identifies resource and investment needs, among other elements. However, the recommendations have not been fully implemented. Since 2009 GAO's has also identified challenges with specific biosurveillance capabilities. Specifically, GAO has identified biosurveillance capability challenges with, among other topics, (1) state and local public heath capabilities, (2) animal health surveillance capabilities, and (3) two Department of Homeland Security biosurveillance efforts\u2014the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC) and the BioWatch Program (which aims to provide early indication of an aerosolized biological weapon attack).

Within biodefense, biosurveillance, as  defined by the July 2012 National Strategy for Biosurveillance, is the  ongoing process of gathering, integrating, interpreting, and  communicating essential information related to all-hazards threats or  disease activity affecting human, animal, or plant health, for the purpose  of (1) achieving early detection and warning, (2) contributing to overall  situational awareness of the health aspects of the incident, and (3)  enabling better decision making at all levels.", "Threats of bioterrorism, such as anthrax attacks, and high-profile disease  outbreaks, such as Ebola in West Africa and emerging arboviruses like  chikungunya and Zika in the Americas, highlight the continued need for  systems that provide early detection and warning about biological threats  to humans.

Infectious  diseases are a continuous threat for reasons that include: (1)  emergence\u2014at times rapid\u2014of new infectious diseases; (2) re- emergence of previously-known infectious diseases; and (3) persistence  of intractable infectious diseases.", "In an era of rapid transit and global trade, the public health and  agricultural industries, as well as natural ecosystems including native  plants and wildlife, face increased threats of naturally occurring outbreaks  of infectious disease and accidental exposure to biological threats.  According to the World Health Organization, infectious diseases are not  only spreading faster, they also appear to be emerging more quickly than  ever before. The ongoing outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas has  heightened travel-related concerns regarding the spread of the virus. As  of March 23, 2016, 273 cases of continental U.S. travel-associated Zika  virus disease have been reported, according to Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC). Figure 2 shows passenger arrivals from  five regions of the world and the top five airports receiving passengers  whose travel originated from each of these regions in 2014.", "According to the World Health Organization, about 75 percent of the new  diseases that have affected humans in recent years are zoonotic and  have been caused by pathogens originating from an animal. These  emerging and reemerging diseases transmit between animals\u2014including  domestic animals and wildlife\u2014and humans. Many of these diseases  have the potential to spread through various means over long distances  and to become global problems. In some cases, disease transmission is  direct, in others the animals act as intermediate or accidental hosts, while  in others transmission occurs, for example, via mosquitoes or ticks.  Examples of emerging and zoonotic diseases include: Zika, chikungunya,  and dengue viruses, West Nile virus, H1N1 (swine) influenza, severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and rabies. Habitat  loss and human encroachment on rural and wildlife environments are  bringing populations of humans and animals, both farmed and wild, into  closer and more-frequent contact. Increasingly, wildlife are involved in the  transmission of diseases to people, pets, and livestock, and managing  wildlife transmitters is an integral part of efforts to control the spread of  zoonotic diseases. Diseases among wildlife can also provide early  warnings of environmental damage, bioterrorism, and other risks to   human health. Finally, potential bioterrorism threats also include the use  of zoonotic diseases as weapons of mass destruction, such as anthrax,  plague, tularemia, and brucellosis.", "Transmission  and detection of Zika,  chikungunya, and dengue viruses Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses are  all spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito,  pictured below. These mosquitoes typically  lay eggs in and near standing water in  containers like buckets, bowls, animal dishes,  flower pots, and vases. They prefer to bite  people, and live both indoors and outdoors.  Mosquitoes that spread dengue,  chikungunya, and Zika are aggressive  daytime biters, but also bite at night.  Mosquitoes can become infected when they  feed on a person already infected with the  virus.  Diagnosing Zika virus infection is complicated  because it is difficult to differentiate it from  other similar diseases, such as dengue or  yellow fever, and some tests for Zika virus  antibodies suffer from cross-reactivity with  antibodies to similar viruses. For example, a  person previously infected with another  flavivirus such as dengue could be falsely  identified as also having been exposed to the  Zika virus (and vice-versa).", "Numerous federal, state, local, and private sector entities have roles and  responsibilities for monitoring for pathogens in human, animal, plant,  food, and the environment. Federal departments, such as the HHS,  USDA, DHS, and the Department of Interior, play leading biosurveillance  roles for certain domains such as human and animal health, food, and air,  but they also rely on support from state and local authorities or partner  with other federal agencies. In other cases federal departments or  agencies play supporting roles. Officials at all levels of government, as  well as Homeland Security Presidential Directive-21\u2019s (HSPD-21) vision  of a national biosurveillance capability, acknowledge that state and local  capabilities are at the heart of the biosurveillance enterprise.

Although these  documents demonstrate clear commitment to coordinating interagency  biodefense efforts, they do not provide the strategic approach that we  suggested in March 2011.

Subsequent to the release of the strategy,  the NSC staff published a companion implementation plan, but it is not  yet clear the extent to which the plan has been widely shared among and  adopted by interagency decision makers as a means to help identify  opportunities to leverage resources and direct priorities.", "The National Strategy for Biosurveillance also does not address issues  we raised related to state and local biosurveillance efforts, and that we  previously recommended. In October 2011, we reported that nonfederal  capabilities should also be considered in creating a national  biosurveillance strategy. The backbone of biosurveillance is traditional  disease-surveillance systems\u2014designed to collect information on the  health of humans and animals to support a variety of public-welfare and  economic goals. These systems support biosurveillance efforts by  recording national health and disease trends and providing specific  information about the scope and projection of outbreaks to inform  response. Because the resources that constitute a national  biosurveillance capability are largely owned by nonfederal entities, a  national strategy that considers how to strengthen and leverage  nonfederal partners could improve efforts to build and maintain a national  biosurveillance capability. Moreover, efforts to build the capability would  benefit from a framework that facilitates assessment of nonfederal  jurisdictions\u2019 baseline capabilities and critical gaps across the entire  biosurveillance enterprise. Such an assessment of capabilities that  support biosurveillance is called for in HSPD-10, which notes that the  United States requires a periodic assessment that identifies gaps or  vulnerabilities in our biodefense capabilities\u2014of which surveillance and  detection is a key part\u2014to guide prioritization of federal investments.  However, in a 2011 report, we noted that the federal government had not  conducted a comprehensive assessment of state and local jurisdictions\u2019  ability to contribute to a national biosurveillance capability.", "While the size, variability, and complexity of the biosurveillance enterprise  makes an assessment difficult, we concluded in our October 2011 report  that the federal government would lack key information about the baseline  status, strengths, weaknesses, and gaps across the biosurveillance  enterprise until it conducts such an assessment. To address these issues,  and building on our June 2010 recommendation to develop a national  biosurveillance strategy, we recommended for such a strategy to (1)  incorporate a means to leverage existing efforts that support nonfederal  biosurveillance capabilities, (2) consider challenges that nonfederal  jurisdictions face, and (3) include a framework to develop a baseline and  gap assessment of nonfederal jurisdictions\u2019 capabilities.

In our October 2011 report on nonfederal biosurveillance  efforts, we found many of the challenges that state and local officials  identified were similar to issues we reported regarding biosurveillance at  the federal level. We noted that many of the challenges facing the  biosurveillance enterprise were complex, inherent to building capabilities  that cross traditional boundaries, and not easily resolved.", "State and Local Public Health Capabilities. In 2011, we found that  state and local officials identified common challenges to developing and  maintaining their biosurveillance capabilities such as (1) state policies in  response to state budget constraints that restricted hiring, travel, and  training; (2) obtaining and maintaining resources, such as adequate  workforce, equipment, and systems; and (3) the lack of strategic planning  and leadership to support long-term investment in crosscutting core  capabilities, integrated biosurveillance, and effective partnerships. For  example, state and local officials we surveyed reported facing workforce  shortages among skilled professionals\u2014epidemiologists, informaticians,  statisticians, laboratory staff, animal-health staff, or animal-disease  specialists. We also found that although the federal government provided  some resources to help control disease in humans and animals in tribal  and insular areas, there were no specific efforts to ensure that their efforts  can contribute to the national biosurveillance capability. Additionally, in  2011, we found that nonfederal partners relied heavily on grants and  cooperative agreements to sustain their biosurveillance capabilities. For  example, the Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative  agreement (PHEP) and the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for  Infectious Diseases cooperative agreement (ELC) were essential for  public health epidemiology and laboratory staff. We concluded that  without assessing the baseline nonfederal capabilities that support  biosurveillance, identification of investment needs for a national  biosurveillance capability cannot be established.", "Animal Surveillance Capabilities. In the area of animal surveillance, we  reported in May 2013 that USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service (APHIS) had developed a new approach for its livestock and  poultry surveillance activities, but had not yet integrated these efforts into  an overall strategy with goals and performance measures aligned with the  nation\u2019s larger biosurveillance policy. Under its prior approach, APHIS  focused its disease surveillance programs on preventing the introduction  of certain foreign animal diseases and monitoring, detecting, and  eradicating other reportable diseases already present in domestic herds.  Under this previous approach, information about nonreportable diseases,  including those that are new or reemerging, was not always captured by  the agency\u2019s disease surveillance efforts. We also reported in 2013 that  under its new approach APHIS had begun to broaden its approach by  monitoring the overall health of livestock and poultry and using additional  sources and types of data to better detect and control new or reemerging  diseases. For example, APHIS had been monitoring for the presence of  pseudorabies\u2014a viral swine disease that may cause respiratory illness  and death\u2014at slaughter facilities, but under the new approach, it  proposed monitoring these facilities for a range of other diseases as well.  However, we concluded that without integrating APHIS\u2019s new approach to  livestock and poultry surveillance activities into an overall strategy with  goals and measures aligned with broader national homeland security  efforts to detect biological threats, APHIS may not be ideally positioned to  support national efforts to address the next threat to animal and human  health. We recommended that APHIS integrate its new surveillance  approach with an overall strategy that guides how its new approach will  support national homeland security efforts to enhance the detection of  biological threats. However, while the agency agreed, this  recommendation has not been implemented.", "DHS Biosurveillance Efforts. In 2015, we identified persistent  challenges related to two of DHS\u2019s biosurveillance capabilities, NBIC and  the BioWatch program. We reported in 2009 that NBIC was not fully  equipped to carry out its mission because it lacked key resources\u2014data  and personnel\u2014from its partner agencies, which may have been at least  partially the result of collaboration challenges it faced. For example,  some partners reported that they did not trust NBIC to use their  information and resources appropriately, while others were not convinced  of the value that working with NBIC provided because NBIC\u2019s mission  was not clearly articulated. In the 2009 report, we recommended that  NBIC develop a strategy for addressing barriers to collaboration and  develop accountability mechanisms to monitor these efforts. DHS agreed,  and in August 2012, NBIC issued the NBIC Strategic Plan, which is  intended to provide NBIC\u2019s strategic vision, clarify the center\u2019s mission  and purpose, and articulate the value that NBIC seeks to provide to its  partners, among other things. In September 2015, we reported that  despite NBIC\u2019s efforts to collaborate with interagency partners to create  and issue a strategic plan that would clarify its mission and efforts, a  variety of challenges remained. Notably, many of its federal partners  continued to express uncertainty about the value NBIC provided. We  identified options for policy or structural changes that could help NBIC  better fulfill its biosurveillance integration mission, such as changes to  NBIC\u2019s roles, but we did not make specific recommendations.", "Additionally, since 2012, we have reported that DHS has faced  challenges in clearly justifying the need for the BioWatch program and its  ability to reliably address that need (to detect aerosolized biological  attacks). In September 2012, we found that DHS approved a next- generation BioWatch acquisition in October 2009 without fully developing  knowledge that would help ensure sound investment decision making and  pursuit of optimal solutions. We recommended that before continuing  the acquisition, DHS reevaluate the mission need and possible  alternatives based on cost-benefit and risk information. DHS concurred  and in April 2014, canceled the acquisition because an alternatives  analysis did not confirm an overwhelming benefit to justify the cost.  Having canceled the next generation acquisition, DHS continues to rely  on the currently-deployed BioWatch system for early detection of an  aerosolized biological attack. However, in 2015, we found that DHS lacks  reliable information about the current system\u2019s technical capabilities to  detect a biological attack, in part because in the 12 years since  BioWatch\u2019s initial deployment, DHS has not developed technical  performance requirements for the system. We reported in October 2015  that DHS commissioned tests of the current system\u2019s technical  performance characteristics, but without performance requirements, DHS  cannot interpret the test results and draw conclusions about the system\u2019s  ability to detect attacks.
