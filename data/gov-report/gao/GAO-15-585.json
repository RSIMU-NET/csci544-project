For example, OPM does not report whether annual EEI changes are statistically significant\u2014that is, whether the changes were meaningful or due to random chance. Likewise, OPM does not analyze which FEVS questions are associated with higher EEI scores. This information would help agencies better focus their efforts to improve engagement and target resources.

Employee engagement is particularly important within  federal agencies, where employees influence the well-being and safety of  the public in myriad ways, such as by conducting advanced scientific  research, verifying and administering benefits, or ensuring the safety of  our workplaces, airports, and national borders. However, government- wide levels of employee engagement have recently declined 4  percentage points, from an estimated 67 percent in 2011, to an estimated  63 percent in 2014, as measured by the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), and  a score OPM derived from the FEVS beginning in 2010\u2014the Employee  Engagement Index (EEI).", "In advance of the 2015 FEVS cycle, which began this spring, the  administration elevated the importance of strengthening employee  engagement across government. For example, strengthening employee  engagement is one of three subgoals of the People and Culture Cross  Agency Priority (CAP) goal, established under the GPRA Modernization  Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). Moreover, agency leaders are to be held  accountable for making employee engagement a priority, as well as an  integral part of their agency\u2019s performance management system. The  administration also set a goal for these efforts: by the issuance of the  2016 FEVS results, the federal government is expected to increase  employee engagement\u2014as measured by the EEI\u2014from 63 percent to 67  percent.

We started with 2006 to include  trends across two different presidential administrations. Because OPM  calculates the EEI and its component scores at the group level, we used  data from OPM to recalculate the EEI for each individual, which enabled  us to conduct regression analysis and assess the statistical significance  of changes in the EEI. The individual level calculation is scaled between 0  and 100 and is based on the proportion of each individual\u2019s positive  responses to the 15 constituent EEI questions. For 2006 and 2008, we  calculated the EEI using only 11 of the 15 EEI questions because the  2006 and 2008 surveys did not include four EEI questions that were  added to the survey in 2010.

At Education, one of our case study  agencies, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) implemented  a process to help ensure that constructive performance conversations  regularly occur. In addition to department-wide requirements for  supervisors to hold two performance conversations a year, OCIO officials  said that they require all supervisors to offer OCIO employees optional  quarterly conversations. These quarterly performance conversations are  guided by a set of specific topics that supervisors and employees  developed together to ensure that employees receive consistent and  regular constructive feedback and coaching.", "Career development and training. Our analysis found that career  development and training was the second strongest driver. For the  question, \u201cI am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my  organization,\u201d we found that, controlling for other factors, someone who  answered \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to that question would have, on average, an  engagement score that was 16 percentage points higher than someone  who answered \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d", "As we found in 2004, the essential aim of training and development  programs is to assist an agency in achieving its mission and goals by  improving individual and, ultimately, organizational performance.

FTC officials implemented an outreach  strategy to inform staff about child and elder care resources after  learning that employees were not aware of the services or did not  know that they qualified for these services. Officials said employee  knowledge of and agency commitment to these kinds of programs  enhances supervisor support for work-life balance. Similarly, to  support work-life balance, as part of its engagED initiative,  Education revised telework policies, provided training for  managers and employees on the new polices and on working in a  telework environment, and improved infrastructure to make  telework as effective as time spent in the office, according to  Education officials.", "Inclusive work environment.

FTC officials emphasized the importance of creating a line  of sight between the agency\u2019s mission and the work of each employee.  As we have previously reported, successful organizations create a \u201cline of  sight\u201d showing how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute  to overall organizational results. FTC officials said that the agency lists  every employee that contributed to a case in the pleadings, from the  attorneys and paralegals to the information technology specialists who  provided computer support. Officials said that legal actions are the  culmination of the efforts of many employees, both mission and mission- support staff, and including their names on pleadings helps create a line  of sight from each employee\u2019s contribution to the organization\u2019s success.  Further, FTC officials said they recognize how mission support functions,  such as excellent human resources customer service contribute to the  agency mission. For example, FTC officials said that they emphasize to  the human resources staff that their prompt handling of payroll and  benefits issues contributes to the overall efficiency and mission  accomplishment by minimizing the time other FTC employees expend on  these concerns.

According to officials at all three of our case study  agencies, they all reach out to employees and their labor union  representatives, if applicable, to obtain insight into their FEVS scores or  to inform other improvement efforts. Our 2003 report found that employee  involvement strengthens the improvement process by including frontline  perspectives and experiences. By participating in improvement task  teams, employees have additional opportunities to share their  experiences and shape policies and procedures as they are being  developed and implemented. For example, in 2012, while NCUA\u2019s EEI  score was above the government-wide level, FEVS questions about  awards, performance appraisals, and merit-based promotions were its  lowest scoring categories. NCUA officials said they contracted with an  external facilitator to conduct workshops and webinar-based feedback  sessions with employees to gain insight into their FEVS results and  identify root causes influencing the survey scores. These officials said  that using external facilitators offered employees confidentiality and  created an environment that encouraged open conversations. Based on  these feedback sessions, NCUA created an internal employee-driven  committee to inform revisions to the awards, performance appraisals, and  merit-based promotion process, and developed recommendations for  NCUA\u2019s management to implement these changes.

For  example, a manager might assume an annual increase in the EEI meant  specific engagement efforts were successful when they were not or  assume an annual decline in the EEI meant specific engagement efforts  were not successful and abandon an effort too soon. Statistical  significance is a function of two things: (1) the size of the change\u2014the  increase or decrease in the EEI, and (2) the size of the population  sampled. In general, the smaller the sample, the larger the change needs  to be before it is statistically significant, and the larger the sample, the  smaller a change needs to be to be significant. In FEVS, sample sizes  tend to be substantially smaller at smaller agencies. For example, from  2013 to 2014 the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, with a  workforce of over 200 employees, had a 2 percentage point change in the  EEI, which was not statistically significant, based on the method we used  to determine statistical significance.
