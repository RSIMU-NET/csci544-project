Advanced technology vehicles powered by alternative fuels, such as electricity and ethanol, are one way to reduce oil consumption. The federal government set a goal for federal agencies to use plug-in hybrid electric vehicles--vehicles that run on both gasoline and batteries charged by connecting a plug into an electric power source--as they become available at a reasonable cost. This goal is on top of other requirements agencies must meet for conserving energy. In response to a request, GAO examined the (1) potential benefits of plug-ins, (2) factors affecting the availability of plug-ins, and (3) challenges to incorporating plug-ins into the federal fleet. GAO reviewed literature on plug-ins, federal legislation, and agency policies and interviewed federal officials, experts, and industry stakeholders, including auto and battery manufacturers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Increasing the use of plug-ins could result in environmental and other benefits, but realizing these benefits depends on several factors. Because plug-ins are powered at least in part by electricity, they could significantly reduce oil consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. For plug-ins to realize their full potential, electricity would need to be generated from lower-emission fuels such as nuclear and renewable energy rather than the fossil fuels--coal and natural gas--used most often to generate electricity today. However, new nuclear plants and renewable energy sources can be controversial and expensive. In addition, research suggests that for plug-ins to be cost-effective relative to gasoline vehicles the price of batteries must come down significantly and gasoline prices must be high relative to electricity. Auto manufacturers plan to introduce a range of plug-in models over the next 6 years, but several factors could delay widespread availability and affect the extent to which consumers are willing to purchase plug-ins. For example, limited battery manufacturing, relatively low gasoline prices, and declining vehicle sales could delay availability and discourage consumers. Other factors may emerge over the longer term if the use of plug-ins increases, including managing the impact on the electrical grid (the network linking the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity) and increasing consumer access to public charging infrastructure needed to charge the vehicles. The federal government has supported plug-in-related research and initiated new programs to encourage manufacturing. Experts also identified options for providing additional federal support. To incorporate plug-ins into the federal fleet, agencies will face challenges related to cost, availability, planning, and federal requirements. Plug-ins are expected to have high upfront costs when they are first introduced. However, they could become comparable to gasoline vehicles over the life of ownership if certain factors change, such as a decrease in the cost of batteries and an increase in gasoline prices. Agencies vary in the extent to which they use life-cycle costing when evaluating which vehicle to purchase. Agencies also may find that plug-ins are not available to them, especially when the vehicles are initially introduced because the number available to the government may be limited. In addition, agencies have not made plans to incorporate plug-ins due to uncertainties about vehicle cost, performance, and infrastructure needs. Finally, agencies must meet a number of requirements covering energy use and vehicle acquisition--such as acquiring alternative fuel vehicles and reducing facility energy and petroleum consumption--but these sometimes conflict with one another. For example, plugging vehicles into federal facilities could reduce petroleum consumption but increase facility energy use. The federal government has not yet provided information to agencies on how to set priorities for these requirements or leverage different types of vehicles to do so. Without such information, agencies face challenges in making decisions about acquiring plug-ins that will meet the requirements, as well as maximize plug-ins' potential benefits and minimize costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation faces a number of energy-related challenges, including heavy  reliance on oil, environmental stress from greenhouse gas emissions  caused by burning fossil fuels, and public health problems associated with  local air pollution.

To broaden our understanding of  the potential benefits, current status of development, and factors that  could delay availability of plug-ins, we analyzed research studies and  interviewed experts from industry, academic, and government sources. To  determine the current status of plug-in vehicles, we obtained information  directly from Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Phoenix Motorcars (a small  manufacturer of all-electric vehicles), Toyota, and the Association of  International Automobile Manufacturers. We also reviewed published  material on other auto manufacturers\u2019 Web sites about the plug-ins that  manufacturers plan to bring to market.

We used professional judgment in identifying the relative  benefits and limitations of these options. To identify the challenges of  incorporating plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles into the federal fleet,  we reviewed federal fleet documents and relevant laws and regulations  governing fleet management and procurement.

Similarly, construction of some  renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines, can be controversial.", "In addition, in regions of the country that are heavily reliant on coal for  power generation, conventional hybrids might offer greater CO emissions than a conventional hybrid. Thus, in the immediate future, plug-ins could be used to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions\u2014relative to conventional hybrids\u2014in regions of the country  where electricity is already generated from low-carbon energy sources.  For example, a plug-in vehicle charging in a coal-reliant state may not  reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to a conventional hybrid. But a  plug-in charging in a state that relies heavily on hydropower would  substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, developing  policy or incentives to encourage consumers to buy plug-ins only in  regions with low-carbon energy sources could be difficult and may not  correspond with manufacturers\u2019 business plans.", "Plug-ins could also reduce emissions that affect air quality. About 50  percent of Americans live in areas where levels of one or more air  pollutants are high enough to affect public health. Research we reviewed  indicated that plug-ins could shift air pollutant emissions away from  population centers even if there was no change in the fuel used to generate  electricity (e.g., if low-emitting renewable sources were not substituted for  higher-emitting sources). For example, a study from the University of  Texas modeled the potential impact plug-in hybrids could have on the  formation of smog in a region of the country that relies heavily on coal for  power generation. Specifically, the study estimated that using plug-in  hybrids substantially reduced smog in major cities if they were charged at  night. These benefits remained even if nighttime power generation had to  be increased to full capacity to meet additional demand. One potential  downside the study identified was that rural areas near power plants could  experience an increase in the overall amount of airborne emissions.  However, since power generation would be increased at night, pollutants  would not be exposed to sunlight, which would limit the production of  smog. This benefit would depend on consumers adopting a substantial  number of plug-ins.", "Finally, plug-in vehicles, which are expected to use lithium-ion batteries,  could also provide environmental benefits by reducing toxic waste that  would otherwise be generated from car batteries. Compared with lead acid  batteries in gasoline vehicles and nickel metal hydride batteries used in  conventional hybrid vehicles, lithium-ion batteries produce insignificant  levels of toxic waste, which means they are less likely to pose  environmental challenges in disposal. However, extracting lithium from  locations where it is abundant, such as in South America, could pose  environmental challenges that would damage the ecosystems in these  areas. Furthermore, lithium-ion batteries can pose challenges and  potential costs and risks related to safety and transport. For example,  lithium-ion batteries have previously posed a risk of \u201cthermal runaway,\u201d in  which the batteries overheat and catch fire. Mitigating this safety issue is a  priority of battery manufacturers, and one battery manufacturer we visited  showed us several innovations to ensure that this would not be a risk  while operating the vehicle.

According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2007 about 58  percent of the oil consumed in the United States was imported. Through  their potential to reduce oil consumption overall, plug-ins could help to  reduce consumption of oil coming from foreign sources, but they could  also create a reliance on another foreign resource. Specifically, most of the  world\u2019s reserves of lithium, which is needed to manufacture batteries for  plug-ins, are located abroad, predominately in South America and China  (see table 2). The United States has supplies of lithium, but if demand for  lithium exceeded domestic supplies, or if lithium from overseas is less  expensive, the United States could substitute reliance on one foreign  resource (oil) for another (lithium). The consequences of relying on  foreign sources of lithium could vary. On one hand, to the extent that this  product is less expensive and readily available, as has often been the case  for foreign sources of oil, manufacturers would be able to produce  batteries at lower cost. On the other hand, if lithium supplies prove  unstable\u2014for example, due to political unrest in the countries in which  they are located\u2014or follow a similar pattern of price shocks as has oil,  cost and risk for battery and plug-in manufacturers would increase.", "Furthermore, manufacturing batteries to mass produce plug-ins could be  limited by the amount of lithium that can be extracted and produced.  According to EPA officials, there is considerable disagreement on the  ultimate worldwide supply of lithium, making it difficult to determine how  many (or how few) batteries for plug-in vehicles could be manufactured in  the long term. In addition, while current levels of global production  (mining and refining) of lithium are measurable, other uncertainties\u2014such  as how much lithium will be needed in each battery\u2014make it difficult to  determine whether current levels of lithium production will need to be  increased to meet demand.", "Despite these issues, reliance on foreign sources of lithium may not pose  the same dependence issues as oil. For example, industry officials told us  that lithium, including that from spent car batteries, is highly recyclable, so  some future demand could be met by ensuring that sufficient recycling  processes are in place. Industry officials also noted that the current  recycling process used for car batteries\u2014which has a high rate of  participation by consumers, auto dealerships, and parts suppliers\u2014could  be adapted to lithium ion batteries. In addition, technology such as  ultracapacitors, which are energy storage devises that are an alternative to  batteries and that do not need lithium, or batteries that use materials  besides lithium, which are being researched by at least one auto  manufacturer, could be used in plug-ins.

Ultimately, however, these batteries may become more  affordable.

These factors could create a  deterrent for consumers who might otherwise consider converting their  vehicles and, according to GSA and DOE officials, have prevented the  federal fleet from using this option to save fuel.", "However, both domestic and foreign auto manufacturers have announced  plans to develop plug-in hybrids and mass produce additional all-electric  vehicles. In the near term\u20142009 through 2012\u2014plug-ins are expected to  include sports cars, compact sedans, SUVs, at least one all-electric pickup  truck, and a commercial all-electric van. In 2013 and 2014, the number of  models of cars and SUVs\u2014both plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles\u2014 will expand, and a minivan may be introduced (see table 4). Information  from the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers suggests  that Asian manufacturers will focus on producing all-electric and  conventional hybrid vehicles and that only one plug-in hybrid is currently  being planned. Domestic auto manufacturers are planning more plug-in  hybrids, in addition to all-electric vehicles, and plan to expand  conventional hybrid technology to existing gasoline-fueled models.  However, the bankruptcy and restructuring of Chrysler and General  Motors could affect these plans. As explained in the note in table 4, we  received information on these plans directly from Chrysler, General  Motors, and other auto manufacturers.", "The planned vehicles will have a range of capacities. The expected all-electric  driving range of plug-in hybrids varies from a low of 10 miles per charge for  the planned plug-in version of the Saturn VUE to a 50-mile all-electric range  per charge for the Fisker Automotive Karma. Many of the planned all-electric  vehicles are expected to have a driving range of about 100 miles on a single  charge, although Tesla Motors plans to introduce an all-electric sedan with a  range of 300 miles. As discussed earlier, the larger batteries necessary for  plug-in vehicles will result in these initial vehicles being considerably more  expensive than comparable vehicles. For example, Phoenix Motorcars\u2019 all- electric pickup truck is expected to retail for $47,500, which is about 81  percent higher than the $26,175 suggested retail price of the comparably sized  Ford F-150 pickup truck. Similarly the Chevrolet Volt is expected to retail for  about $40,000 when it is first marketed, and it will be sized somewhere  between a Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G6. The Volt\u2019s retail price is about  $25,000 higher than the Chevrolet Cobalt and about $20,000 more than the  Pontiac G6."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of Battery Technology, Limited Charging Infrastructure, and Current Economic Conditions Could Delay Plug-ins and Affect Consumer Demand", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Factors Associated with Battery Development", "paragraphs": ["Achieving economies of scale to help lower the cost of plug-in batteries  will be difficult.

Inadequate manufacturing  processes will likely result in batteries that are more likely to fail. In  addition, industry officials told us that most battery component  manufacturing and assembly of battery packs is done abroad, and there is  limited manufacturing capacity worldwide. While some manufacturers  have announced plans to establish battery plants domestically, the capital  investments will be significant. Congress established a program to assist  companies interested in developing these plants in the Recovery Act. In  addition, some industry participants told us that the purchasing power of  the federal fleet could help manufacturers achieve economies of scale in  battery manufacturing. However, with a total purchase of about 70,000  vehicles in 2008, and with only about 20,000 passenger sedans being  purchased annually, the purchasing power of the federal government is  small relative to the overall auto market. For example, about 13 million  vehicles were sold in the United States in 2008 and about 16 million in  2007.", "In addition, questions about the potential longevity of lithium batteries  remain and have caused at least one prominent manufacturer to be  conservative in its plans to develop plug-ins. In early tests, and under  testing conditions, lithium-ion batteries have been shown to last for a  sufficient number of charging cycles to enable plug-ins to have a  comparable lifetime to conventional automobiles. However, if the batteries  prove unreliable in real world conditions, manufacturers could be exposed  to significant costs associated with warranties.

One study estimated  that about 40 percent of consumers do not have access to an outlet near  their vehicle at home. Consumers without ready access to an outlet, such  as those who only have street parking, would need public charging  infrastructure, which manufacturers and others told us could be installed  at the relatively low cost of perhaps a few thousand dollars for a new  charging box. By comparison, ethanol (E85), another alternative to  petroleum, has struggled to make inroads as an alternative transportation  fuel, in part because it can cost up to $62,400 to install a new E85 fuel  pump. However, public charging infrastructure would require  establishment of a new system for building outlets and billing for the  power dispensed, whereas fueling stations for gasoline vehicles are  already widely available.", "In addition, plug-ins could increase demand for electrical power and, over  time, power companies may have to generate more electricity to meet this  demand, depending on when and how often vehicles were charged.  Results from a Duke University study suggested that if plug-in hybrids  reached 56 percent of the cars on the road by 2030, they would require an  increase in electricity production, much of which would likely come from  additional coal plants. Although an increase in coal consumption would  produce additional carbon dioxide emissions, the study noted that if this  increased consumption came during off peak hours, power companies  would likely build additional capacity that produces electricity more  efficiently and\u2014excluding upfront capital costs\u2014at lower cost on a daily  operational basis. In the near term, a study by the World Wildlife  Federation using 2005 levels of power generation estimated that 1 million  plug-in hybrids would demand 0.04 percent of the nation\u2019s power. In  addition, a 2006 analysis by the Pacific National Laboratory estimated that,  if plug-ins were charged during off-peak hours, about 84 percent of cars,  SUVs, and pickup trucks on the road in 2001 could be supported without  building new electricity-generation capacity. The variations in these  studies are a consequence of different assumptions, and ultimately only  real-world experience will show the actual demand for power.", "Thus, a large number of plug-ins could be put into use with available  power, if consumers charge their plug-ins during off-peak hours. To  encourage consumers to do so, cheaper rates for electricity could be  charged after a certain hour at night. However, power companies would  need to be able to apply different rates during off-peak hours and would  need to make this cost advantage evident to consumers on their bills or  through some other means, such as new technology. Such technology, or  \u201csmart charging infrastructure,\u201d would likely need to include features that  allow consumers to indicate by what time the car needs to be charged and  a way to meter and bill consumers different prices for on- and off-peak  consumption.

To initiate this test fleet,  DOE established partnerships with organizations such as power  companies, local government agencies, and others across the United  States and Canada. DOE covered half the cost of converting a  conventional hybrid to a plug-in hybrid, as well as the cost of the devices  to collect and transmit data on fuel economy, charging patterns, and driver  behavior back to the lab. In addition, DOE is administering a $30 million  grant program to facilitate the deployment of demonstration vehicles to  accelerate improvements to plug-in vehicle technology.

The credit increases with the size of the battery up to $7,500 but is not  applicable for vehicles over 14,000 pounds. In addition, the Recovery Act  established a credit of up to $2,500 for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and  low-speed four-wheeled plug-in vehicles, such as neighborhood electric  vehicles, and establishes a credit of 10 percent of the cost of converting a  vehicle\u2014up to $4,000\u2014for the conversion of existing vehicles to run on  battery power. One study has indicated that smaller batteries that are  more frequently charged may be more cost-effective solutions for reducing  greenhouse gas emissions, but this tax credit program benefits plug-ins  with larger batteries. In addition, tax incentives aimed at consumers with  the oldest and least fuel-efficient vehicles can encourage them to retire  these vehicles and replace them with plug-ins, thus resulting in a greater  public benefit than replacing vehicles with average or higher fuel  economy.

However, if batteries  prove to be unreliable, the government would be exposed to additional  costs. To mitigate consumer reluctance to buy vehicles from a financially  distressed company, Treasury provided $280 million to Chrysler and $360  million to General Motors to back warranties of these companies. As of  June 2009, Treasury officials noted that Chrysler and General Motors  continue to support their warranties and Treasury believes that the money  provided to them will be returned to Treasury. We were not able to find  estimates of the cost of this approach if it were to be applied to plug-in  vehicles. Furthermore, if such funding were directed to troubled  manufacturers, these costs would be in addition to the $17.4 billion  already provided by the government to Chrysler and General Motors  through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

If a cap-and-trade program, or  carbon tax, were applied to transportation fuels, it could make the life- cycle costs of plug-ins more competitive with other vehicles, depending on  its effect in changing the price differential of gasoline relative to  electricity. An energy bill that includes a carbon cap-and-trade program  was introduced in the 111th Congress, and the administration has  indicated an interest in supporting such a program. Some economists  advocate using revenue from a cap-and-trade program to lower income  taxes, which could offset some of the increased cost consumers would  experience from higher fuel prices.", "To enhance consumer acceptance of the technology and once reasonably  accurate information on the performance of plug-ins is available, the  government could play a role in providing consumer education. At the  most basic level, the government could provide information to help  consumers make the decision to invest in plug-ins by, for example,  showing the extent to which fuel savings may offset the initial higher cost  of plug-ins. In addition, it could inform consumers of potential electrical  updates that may be needed in a home, such as a dedicated circuit for  charging a plug-in, to prevent consumers from becoming frustrated once  they bring their vehicles home. Finally, the government could provide  information to help consumers use the technology more wisely. For  example, it could explain the effects of driving style on plug-in hybrid fuel  economy and the potential cost savings of charging during off-peak hours.  The government already provides similar types of information on vehicles  through sources such as its fuel economy Web site.", "Government may also need to both provide and standardize how some  information on the performance of vehicles is communicated to  consumers. For example, car companies are currently required to post  EPA-validated fuel economy labels on new cars, but consumers may need  other kinds of metrics about plug-ins, such as the length of time it takes to  charge one with a 110- or 220-volt plug, and how far the different vehicles  can go before they require charging or will begin to rely on gasoline for  additional power. Such options could increase the regulatory role played  by the federal government. However, EPA already plays a role in providing  information on vehicle fuel economy and may be able to adapt current  processes to include information on plug-ins.", "In the longer term, government could help facilitate smart charging by  helping to develop the necessary infrastructure, which includes meters  and a standardized communications between power companies and  consumers.

Agencies also have not formulated plans for  incorporating plug-ins into their fleets, largely because information they  would need is not yet available. Finally, agencies may have difficulty  meeting the federal goal of acquiring plug-in hybrids, as it conflicts with  some federal requirements and agencies lack guidance on how to  negotiate this situation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "High Upfront Costs of Plug-ins Will Initially Create a Challenge for Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Just as the high initial cost of plug-ins may hinder consumer adoption of  these vehicles, it will also limit agencies ability to acquire them. Plug-ins  are likely to cost significantly more than comparably sized gasoline- powered vehicles, and because the upfront cost of a vehicle is a key factor  when agencies select a vehicle, federal customers will likely not be able to  purchase or lease many of these vehicles without additional funding to  help cover costs. Thus, as a practical matter, agencies\u2019 budgets will  determine the extent to which they can integrate plug-in hybrids and all- electric vehicles into their fleets. GSA typically negotiates with auto  manufacturers for significantly discounted prices for the vehicles it  purchases and leases for federal agencies\u2014typically more than 40 percent  below the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. (See app. II for more  information on GSA procurement processes.) For example, GSA offers  agencies a Ford F-150 pickup truck for $15,111 (about an $11,000 discount  to the suggested retail price), a Chevrolet Cobalt for $12,600 (about a  $2,400 discount), and a 4-cylinder Pontiac G6 for $14,000 (about a $6,000  discount). GSA officials did not think they would be able to obtain the  usual discount for early plug-ins since auto manufacturers are often  reluctant to offer the same discounts for new model lines because they can  better recover their start-up costs in the retail market. Therefore, since  discounted plug-in hybrids will not likely be offered to the government, the  cost differential between plug-ins and comparable vehicles\u2014including  other alternative fuel vehicles such as flex-fuel vehicles\u2014could be even  greater for the government than it would be for an individual consumer.", "The additional expense of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles could  also make it more difficult to incorporate leased plug-ins into the fleet.  GSA officials said that their authorization limits the agency\u2019s ability to  replace existing vehicles with plug-ins in its leasing program, at least  initially. Because the high cost of plug-ins will stretch thin GSA\u2019s revolving  fund\u2019s ability to absorb costs over the life of the lease, GSA would need  additional funding upfront to cover the higher costs of plug-ins. It could  subsequently recover some of these costs by setting the lease rates for  agencies at a level that would replenish these funds. However, this  additional cost would cause lease rates for plug-ins to not be competitive  with lease rates for similarly sized vehicles. In addition, GSA determines  its lease rates for vehicles not just based on the initial price but also the  price they can get for the vehicle in the used car market. However,  uncertainties regarding the resale value of plug-ins will make it difficult for  GSA to lower the lease rate based on the amount of money it could recoup  through resale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Life-Cycle Cost Analysis Is Not Widely Used in Making Choices between Vehicles, and Agencies Do Not Have Information Needed to Compare Plug-ins with Other Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["Executive Order 13423 directs agencies to begin purchasing plug-in  hybrids once they are reasonably comparable on a life-cycle cost basis  with conventional vehicles. A life-cycle cost analysis includes factors such  as the expected total fuel and maintenance costs of a vehicle over the  years that the agency would operate it. This helps the purchaser  determine the best long-term value for the investment. The Federal  Acquisition Regulation does not explicitly require agencies to perform life- cycle cost analysis for their acquisitions, including vehicles they acquire,  although agencies are free to do so.", "Among the agencies we reviewed, the use of life-cycle cost analysis varied,  and according to FEDFLEET, an organization representing federal fleet  managers, most agencies do not use life-cycle costing when evaluating  which vehicles to purchase. When selecting vehicles, fleet managers with  whom we spoke said they primarily consider mission needs, upfront costs,  and federal goals and requirements, rather than long-term savings.  However, of the agencies we reviewed, only agencies within DOD\u2014the Air  Force, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014reported that they evaluate life-cycle  costs to differentiate between multiple vehicles that met the agencies\u2019  needs.", "In order to conduct analysis of life-cycle costs, agencies need access to  information that would enable such an analysis, such as estimates of  lifetime fuel economy, and ongoing maintenance and repair data for  specific vehicles. GSA officials told us that some information on life-cycle  costs of vehicles is available though a database that houses information on  fuel consumption reported by agencies, and that GSA Fleet would have  some information on lifetime maintenance costs of some vehicles. In  addition, life-cycle cost estimates for existing vehicles are available from  public sources of automotive information. However, such information for  specific vehicles is not readily available from GSA. For example,  AutoChoice, a Web site developed by GSA to provide information to  agencies on vehicles available for purchase, includes information about  upfront costs and vehicle performance characteristics (such as engine size  and fuel economy) but does not include information on total cost of  ownership, such as estimated lifetime fuel or maintenance costs.", "For comparable conventional gasoline vehicles in the same class,  differences in life-cycle costs may not be significant, but differences could  arise when comparing a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle to a plug- in hybrid or all-electric vehicle, depending on a number of factors.  However, since plug-in hybrids are not currently available in the  marketplace, much of the information about their lifetime ownership costs  is unknown. First, the fuel economy of planned plug-in hybrids has not  been announced and will vary greatly depending on how agencies plan to  use them. For example, plug-in hybrids used only within the all-electric  range will use no gasoline at all, while plug-in hybrids used for long- distance driving may not offer fuel economy much better than a  conventional hybrid or highly fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicle.  Secondly, their maintenance costs could be significantly more or less than  conventional technology. For example, failure of vehicle batteries\u2013\u2013which  will likely be the vehicles\u2019 most expensive component\u2013\u2013after warranties  expire could entail significant costs for agencies. In addition, some  maintenance issues may involve proprietary considerations or require  additional specialized training for maintenance staff among agencies that  service their own vehicles. Conversely, to the extent that plug-in vehicles  will have fewer moving parts, they may offer significantly lower  maintenance costs over the life of the vehicle. Finally, another important  factor in determining vehicle life-cycle costs is resale value, which is also  uncertain in the case of plug-ins. GSA officials said that past experience  with advanced technology vehicles underscored the risk federal agencies  might face when trying to resell the vehicles. For example, when GSA  attempted to resell some of its compressed natural gas vehicles in the  1990s, there was no market for them and the resale value was essentially  zero. By comparison, information from public sources of automotive data  suggests that the projected value of a Toyota Prius, a conventional hybrid,  will hold up well over time compared with similarly sized gasoline  vehicles.", "We believe these uncertainties make it difficult for fleet managers to plan  for the integration of plug-in hybrids in the early years of their  commercialization and pose challenges for agencies in complying with the  executive order. In addition, to compare plug-in hybrids with other  vehicles available to them, agencies will need to make certain assumptions  that can materially affect the estimation of whether the vehicles are  comparable on a life-cycle cost basis. For example, factors such as agency  policies about when and how often vehicles are charged, driving behavior  and the types of trips plug-in hybrids are predominantly used for, and the  potential for training needed to service the vehicles all can influence the  costs of the vehicle to the agency over its lifetime. Currently there is no  guidance on how to deal with these uncertainties and no further  information about the performance of the vehicles.", "GSA and DOD have started to explore options that would allow the  agencies to acquire and use neighborhood electric vehicles while  minimizing some of the risk associated with the uncertainties described  above. Specifically, GSA, on behalf of the Department of the Army, is  currently negotiating \u201cpass-through lease agreements\u201d in which it would  lease neighborhood electric vehicles directly from manufacturers and pass  the leases on to the customer. In its effort to reduce petroleum  consumption, the Army would like to order 4,000 neighborhood electric  vehicles over a 3-year period beginning in 2009 and replace gas-powered  vehicles, where appropriate, on a one-for-one basis. Leasing, rather than  purchasing, the neighborhood electric vehicles will help mitigate risks  associated with their maintenance and their minimal resale value,  according to GSA and DOD officials. The cost of the leases could be higher  if manufacturers adjust the rate to account for risk associated with  expected costs and performance of plug-in vehicles. However, if the  government leased these vehicles, it would avoid liability of ownership,  especially with regard to the maintenance and resale challenges GSA and  federal agencies would otherwise face. GSA has not yet explored the  possibility of leasing other plug-ins directly from manufacturers; however,  GSA officials thought this option would be worth exploring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability of Plug-in Vehicles to the Federal Fleet May Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["Auto manufacturers may not make a high volume or wide range of plug-in  vehicle models available to the federal government.

In addition, foreign  manufacturers historically have not entered into procurement contracts  with GSA.

These plans also must be updated to reflect  changing circumstances and should include a number of key elements,  such as (1) approaches for achieving long-term goals; (2) linkages to goals;  (3) frameworks for aligning agency activities, processes, and resources to  attain goals; (4) consideration of external factors; and (5) reliable  performance data needed to set goals, evaluate results, and improve  performance.", "Agency officials told us that the uncertainties surrounding plug-ins, as  discussed throughout this report, prevent them from developing plans for  integrating plug-ins into their fleets. For example, agency officials reported  that the performance characteristics of plug-ins\u2014such as fuel economy,  length of time to charge, and range\u2014are still in question. While there is  some preliminary information on performance characteristics and  potential benefits, agencies cannot determine with certainty whether the  vehicles will meet their mission, which is one of the most important  criteria in purchasing vehicles. In addition, according to FEDFLEET, plug- in hybrids are a suitable option for agencies located in metropolitan areas,  on military bases, and federal centers, but agency fleet managers noted  that plug-in hybrids may not be appropriate for agency missions located in  remote areas or that require long-distance driving without assurance that  charging infrastructure will be accessible. Finally, the compact size of the  first plug-in hybrids expected on the market may be problematic. For  example, USPS officials stated that they are unlikely to acquire plug-in  hybrids with limited cargo capacity, such as the Chevy Volt, but viewed  plug-in vans with larger cargo space as an option.", "Agencies are also uncertain how to plan for the integration of plug-ins  because they have not determined whether additional charging  infrastructure would be needed at federal facilities to accommodate the  use of plug-ins. The first generation of plug-ins is expected to use ordinary  plugs and outlets to recharge the vehicles, and agency officials expected  that small numbers of plug-ins would not pose considerable infrastructure  challenges. However, many agency officials we interviewed stated that  they had yet to conduct any assessment of their current facilities to  determine the extent to which they could support plug-ins and, thus, what  modifications might be necessary. For example, according to several  agency officials, federal agencies located in a commercially leased space  may not have access to additional electrical infrastructure necessary to  support vehicle charging, or the building owner may not be willing to  provide it. Also, as the number of plug-ins used by federal agencies  increases, it will likely become necessary to upgrade the facility\u2019s  electrical service to accommodate the growing demand. In addition, some  agencies with their own charging facilities may need to collaborate with  the local utility to ensure transformers serving the building can manage  additional load. Agencies may also need to collaborate with local power  companies and be prepared to install smart charging capability to ensure  that electrical power is being used in the most efficient manner possible.  Finally, some officials emphasized that they may need funding for  additional infrastructure, such as charging stations. Because of these  uncertainties, agency officials informed us that it would be extremely  difficult to develop a plan that successfully incorporates plug-ins into their  mission and uses these vehicles as effectively as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Plug-ins into the Federal Fleet May Be at Odds with Other Federal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Agencies also face a challenge posed by the patchwork of existing federal  requirements that covers energy use and vehicle acquisitions. In deciding  whether to acquire plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles, agencies must  also consider how this decision will affect their ability to meet these other  requirements, some of which conflict with one another. These  requirements are intended to further several important objectives,  including reducing petroleum consumption and encouraging the use of  alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuel in the federal fleet. However,  the current set of requirements does not provide agencies with a means to  set priorities for these objectives and make complex decisions such as  what vehicles to acquire under what circumstances.", "Using plug-in vehicles could create several challenges related to meeting  energy reduction and fuel consumption goals.", "Consumption of electricity by plug-ins could conflict with energy  reduction requirements for facilities: Under Executive Order 13423  agencies are expected to reduce energy intensity in federal facilities by 3  percent per year through the end of fiscal year 2015; further, EISA requires  a reduction in energy intensity in facilities by 30 percent by the end of  fiscal year 2015, relative to the baseline of their energy use in fiscal year  2003. Energy intensity is defined as energy consumed per gross square foot  of facilities. Because plug-ins are expected to rely on electricity from  federal facilities while charging, they could increase energy consumption,  particularly if plug-ins are used in large numbers. Such an increase could  create a conflict with the requirement in EISA for federal facilities to  reduce energy consumption of facilities. If agencies do not have a means  to determine the electricity used by plug-ins, they will have no way of  subtracting vehicle usage from facility usage to track their progress in  meeting the facility requirement.", "Without means to measure electricity used to \u201cfuel\u201d plug-ins, agencies  may underestimate progress toward alternative fuel consumption  requirements: EISA requires agencies to increase alternative fuel use by  10 percent annually. The electricity used to charge plug-in hybrids and all- electric vehicles, except neighborhood electric vehicles, can count toward  this requirement. But according to agency officials, facilities are generally  not equipped with dedicated meters or other means of measuring the  amount of electricity used by vehicles. According to the DOE official  responsible for federal fleet policy, electricity used by plug-in hybrids and  all-electric vehicles could be estimated, but there is currently no guidance  for how to do this.", "The lack of guidance regarding alternative fuel use for plug-in hybrids  could hamper agencies\u2019 ability to meet the 100-percent alternative  fueling requirement: EPAct 2005 requires that alternative fuel vehicles be  fueled with alternative fuel 100 percent of the time, unless they qualify for  a waiver. In the case of flex-fuel vehicles that are fueled by ethanol (E85)  and gasoline, agencies can qualify for a waiver to use gasoline in flex-fuel  vehicles if E85 is not readily available or costs too much. DOE guidance  allows exceptions under certain conditions\u2014for example, agencies may  use gasoline, instead of E85, to complete the mission at hand if E85 is  unavailable. According to DOE officials, similar guidance will be necessary  to address conditions when alternative fuel, specifically electricity, is  unavailable for plug-in hybrids.", "The lack of guidance regarding the electricity used by neighborhood  electric vehicles could lead to inaccuracies in alternative fuel  consumption reporting: According to DOE, neighborhood electric  vehicles do not qualify as alternative fuel vehicles under EPAct 1992.  However, because neighborhood electric vehicles are fueled with  electricity, without a means of accounting for their electricity use  separately from that of plug-in hybrids and other all-electric vehicles,  agencies could be improperly counting the electricity used by  neighborhood electric vehicles as alternative fuel. Neighborhood electric  vehicles can, however, help agencies meet their petroleum reduction  targets, and DOD and GSA plan to put more of these vehicles into use.  DOE has not provided guidance to agencies on this subject. DOE\u2019s official  responsible for fleet policy noted that because so few neighborhood  electric vehicles have been used to date, the lack of policy has not been a  problem. Now that neighborhood electric vehicles are becoming more  popular, he said, DOE has begun developing guidance specifying how to  account for the electricity used in neighborhood electric vehicles.", "In addition, the various federal requirements that pertain to energy use  and vehicle acquisitions do not provide agencies with a clear way to set  priorities and effectively address conflicts between these requirements.", "Until they are more affordable, plug-ins are unlikely to be the most cost- effective type of AFV for reducing petroleum consumption: EPAct 1992  requires that at least 75 percent of all new vehicle acquisitions by agencies for  EPAct-covered fleets be alternative fuel vehicles. In addition, EISA requires  agencies to reduce petroleum consumption. Acquiring plug-ins would be  helpful in meeting both requirements. However, agencies would be able to  replace more of their older, less-efficient vehicles by acquiring either less  costly AFVs or fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles. Depending on the  circumstances, acquiring plug-ins could limit an agency\u2019s ability to meet the  requirement to reduce petroleum consumption.", "The new requirement to acquire low-emission vehicles creates an  additional priority that agencies must manage: EISA directs agencies to  procure only low-emission greenhouse gas vehicles, and EPA is in the process  of developing a definition for these vehicles. DOE officials noted that the  EISA requirement may be at odds with the AFV acquisition requirement  because most AFVs in use today, particularly flex-fuel vehicles, meet the EISA  emissions requirement only if they are fueled with alternative fuel, not  gasoline. In addition, the amount of emissions produced by a plug-in hybrid  depends in part on the source of energy used to generate electricity, as well as  how much gasoline it consumes. Once agencies have guidance defining low- emission vehicles, they may face similar conflicts in trying to meet the various  vehicle acquisition requirements and goals.", "Finally, in our 2008 report, which addressed the extent to which agencies  were making progress toward meeting federal fleet energy objectives, we  found several additional conflicts agencies experienced in trying to meet  all of the current regulations. For example, we found that while agencies  were able to meet the alternative fuel vehicle acquisition requirement, they  were highly unlikely be able to meet the alternative fuel use requirement  because of a limited supply of alternative fuel and an inadequate  alternative fuel infrastructure. These issues were also factors in some  agencies\u2019 inability to meet the petroleum requirements for fiscal year 2007.  Accordingly, we suggested that Congress consider aligning the federal  fleet AFV acquisition and fueling requirement with current alternative fuel  availability and revising those requirements as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As federal agencies work to cost-effectively comply with requirements and  goals for conserving energy in their facilities and vehicle fleets, a number  of uncertainties hinder their efforts. Although, by making statutory  requirements, Congress signified the importance of acquiring alternative  fuel vehicles, using alternative fuel, decreasing petroleum use, decreasing  greenhouse gas emissions, and improving energy efficiency in facilities,  the requirements can be costly and are sometimes in conflict. As a result,  agencies are uncertain about setting priorities and struggle to meet the  overall intent of these requirements and goals. Executive Order 13423\u2019s  directive to incorporate plug-in hybrids into fleets adds to the agencies\u2019  struggle to balance requirements and goals within their budgets. Without  having clear priorities for the patchwork of requirements that compete for  funding, agencies may miss opportunities to effectively use new  technologies and maximize petroleum reduction. Alternatively, agencies  may opt to meet the requirements that are most feasible for them,  regardless of whether the actions match the priorities of Congress.", "In the past, agencies chose among vehicles with internal combustion  engines, which simplified the process of comparing the cost of vehicles  and making cost-effective choices. With the advent of plug-in hybrids and  all-electric vehicles, as well as new requirements such as reducing  greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum consumption, the process has  become more complicated. For several reasons, agencies lack information  critical to making informed vehicle acquisition decisions that will meet  energy-conservation requirements in a cost-effective manner. Specifically,  agencies lack (1) data on how the different configurations of plug-ins will  affect the costs of the vehicles over their life cycles, (2) strategic plans for  how they will incorporate plug-in vehicles, and (3) guidance on how to  account for the electricity plug-ins will use.", "Plug-ins will be expensive relative to other vehicles until battery costs  come down and challenges such as achieving economies of scale are met.  These high upfront costs will prevent agencies from including plug-ins in  large numbers in their fleets without additional funding. Furthermore,  agencies will also be hindered from incorporating plug-ins because of  uncertainties regarding their performance, the maintenance and reliability  associated with the vehicles\u2019 batteries, and the resale value of the vehicles.  Exploring the option of leasing the vehicles directly from manufacturers  could help mitigate these risks and allow agencies to experiment with how  well the vehicles perform within their fleet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enable agencies to more effectively meet congressional requirements,  we recommend that the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with EPA,  GSA, OMB, and organizations representing federal fleet customers such as  INTERFUEL, FEDFLEET, and the Motor Vehicle Executive Council,  propose legislative changes that would resolve the conflicts and set  priorities for the multiple requirements and goals with respect to reducing  petroleum consumption, reducing emissions, managing costs, and  acquiring advanced technology vehicles.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Energy begin to develop guidance for  when agencies consider acquiring plug-in vehicles, as well as guidance  specifying the elements that agencies should include in their plans for  acquiring the mix of vehicles that will best enable them to meet their  requirements and goals. Such guidance might include assessing the need  for installing charging infrastructure and identifying areas where  improvements may be necessary, mapping current driving patterns, and  determining the energy sources used to generate electricity in an area.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Energy continue ongoing efforts  to develop guidance for agencies on how electricity used to charge plug- ins should be measured and accounted for in meeting energy-reduction  goals related to federal facilities and alternative fuel consumption. In  doing so, the Secretary should determine whether changes to existing  legislation will be needed to ensure there is no conflict between using  electricity to charge vehicles and requirements to reduce the energy  intensity of federal facilities, and advise Congress accordingly.", "We recommend that the Administrator of the General Services Administration  consider providing information to agencies regarding total cost of ownership  or life-cycle cost for vehicles in the same class. For plug-in vehicles that are  newly offered, the Administrator should provide guidance for how agencies  should address uncertainties about the vehicles\u2019 future performance in  estimating the life-cycle costs of plug-ins, so agencies can make better- informed, consistent, and cost-effective decisions in acquiring vehicles.", "We also recommend that, once plug-in hybrids and all-electrics become  available to the federal government but are still in the early phases of  commercialization, the Administrator of GSA explore the possibility of  arranging pass-through leases of plug-in vehicles directly from vehicle  manufacturers or dealers\u2014as is being done with DOD\u2019s acquisition of  neighborhood electric vehicles\u2014if doing so proves to be a cost-effective  means of reducing some of the risk agencies face associated with  acquiring new technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, DOE, EPA, GSA, OMB, and  USPS for review and comment.

Although the United States Postal  Service (USPS) is not subject to Executive Order 13423 as are other  federal agencies, our review encompassed the fleet operations of USPS  because of its size, its past experience in testing electric vehicles, and the  potential of that fleet to utilize plug-in technologies. In addition, USPS  officials indicated that they will try to comply with the executive order  even though they are not required to do so. To inform each of our  objectives, we conducted nine site visits with organizations that have test  fleets of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles (see table 5).", "To identify the potential benefits and trade-offs of plug-ins, we interviewed  officials from power companies and other entities, such as the National  Laboratories, currently testing plug-ins. We also reviewed data from these  organizations on the performance of plug-ins when it was available. We  analyzed the results of published studies from academic research centers  and others that evaluated the potential benefits plug-ins can offer with  respect to issues such as reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas  emissions and identified trade-offs plug-ins could require compared to  other alternative fuel vehicles and conventional gasoline vehicles.

We also reviewed published material on Web sites of a variety of smaller  manufacturers, such as Tesla Motors, Fisker Automotive, and others about  the plug-ins that those manufacturers plan to bring to market. To understand  the development of plug-in vehicle and battery development and identify any  potential challenges to the development and commercialization of these  technologies, we interviewed a wide variety of stakeholders, and reviewed  documents from diverse stakeholders, including auto manufacturers, battery  manufacturers, Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) officials, National Laboratory researchers, power companies,  charging infrastructure equipment companies, and others. We reviewed  published research related to plug-in technology, such as studies on vehicle  and battery performance and consumer acceptance of plug-in technology. In  addition, to examine the impact of rising or falling gasoline prices relative to  electricity prices, different battery costs and prices of vehicles, and different  assumptions regarding maintenance expenses and resale values, we  developed a model to attempt to estimate the life-cycle and cost-effectiveness  of plug-ins relative to conventional hybrids and conventional gasoline- powered vehicles. While our modeling effort highlighted the importance of  certain variables, such as battery cost, because of the significant uncertainties  regarding the estimates used in these models, we do not report specific  results. We also tracked and analyzed developments related to the current  economic crisis and financial stress facing the auto industry and the potential  impact this crisis could have on plug-in vehicle development.

To ensure the studies we considered were of sufficient scientific  rigor, we limited our review to articles published in well-respected peer- reviewed journals or those provided by experts or organizations because of  their level of expertise in this area. Articles using cost-benefit analysis to  describe the relative benefits of plug-ins were reviewed by an economist. The  options selected for discussion represent those supported by many of these  experts. In addition, we considered the potential costs the options could pose  to the federal government as well as what role the government might play  relative to other stakeholders who also stand to benefit from this technology.", "Inherently there are certain limitations and variances in the quality of  information available about these options. Therefore, we used professional  judgment in identifying the relative benefits and limitations of these options.

If GSA modifies the standards to address, for example, new  federal mandates or goals, GSA publishes a draft version and provides a  comment period for stakeholders before finalizing them. Once the  standards are finalized, GSA Automotive issues at least five solicitations in  the FedBizOpps, the government portal for federal procurement  opportunities to cover specific types of vehicles, such as sedans, trucks,  buses and ambulances, reviews proposals, and awards contracts in time  for the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1.

Similarly, GSA Fleet obligates money to GSA  Automotive from its revolving fund to purchase the vehicles it leases to  federal customers and recovers purchase and maintenance costs through  lease fees and the resale of vehicles at the end of their life cycle.  According to GSA Fleet officials, approximately 20 percent of the leased  vehicles are replaced each year. GSA Fleet replaces the leased vehicles  using several criteria, among which age and mileage are foremost. Since  GSA Fleet needs to recover its costs to maintain the solvency of its  revolving fund, it auctions off most of its sedans, for example, within 5  years of their purchase.
