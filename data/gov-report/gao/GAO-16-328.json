On average, 380,000 veterans were newly enrolled in VHA's health care system each year in the last decade.", "GAO was asked to examine VHA's efforts to provide timely access to primary care services. This report examines, among other things, (1) newly enrolled veterans' access to primary care and (2) VHA's related oversight. GAO interviewed officials from six VA medical centers selected to provide variation in factors such as geographic location, clinical services offered, and average primary care wait times; reviewed a randomly selected, non-generalizable sample of medical records for 180 newly enrolled veterans; and interviewed VHA and medical center officials on oversight of access to primary care. GAO evaluated VHA's oversight against relevant federal standards for internal control."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that not all newly enrolled veterans were able to access primary care from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and others experienced wide variation in the amount of time they waited for care. Sixty of the 180 newly enrolled veterans in GAO's review had not been seen by providers at the time of the review; nearly half were unable to access primary care because VA medical center staff did not schedule appointments for these veterans in accordance with VHA policy. The 120 newly enrolled veterans in GAO's review who were seen by providers waited from 22 days to 71 days from their requests that VA contact them to schedule appointments to when they were seen, according to GAO's analysis. These time frames were impacted by limited appointment availability and weaknesses in medical center scheduling practices, which contributed to unnecessary delays.", "VHA's oversight of veterans' access to primary care is hindered, in part, by data weaknesses and the lack of a comprehensive scheduling policy. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards, which call for agencies to have reliable data and effective policies to achieve their objectives. For newly enrolled veterans, VHA calculates primary care appointment wait times starting from the veterans' preferred dates (the dates veterans want to be seen), rather than the dates veterans initially requested VA contact them to schedule appointments. Therefore, these data do not capture the time these veterans wait prior to being contacted by schedulers, making it difficult for officials to identify and remedy scheduling problems that arise prior to making contact with veterans. Further, ongoing scheduling errors, such as incorrectly revising preferred dates when rescheduling appointments, understated the amount of time veterans waited to see providers. Officials attributed these errors to confusion by schedulers, resulting from the lack of an updated standardized scheduling policy. These errors continue to affect the reliability of wait-time data used for oversight, which makes it more difficult to effectively oversee newly enrolled veterans' access to primary care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VHA (1) ensure veterans requesting appointments are contacted in a timely manner to schedule one; (2) monitor the full amount of time newly enrolled veterans wait to receive primary care; and (3) issue an updated scheduling policy. VA concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and identified actions it is taking to implement them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), within the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), operates one of the nation\u2019s largest health care  systems. It provided care to about 6.6 million veterans in fiscal year 2014  and spent about $58 billion for their care in that year. Primary care  services are often the entry point to the VHA health care system for  veterans, including an aging veteran population and a growing number of  younger veterans returning from military operations in Afghanistan and  Iraq. Over the past decade, VHA has faced a growing demand for  outpatient primary care services. From fiscal years 2005 through 2014,  the number of annual outpatient primary care medical appointments VHA  provided through its medical facilities increased by 17 percent, from  approximately 10.2 million to 11.9 million. Each year over that period, an  average of 380,000 veterans were newly enrolled in VHA\u2019s health care  system. In fiscal year 2014, VHA provided about 730,000 primary care  appointments for new patients\u2014appointments for those patients who  have not been seen in a primary care clinic in the past 24 months,  including those who are newly enrolled.", "Access to timely primary care medical appointments is critical to ensuring  that veterans obtain needed medical care, because primary care is a  gateway to obtaining other VHA health care services, including specialty  care. When veterans need specialty care\u2014such as cardiology or  gastroenterology\u2014they are typically referred to a specialist by their  primary care provider, and each veteran\u2019s primary care team manages  and coordinates the needed care. Veterans may obtain primary care  services at VHA\u2019s medical facilities, which include 167 medical centers  and more than 800 community-based outpatient clinics. Responsibility  for ensuring timely access to primary care rests with 20 regional Veterans  Integrated Service Networks (VISN), which oversee the medical centers,  and with VHA\u2019s central office, which oversees the entire VA health care  system.", "In recent years, we and others have expressed concerns about VHA\u2019s  ability to effectively oversee timely access to health care for veterans, and  the failure to provide timely access to care, which, in some cases,  reportedly has resulted in harm to veterans. Our prior work on VHA\u2019s  oversight of primary and specialty care found VHA did not have adequate  data and oversight mechanisms in place to ensure veterans receive  timely care. For example, since 2012, we have issued several reports  recommending that VA improve appointment scheduling, ensure the  reliability of wait-time and other performance data, and improve oversight  to ensure VA medical centers provide veterans with timely access to  outpatient primary and specialty care, as well as mental health care. (See  app. I for the status of those recommendations.) Based on these serious  concerns about VA\u2019s management and oversight of its health care  system, we have concluded that VA health care is a high-risk area and, in  2015, added it to GAO\u2019s High Risk List. To help improve timely access to  health care, Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and  Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice Act), which provided veterans facing  long waits or lengthy travel distances the opportunity to obtain care from  providers (non-VA) in the community.", "You asked us to examine VHA\u2019s efforts to provide timely access to  primary care services.

Additionally, we interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Health  Eligibility Center, VHA central office\u2014VHA\u2019s Health Resource Center,  Office of Primary Care, and Access and Clinical Administration  Program\u2014and six VA medical centers about policies and guidance for  scheduling newly enrolled veterans for outpatient primary care  appointments. These medical centers were: VA Central Western  Massachusetts Healthcare System (Leeds, Massachusetts); Tennessee  Valley Healthcare System (Nashville, Tennessee); Fayetteville VA  Medical Center (Fayetteville, North Carolina); Ralph H. Johnson VA  Medical Center (Charleston, South Carolina); VA Eastern Kansas Health  Care System (Leavenworth, Kansas); and VA San Diego Healthcare  System (San Diego, California).  We selected the six medical centers for  variation in (1) average time new patients were waiting for primary care  based on appointment wait-time data published on VA\u2019s public website,  (2) facility complexity, and (3) geographic location. Although our previous  work, as well as that of the VA Office of Inspector General, has shown  that the VHA wait-time data are unreliable and prone to errors and  interpretation, through interviews with VHA officials knowledgeable about  the wait-time data, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for our use in selecting individual medical centers to include in our  review. We also interviewed officials from each of the VISNs  responsible for oversight of these medical centers. We also obtained the  perspectives of VHA, VISN, and VA medical center officials about issues  such as challenges to veterans\u2019 access to primary care appointments and  potential solutions for improving access.", "Further, for each of the six VA medical centers included in our review, we  obtained a list of veterans who, between October 1, 2014, and March 31,  2015, requested on their enrollment applications that VA contact them to  schedule medical appointments. From this list, we selected a sample of  60 veterans, each of whom had not yet been seen by a primary care  provider, 10 randomly selected from each of the six medical centers. We  also selected a sample of 120 veterans who each were seen by a primary  care provider, 20 randomly selected from each medical center included in  our review. We examined the medical records for each of these 180  veterans to determine the history of actions taken to schedule  appointments, such as dates the appointments were scheduled; dates  veterans were seen by primary care providers, if applicable; and whether  initially scheduled appointments were canceled, and if so, whether and  when they were rescheduled. We also obtained information on the dates  each of the six medical centers contacted veterans to schedule  appointments. For those veterans who had been seen by providers, we  calculated the amount of time it took from the dates the veterans  requested on their enrollment applications that VA contact them to  schedule appointments until their appointment dates, and compared  those time frames to the amount of time reflected in the medical centers\u2019  scheduling systems. For those veterans who had not been seen by  providers at the time of our review, we interviewed medical center officials  to identify reasons why they were not seen. We used the results of our  analyses to determine whether the medical centers were contacting  veterans and scheduling appointments according to VHA policies.", "To examine the extent to which veterans access follow-up primary care in  a timely manner, we reviewed relevant VHA and VA medical center  documents, and interviewed officials from VHA\u2019s central office, and the  six medical centers in our review regarding the policies and procedures  for scheduling follow-up outpatient appointments. For each of the six  medical centers, we obtained a list of veterans who saw primary care  providers for follow-up appointments in June 2015. From that information,  we selected a sample of 60 veterans, 10 randomly selected from each of  the six medical centers. We examined the medical records of these 60  veterans to determine whether a VHA provider had instructed veterans to  return for follow-up appointments, and if so, the time frames for  scheduling the return visits. We then reviewed the history of actions taken  to schedule each of the follow-up appointments to determine whether the  appointments were scheduled according to both VHA policies and the  providers\u2019 instructions, and if not, the factors that affected timely  scheduling. The results from our work at six medical centers, including  our medical record reviews of 240 veterans\u2014180 newly enrolled and 60  who saw providers for follow-up primary care appointments\u2014cannot be  generalized to all veterans at the medical centers in our review, or to  other medical centers.", "To determine the extent to which VHA provides oversight of veterans\u2019  access to primary care, we reviewed documents, including national VHA  and local medical center appointment scheduling policies. Additionally,  we interviewed officials from VHA central office and the six VISNs and  medical centers in our review about their oversight efforts. As part of our  review, we also reviewed the key mechanisms that officials told us they  were using to conduct oversight of veterans\u2019 access to primary care,  including the key measures they were using to monitor the timeliness of  appointments.

Consequently, data used for monitoring and oversight  do not capture veterans\u2019 overall experiences, including the time newly  enrolled veterans wait prior to being contacted by a scheduler, which  makes it difficult for officials to effectively identify and remedy scheduling  problems that arise prior to making contact with veterans.", "Our review of medical records for 120 newly enrolled veterans found that,  on average, the total amount of time it took to be seen by primary care  providers was much longer when measured from the dates veterans  initially requested VA contact them to schedule appointments than it was  when using appointment wait times calculated using veterans\u2019 preferred  dates as the starting point. (See table 4.)", "The amount of time elapsed between when veterans initially requested  VA contact them to schedule appointments and when they are seen by  providers may be due to veterans\u2019 decisions such as not wanting to  schedule appointments immediately, or cancelling and rescheduling initial  appointments. However, we found the amount of time between initial  requests and when they received care also varied due to factors  unaffected by veterans\u2019 decisions, including VA medical centers not  contacting veterans in a timely manner, medical centers being unaware of  veterans\u2019 requests, and difficulties in processing veterans\u2019 requests that  they be contacted to schedule appointments. For example:", "One veteran applied for VHA health care benefits in December 2014,  which included a request to be contacted for an initial appointment.  The VA medical center contacted the veteran to schedule a primary  care appointment 43 days later. When making the appointment, the  medical center recorded the veteran\u2019s preferred date as March 1,  2015, and the veteran saw a provider on March 3, 2015. Although the  medical center\u2019s data showed the veteran waited 2 days to see a  provider, the total amount of time that elapsed from the veteran\u2019s  request until the veteran was seen was actually 76 days.", "For another veteran, the medical record indicated that a request to  schedule an appointment was made in October 2014. According to  VA medical center officials, the veteran had a compensation and  pension exam, and as a result, this veteran was not on the list of  those who needed to be contacted to schedule a primary care  appointment. Officials told us that the veteran contacted the medical  center in January 2015 to schedule an appointment, with a preferred  date in January 2015. The veteran had his appointment in February  2015. While the medical center\u2019s data show the veteran waited 13  days to be seen, the total amount of time that elapsed from the  veteran\u2019s initial request to schedule an appointment until the veteran  was seen was 113 days.", "According to VHA officials responsible for monitoring wait times, there are  no VHA policies requiring that they measure and monitor the total amount  of time that newly enrolled veterans experience while waiting to be seen  by a primary care provider. Instead, VHA\u2019s policy is to use data that  measure the timeliness of appointments based on veterans\u2019 preferred  dates. Although there is no policy requiring that they measure the total  time veterans wait to be seen, officials from one VISN told us that they  measure this period of time, as it may provide valuable insights into newly  enrolled veterans\u2019 experiences in trying to obtain care from VHA. During  our discussions with these VISN officials, they expressed concern that  monitoring veterans\u2019 wait times using the preferred date is too limited,  because it does not capture the full wait times veterans experience.", "Since February 2015, officials from this VISN have instructed each of the  medical centers they oversee to audit a sample of 30 primary care,  specialty care, and mental health appointments for new patients,  including newly enrolled veterans, for a total of 90 appointments each  month. As part of this audit, medical center officials record the dates  veterans initially requested VA contact them to schedule appointments,  the dates appointments were created, and the dates veterans were seen  by providers. VISN officials use the information to prepare a monthly  summary report which tracks a variety of information, including the  percentage of appointments for which the veterans\u2019 overall wait was more  than 30 days. According to data from the October 2015 audit, 24 percent  of veterans waited more than 30 days from their initial request until they  were seen by a provider. Officials indicated that by analyzing trends on  these and other data, they will be able to identify whether factors such as  enrollment issues or problems contacting newly enrolled veterans are  impacting overall wait times. Officials indicated that it is time-consuming  to perform these audits, and it would be helpful if VHA had a centralized  system which would enable them to electronically compile the data.", "During our review we also found that under the Health Resource Center\u2019s  Welcome to VA program, officials are developing a centralized electronic  system to track various dates related to newly enrolled veterans, including  the date each veteran applied for VHA health care. Once applications for  benefits are approved, staff in the Health Resource Center call centers  contact each newly enrolled veteran, and ask if that veteran wants to  begin receiving health care at VHA. For veterans that indicated on their  applications that they wanted to be contacted to schedule an  appointment, their requests are confirmed through these calls, and the  dates of the requests on the applications are recorded in the Health  Resource Center system, as well as the dates the veterans were  contacted. For veterans who did not indicate they wanted to be contacted  on their applications, but tell Health Resource Center staff during the calls  that they want care, the dates of contact are documented as their initial  requests for care. Officials indicated that it is important to begin tracking  from the onset of veterans\u2019 requests, because that is when they told VA  they needed care. Officials indicated that since July 2015, they have been  piloting this Welcome to VA data collection and tracking effort with one  VISN, and hope to expand this effort across the VHA system during 2016.  They further indicated that they have been coordinating with the VHA  office responsible for monitoring access, and hoped their data could be  integrated into VHA\u2019s routine monitoring of veterans\u2019 wait times."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scheduling Errors Continue to Affect the Reliability of Wait-Time Data, Including for Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["Ongoing problems continue to affect the reliability of wait-time data,  including for primary care, used by VHA, VISN, and VA medical center  officials for monitoring and oversight. Our previous work in 2012, as well  as that of VA and the VA OIG in 2014, has shown that VHA wait-time  data are unreliable and prone to errors and interpretation. Among other  things, we found in December 2012 that medical centers were not  implementing VHA\u2019s scheduling policies in a consistent manner, which  led to unreliable wait-time data. Although VHA has taken steps since then  to improve the reliability of its wait time data, including ensuring that  scheduling staff complete required training, we found VHA schedulers  were continuing to make errors in recording veterans\u2019 preferred dates;  and thus, data reliability problems continue to hinder effective oversight.", "During our review of appointment scheduling for 120 newly enrolled  veterans, we found that schedulers in three of the six VA medical centers  included in our review had made errors in recording veterans\u2019 preferred  dates when making appointments. Specifically, we found 15  appointments for which schedulers had incorrectly revised the preferred  dates. In these cases, we recalculated the appointment wait time based  on what should have been the correct preferred dates, according to VHA  policy, and found the wait-time data contained in the scheduling system  were understated. (See table 5.)", "We found that schedulers incorrectly revised patients\u2019 preferred dates to  later dates, inconsistent with VHA policy, under two scheduling scenarios:  1.  Medical center primary care clinics cancelled appointments, and when  those appointments were re-scheduled, schedulers did not always  maintain the original preferred dates in the system, but updated them  to reflect new preferred dates recorded when the appointments were  rescheduled. This is not consistent with VHA policy, which indicates  that if a clinic cancels an appointment, the original preferred date  should be maintained in the system.  2.  Preferred dates initially recorded when placing veterans on the  electronic wait list were incorrectly revised to later dates when  appointments became available and were scheduled. This included  revising preferred dates to the same dates of the scheduled  appointments. This is also inconsistent with VHA policy, which  indicates that the veterans\u2019 preferred dates recorded at the time of  entry on the electronic wait list should not be changed. We confirmed  our understanding of this policy with officials from one of the VISNs,  and discussed these cases with VA medical center officials, who  indicated that they would need to provide additional training to  schedulers to ensure compliance with VHA\u2019s scheduling policies.", "We also found in our review of medical records, that of 120 veterans who  saw providers, 65 veterans, or 54 percent, had appointments with a zero- day wait time recorded in the scheduling system. VHA officials indicated  that appointments with wait times of zero days are a potential indicator of  scheduling errors. Based on our review of medical records for these  veterans, 13 of the appointments with zero-day wait times were those that  were incorrect due to schedulers revising preferred dates.", "In addition, officials from five of the six VA medical centers in our review  told us they continue to find through their scheduling audits that  schedulers are incorrectly recording preferred dates. Officials from each  of the six medical centers explained that they periodically audit scheduled  appointments to help ensure schedulers are complying with scheduling  policies. Officials from these medical centers indicated a key focus of the  audits is to assess whether schedulers are correctly recording the  preferred date when making appointments, and that wait times are being  calculated correctly. For example, officials from one medical center said  they audited nearly 1,200 appointments between January and June 2015,  and identified 205 appointments for which schedulers incorrectly recorded  the veteran\u2019s preferred date. Officials indicated that based on these  results, scheduling supervisors provided training with those schedulers  who made the errors.", "Since July 2014, VHA has issued a revised interim scheduling directive  and numerous individual memos to clarify and update the scheduling  policy, but has not yet published a comprehensive policy that incorporates  all of these changes. Officials from four of the six VISNs in our review  indicated that the way VHA has communicated revised scheduling  policies and updates to medical centers has been ineffective and may be  contributing to continued scheduling errors. They indicated that high  turnover among schedulers and the lack of an updated standardized  scheduling policy make it more difficult to train schedulers and to direct  these staff to current policy, which increases the likelihood of errors.  Federal internal control standards call for management to clearly  document, through management directives or administrative policies,  significant events or activities\u2014which in this instance would include  ensuring that scheduling policies are readily available and easily  understood\u2014and that management should use and communicate, both  internally and externally, quality information to achieve its objectives.  VHA officials acknowledged that they are aware of frustration among  medical center staff, and that they have been working over the past 18  months to develop an updated and comprehensive scheduling policy.  Officials indicated that their current target is to issue a revised policy  some time in 2016.", "To help VA medical centers and VISNs identify scheduling problems, in  January 2015, VHA implemented its scheduling trigger tool, which is  designed to provide medical center and VISN officials with an early  warning that scheduling problems may be occurring. According to VHA  officials, the tool uses statistical analysis software to review appointment  data from all medical centers in order to detect potential erroneous  scheduling practices, including those that deviate from VHA policies.  For example, it assesses whether medical center schedulers are  accurately documenting patients\u2019 preferred dates and whether they are  using the electronic wait list correctly for new patients. The tool assesses  each medical center\u2019s scheduling performance and automatically alerts  medical center and VISN leadership if a medical center is performing in  the bottom 20 percent. According to VHA officials, use of the tool has  prompted many requests for assistance, and they have provided  additional scheduler training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA and Medical Centers Have Implemented Efforts Aimed at Improving Veterans\u2019 Timely Access to Primary Care VHA Has Implemented System-Wide Efforts Designed to Offer Veterans More Timely Access to Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["VHA has implemented two system-wide efforts designed to offer veterans  more timely access to primary care: the Veterans Choice Program,  created through the Choice Act; and an initiative to increase primary-care  hours."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Medical Centers Have Implemented Local Efforts to Improve Veterans\u2019 Access to Timely Primary Care", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the VHA-wide initiatives aimed at improving access, officials  from the VA medical centers in our review also reported implementing  several local efforts to improve veterans\u2019 timely access to primary care  appointments.

For example, officials at two medical centers  stated that they are reconfiguring their primary care clinic\u2019s space to  accommodate additional providers and other staff without having to lease  additional space. Officials from another medical center told us they were  expanding clinic space by opening several additional community-based  outpatient clinics by entering into emergency lease agreements in  addition to beginning the construction of new clinic space.", "Further, officials from five medical centers in our review reported hiring  additional providers or creating additional positions. For example, officials  at one medical center stated that since 2013 they have hired 20 new full- time providers and 18.5 full-time equivalent nurses. Additionally, they  have also created a new position\u2014a \u201cgap\u201d provider who is a doctor, nurse  practitioner, or nurse\u2014that allows flexibility to cover short-term leave such  as sick or annual leave or longer-term leave such as the gap between  one provider leaving and a new provider coming on board. In practice, the  medical center shifts gap providers from one location to another as  needed, enabling the medical center to minimize backlogs that may arise  due to staffing shortages and unanticipated provider absences. Currently,  this medical center has seven gap providers in primary care. Similarly,  two other medical centers reported using flexible providers who work  across several clinic locations to improve access to primary care for  veterans.", "Finally, officials from three of the medical centers included in our review  reported developing technological solutions to improve access to timely  primary care appointments. These solutions included increasing the use  of telehealth and secure messaging to improve the convenience and  availability of primary care appointments. For example, officials from  one of the medical centers in our review said providers are using secure  messaging to communicate with patients and reduce the need for in- person encounters, which they said helps free up appointments for other  patients."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Providing our nation\u2019s veterans with timely access to primary care is a  critical responsibility of VHA. As primary care services are often the entry  point to the VA health care system for newly enrolled veterans, the ability  to access primary care and establish a relationship with a VHA provider  can be instrumental in the ongoing management of a veteran\u2019s overall  health care needs. Although VHA has processes for identifying those  veterans who have requested VA contact them to schedule appointments,  our review of a sample of newly enrolled veterans revealed that VA  medical centers did not always provide that care until several months  after veterans initially indicated interest in obtaining it, if at all. In several  cases, newly enrolled veterans were never contacted to schedule  appointments, due to medical center staff failing to comply with VHA  policies for scheduling such appointments or medical center staff being  unaware of veterans\u2019 requests. In the absence of consistent adherence  by medical center staff to VHA scheduling processes and policies,  veterans may continue to experience delays in accessing care.", "To help oversee veterans\u2019 access to primary care, officials at VHA\u2019s  central office, medical centers, and VISNs rely on measuring, monitoring,  and evaluating the amount of time it takes veterans to be seen by a  provider. The data currently being used to evaluate newly enrolled  veterans\u2019 access to primary care, however, are limited because they do  not account for the entire amount of time between veterans\u2019 initial  requests to be contacted for appointments and being seen by primary  care providers. This is because the method VHA uses to measure the  appointment wait times for newly enrolled veterans does not begin at the  point at which veterans initially request that VA contact them to schedule  appointments when applying for VHA health care, but rather begins when  VA medical center staff contact veterans and record the veterans\u2019  preferred dates. Consequently, data used for monitoring and oversight do  not capture the time newly enrolled veterans wait prior to being contacted  by a scheduler, making it difficult for officials to effectively identify and  remedy scheduling problems that arise prior to making contact with  veterans. Recognizing limitations in monitoring and oversight of access  data based on veterans\u2019 preferred dates, some system-wide and local  efforts are being developed and implemented to broaden data collection  and oversight of newly enrolled veterans\u2019 access to primary care; such  efforts could have applicability across the entire VHA system.", "Ongoing scheduling problems continue to affect the reliability of wait-time  data, including for primary care. Our previous work has shown that VHA  wait-time data are unreliable due, in part, to medical centers not  implementing VHA\u2019s scheduling policies consistently. VHA central office  officials have responded to scheduling problems throughout the VHA  system by issuing several individual memorandums to clarify scheduling  policies. However, VHA\u2019s piecemeal approach in implementing these  policies may not be fully effective in providing schedulers with the  comprehensive guidance they need to consistently adhere to scheduling  policies or providing the reliable data officials need for monitoring access  to primary care. Our review of medical records for a sample of veterans  found that scheduling errors continue, diminishing the reliability of data  officials use for monitoring the timeliness of appointments by understating  the amount of time veterans actually wait to see providers. Officials at  several of the VA medical centers also continue to uncover scheduling  errors through audits, and VISN officials attribute the errors, in part, to the  lack of an updated comprehensive scheduling policy.
