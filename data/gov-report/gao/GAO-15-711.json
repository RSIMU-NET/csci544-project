However, DOD has not fully addressed a 2008 internal recommendation to develop a department-wide values-based ethics program, which would emphasize ethical principles and decision-making to foster an ethical culture and achieve high standards of conduct. In 2012, DOD studied the design and implementation of a values-based ethics program and in 2013 delivered related training to certain DOD personnel. DOD has decided to take no further actions to establish a values-based ethics program, but it has not demonstrated that additional actions are unwarranted or assessed the feasibility of expanding training to additional personnel. As a result, the department neither has assurance that it has adequately addressed the identified need for a values-based ethics program nor has information needed to target its training efforts appropriately.", "DOD established a 2-year, potentially renewable, position for a Senior Advisor for Military Professionalism, ending in March 2016, to oversee its professionalism-related efforts. Since 2014 the Advisor's office has identified and taken steps toward implementing some of its major tasks, which relate to coordinating and integrating DOD's efforts on professionalism. Professionalism relates to the values, ethics, standards, code of conduct, skills, and attributes of the military workforce. However, the office has not developed timelines or information to assess its progress in completing its major tasks. Thus, DOD does not have information to track the office's progress or assess whether the SAMP position should be retained after March 2016.", "DOD has not fully implemented two key tools for identifying and assessing ethics and professionalism issues, and it has not developed performance metrics to measure its progress in addressing ethics-related issues. DOD has identified several tools, such as command climate and 360-degree assessments, that can be used to identify and assess ethics and professionalism issues. However, guidance issued by the military services for command climate assessments does not meet all statutory requirements and DOD guidance. As a result, the services do not have the required level of accountability during the performance evaluation process over the occurrence of these assessments, or assurances that all military personnel are able to anonymously participate in them. Further, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Joint Staff have developed and implemented 360-degree assessments for some but not all general and flag officers, and therefore some of these officers are not receiving valuable feedback on their performance as intended by DOD guidance. Finally, federal internal control standards emphasize the assessment of performance over time, but DOD is unable to determine whether its ethics and professionalism initiatives are achieving their intended effect because it has not developed metrics to measure their progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD determine whether there is a need for a values-based program, assess the expansion of training, modify guidance, assess the use of a key tool for identifying ethics and professionalism issues, and develop performance metrics.

Military personnel are required to adhere  to ethical principles and standards of conduct established in federal  statutes and departmental guidance pertaining to, among other things,  financial disclosure, conflicts of interest, gift acceptance, and travel.  Recent DOD and military service investigations of misconduct by active  duty servicemembers, including general and flag officers, have placed  DOD\u2019s ethics and professionalism programs under increased presidential,  congressional, and departmental scrutiny.

The report noted that while SOCO had been  effective in demanding compliance for set rules, the ethics program may  have provided the false impression that promoting an ethical culture was  principally the concern of the Office of General Counsel, when integrity is  a leadership issue, and therefore everyone\u2019s concern. In 2010, the Panel  also noted that an effective values-based ethics program, as evidenced  by the many robust programs employed by DOD contractors, cannot be  limited to educating DOD leadership; rather, it must be aimed at  promoting an ethical culture among all DOD employees. The Panel\u2019s  recommendation was based in part on the Defense Science Board\u2019s 2005  finding that while DOD had in place a number of pieces for an ethically  grounded organization, it lagged behind best-in-class programs in  creating a systematic, integrated approach and in demonstrating the  leadership necessary to drive ethics to the forefront of organizational  behavior. The Panel reiterated its recommendation for a department- wide values-based program in its 2009 and 2010 reports to Congress.", "In response to the Panel\u2019s recommendation, DOD contracted for a 2010  survey and a 2012 study to assess DOD\u2019s ethical culture and to  design and implement a values-based ethics program, respectively. The  2010 survey assessed various dimensions of ethical behavior, including  the level of leadership involvement in the ethics program and the extent to  which employees perceive a culture of values-based ethics and are  recognized and rewarded for ethics excellence. The survey report  findings showed that DOD\u2019s overall ethics score was comparable to that  of other large federal government organizations, but advocated for a  values-based approach to address ethical culture weaknesses. For  example, the survey report stated that: employees believe that DOD rewards unethical behavior to an extent  that is well above average; employees fear retribution for reporting managerial/commander  misconduct to an extent that is well above average; and  the number of employees who acknowledge regularly receiving ethics  information and training is comparatively low.", "The 2012 study reinforced the need for a department-wide values-based  ethics program\u2014noting that DOD lagged behind common practices,  among other things\u2014and made 14 recommendations related to  establishing such a program. Notably, these recommendations included  developing an independent Office of Integrity and Standards of Conduct;  adopting a set of core values representing all of DOD; conducting annual  core values training for all DOD employees; and periodically measuring  program effectiveness. In 2013, the Panel on Contracting Integrity issued  a memorandum to SOCO stating that, after reviewing the 2012 study\u2019s  recommendations, SOCO was better positioned than the Panel to  implement the study\u2019s recommendations.", "In 2013, SOCO partially implemented 1 of the study\u2019s 14  recommendations by annually delivering values-based ethics training to  DOD financial disclosure filers\u2014who are required to receive annual  ethics training\u2014as well as other select military and civilian personnel.", "This training emphasizes DOD and military service core values such as  honor, courage, and integrity; highlights cases of misconduct; discusses  ethical decision-making; and features senior-leader involvement in  presentations to emphasize its importance. In 2014, the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed that all  acquisition workforce personnel also complete this training annually to  reinforce the importance of ethical decision-making. SOCO officials stated  that they encourage all DOD organizations to administer this values- based annual ethics training and to extend this training to other personnel  not required to receive mandatory annual ethics training. In 2014, DOD  reported that about 146,000 department personnel received annual  ethics training. We estimate that this represents about 5 percent of DOD\u2019s  total workforce.", "The Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a key source of guidance often  used in developing effective ethics programs, encourage organizations to  train all employees periodically on ethics. Similarly, DOD\u2019s 2012 study  recommended mandatory annual training on integrity and ethics for all  DOD employees, and the 2008 Panel report stated that an effective  values-based ethics program must be aimed at promoting an ethical  culture among all DOD employees. Several of the DOD, foreign military,  and industry organizations we spoke with cited the importance of training  to convey information about ethics. For example, SOCO officials stated  that positive feedback from the initial values-based training rollout in 2013  influenced their decision to continue with this format in 2014, while  officials from the SAMP office stated that employees need to be reminded  of ethics periodically, and that senior leadership should be retrained  continuously on ethics rules. Additionally, officials from each of the four  industry and foreign military organizations we contacted stated that ethics  training within their organizations was either mandatory for all employees  on a periodic basis or available to all employees in one or more formats.", "As noted above, SOCO encourages DOD organizations to administer  values-based annual training to non-mandatory personnel, but neither  SOCO nor the military departments have assessed the feasibility of  expanding this training to additional personnel. A SOCO official stated  that annual training could be expanded to a larger group of employees,  potentially on a periodic instead of an annual basis, but that any decision  to appreciably expand ethics training would have to consider factors such  as associated costs related to the time and effort for leaders and ethics  counselors to conduct training, employee hours to take training, and  administrative support time to track compliance with the training  requirement. This SOCO official noted also that the Army required face- to-face annual ethics training for all employees from approximately 2002  through 2006 but subsequently eliminated the requirement because of the  resource burden and the concern that training was not needed for most  enlisted personnel and junior officers. Our work on human capital states  that agencies should strategically target training to optimize employee  and organizational performance by considering whether expected costs  associated with proposed training are worth the anticipated benefits over  the short and long terms. Without considering such factors in an  assessment of the feasibility of expanding mandatory annual values- based ethics training to a greater number of DOD employees, the  department may be limited in its ability to properly target this training, and  therefore may be missing opportunities to promote and enhance DOD  employees\u2019 familiarity with values-based ethical decision-making.", "With respect to the other 13 recommendations from the 2012 study,  SOCO officials stated that they do not plan to take further action. These  officials also stated that they have not formally responded to the Panel\u2019s  original recommendation to develop a values-based ethics program or its  subsequent memorandum. SOCO officials expressed support for  developing a values-based ethics program provided that such a program  were properly resourced and focused on substantive issues instead of  process. Similarly, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics stated that the  department would benefit from the creation of such a program, and  stressed the need for senior leaders to be involved in promoting  awareness of ethical issues. However, SOCO officials stated that the  Panel and 2012 study recommendations were not binding, and that  SOCO\u2014which is staffed by five attorneys\u2014would not be optimally  positioned to develop a department-wide program. These officials also  stated that implementing all of the study\u2019s other 13 recommendations was  neither feasible nor advisable, and they cited existing practices as being  consistent with some of the study\u2019s recommendations. For example:", "The study\u2019s recommendation to move SOCO from under the Office of  General Counsel and rebrand it as an independent Office of Integrity  and Standards of Conduct was not possible because ethics  counselors are required to be attorneys, according to the Joint Ethics  Regulation, and must therefore remain under the supervision of the  DOD General Counsel in order to provide the legal advice that the  department and its personnel require.", "The study\u2019s recommendation to create a direct link between senior  leadership and the Secretary of Defense on ethics and  professionalism matters is addressed, in part, by the SAMP position  that was created in March 2014. However, as discussed later in this  report, if DOD decides not to renew this position or retain its functions  beyond March 2016, DOD will lose its direct link between senior  leadership and the Secretary of Defense on ethics and  professionalism matters. Both SAMP and SOCO officials stated that  there is an enduring need for such a link or the functions performed by  the SAMP office, and officials from three of the four industry and  foreign military organizations we contacted stated that their  organization had in place a direct link to senior leadership on ethics- related matters.", "The study\u2019s recommendation to assess and mitigate ethical culture  and compliance risk is consistent with SOCO\u2019s current practice of  informally reviewing misconduct reports and survey results,  conducting ethics program reviews, consulting ethics officials, and  factoring perceived trends into training plans and appropriate ethics  guidance and policy.", "Federal internal control standards emphasize the need for managers to  respond to findings and recommendations from audits and reviews and to  complete all actions that correct or otherwise resolve the matters brought  to management\u2019s attention within established timeframes, or alternatively  to demonstrate that actions are unwarranted.

The  SAMP office has drafted a white paper exploring the relationship between  the military profession and the military professional, developed a  catalogue documenting tools that can be used to assess ethics-related  issues, and initiated steps to update the 2010 department-wide survey of  DOD\u2019s ethical culture. In addition, the SAMP office has canvassed the  military services to identify service-level initiatives for civilian personnel  that are similar to the 13 general and flag officer initiatives, conducted  sessions with senior officers to identify areas of interest to senior  leadership, and begun to partner with academic institutions to pursue  research related to utilizing behavioral science and neuroscience to  address issues of ethics, character, and competence in the military.", "While the SAMP office has taken steps toward completing its major tasks,  it has not defined timelines or measures to (1) assess its progress or  impact; (2) determine whether it has completed its major tasks; or (3) help  inform the decision on whether its initial 2-year term should be renewed.  SAMP officials stated that while the office has not defined timelines or  measures, they believe that the office\u2019s activities should help to establish  self-perpetuating professionalism efforts within the military services.  SAMP officials stated that such efforts within the services may somewhat  diminish the need for SAMP, but these same officials also noted that the  work of the office will remain necessary and that its function should exist  beyond the initial 2-year term because building and sustaining an ethical  culture and professionalism capacity constitute a continuous effort at  every grade level. They added that the Secretary of Defense will also  continue to need a mechanism for looking across the services, working  with other countries, and influencing departmental policies. The need for  senior-level oversight of professionalism or ethics issues also was cited  by other DOD, industry, and foreign military organizations we contacted.  For example, SOCO officials expressed support for maintaining the  SAMP position or function beyond the initial 2-year period, stating that  there is enduring value in having an office like SAMP because it provides  a sense of permanence to ethics and professionalism and will help  institutionalize related improvement efforts. Similarly, as previously  stated, officials from three of the four industry and foreign military  organizations we contacted stated that their organization had in place a  direct link to senior leadership on ethics-related matters. Without timelines  or measures to assess the office\u2019s progress, DOD does not have  performance information for determining whether SAMP\u2019s efforts are on  track to achieve desired outcomes, and the department may find it difficult  to determine the future of the office and its function. Further, DOD will not  be positioned to assess whether SAMP is the appropriate vehicle to  achieve these outcomes or how best to allocate resources within the  department to achieve them."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Identified Potential Tools for Assessing Ethics and Professionalism Issues but Has Not Fully Implemented Key Tools or Developed Performance Metrics", "paragraphs": ["DOD has identified a number of mandatory and optional tools that  defense organizations can use to identify and assess individual and  organizational ethics and professionalism issues.

Psychometric tools include instruments such as the Navy\u2019s Hogan  Insights, which are designed to provide a holistic behavioral review of an  individual, and are generally used to assess and identify individual  behavior and personality traits. The SAMP office is completing an  inventory of climate, professional development, and psychometric tools  that are used across the department to enhance interdepartmental  visibility of these tools and to promote best practices. SAMP officials  stated that while these tools could be used to assess ethics-related  issues, none of the tools were designed exclusively for that purpose.  Figure 1 shows some of the tools identified by the SAMP office that could  be used to identify and assess individual and organizational ethics-related  issues.", "Officials from the SAMP office and from each of the military services have  cited command climate assessments and 360-degree assessments as  the department\u2019s primary tools that could be used for identifying ethics- related issues. Command climate assessments are designed to assess  elements that can impact an organization\u2019s effectiveness such as trust in  leadership, equal opportunity, and organizational commitment. These  assessments can include surveys, focus groups, interviews, records of  analyses, and physical observations. The command climate  assessment\u2019s main component is a survey administered online by the  Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute. Survey results, which  are provided to the unit commander, include a detailed analysis of unit  results in comparison to other units within the organization.", "In addition, 360-degree assessments are a professional developmental  tool that allows individuals to gain insights on their character traits by  soliciting feedback about their work performance from superiors,  subordinates, and peers. A variety of 360-degree assessments are used  across the department to enable different levels of personnel to obtain  such feedback. For example, the Army conducts three different 360- degree assessments under the Multi-Source Assessment Feedback  Program, which are targeted toward officers (Brigadier General and  below), non-commissioned officers, and civilian leaders. SAMP officials  stated that while none of these tools is specifically designed to assess  ethics issues, the office is investigating whether a combination of them  can be used to provide a more holistic picture of ethical behavior, and  exploring what might be gained by sharing data captured by these tools  across the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Military Services Have Implemented Command Climate Assessments, but Their Guidance Does Not Fully Address All Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The military services have issued guidance to implement command  climate assessments, but the Army, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps  do not have assurance that they are in compliance with all statutory  requirements because their guidance does not fully address implementing  and tracking requirements.

In addition to  complying with these requirements, the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy  also have command climate assessments reviewed above the next  highest level. For example, Navy officials stated that their command  climate assessment results are aggregated, analyzed, and reported to  Navy leadership annually to inform service policy and training.", "With respect to sections 587(b) and 587(c) of the authorization act, the  Navy\u2019s guidance addresses these sections, but the Army\u2019s, the Air  Force\u2019s, and the Marine Corps\u2019 respective guidance do not. For example,  the Army\u2019s performance evaluation process requires that raters assess a  commander\u2019s performance in fostering a climate of dignity and respect,  and in adhering to the requirements of the Army\u2019s Sexual  Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program, which requires  that command climate assessments be conducted. However, this  program does not specifically require that commanders include a  statement in their performance evaluations as to whether they conducted  an assessment, or that failure to do so be recorded in their performance  evaluation.", "In addition, not all of the military services\u2019 guidance fully meets DOD  guidance.

Among other things,  the guidance addresses the size of units for conducting command climate  assessments and the dissemination of assessment results. In response to  this guidance, each of the military services has developed written  guidance.

Specifically, the 2013  General and Flag Officer Character Implementation Plan memorandum  states that 360-degree assessments would be developed and used for all  military service and Joint Staff general and flag officers, and a November  2013 memorandum issued by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to  the President reiterates the department\u2019s commitment to developing and  implementing 360-degree assessments for all general and flag officers.", "The Air Force and the Army have developed and implemented 360- degree assessments for all of their general officers, but the Navy, the  Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff have developed and implemented 360- degree assessments only for certain general and flag officers. Table 3  shows the extent to which the military services and the Joint Staff have  developed and implemented 360-degree assessments for their general  and flag officers.", "The Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff cited different reasons for  developing and implementing 360-degree assessments only for certain  general and flag officers. For example, in 2013, the Navy required new  flag officers promoted to the Rear Admiral (Lower Half) rank, as well as  Rear Admiral (Lower Half) selects, to complete 360-degree assessments.  A Navy official stated that expanding 360-degree assessments to include  all Navy flag officers would incur significant costs, particularly with regard  to the cost of specially trained personnel to coach individuals on how to  respond to the results of their 360-degree assessments. Similarly, officials  from the SAMP office and Joint Staff cited coaching as a driver of costs  for 360-degree assessments. A RAND study released on behalf of DOD  in April 2015 also noted that 360-degree assessments are resource- intensive to design, implement, and maintain. Due to the costs  associated with expanding 360-degree assessments and other concerns,  such as the value of the feedback elicited by the tool, the Navy is  investigating other tools and techniques that can provide critical self- assessment for its personnel. For example, Navy officials stated they are  using a similar tool\u2014the Hogan Assessment\u2014as part of a Command  Leadership Course for some prospective commanding officers.", "According to Marine Corps officials, in 2014, two general officers from the  Marine Corps participated in a Joint Staff 360-degree assessment pilot  program. These officials stated that there are no plans to expand the  program to include Marine Corps general officers not assigned to the  Joint Staff because Marine Corps senior officials are satisfied with the  flexibility and feedback that the Joint Staff pilot provides, and because the  Marine Corps also uses the Commandant\u2019s Command Survey, which  similarly focuses on the climate and conduct of leaders and commanders.", "In October 2014, following its pilot, the Joint Staff initiated 360-degree  assessments for one and two star general and flag officers to occur at 6  months and 2 years after assignment to the Joint Staff. In July 2015, the  Joint Staff issued guidance requiring that Joint Staff three star general  and flag officers, civilian senior executives, and one, two, and three star  general and flag officers at the combatant commands complete 360- degree assessments. Joint Staff officials stated that 360-degree  assessments are not used at the four star rank because at that level the  peer and superior populations are significantly smaller, creating a greater  possibility of assessor survey fatigue and concerns about anonymity.  Further, Joint Staff officials stated that four star level officers already  conduct command climate surveys that allow everyone within their unit or  organization to assess the leader and organization.", "While the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff cited varying  reasons for implementing 360-degree assessment only for certain general  and flag officers, the inconsistent implementation of this tool across the  department denies a number of senior military leaders valuable feedback  on their leadership skills and an opportunity for developing an  understanding of personal strengths and areas for improvement. Taking  into account the military services\u2019 and the Joint Staff\u2019s differing reasons,  including costs, for implementing 360-degree assessments only for  certain general and flag officers, DOD may benefit from reassessing the  need and feasibility of developing and implementing 360-degree  assessments for all general and flag officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have Performance Metrics to Measure Its Progress in Addressing Ethics and Professionalism Issues", "paragraphs": ["Federal internal control standards emphasize the importance of  assessing performance over time, but DOD is unable to determine  whether its ethics and professionalism initiatives are achieving their  intended effect because it has not yet developed metrics to measure the  department\u2019s progress in addressing ethics and professionalism issues.  In 2012, we reported that federal agencies engaging in large projects can  use performance metrics to determine how well they are achieving their  goals and to identify any areas for improvement. By using performance  metrics, decision makers can obtain feedback for improving both policy  and operational effectiveness. Additionally, by tracking and developing a  baseline for all measures, agencies can better evaluate progress made  and whether or not goals are being achieved\u2014thus providing valuable  information for oversight by identifying areas of program risk and their  causes to decision makers. Through our body of work on leading  performance management practices, we have identified several attributes  of effective performance metrics (see table 4).", "SAMP officials stated that they recognize the need to continually measure  the department\u2019s progress in addressing ethics and professionalism, and  are considering ways to do so; however, challenges exist. For example,  the SAMP office plans to update the 2010 ethics survey by administering  a department-wide ethics survey in 2015 to reassess DOD\u2019s ethical  culture. SAMP officials stated that they expect the new survey to yield  valuable information on DOD\u2019s ethical culture, but they have not identified  metrics to assess DOD\u2019s ethical culture. Additionally, SAMP officials  stated that they plan to modify questions from the 2010 survey to lessen  its focus on acquisition-related matters, and to collect new information.  While modifying the questions from the 2010 survey may improve DOD\u2019s  understanding of its ethical climate, doing so could limit DOD\u2019s ability to  assess trends against baseline (2010) data. Moreover, DOD\u2019s ability to  assess trends in the future may also be affected by uncertainty as to  whether the survey will be administered beyond 2015. SAMP officials  attributed this uncertainty, in part, to survey fatigue within the  department\u2014a factor cited by SAMP officials that could also affect the  response rate for the 2015 survey, and therefore limit the utility of the  survey data. To combat this challenge, the SAMP office is considering  merging the ethics survey with another related survey, such as the sexual  assault prevention and response survey. According to SAMP officials, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has  established a working group to address survey fatigue within the  department.", "SAMP officials stated that they have also considered using misconduct  report data to assess the department\u2019s ethical culture, but that interpreting  such data can be challenging. For example, a reduction in reports of  misconduct could indicate either fewer occurrences or a decrease in  reporting\u2014the latter of which could be induced by concerns over  retribution for reporting, officials stated. Additionally, our review found  that the department\u2019s ability to assess department-wide trends in ethical  behavior is limited because misconduct report data are not collected in a  consistent manner across DOD. Specifically, DOD organizations define  categories of misconduct differently, thereby precluding comparisons of  misconduct data across different organizations, as well as aggregate- level analysis of department-wide data. To address this challenge, the  DOD Office of Inspector General is developing common definitions to  standardize the collection of misconduct report data across the  department. DOD Office of Inspector General officials estimated that the  definitions will be finalized in 2016.", "Because of such challenges, SAMP officials are considering certain  activities, such as increased focus on ethics-related matters by DOD  senior leadership, to be indicators of progress. Our work on performance  management has found that intermediate goals and measures such as  outputs or intermediate outcomes can be used to show progress or  contribution to intended results. For instance, when it may take years  before an agency sees the results of its programs, intermediate goals and  measures can provide information on interim results to allow for course  corrections. Also, when program results could be influenced by external  factors beyond agencies\u2019 control, they can use intermediate goals and  measures to identify the program\u2019s discrete contribution to a specific  result. Our review found that various mechanisms were used by the  industry and foreign military organizations we contacted to assess ethical  culture, with officials from all four industry and foreign military  organizations stating that their organization had used one or more tools to  assess the ethical culture of their organizations. For example, one of the  foreign military organizations we contacted administers a survey  periodically to both civilian and military personnel to measure the  organization\u2019s ethical culture against a baseline that was established in  2003. SAMP officials similarly stated that a variety of data sources\u2014 including organizational, survey, attitudinal, behavioral, and perception of  trust data\u2014should be used to assess DOD\u2019s ethical culture. However,  without identifying specific sources, DOD will not have the information  necessary to assess its progress. Moreover, without establishing clear,  quantifiable, and objective metrics that include a baseline assessment of  current performance to measure progress, or intermediate or short-term  goals and measures, decision-makers in DOD and Congress will find it  difficult to determine whether the department\u2019s ethics and professionalism  initiatives are on track to achieve desired outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Maintaining a workforce characterized by professionalism and  commitment to ethical values is key to executing DOD\u2019s mission to  protect the security of the nation; limiting conduct that can result in  misuse of government resources; and maintaining servicemember,  congressional, and public confidence in senior military leadership. As  recent cases of misconduct demonstrate, ethical and professional lapses  can carry significant operational consequences, waste taxpayer  resources, and erode public confidence. Since 2007, DOD has taken  significant steps to improve its ethical culture, for instance by conducting  a department-wide ethics survey and follow-on study. The department  has also acted to enhance oversight of its professionalism-related  initiatives and issues, for example through creating the SAMP office.  However, its overall effort could be strengthened by taking a number of  additional steps. In particular, without fully considering the Panel on  Contracting Integrity\u2019s recommendation to create a values-based ethics  program and the subsequent 2012 study recommendations, as well as  assessing the feasibility of expanding annual values-based ethics training  beyond the current mandated personnel, DOD will not have assurance  that it is doing enough to promote an ethical culture, and it may face  challenges in identifying areas for future action. Similarly, without  performance information, including timelines and measures, DOD will not  be optimally positioned to determine whether the SAMP\u2014a key oversight  position\u2014should be renewed after its initial 2-year term, or to assess the  SAMP office\u2019s progress.", "At the military service level, further actions also could improve oversight  of ethics and professionalism-related issues for senior leaders. For  instance, without revising current guidance to comply with statutory  requirements and departmental guidance and assure that commanders  are conducting command climate assessments, the Army, the Air Force,  the Navy, and the Marine Corps will be unable to discern whether  commanders are obtaining feedback on their performance and promoting  an effective culture. Furthermore, without examining the need for and  feasibility of implementing 360-degree assessments for all general and  flag officers, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff will not have  information that could enhance individual ethics and professional values.", "Finally, given the initiatives that DOD is planning and has under way, it is  important that there be reliable means by which to gauge progress.

In its  written comments, DOD stated that the department will submit its Fiscal  Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act report on military programs  and controls regarding professionalism to Congress on September 1,  2015, thereby satisfying the requirements of this recommendation.", "Although DOD states that the intent of our recommendation will be  satisfied by the September 1, 2015, report to Congress, we have not  been provided a copy of the draft report and cannot determine whether  the report will include timelines and measures. Further, while DOD stated  that SAMP's dissolution will occur in March 2016, a formal decision has  not yet been made. As we discussed in our report, DOD officials stated  that there is an enduring need for the work and functions of the SAMP  office because, among other things, building and sustaining an ethical  culture and professionalism capacity constitute a continuous effort at  every grade level, and because of the importance of having a direct link  between senior leadership and the Secretary of Defense on ethics and  professionalism matters. The intent of our recommendation is to help  equip decision makers with the information necessary to assess SAMP's  progress and thereby determine next steps regarding its future. We  continue to believe that without timelines or measures to assess the  office\u2019s progress, DOD will not be positioned to assess whether SAMP is  the appropriate vehicle to achieve these outcomes, or how best to  allocate resources within the department to achieve them.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of  Staff; the Secretaries of the Military Departments; and the Commandant  of the Marine Corps.

For example, we reviewed the  Code of Federal Regulations and DOD guidance such as the Joint Ethics  Regulation, which governs DOD\u2019s ethics program and the management of  related activities including training, financial disclosure reporting, and gift  receipt. We also reviewed work plans and timelines that define the  Senior Advisor for Military Professionalism (SAMP) position and the  scope of its activities. We compared, against federal internal control  standards and practices for effective ethics programs and strategic  training, actions and work products related to the department\u2019s ongoing  and planned initiatives to establish a values-based ethics program and to  develop an ethical and professional culture. These documents included  studies commissioned by DOD to assess its ethical culture and to design  and implement a values-based program; memorandums and work  products related to the 13 general and flag officer character initiatives;  and Secretary of Defense memorandums requiring actions including  ethics training and professional military education reviews. We also  interviewed officials responsible for ethics and professionalism from the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services, and the Joint  Staff to identify additional actions and determine progress in these areas.  We assessed these documents by comparing them against leading  practices for strategic planning and performance measurement that relate  to the need for detailed plans outlining major implementation tasks and  defined measures and timelines to measure progress; and federal internal  control standards related to the need for performance measures and  indicators, and the importance of managers determining proper actions in  response to findings and recommendations from audits and reviews and  completing such actions within established timeframes.", "We obtained and analyzed Fiscal Year 2012 to 2014 misconduct data  from the DOD Office of Inspector General to identify discernible trends in  reported misconduct, as well as data regarding the number of DOD  personnel receiving annual ethics training. Specifically, we obtained  calendar year 2014 DOD annual ethics training data that included active  duty, reserve, and civilian personnel reported to the Office of Government  Ethics by the 17 DOD Designated Agency Ethics Officials, excluding the  National Security Agency. These are the most current data available on  annual ethics training, and they are the data used by the Office of  Government Ethics to determine DOD\u2019s compliance with the annual  training requirement for financial disclosure filers. We did not assess the  reliability of these data, but we have included them in the report to provide  context. We did not use these data to support our findings, conclusions,  or recommendations. To determine the percentage of DOD personnel  who have completed annual ethics training, we obtained Fiscal Year 2014  data from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) on  the number of DOD personnel, including active duty and reserve  component military personnel and civilian full-time equivalents. We also  reviewed relevant literature to identify ethics-related issues and best  practices within DOD, and we met with foreign military officials, defense  industry organizations, and commercial firms that we identified during our  preliminary research and in discussion with DOD officials as having  experience in implementing and evaluating compliance-based or values- based ethics programs in the public and private sectors, both  domestically and internationally, to define the concept of values-based  ethics and to gather lessons learned from values-based ethics program  implementation. A full listing of these organizations can be found in table  5.", "To evaluate DOD\u2019s tools and performance metrics for identifying,  assessing, and measuring its progress in addressing ethics and  professionalism issues, we examined assessment tools identified by DOD  as containing ethics-related content, including command climate surveys  and 360-degree assessments. We used content analysis to review and  assess actions the department has taken to implement and use the  results of command climate and 360-degree assessments in accordance  with statutory requirements and departmental guidance. These  requirements pertain to the implementation, tracking, and targeting of  these tools, among other things. To do this, we met with officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services, and the Joint  Staff to obtain information on the status of their efforts to implement and  track command climate assessments, and to develop and implement 360- degree assessments for general and flag officers in accordance with  statutory requirements and departmental initiatives. We then assessed  guidance and instructions developed by the military services and the Joint  Staff to determine whether they addressed each of the statutory  requirements and departmental guidance related to command climate  assessments and 360-degree assessments.", "To ensure accuracy, one GAO analyst conducted the initial content  analysis by coding the military services\u2019 and the Joint Staff\u2019s actions with  respect to each requirement, and a GAO attorney then checked the  analysis for accuracy. We determined that command climate guidance  and instructions addressed a statutory or departmental requirement if it  addressed each aspect of the requirement. Similarly, we determined the  extent to which the military services and the Joint Staff had developed  and implemented 360-degree assessments for all general and flag  officers by evaluating the steps they had taken to develop and implement  these tools for each general and flag officer rank within each organization.  Any disagreements in the coding were discussed and reconciled by the  analyst and attorney. We also spoke with officials within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the military services to identify  performance metrics that could be used by the department to measure its  progress in addressing ethics and professionalism issues, and we  assessed the department\u2019s efforts to identify such metrics against federal  internal control standards and our prior work on performance  measurement leading practices.", "In addressing both of our audit objectives, we interviewed officials from  the organizations identified in table 5.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to  September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
