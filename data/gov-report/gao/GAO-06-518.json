GAO identified $0.3 million of FEMA paid costs that the Red Cross properly deducted from its reimbursement requests, so as not to duplicate funding by other federal sources. The Red Cross also reduced its requested reimbursements by $60.2 million to reflect private donations for disaster relief for the four hurricanes, for a net reimbursement of 28.1 million. Red Cross expenses were incurred in states and territories eligible for disaster relief associated with the four hurricanes in accordance with the FEMA/Red Cross agreement. The Red Cross requested reimbursement of $28.1 million for the period August 11, 2004, through June 30, 2005, for payment from federal appropriated funds under Public Law 108-324. After review and some retesting, GAO relied upon audit work conducted by the CPA firm of KPMG, LLP, which determined that most Red Cross expenses were incurred for eligible disaster services and were supported by adequate documentation. However, KPMG identified six weaknesses in the Red Cross's internal controls related to expenses incurred for the four hurricanes and reported $712,000 of known questioned costs, with which Red Cross concurred.

These storms are referred to as tropical depressions when  sustained winds are less than 39 miles-per-hour (mph) and are given a name  as a tropical storm if sustained winds exceed gale force of 39 mph up to 74  mph. Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with sustained winds that exceed 74  mph, which circulate counterclockwise about their centers in the Northern  Hemisphere. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through  November 30 each year.", "On August 13, 2004, the third storm of the 2004 hurricane season, named  Hurricane Charley, made U.S. landfall as a category 4 hurricane near  Charlotte Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico side of the Florida peninsula with  sustained winds of 150 mph. This hurricane was the strongest hurricane to  hit the United States since the category 5 Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  Hurricane Charley caused catastrophic wind damage across central  Florida, with nine tornadoes reported on August 13 in association with the  hurricane. As indicated in figure 1, the hurricane\u2019s path moved northeast  across central Florida, with the center passing near Orlando at 86 mph as it  moved off the northeast coast near Daytona Beach and into the Atlantic  Ocean.", "Charley then moved north along the South Carolina coast, making U.S.  landfall again at North Myrtle Beach as a category 1 hurricane with  sustained winds of 75 mph. The hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical  storm over North Carolina as it moved up the Atlantic coast. Hurricane  Charley created rain, flooding, and seven tornadoes in North Carolina and  Virginia, including category F1 tornado damage at Kitty Hawk, North  Carolina. On August 15, Charley merged with a frontal zone in  southeastern Massachusetts that eventually moved into Canada. Hurricane  Charley was cited in two federal disaster declarations for Florida and South  Carolina. It was responsible for 33 U.S. deaths according to the Red Cross  and 34 U.S. deaths according to NOAA\u2019s National Climate Data Center  (NCDC). The Property Claims Service and the Insurance Information  Institute, both of which provide insurance damage information, estimated  damage to insured property that averaged $7.2 billion and an equal amount  for uninsured damages. With total damage estimated at about $15 billion,  Charley became the third costliest hurricane in U.S. history through 2005.", "The sixth storm of the 2004 hurricane season, named Hurricane Frances,  reached peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of  144 mph out in the Atlantic Ocean as it passed north of the U.S. Virgin  Islands on August 31, 2004. Frances was downgraded to a category 2  hurricane with sustained winds of around 100 mph by the time it made U.S.  landfall near Sewall\u2019s Point, 35 miles north of West Palm Beach on the east  coast of Florida on September 5. As indicated in figure 1, Frances moved  northwest across central Florida and became a tropical storm as it moved  into the Gulf of Mexico near New Port Richey, Florida, on September 6.    Later that day it again made U.S. landfall on the Florida panhandle and  moved west into eastern Alabama and western Georgia. It weakened to a  tropical depression on September 7, and moved into West Virginia early on  September 9. Hurricane Frances produced gale force winds as it briefly  accelerated northeast across New York and into northern New England  until dissipating over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 10.", "Frances caused widespread rains and flooding over much of the eastern  United States and a total of 101 tornadoes were reported in association  with this hurricane, with 56 occurring in the Carolinas on September 7.  Hurricane Frances was cited in five federal disaster declarations for  Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. It was  responsible for 45 U.S. deaths according to the Red Cross and 38 U.S.  deaths according to NOAA/NCDC. The American Insurance Services  Group, an insurance trade association, estimated damage to insured  property at $4.43 billion and an equal amount for uninsured damages. With  total damage estimated at $8.9 billion, Frances became the fifth costliest  hurricane in U.S. history through 2005.", "The ninth storm of the 2004 hurricane season, named Hurricane Ivan,  reached category 5 strength three times in the course of its journey across  the Atlantic into the Gulf of Mexico, with sustained winds as high as 167  mph. From September 5 to 12, Ivan caused considerable property damage  and loss of life primarily in Grenada and Jamaica as it passed through the  Caribbean Sea. Ivan weakened to a category 3 hurricane with sustained  winds of 121 mph when it made U.S. landfall just west of Gulf Shores,  Alabama, on September 16. As indicated in figure 1, Ivan moved across  central Alabama where it weakened to a tropical storm and moved  northeast as far as the Delmarva Peninsula on September 18. However,  even as a weak tropical storm, Ivan produced considerable rain and  flooding, spawning 113 tornadoes across the southeastern United States, as  depicted in figure 2.", "This included two category F2 tornadoes in Florida that resulted in five  deaths, and 61 tornadoes reported on September 17. Ivan then ceased its  northeast movement and over the next 3 days made a large loop and moved  southwest along the eastern U.S. coast, crossing Florida back into the Gulf  of Mexico on September 21. There Ivan completed its loop and became a  tropical storm, making landfall in southwestern Louisiana on   September 24. Later that day, it dissipated over the upper Texas coast after  completing a storm track more than 5,600 miles long. Hurricane Ivan was  cited in nine federal disaster declarations for Alabama, Florida, Georgia,  Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and  Pennsylvania. It was responsible for 63 U.S. deaths according to the Red  Cross and 52 U.S. deaths according to NOAA/NCDC. The American  Insurance Services Group estimated insured property damage at   $7.1 billion and an equal amount for uninsured damages. With total damage  estimated at $14.2 billion, Ivan became the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S.  history through 2005.", "The 10th storm of the 2004 hurricane season, named Hurricane Jeanne, was  a tropical storm as it moved over the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 14,  2004, and produced heavy rain over Puerto Rico on September 15, with  sustained winds of 69 mph. Jeanne became a category 1 hurricane over the  Dominican Republic with sustained winds of 81 mph that resulted in an  estimated 3,000 deaths in Haiti from torrential rainfall, mudslides, and  flooding on September 17. Jeanne made U.S. landfall at Port St. Lucie on  the east coast of Florida, very near where hurricane Frances made U.S.  landfall on September 5, as a category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of  121 mph on the morning of September 26.", "As indicated in figure 1, Jeanne moved westward across central Florida but  quickly became a tropical storm by the time it reached Tampa. It further  weakened to a tropical depression as it moved northward, dumping heavy  rains across central Georgia and into the Carolinas, Virginia, and the  Delmarva Peninsula. On September 29, Jeanne merged with a frontal zone  that dissipated eastward into the Atlantic. Hurricane Jeanne was cited in  five federal disaster declarations for the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,  Florida, Virginia, and Delaware. It was responsible for 13 U.S. deaths,  according to the Red Cross, and 28 U.S. deaths, according to NOAA/NCDC.  The American Insurance Services Group estimated damage to insured  property at $3.44 billion and an equal amount for uninsured damages. With  total damage estimated at $6.9 billion, Jeanne became the seventh costliest  hurricane in U.S. history through 2005.", "The Red Cross activated its preparedness and disaster relief operations  before hurricane Charley made landfall, and remained on the ground  providing critical emergency services through the three subsequent  hurricanes. The Red Cross stated that this effort, through the 2004  hurricane season, resulted in the largest hurricane relief operation in its  123-year history. From mid-August through mid-October 2004, the Red  Cross reported that it had established over 1,800 shelters that housed  almost 425,000 people displaced by the hurricanes, provided over 11  million meals and snacks to hurricane victims and emergency workers, and  provided more than 149,000 comfort kits and 113,000 cleanup kits. The Red  Cross stated that this effort involved over 35,000 workers, of whom 90  percent were volunteers, to set up shelters, provide transportation, support  the sheltering and feeding effort, and distribute supplies.", "As required by statute and regulation, the Red Cross receives an annual  audit of its consolidated financial statements, including a schedule of  expenditures of federal awards. The Red Cross is required to have its  activities, including a complete, itemized report of all receipts and  expenditures, audited by the Secretary of Defense through the U.S. Army  Audit Agency pursuant to 36 U.S.C. 300110; Department of Defense  Directive 1330.5; and Army Regulation 930-5. The Red Cross is also subject  to the audit requirements of the Single Audit Act and OMB Circular No. A- 133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.", "The Red Cross contracted with an independent public accounting firm,  KPMG, to conduct a financial audit of its consolidated financial statements,  as well as an audit of its schedule of expenditures of federal awards, for the  fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. To fulfill its audit responsibilities, avoid  duplication and unnecessary expense, and make the most efficient use of  available resources, the U.S. Army Audit Agency reviewed KPMG\u2019s work  and reports. According to its report of October 21, 2005, the U.S. Army  Audit Agency found nothing during its review to indicate that KPMG\u2019s  unqualified opinion on the Red Cross\u2019s 2005 consolidated financial  statements was inappropriate or could not be relied on.", "For the Red Cross single audit, the Department of Health and Human  Services serves as the cognizant federal agency on behalf of all  participating federal agencies under the Single Audit Act audit process.

This draft agreement  outlined the operating definitions and the proposed approach for federal  reimbursement of Red Cross disaster relief, emergency services, and  recovery expenditures associated with hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan,  and Jeanne. We then participated in a series of meetings with  representatives of the Red Cross, FEMA, DHS\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, KPMG, and OMB. The purpose of these meetings was to refine the  criteria to be consistent with FEMA and Red Cross policies and procedures  for disaster relief and Public Law 108-324. The final agreement was signed  by FEMA and Red Cross officials in May 2005.", "To ensure that Red Cross reimbursements did not duplicate funds paid by  other federal programs, we examined the FEMA and Red Cross agreement  that provided that the Red Cross would not request reimbursement for any  expenses paid by other federal funding sources. As the primary federal  funding source for disaster assistance, FEMA identified any payments it  had made to the Red Cross and reconciled amounts to reimbursement  requests to ensure that its federal funds were not duplicated. We reviewed  this identification and reconciliation process, conducted discussions with  FEMA and Red Cross officials, and reviewed for indications of other  federal funding during our audit of Red Cross reimbursement requests.", "To determine if Red Cross reimbursable claims were paid only for services  in states and territories declared eligible for disaster relief, we reconciled  21 federal disaster declarations for hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and  Jeanne to the FEMA and Red Cross agreement. We also identified states  where federal disaster declarations were issued as a result of severe  flooding caused by these four hurricanes. However, the Red Cross, as a not- for-profit organization, is not limited by federal disaster declarations and  can provide emergency assistance where it determines there is a need. As a  result, we identified several other states where Red Cross incurred some  hurricane-associated expenses related to the four hurricanes that were part  of the FEMA/Red Cross agreement.", "To determine whether reimbursable claims were paid only for allowable  categories of services and support, and whether those claims were  supported by adequate documentation, we reviewed audit work performed  by the public accounting firm of KPMG. The Red Cross hired KPMG to  perform an entitywide audit of its consolidated financial statements,  including all of its federal awards in accordance with OMB Circular No. A- 133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.  In order to avoid duplication of audit work, we reviewed KPMG\u2019s Single  Audit Act audit of the Red Cross for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005,  that contained $88.6 million of incurred expenses and $28.1 million of net  reimbursements to be paid from federal funds that we were mandated to  audit under Public Law 108-324.

The cards were introduced on a large scale basis for the first  time during the 2004 hurricane response in Florida. The cards are preferred  by the Red Cross in part because of their acceptance by merchants,  reduced paperwork, and the flexibility afforded to disaster clients. An  internal authorizing approval document (Red Cross Form 1030) is used to  issue a card to individual clients following initial casework. Individual card  spending limits are determined by the caseworker\u2019s assessment of the  client\u2019s immediate needs for housing, food, transportation, and other  personal expenses, with a current maximum card balance of $5,000. Card  spending limits can be restored after they are consumed if the caseworker  determines additional client need exists. Most cards were \u201ccash-enabled,\u201d  meaning they could be used to withdraw cash from any ATM. To limit  certain risks of unauthorized card use, specific merchant codes are  blocked by the card program\u2019s bank administrator in order to prevent the  card from being used at locations that principally sell goods such as alcohol  and tobacco and at certain luxury retail outlets.", "KPMG conducted a monetary unit statistical sample of 336 transactions on  334 individual debit cards from a population of about 40,000 debit cards  that generated $24.0 million of transactions.

This amount was the difference  between detail amounts reported by the issuing bank based upon card  transactions and summary amounts the bank reported to the Red Cross for  the debit card program. The Red Cross used the amounts from the bank  summary reports to record entries to its general ledger and to recognize  debit card expenses for the 2004 hurricane program. No reconciliation  between these two bank reports had been performed by the Red Cross  following the 2004 hurricane season. The bank investigated the difference  and discovered that its summary program reports were erroneously  capturing duplicate cardholder information if a card was assigned to a  cardholder more than one time. This caused an overstatement in the  summary of debit card amounts, although the bank\u2019s detail transaction  reports on cards were correct.

Any questionable transactions  were to be referred to the Family Services unit for further investigation.  However, no standard procedures were developed for monitoring cards  until May 2005, when a one-page procedure provided examples of  questionable card activity that should be pursued.
