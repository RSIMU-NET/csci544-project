Given the federal government\u2019s  sheer size and scope, providing a clear and complete picture of what the  federal government does and how much it costs has been a challenge.  Federal government activities are spread across numerous programs and  agencies, and there is no comprehensive resource describing these  programs or information about their cost, what services they provide, and  how they are performing. The lack of a comprehensive inventory of  federal programs makes it difficult to assess the scope of the federal  government\u2019s involvement in particular areas and, therefore, limits the  ability of decision makers to determine where action is needed to make  government more effective and efficient. As we have previously reported,  this includes limiting the government\u2019s ability to identify and address  programs that are overlapping or duplicative or that operate in a  fragmented manner across multiple agencies.", "The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) requires the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) to present a coherent picture of all  federal programs by making information available about each federal  program on a website. Relatedly, the Digital Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), once fully implemented, is  expected to link federal contract, loan, and grant spending information  with specific federal programs. Programs are defined in the Glossary of  Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process as \u201cgenerally, an organized  set of activities directed toward a common purpose or goal that an agency  undertakes or proposes to carry out its responsibilities.\u201d A federal  program inventory would consist of the individual programs identified by  the agencies and OMB and information collected about each of them.", "We reported in 2014 that initial efforts to develop an inventory have  resulted in inconsistent definitions and significant information gaps. As a  result, the inventory did not provide useful information for decision  making. Further, we stated that without such an inventory, efforts to link  spending information to specific programs as part of DATA Act  implementation will be hampered. Therefore, we recommended OMB  accelerate efforts to determine how best to merge GPRAMA and DATA  Act requirements to produce a federal program inventory that meets  Congress\u2019s needs. OMB staff generally agreed with our  recommendations regarding the implementation of the inventory, although  they stated that until they had firmer plans on how program inventory and  DATA Act implementation could be merged, they could not determine if  implementing all of our recommendations would be feasible. See  appendix II for a list of these prior recommendations and more details on  their implementation status.", "Since our 2014 report on the initial program inventory, we have  conducted additional work to better understand what OMB and agencies  could do to develop a federal program inventory. During this time, we  identified the theories and practices of information architecture as a  potential framework for the development of a useful federal program  inventory. Broadly speaking, information architecture is the practice of  deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable.  Information architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling  content in an effective and sustainable way to support findability,  manageability, and usability from the infrastructure level to the user  interface level. The goal is to help users find information and complete  tasks. To do this in the context of a federal program inventory, agencies  would more effectively contribute to the inventory if they are able to  understand how the pieces fit together to create the larger picture and  how items relate to each other within the system.", "GPRAMA includes a statutory provision for us to periodically evaluate and  report on (1) how implementation of the act is affecting performance  management at the 24 major departments and agencies subject to the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, including whether  performance management is being used to improve efficiency and  effectiveness of agency programs; and (2) crosscutting goal  implementation. This report is part of our response to that mandate. Our  objective for this report was to examine how the principles and practices  of information architecture can be applied for the development of a useful  federal program inventory. We reviewed several resources in the field of  information architecture and discussed its applicability to developing a  federal program inventory with practitioners in the field. We also  examined how these principles and practices align with guidance and  other good practices for the development of federal websites, which  include practices related to quality and usefulness, among other areas, as  described in our methodology in appendix I.", "Our methodology involved describing the general steps that could guide  the development of a federal program inventory using an information  architecture approach, as well as assessing how the principles and  practices of information architecture could be used to identify programs  and to identify, compile, and organize information within an inventory.

OMB subsequently published 24 separate inventory  documents on Performance.gov in May 2013, wherein agencies were to  select an approach for identifying programs and provide funding and  performance information for the programs identified. For the second  phase, originally planned for publication in May 2014, the 24 agencies  were to update their inventories based on any stakeholder feedback they  received and provide additional program-level funding and performance  information. OMB\u2019s guidance also stated that, at that time, the inventory  information was to be presented in a more dynamic, web-based  approach. However, agencies did not publish updated inventories in May  2014.", "In October 2014, we reported that according to OMB officials plans for  updating the inventories were on indefinite hold as OMB re-evaluated  next steps for what type of information would be presented in the  inventories and how it would be presented.

Agencies had the flexibility to identify their  programs using different approaches within the broad definition of what  constitutes a program, which\u2014while potentially appropriate for individual  agencies\u2014limited the comparability of information across the inventory.  Further, we found that the agencies did not work together or consult with  stakeholders. We also found that none of the agencies provided the  necessary budget and performance information. Without performance  information, it was unclear how programs supported various agency  goals. We also determined that for the federal program inventory to be  useful it must be accurate, complete, consistent, reliable, and valid,  among other factors. We recommended a number of specific steps  OMB and agencies could take to ensure the inventories are more useful  to decisions makers, including providing complete performance  information (including performance goals), consulting with stakeholders,  and ensuring that information in the inventory is comparable within and  across agencies.

There are three key concepts in information  architecture that are relevant to the development of a federal program  inventory\u2014facet, controlled vocabulary, and taxonomy. Table 1 defines  these terms and provides examples of what they mean within the context  of a federal program inventory. Decision rules provide consistency in how  programs are included, in the application of the controlled vocabulary,  and in the collection of program information in facets.", "Information architecture can be visualized as a process to identify and  define needed information, develop a structure for organizing and  presenting it, and ensure that standards are met and maintained. These  steps may not be purely sequential, but may be iterative as the inventory  is developed, evaluated, and maintained. Based on the principles of  information architecture, figure 1 provides a conceptual overview of this  potential process for developing a federal program inventory. Each of  these steps is described more fully in the sections following.", "As program information in the inventory is collected and organized into  facets, it can be aggregated or disaggregated to facilitate various uses.  Facets\u2014and the information or data collected within them\u2014can be  structured to allow for searching, grouping, or other functions. Individual  facets could describe program characteristics or operations or could  relate to budgeting or performance information, among other things.  Within these facets, specific information or data would be reported such  as program type, specific agency or office names, or budget data. By  organizing information according to facets, programs can be identified,  grouped, or organized based on certain characteristics, such as the  information or data collected within the facet. For example, if a program  facet on beneficiaries existed, then potentially all programs that serve the  same types of beneficiaries could be identified within the inventory.", "In the following sections we provide examples of how these principles and  practices can be applied to federal programs.

There can be many specific uses for the inventory to  support this purpose, and input from stakeholders\u2014such as Congress,  agency officials, state and local governments, third-party service  providers, and the public\u2014can assist in establishing these potential uses.  Early stakeholder involvement can also guide efforts to determine what  programs and program information should be included so that the  inventory is more likely to meet stakeholder needs over time.", "We have reported that a federal program inventory including performance  information could be used by congressional decision makers to inform  decision making to identify issues that the federal government should  address, to measure progress, and to identify better strategies, if  necessary, among other uses. State officials that we interviewed from  three states that have developed or are developing program inventories  pointed to similar potential uses. For example, in Vermont a senior  performance management official said the state\u2019s inventory could be used  to facilitate cross-agency coordination, aid government transitions (such  as for newly elected legislators), and link program performance with  funding. Likewise, an Arizona official told us the state\u2019s program inventory  has the potential to show how agency programs align with performance  goals. Michigan officials anticipate that the program inventory currently  being developed in that state will have the potential to identify duplication  and overlap among state programs. As a result, decision makers in that  state will be better equipped to oversee the budget process.", "Our prior work highlights potential uses for different types of information  that could be included in a program inventory. Performance and  budgeting information\u2014including, among other types of information,  performance goals, targets, and time frames; measures of efficiency;  operations, such as activities and services; and costs\u2014could facilitate a  variety of potential uses, such as helping decision makers prioritize resources among programs or  identifying pressing issues for the government to address;  informing congressional decisions about authorizing or reauthorizing  federal programs, provisions in the tax code, and other activities; and determining the scope of the federal government\u2019s involvement,  investment, and performance in a particular area.", "Prioritization of some uses may be important to consider to make the  inventory more effective. As we previously reported, consulting with  stakeholders to understand their needs would better ensure that the  information provided in the inventories is useful for stakeholder decision  making. Such prioritization, for example, could also involve examining  costs that agencies might face in collecting information for certain facets.  Then decisions could be made to select only a subset of all potential  facets for inclusion in early iterations of the inventory.", "Tax expenditures are one program type that would need to be included in  the program inventory to fully implement GPRAMA. Tax expenditures  represent a substantial federal commitment. If the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s estimates are summed, an estimated $1.23 trillion in federal  revenue was forgone from the 169 tax expenditures reported for fiscal  year 2015, an amount comparable to discretionary spending. Tax  expenditures are often aimed at policy goals similar to those of federal  spending programs. Increased transparency over tax expenditures could  help determine how well specific tax expenditures work to achieve their  goals and how their benefits and costs compare to those of spending  programs with similar goals. In our 2014 review of the executive branch\u2019s  initial effort to develop a program inventory, we recommended OMB  include tax expenditures as a program type in the federal program  inventory and work with the Department of the Treasury to produce an  inventory of tax expenditures. As stated previously, OMB neither agreed  nor disagreed with those recommendations.", "Likewise, to enhance usefulness at the federal level, a program inventory  can include program operations information, in addition to the budget and  performance information required by GPRAMA. Program operations  information can include descriptions of what programs do, whom they  serve, and the specific activities they conduct. Including this type of  information provides a more comprehensive picture of a program within  the inventory. There are many potential benefits, including improved  ability to identify, assess, and address fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication within the federal government. Likewise, program operations  information can provide opportunities to enhance service delivery among  programs offering similar services or serving related populations. For  example, programs serving low income or transportation disadvantaged  populations could look for opportunities to facilitate access to related  services by coordinating to provide transportation for these beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Step 2: Identify Concepts and Terms", "paragraphs": ["One of the central tasks in creating an inventory of federal programs is to  identify the programs to be included and the information to be collected  about them. Information architecture practices suggest selecting  information sources to compile a list of concepts and terms as part of a  controlled vocabulary. For example, stakeholders may frequently use  certain terms and concepts to describe programs and make distinctions  between different types of programs that can affect the content of the  inventory or the information included within it. Thus, grant programs may  describe eligible beneficiaries using similar terms, such as rural and  urban or youth and elderly. Once the list of concepts and terms has been  compiled using a structured process for identifying key terms and  concepts, preferences can be selected that best align with meeting user  needs to create facets for the inventory. Potential information sources  include agency budgets, budget justifications, performance reports,  organizational structures, websites, and other internal documentation.", "Additionally, the facets that will frame information about those programs  would need to be identified and defined, with OMB deciding which facets  warrant the cost of collection in the short and long term with input from  agencies and stakeholders, if the information architecture approach is  used. According to the National Information Standards Organization  (NISO), the design and development of a controlled vocabulary can help  to ensure that concepts are described distinctly by eliminating ambiguity  and controlling for synonyms.

However, variations in agency  organizational structures, missions, history, and funding authorities\u2014as  well as in the purposes for which agencies create or use program  information, such as budgets or performance reports\u2014can result in  differences in how agencies organize and group activities using different  terms. To illustrate these differences, table 2 provides our observations  on how Education, USAID, and DHS used the concepts and terms of  program area (for collections of related programs), program, and activity  (for more specific activities within a given program) in budget  documentation. Each of these three agencies includes these concepts in  their documents, but how they are organized and what they contain  differs.", "The varied uses of these terms within and across agencies\u2014all from  agency budget documentation\u2014illustrate one challenge of consistently  using words such as \u201cprogram\u201d and the benefits of creating a controlled  vocabulary that could move agencies toward a common understanding  and more consistent application of these terms for an inventory.  Because agencies have flexibility in deciding what activities constitute a  program, an information architecture approach that would focus attention  at the facet level would help make the inventory information more  consistent.

Conversely, an approach to an inventory that  groups activities narrowly and includes a comparatively large number of  programs could result in greater transparency and usefulness, but would  likely create significant costs for agencies to identify, create, and  maintain. Decision rules for determining what should be identified as a  program for purposes of the inventory will need to balance usefulness  and costs, if this approach is implemented.", "Further, agencies will need to consider how best to organize their  activities for inclusion as programs in the inventory, which could present a  challenge. The three agencies we reviewed have different organizational  structures, such as strategic, programmatic, or budget structures that  could be used to organize inventory programs. For example, Education  generally has consistent, program-focused alignment across its  organizational structures. DHS has historically not had as consistent a  program focus across its structures\u2014given its origins from many different  agencies\u2014but has recently more closely aligned its budget and program  structures. USAID\u2019s different structures have presented agency efforts in  multiple ways, including at a country level and also at a broader, mission- focused level such as combating malaria or providing basic education.  (See appendix III for more information on how these differences can  affect program identification.) Decision rules will need to be established to  help agencies present programs in the inventory in a way that is as  consistent as possible, given these differences, which could pose  different challenges across agencies.", "Because agency activities and structures differ, as do user needs,  agencies implementing an information architecture approach would need  to clearly illustrate the relationships among individual\u2014or groupings of\u2014 activities and what is included under a designated program name. This  will provide transparency over how the agency applied decision rules and  what an agency included under that program, though some agencies may  have greater challenges doing so. At the three agencies, we found that  variations in the ease of identifying programs often reflected agency  organizational structures. For example, Education\u2019s internal organization  allows for the relatively easy identification of a consistent list of programs  when using appropriation accounts and program names, in part because  its appropriations are set up similar to its programs, according to agency  officials. By contrast, other agency officials\u2014including at USAID\u2014 expressed concern about linking programs to appropriations, because  their programs and appropriations are not similarly structured. Appendix  III provides information on how Education\u2019s, USAID\u2019s, and DHS\u2019s  organizational structures might affect program identification\u2014specifically  in our case study context of identifying programs using budget  documentation\u2014including a recent DHS effort to better align its budget  structure with its discretionary programs.", "OMB and agencies could also establish decision rules on how to treat  activities and funding streams that may not be clearly linked to specific  programs or provide overall administrative or mission support, in order to  ensure these items are treated consistently. This can include, for  example, general administration, information technology-related  maintenance, and general construction. Each of the three agencies  selected for our illustrative case studies had these categories of funding  and expenses. For example, Education had a \u201cProgram Administration\u201d  program that accounted for over $400 million in fiscal year 2015  obligations and funded close to half of the agency\u2019s almost 4,100 full-time  employees. Education used \u201cProgram Administration\u201d to provide  administrative support across most programs and offices in the  department.

Table 4 provides an illustration of selected programs in three federal  agencies providing early learning or child care services for different age  groups. In the federal program inventory, comparisons could be made  across or between multiple facets. In this case, the information included  within the activities/services and beneficiary facets are compared to  identify programs with similar characteristics.

For those programs that were included in the  CFDA, for example, we were able to collect information for a number of  our facets, such as functional codes that reflect program operations and  coded entries for eligibility.

For example,  we were unable to identify 39 (of 58) efforts or programs in the  President\u2019s budget by name or by funding for a recent report looking at  federal efforts supporting U.S. manufacturing, although we were able to  report program obligations for many but not all of them after we  conducted a survey of agency officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Step 4: Evaluate Structure and Content", "paragraphs": ["After identifying programs and facets and determining relevant  relationships, information architecture principles suggest evaluating the  taxonomy of the program inventory in several ways. For instance, an  evaluation could ask how well the inventory\u2019s structure and controlled  vocabulary organize and present needed information. Further, the  evaluation could involve consulting with experts or comparing with  existing taxonomies and standards to ensure that all the needed terms  and facets are included. Evaluation of the structure and content of the  inventory can involve different methodologies, including reviewing existing  standards and interviewing subject-matter experts. There are a number of  sources available for standards related to the organization of information  using the principles and practices of information architecture, including  NISO standards for controlled vocabularies.", "In addition to evaluating the inventory\u2019s taxonomy and facets, it will also  be necessary to evaluate the quality of the specific program information  content. This includes examining the consistency and completeness of  the information that agencies report. Consistently identifying program  information in facets related to outcomes could help agencies identify  where they have programs that have similar purposes or activities, and  therefore opportunities to collaborate. Likewise, a complete inventory\u2014 including all federal efforts within each definition\u2014could be a useful tool  for addressing crosscutting issues. Specific aspects could include  examining whether the information is accurate, consistent with the  controlled vocabulary, properly formatted, and current. Including  consistent and complete program information will help the inventory be  more useful and allow users to better compare and contrast programs  across broad areas with federal involvement, as we noted in our 2014  report.", "More generally, while the inventory is developed iteratively, continuously  evaluating the extent to which it is delivering the usefulness desired by  stakeholders will enhance its continued usefulness. As part of this  evaluation, OMB and agencies can assess the decision rules for the  identification of individual programs to determine the extent to which the  resulting set of programs are identified at a level that facilitates  comparisons across and within agencies. This type of evaluation could  lead agencies to determine that activities should be grouped together  more broadly (including more activities) or more narrowly (including fewer  activities) to allow for better comparisons and increased usefulness. In  some cases, activities may need to be allocated differently among  programs. Likewise, an evaluation could test program identification by  determining if the inventory includes sufficient breadth (in terms of an  agency\u2019s total funding) and depth (at a level that is useful for decision  makers). We reviewed one narrow way agencies could identify  programs\u2014using budget documentation\u2014and found challenges to the  consistency and completeness of program information (see appendix  III).

The taxonomy  structure serves as the backbone and allows for the presentation of  concepts, terms, and relationships dynamically. Specifically, individual  facets can be used to identify potential relationships between programs  and to organize information in new ways within the inventory. For  example, in our hypothetical inventory the facets containing budget  information for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Child and Adult Care Food  Program can be linked to both the School Lunch and the School  Breakfast programs through a common account. The ability to view these  related programs gives the user more tools and information to understand  how programs fit within the whole of government and relative to one  another. In addition, tagging program information (e.g., attributes or  characteristics) within facets in a taxonomy can help create new  relationships and allow for the grouping and linking of content in new  ways. For example, HHS\u2019s Child Care and Development Fund provides  child care services to children ages 5 and under through grants that also  support low-income families and children with disabilities. This program  could be tagged to highlight these and other attributes of the program  collected in facets related to activities and services and to eligible  beneficiaries. Then, a user interested in similar programs could click on a  tag (e.g., early learning services) that could generate a list of programs  that also have that tag.

Using a variety of methods to test the inventory with the intended  audience can validate design and content decisions, including any  assumptions made about how users interact with data. One method is  to conduct usability testing by asking users to complete a series of clearly  defined tasks and monitoring how they navigate the inventory. For  example, users could be asked to find a term that is grouped with other  terms or to find everything they can about a particular topic. Analysis of  resulting data from browsing or searching the user interface\u2014such as the  number of clicks or completion times of tasks\u2014can reveal how the  presentation and grouping of terms affects the completion of user tasks.", "A complementary method is to interview or conduct focus groups to  obtain qualitative feedback on the usability and usefulness of the  inventory. To illustrate this validation methodology, we asked  congressional staff to offer their perspectives on how they might use an  interactive website containing a federal program inventory with search,  filtering, and other navigation capabilities. Overall, congressional staff  affirmed that a searchable and sortable design with the ability to provide  different levels of aggregation and disaggregation of program information  would be useful for a number of tasks, including the following:  informing staff quickly about programs as part of background research  for various tasks; developing briefing materials for members using program information,  informing congressional decisions about authorizing or reauthorizing  federal programs and provisions in the tax code; answering constituent questions;  identifying information related to program performance; and drawing attention to information gaps, such as if program goals or  targets were not developed.", "The congressional staff we interviewed also stated that having links to  program evaluations, especially GAO, inspector general, and  Congressional Research Service reports, would be helpful for learning  about program performance, as would information tags identifying direct  and indirect program activities and services.", "Further, we shared with congressional staff a series of illustrative  examples of summary sheets containing information on a number of  potential program facets, including budget, performance, and operations  information. (Figure 5 presented in the previous section above is one of  these examples.) These staff said the types of information and  organization matched what they would expect in an inventory and would  want to inform their work, although they stated the inventory could be  more useful if historical information were more robust than what we  included. For example, they expressed a preference for at least 5 years of  budget information rather than the 3 years our hypothetical inventory  provided. Some staff also emphasized the importance of having strictly  defined fields, such as the program history field, in order to avoid  confusion and reduce subjectivity in program information. Such feedback  can provide valuable insights into the design and content users find most  important, the limitations they identify, and their satisfaction with the  overall interface and program inventory.", "Incorporating the validation results into the design and content of the  inventory would enhance usefulness by ultimately enabling users to better  find the information they need.

For example, one potential  Education program has had three names since it was originally  authorized: (1) Striving Readers, then (2) Striving Readers  Comprehensive Literacy, and most recently (3) Comprehensive Literacy  Development Grants. Each version of the program has been authorized  by different statutory provisions, creating complexities in tracking program  information across time, and raising questions about whether it is the  same program, successor programs, or three individual programs.

We found  differences across agencies in the extent to which their budget  documents could generate consistent and complete lists of programs,  which could result from different organizational structures. Specifically,  the programs listed in budget documents did not always present agency  programs consistently across other agency resources, such as  performance documents or agencies\u2019 congressional appropriations.  Further, budget documentation did not always allow for the complete  identification of programs for the inventory in terms of depth (at a level  that would be sufficiently useful for decision making), although it did have  complete breadth (as it contained each agency\u2019s total funding).", "Overall, Education\u2019s closer alignment between budget, program, and  other organizational structures generally made the identification of  programs with budget documents more consistent, limiting challenges.  Education\u2019s budget, appropriation, program, and performance structures  were all similar, and information about programs was presented  consistently across information resources such as appropriation,  performance, and Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CDFA)  information. Further, Education presented programs with a set of activities  at a level that could be useful for decision making in an inventory. For  example, Education\u2019s Promise Neighborhoods program supported  awards to local partnerships to develop and implement comprehensive,  neighborhood-based plans for meeting the cradle-to-career educational,  health, and social service needs of children in high-poverty communities.  Although there were a number of separate activities within the program,  its neighborhood focus presented information that could help decision  makers evaluate the activities as a group in light of that focus.  Education\u2019s hierarchical structure generally allowed for a clear  identification of relationships between agency offices, program areas, and  individual programs. Also, other Education documentation presented a  specific program list by administrative office and provided a cross-walk  between those programs and agency goals, which made it easier to  understand how specific programs contribute to the achievement of those  goals.", "By contrast, USAID budget documents presented greater challenges in  identifying possible programs, as its documents were less aligned with a  specific program structure and offered less consistent and precise  identification. USAID did not have a specific, complete set of programs in  budget documents. Rather, USAID identified specific funding accounts,  and included some highlights\u2014but not systematic information\u2014about  more specific efforts.

For  example, its Peace and Security objective included six program areas: (1)  Counter-Terrorism; (2) Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction; (3)  Stabilization Operations and Security Sector Reform; (4) Counter  Narcotics; (5) Transnational Crime; and (6) Conflict Mitigation and  Reconciliation. USAID provided information about its work in these areas,  but had no specific list of its programs. USAID officials noted that the  program areas listed in the justification broadly relate with the program  areas set forth in the Department of State\u2019s Standardized Program  Structure and Definitions. USAID creates its budget justification jointly  with the Department of State.", "USAID had different structures across its congressional budget  justification, performance structures, and program activities, though its  budget justification presented a high-level funding crosswalk between its  budget and performance structures. Further, USAID presented its efforts  at an individual award level online, including at foreignassistance.gov, but  that may be at too narrow a level to be useful for decision making when  included in an inventory. The range of structures and ways to present  information on the activities of USAID provides transparency and  accountability on how agency funds are being used. However, it is our  observation that this flexibility and range of methods for presenting  information made it challenging to identify through budget documents  specific programs that could be included in an inventory, if that inventory  were intended to link specific programs and appropriation amounts.  USAID officials noted that the agency had specific definitions of program  area, program, and activity in documents other than the agency\u2019s  congressional budget justification.", "Like USAID, DHS did not present a comprehensive program list in its  budget documents: DHS had disparate budget, program, and other  agency structures, in its case borne out of the parts of different agencies  that combined to create DHS, according to agency officials. However,  DHS recently aligned its discretionary programs with a standardized  budget structure, and now has greater similarities across its budget justifications and appropriations structure. Specifically, DHS established  four standard budget categories to be used by all of its mission  components: (1) Research and Development; (2) Procurement,  Construction, and Improvements, (3) Operations and Support, and (4)  Federal Assistance. DHS defined each budget category and created  guidance on what activities would typically be included. DHS then created  six sub-categories\u2014at the level of the budget\u2019s program, project, and  activity account\u2014for more specific funding areas where applicable. DHS  also approved other individual categories that better reflect the  components\u2019 distinct missions. For instance, in the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, DHS used the standard sub-category of Mission  Support along with the individual subcategory of Preparedness and  Protection. Moreover, DHS added more specific information to the budget  program activity for its 2018 budget justification below the program,  project, and activity account level.

Not all agency programs would be included in the CFDA since  the purpose of the catalog is to assist potential applicants to identify and  obtain general information about domestic assistance programs.

These complex and uncertain  relationships could affect some of the matched program numbers in table  5 (above) because multiple budget program activities or multiple CFDA  programs could be matched."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Brian James (Assistant Director), Molly  Laster (Analyst in Charge), Andrew Nelson, and Michelle Serfass made  key contributions to this report.
