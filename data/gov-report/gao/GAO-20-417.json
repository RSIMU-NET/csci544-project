GAO also found that program and contracting officials from six of the eight contracts GAO reviewed did not identify specific oversight activities they conducted to mitigate the risk of contractors performing functions in a way that could become inherently governmental. DHS lacks guidance on what these oversight tasks could entail. Without guidance for documenting and updating the planned federal oversight personnel needed, and identifying oversight tasks, DHS cannot mitigate the risks associated with service contracts in need of heightened management attention.", "Selected DHS components have information on service requirements, but budget documentation\u2014submitted to DHS headquarters as well as to Congress\u2014does not communicate details about most estimated or actual service contract requirements costs. Given that services account for over three-quarters of DHS's annual funding for contracts, additional insights would shed light into how much of DHS's mission is being accomplished through services, including those requiring heightened management attention.

To determine the proportion of service obligations in need of  heightened management attention, we identified obligations coded as  being functions that were closely associated with inherently  governmental, critical, or both in FPDS-NG, or coded with a product and  service code identified as a special interest function. We assessed the  reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing existing information about the  FPDS-NG system and data\u2014specifically the data dictionary and data  validation rules\u2014and performing electronic testing.

We selected U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Office of  Procurement Operations (OPO). For the purposes of this report, we will  refer to these contracting activities, which include three components and  one office, as components. From these components, we selected a non- generalizable sample of 100 fiscal year 2018 contracts that were above  the simplified acquisition threshold and were not exempt from performing  a Balanced Workforce Assessment Tool (BWAT). The BWAT was a risk  analysis tool used by DHS components at that time to identify the  appropriate mix of federal and contractor employees until DHS  decommissioned its use in March 2019. A proposed service requirement  was exempt from the BWAT analysis if the expected total cost was below  the simplified acquisition threshold\u2014currently $250,000\u2014or if the product  or service code was one that DHS previously determined was not likely to  include critical or closely associated with inherently governmental  functions.

To determine what processes selected components  have for identifying and developing service requirements, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed program and contracting officials  associated with our four selected components and eight selected  contracts. To determine how DHS is reviewing service contract  requirements, we reviewed guidance and documents from DHS\u2019s Office  of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) and Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management, and federal internal control  standards on risk assessment.

For example, the FAR requires that agencies  conduct market research, as appropriate, and defines market research as  the process used to collect and analyze information about capabilities in  the market that could satisfy an agency\u2019s needs. While the extent of  market research will vary depending on characteristics of the  requirement, the FAR provides general policies and procedures for  conducting market research with the goal of arriving at the most suitable  approach to acquiring, distributing, and supporting supplies and  services. The FAR also requires agencies to perform acquisition  planning activities for all acquisitions to ensure that the government  meets its needs in the most effective, economical, and timely manner  possible.", "In addition to the FAR, DHS relies on the Homeland Security Acquisition  Regulation and Homeland Security Acquisition Manual\u2014issued by DHS\u2019s  Chief Procurement Officer to implement and supplement the FAR\u2014to  establish policies and procedures for all acquisition activities within the  department. For example, together the Homeland Security Acquisition  Regulation and Homeland Security Acquisition Manual provide more  specific department-wide policies and procedures for implementing  acquisition requirements laid out by the FAR, such as competition,  acquisition planning, and market research. Contracting activities may also  implement their own procedures that support and implement the FAR,  Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation, and Homeland Security  Acquisition Manual.", "DHS also has its own policies and guidance for managing its service  acquisition programs. For example, DHS generally defines major  acquisition programs as those with life-cycle cost estimates of $300  million or more. However, DHS\u2019s Acquisition Management Instruction  102-01-001 identifies additional thresholds for approval of stand-alone  service acquisition programs\u2014service contracts that are not part of a  larger acquisition program. Specifically, service acquisition programs  with annual cost estimates of $1 billion or more, or between $100 million  and $1 billion are identified as Major Level 1 or 2 acquisition programs,  respectively, and generally require approval from DHS\u2019s Chief Acquisition  Officer. Service acquisition programs with annual cost estimates under  $100 million can be approved at the component level in accordance with  component policies and processes. As of November 2019, DHS did not  have any service programs identified as Major Level 1 or 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Service Functions Requiring Heightened Management Attention", "paragraphs": ["In response to the 2009 Presidential Memorandum on Government  Contracting, OFPP, within OMB, issued a policy letter in September 2011  to all executive agencies\u2014including DHS\u2014to clarify, in part, when  governmental outsourcing of services is and is not appropriate.  Specifically, the letter defines inherently governmental functions,  according to the definition in the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act,  as those that are so intimately related to the public interest as to require  performance by federal employees, such as determining agency policy or  budget requests. Additionally, it identifies categories of service functions  that agencies are allowed to contract for, but that require heightened  management attention, as they pose a risk to the government losing  control of either its responsibility to perform inherently governmental  functions or its mission and operations. Figure 1 illustrates the increasing  risk related to contracting for these types of functions.", "The letter also provides guidance on managing the performance of  closely associated with inherently governmental and critical service  functions, among others. In 2010, OFPP had also identified categories of  services requiring heightened management attention. The three  categories of service functions requiring special or heightened  management attention follow:  1.  Closely associated with inherently governmental functions. The  2011 OFPP policy letter adopts a single definition of an inherently  governmental function, clarifies the types of services that constitute  those closely associated with inherently governmental functions, and  highlights the steps that agencies must take to ensure that the  contractor does not ultimately perform functions that are reserved  exclusively for federal employees. The response to public comments  in the 2011 OFPP policy letter\u2014in accordance with the FAR\u2014 provides the example that aspects of acquisition planning, such as  determining requirements and approving a contract strategy, are  inherently governmental functions. However, contractors may be used  to support acquisition planning efforts through functions such as  performing market research or drafting statements of work. These  supporting functions are deemed closely associated with inherently  governmental functions and can be contracted for. However, the  OFPP policy letter states that agencies are required to take certain  steps\u2014such as assigning a sufficient number of qualified government  employees to perform contract management\u2014to ensure, among other  things, that the contractor does not perform, interfere with, or  undermine the integrity of the agency\u2019s decision-making  responsibilities.  2.  Critical functions. The 2011 OFPP policy letter describes critical  functions that, when contracted for, pose a risk that the agency could  lose control of its mission and operations. Among other things, the  policy established the criteria for identifying critical functions that are  internally unique to each agency based upon their mission and  operations. As an example, the 2011 OFPP policy letter notes that  analyzing areas of tax law that impose significant compliance burdens  on taxpayers may constitute a critical function for the Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s Office of the Taxpayer Advocate. OFPP notes that  when contracting for a critical function, agencies must retain sufficient  internal capability either through: dedicating an adequate number of  federal personnel to perform the function in-house or alongside the  contractors in the event the contractor fails to perform; or ensuring  federal personnel are available to oversee and manage the contractor  workforce.  3.  Special interest functions. Special interest functions, according to  OFPP, are functions that required increased management attention  due to heightened risk of workforce imbalance. Some special interest  functions may also be either closely associated with inherently  governmental or critical functions. According to OFPP, contracting for  these functions also poses a risk that the agency can lose control of  its mission and operations. In a November 2010 memo, OMB  instructed agencies to identify and analyze a list of product and  service codes to be deemed special interest functions. DHS, with  OMB approval, has chosen 17 product and service codes to  categorize as special interest functions, including policy review and  development and acquisition support services. To mitigate the risk  associated with contracting for special interest functions, agencies are  required to analyze their contracts for special interest functions  annually to ensure the mix of federal employees to contractors is  appropriately balanced.", "For examples of functions deemed closely associated with inherently  governmental, critical, and special interest, see appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of DHS\u2019s Identification of Inherently Governmental, Closely Associated with Inherently Governmental, Critical, and Special Interest Functions", "paragraphs": ["Since March 2019, DHS has required program officials to complete its  Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis job aid for all  proposed service contract requirements above the simplified acquisition  threshold\u2014currently $250,000\u2014with a product and service code that is  not included on DHS\u2019s exemption list.

This section includes a checklist for functions that the FAR  has identified as being inherently governmental, such as developing  federal agency policy and determining price reasonableness of vendor  bids.

This section requires program officials to consider whether  the proposed requirement is necessary for the agency to effectively  perform and maintain control of its mission, which would designate the  requirement as critical. Agencies are allowed to contract for critical  functions so long as the program official certifies that the agency has  sufficient internal capacity to undertake the work if, for any reason, the  contractor is unable to provide the service. Special interest functions  are not required to be identified in the job aid.", "The job aid concludes with the program official\u2019s signature and is  eventually forwarded to the contracting officer as part of the overall  procurement package prior to soliciting for the proposed requirement.", "The job aid was put in place following the March 2019 decommissioning  of DHS\u2019s prior tool\u2014the BWAT. The BWAT was used to implement  DHS\u2019s Balanced Workforce Strategy, which focuses on achieving the  appropriate mix of federal and contractor personnel. This strategy was  established in October 2009 to meet the statutory requirements in the  2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act  directed most federal agencies\u2014including DHS\u2014to devise and  implement guidelines and procedures to ensure that, on a regular basis,  consideration is given to using federal employees to perform new  functions, and functions that are performed by contractors but can be  performed by federal employees.", "The Balanced Workforce Strategy established processes to enable DHS  to achieve the appropriate mix of federal employees and contractors to  accomplish the department\u2019s mission, while minimizing risk to DHS\u2019s  missions from an overreliance on contractors. DHS implemented this  strategy through the BWAT\u2014an online questionnaire completed by  individual program offices for certain service contracts. The function of  the BWAT was to ensure the proposed service functions are not  inherently governmental, and to identify whether the functions are closely  associated with inherently governmental, critical, or special interest,  among others. In addition, the BWAT recommended the ratio of federal  employees to contractors needed to oversee those services. This  analysis was then approved by the program and reviewed by the  contracting officer as part of the procurement package.", "According to officials from an internal DHS working group, the Balanced  Workforce Strategy\u2014and BWAT by extension\u2014were deemed no longer  necessary based on the maturation of the department\u2019s program and  contracting officials\u2019 ability to identify inherently governmental, closely  associated with inherently governmental, critical, and special interest  functions without a detailed questionnaire.

Figure 8  summarizes key processes we identified that DHS uses to identify and  develop service requirements.", "In addition to the policies and guidance DHS has for identifying and  developing service requirements, DHS components in our review have  implemented additional guidance and tools. For example, USCIS has  developed specific guidance to support the program office\u2019s development  of requirements, including information on how to define requirements,  conduct market research, and develop a cost estimate and acquisition  strategy. Further, all of the components in our review reported using tools,  such as templates and checklists, to help guide program and contracting  officials through the requirements development process. For example, all  of the components in our review use templates for market research,  acquisition plans, and requirements documents that identify what  information officials should include in these documents. The components  in our review also provided program and contracting officials with  checklists for what documents are required in the procurement package,  depending on the type of contract being solicited. Some of the  components in our review maintain this information on acquisition  websites that serve as repositories for DHS and component guidance,  templates, and other requirements. For example, ICE\u2019s Office of  Acquisition Management\u2019s portal provides guidance, documents, and  templates by phase of the acquisition process, from acquisition planning  and solicitation preparation through contract administration and close-out.", "DHS components in our review also relied on subject matter experts to  assist in their requirements development efforts, with the level of  involvement varying depending on the requirement. Specifically, officials  associated with two of the eight contracts in our review stated they used  integrated product teams to assist with developing their service  requirements. For example, officials involved in requirements  development for services at USCIS\u2019s 135 Application Support Center  locations told us they established an integrated product team with  program officials, the contracting officer, cost estimators, Field Office  Directorate personnel, and Office of Security and Integrity personnel.  Officials from the other six contracts relied on more informal subject  matter expert involvement. Component officials from three of our  contracts that relied on more informal coordination methods said that  when the requirement is recurring and has previously been contracted for,  formal coordination through an integrated product team may not be  necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Fully Developed an Approach to Ensure Certain Service Procurements Are Clearly Defined and Consistently Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["DHS has established a process for reviewing the procurement strategy  for certain service and product procurement actions prior to award, but  has not developed an approach to ensure proposed service contract  requirements are clearly defined or that it is consistently reviewing what  DHS considers to be high-risk service procurement actions. In 2018,  OCPO and the Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management  began piloting a DHS-wide Service Requirements Review to validate,  optimize, prioritize, and approve service requirements early in the  development process. However, DHS discontinued these efforts before  the pilot was finalized. According to DHS officials, they initiated this pilot  because there had been no consistency or rigor for reviewing service  contract requirements even though these contracts account for over 70  percent of DHS\u2019s contract obligations.", "According to DHS documents and officials, the main objectives of the pilot  were to: ensure service requirements are clearly defined and reviewed before  planning how the services are obtained; assess whether the services should be provided in whole or in part by  foster collaboration and opportunities to leverage efficiencies for  similar service requirements to avoid duplication in services across  the department; and assess whether the requirement should be managed as a service  acquisition program.", "To accomplish these objectives, DHS identified stakeholders from within  DHS\u2019s Management Directorate to be headquarters-level reviewers for  service requirements based on the type of service being contracted for.  However, according to OCPO and Office of Program Accountability and  Risk Management officials, the pilot was discontinued in April 2019 before  any service requirements were reviewed because it was determined to be  too resource intensive.", "According to DHS officials, the discontinuation of the Service  Requirements Review pilot coincided with the implementation of the  Procurement Strategy Roadmap, a separate OCPO-led initiative to review  and approve the procurement strategy for all service and product  acquisitions with a total estimated value over $50 million. The  Procurement Strategy Roadmap requires contracting activities, along with  their procurement teams, to present and discuss the procurement  strategy with the DHS Chief Procurement Officer, members of OCPO,  and other stakeholders as needed, prior to drafting an acquisition plan or  other decision documents. According to OCPO officials, it was intended to  require procurement staff to meet with OCPO officials early in the  acquisition planning process, prior to the service contract requirement  being finalized, to discuss how services and products would be  purchased. Specifically, the Procurement Strategy Roadmap is intended  to address what OCPO considered as key elements of the procurement  process, such as the requirement, competition, the availability of strategic  sourcing or small business options, and contract type.", "Following the discontinuation of the Service Requirements Review pilot in  April 2019, OCPO and Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management officials discussed expanding the Procurement Strategy  Roadmap to incorporate some elements of the Service Requirements  Review pilot, including reviewing proposed requirements to determine if  they are clearly defined and valid, when appropriate. For example, OCPO  officials said they have included the Office of Program Accountability and  Risk Management and the Office of the Chief Information Officer to  facilitate additional DHS stakeholder involvement in some reviews, and to  broaden the discussion beyond how services and products will be  purchased and include what the requirement is and whether it needs to  be purchased at all.", "However, as of February 2020, OCPO officials told us that reviewing  requirements to ensure they are clearly defined and collaborating with  additional DHS stakeholders to identify opportunities to leverage existing  service requirements was not the intent of the Procurement Strategy  Roadmap. For example, OCPO officials stated that proposed  requirements may only be reviewed by additional DHS stakeholders during the Procurement Strategy Roadmap if the requirement is new,  \u201cunique,\u201d or \u201chigh risk,\u201d and that this decision is based on their review of  the information in the Procurement Strategy Roadmap and professional  judgment. When asked what constitutes a unique or high risk  requirement, officials told us a proposed requirement could be high risk if  it had historical procurement issues, but noted that ultimately the decision  to review the requirement and whether to involve additional DHS  stakeholders in that review is subjective and based on whether OCPO  leadership believes other stakeholders may add value in developing and  reviewing the proposed requirement. According to OCPO officials, some  Procurement Strategy Roadmap requirements supporting major  acquisition programs undergo separate review by DHS headquarters  stakeholders in the Acquisition Review Board. However, high-dollar  service acquisitions that are not associated with a major acquisition  program or not above $100 million do not currently receive headquarters- level scrutiny to determine whether requirements are clearly defined or to  leverage efficiencies and buying power for similar service requirements  across the department.", "In addition, OCPO has not established a process to ensure it is  consistently reviewing proposed procurement actions through the  Procurement Strategy Roadmap. Our review of the fiscal year 2019  Procurement Strategy Roadmap eligible procurement actions found that  OCPO subjectively waived the review for 18 of the 49 eligible actions\u2014 over 36 percent of the actions that should have been subject to a  Procurement Strategy Roadmap. The waived procurement actions  included three out of six Federal Emergency Management Agency  actions, eight out of 16 OPO actions, four out of 12 CBP actions, and two  out of six Transportation Security Administration actions. According to  OCPO officials, the decision to waive a procurement action is a subjective  one, made by OCPO leadership based on the initial information provided.  For example, officials said the review may be waived if the procurement  action is recurring or will be fulfilled using an already established DHS  contract vehicle.", "We found, however, that the subjective decision to waive the reviews  does not take into account other acquisition risks. For example, our  review of the description of waived procurement actions found that 11 of  the 18 actions were for services, including some for administrative and  professional support and information technology services that DHS  considers to be in need of heightened management attention. Two of the  waived actions were for requirements that resulted in orders placed off  General Services Administration Schedule contracts, despite an OCPO  official telling us that these orders are expected to receive increased  scrutiny to ensure that any existing DHS contract vehicles have been fully  considered.", "Our review of waived procurement actions also found that OCPO waived  several Federal Emergency Management Agency actions for disaster  response activities and CBP actions for services at temporary soft-sided  facilities used for holding detainees on the U.S.-Mexico border. Our prior  work has noted challenges in requirements development and acquisition  planning for these types of contracts. For example, in April 2019, we  reported that contracting officers at FEMA were receiving requirements  packages for disaster contracts that lacked technical specificity or had  inaccurate estimates of the products and services needed. In March  2020, we also reported on acquisition planning, requirements  development, and information sharing challenges with one of the waived  procurement actions\u2014a CBP delivery order for a soft-sided facility and  services to hold and care for detainees\u2014finding that these challenges led  to CBP spending millions of dollars on services that were not ultimately  needed.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should identify  and respond to risk to achieve its objectives. OCPO officials  acknowledged that the intent of the Procurement Strategy Roadmap was  not to replace the Service Requirements Review that preceded it, and  that expanding the scope of the Procurement Strategy Roadmap to  review requirements would require additional resources. However, the  department\u2019s previous efforts to devote management attention to its  growing proportion of service procurements are indicative of its concerns  about its use of service contracts. While the Procurement Strategy  Roadmap is not specific to services, it can provide a mechanism to  address these concerns. Moreover, without documenting factors OCPO  considers when waiving certain Procurement Strategy Roadmap eligible  procurement actions, DHS is at risk of not consistently reviewing service  procurement actions that could benefit from headquarters-level review.  Given DHS\u2019s reliance on service contracts, which accounted for 78  percent of DHS\u2019s contract obligations in fiscal year 2018, developing a  risk-based approach for reviewing proposed service requirements through  the Procurement Strategy Roadmap or other means could help to  improve DHS\u2019s use of service contracts by identifying opportunities to  leverage efficiencies and ensuring service requirements are clearly  defined across the department."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS and the Components in Our Review Inconsistently Planned for and Conducted Oversight of Selected Service Contracts in Need of Heightened Management Attention", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Does Not Have a Formal Process for Planning and Updating Personnel Resources Needed for Service Contracts Requiring Heightened Management Attention", "paragraphs": ["DHS does not have a formal process for identifying all service  requirements in need of heightened management attention or for  planning, documenting, and updating the amount of federal personnel  necessary to perform or oversee these requirements.

Specifically, OFPP notes that prior to contract  award, for services that require heightened management attention  agencies should complete an analysis that among other things and  depending on the service, establishes that they can:  retain sufficient capacity and capability to give heightened  management attention to contractor performance or retain control of  its operations;  limit or guide the contractor\u2019s exercise of discretion; ensure reasonable identification of contractors and contractor work avoid or mitigate conflicts of interest.", "Functions Requiring Heightened  Management Attention  The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy  (OFPP) guidance identifies three categories of  service contracts requiring heightened  management attention\u2014those closely  associated with inherently governmental  functions, critical functions, and special  interest functions. Depending on the function,  these categories of service contracts may  involve contractor work products that support  policy development and program evaluation,  and other tasks that are essential to the  agencies\u2019 ability to perform its mission.  According to OMB, these contracts require  management attention to ensure that they do  not result in the performance of inherently  governmental functions by the contractor and  that agencies retain control of their mission  and operations.", "DHS officials stated that, as of March 2019, they use the Inherently  Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis, or job aid, to screen  proposed service requirements to ensure that there are no inherently  governmental functions and to identify functions that may be contracted  for that are closely associated with inherently governmental or critical. If a  function is identified as closely associated with inherently governmental or  critical, program officials must certify that there is sufficient internal  capacity to oversee contractor activities and maintain control of its  missions and operations. Further, if a function is closely associated with  inherently governmental, the job aid includes a narrative section where  the program office should document mitigation strategies to ensure  heightened management attention and enhanced oversight occur  throughout the life of the contract. We found that the job aid does not  provide a place to identify special interest functions that require  heightened management attention.", "In addition, the job aid does not require program officials to analyze or  document the expected federal personnel necessary to perform or  oversee service requirements in need of heightened management  attention following contract award; therefore information available for  planning purposes is limited. We analyzed all nine of the 27 completed  job aids that included closely associated with inherently governmental  functions, and found that none included any calculation of federal  oversight personnel necessary or mentioned the federal personnel who  will be expected to perform oversight activities. The narrative section of  the job aid instructs components to document mitigation strategies for  functions identified as closely associated with inherently governmental  functions. We found that two of the nine job aids identified mitigation  strategies, such as noting that federal employees will ensure the  contractor\u2019s presence is announced at all meetings. However, neither  provided any detail about who\u2014such as the program manager or  contracting officer representative\u2014would be responsible for performing  and overseeing the contractor employees performing the contracted  functions or tasks.", "Program and contracting officials from ICE, CBP, and USCIS stated that  analyzing and documenting the expected federal oversight personnel  necessary prior to contract award with the BWAT provided visibility\u2014both  within the program and across the component\u2014into resource needs.  However, only ICE continues to analyze and document federal oversight  necessary outside of the job aid. Following the BWAT\u2019s decommissioning,  ICE established a Service Contract Review Template for all service  contracts above $1 million. ICE program officials are expected to  complete this template with information such as a description of the  requirement, the anticipated product and service code, identification of  special interest functions, expected number of contractors needed, the  number of federal employees available to oversee the work, and a  justification for outsourcing the requirement. From this information, the  template produces a recommended percentage of federal personnel  necessary to perform management oversight. ICE created this new  process because it wanted to ensure that it has a repeatable,  documented decision-making process that helps plan oversight, such as  the proper balance of federal and contractor employees and determining  the reasonableness of the contract.", "DHS\u2019s job aid also does not provide a process to update oversight needs  if the contracted tasks or functions change throughout the life of the  service contract. Officials from three of the four components in our review  reported not having a formal process for updating federal oversight needs  when elements of the contract change\u2014such as an increase in the  number of contractor personnel performing tasks or a change in scope.  For example, component program and contracting officials told us that,  although one of the service contracts in our review experienced an  increase in the number of contractor personnel, they did not update  planning for federal oversight personnel needs. In contrast, officials from  ICE reported having a process to reevaluate federal oversight needed  that is triggered by specific contract funding actions. Funding actions that  trigger the process include: establishing a new contract, exercising an  option on an existing contract, or adding funding to a service contract.  ICE officials explained that through this process they review the service  contract for changes to the number of contractors and whether the current  oversight levels are sufficient. If they find that current oversight levels are  no longer sufficient, ICE officials stated that they would require the  program office to develop a risk mitigation strategy, such as assigning  additional oversight personnel or increasing the contractor\u2019s reporting  requirements.", "DHS headquarters officials told us they no longer have a formal process  for analyzing and documenting federal oversight requirements because  the department has matured since implementing the BWAT, and program  and contracting staff are aware of how to plan for federal oversight  requirements for service contracts in need of heightened management  attention. Specifically, during our review, DHS and component officials  from OPO and USCIS stated that they rely on their program and  contracting officials\u2019 historical knowledge and professional judgment to  determine and communicate oversight needs informally at the component  level. However, we found a lack of understanding and inconsistencies in  how oversight was analyzed and documented prior to the BWAT\u2019s  decommissioning. Specifically, 25 of the 75 required BWATs for special  interest functions we reviewed either could not be provided or did not  contain the information used to calculate and, therefore, plan for sufficient  federal employees to conduct oversight.", "In addition, according to DHS documents and officials, the department  plans for federal oversight personnel needs more broadly through its  annual workforce planning efforts; and therefore, it is not necessary to  analyze federal oversight personnel needs at the contract level. Yet we  found that DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2018 annual workforce plan focused on DHS  and government-wide mission critical occupations, like Border Patrol  Agents and Transportation Security Administration Officers. The plan  does not address oversight needs based on services in need of  heightened management attention (i.e., contracted functions that are  closely associated with inherently governmental, critical, or special  interest). While DHS\u2019s workforce plan accounts for government-wide  mission critical occupations, such as contracting officers and specialists,  there is not the same level of consideration given to program managers,  employees who serve as contracting officer\u2019s representatives, or other  program staff that are responsible for performing oversight at the contract  level.", "According to OCPO officials, program officials completing the job aid  should document in the narrative section the federal personnel  responsible for ensuring the task does not become inherently  governmental. However, we found that the job aid instructions do not  address how program officials should analyze or document the federal  personnel who will be tasked with conducting oversight. The job aid also  does not include similar instructions, or provide space, to depict this  information for functions identified as critical. Moreover, although there is  guidance on when an initial job aid needs to be completed, there is no  guidance indicating when, and under what circumstances, program and  contracting officials may need to update federal oversight needs based on  changes to the functions or task being performed by the contractor.

However, without consistently identifying all service requirements in need  of heightened management attention and establishing a repeatable  process across the department for analyzing, documenting, and updating  the federal personnel needed to perform or oversee the requirement  when changes occur, program and contracting officials lack reasonable  assurance that they are dedicating an adequate number of federal  employees to oversee these functions.

The 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act states that  agencies should have specific safeguards and monitoring systems in  place to ensure the work that contractors are performing has not changed  or expanded during performance to become an inherently governmental  function. Additionally in 2010, OMB issued a memo that states agencies  shall conduct meaningful analysis\u2014through the annual service  inventory\u2014focused on special interest functions that require heightened  management attention to ensure proper workforce balance.", "Based on our review of contract documentation and interviews with  program and contracting officials associated with the eight contracts in  our review, oversight of these service contracts in need of heightened  management attention focused largely on assessing the quality of specific  contractor tasks. Oversight of these contracts did not include a focus on  ensuring the work of the contractors is not performed in a way so as to  become inherently governmental, or that DHS retains sufficient internal  capability to perform its missions. While assessing quality is important in  monitoring contractor performance, it does not allow DHS to identify when  tasks beyond what is detailed in the contract\u2014including tasks that are  potentially inherently governmental and require that final agency action  reflects the independent conclusions of agency officials\u2014are being  performed. According to DHS\u2019s most recent service contract inventory  analysis and OCPO officials, DHS relies on well-trained contracting  officer\u2019s representatives to monitor contractor performance for inherently  governmental functions. Yet one of the eight contracts in our review has  not had a certified contracting officer\u2019s representative assigned to the  contract since its award in September 2018. For the remaining seven  contracts, we found that their contracting officer\u2019s representative  appointment letters\u2014which document oversight responsibilities\u2014 mentioned performing surveillance and inspections against the contract\u2019s  performance requirements. But only two of the seven letters\u2014both from  CBP\u2014reference performing oversight tasks focused on how the  contractor is completing the work. Specifically, both appointment letters  stated that ongoing reviews should be completed focusing on the way  work is performed and how the government is managing service  acquisitions for closely associated with inherently governmental and  critical functions. However, none of the letters we reviewed identified  specific safeguards\u2014such as vetting all contractor recommendations  through a panel of federal employees\u2014that federal personnel should  perform to mitigate identified concerns with contractors performing closely  associated with inherently governmental or losing sufficient internal  capability for performing critical functions.", "Similarly, program and contracting officials associated with six of the eight  service contracts in our review did not identify additional oversight tasks  undertaken as a result of the contract requiring heightened management  attention. Rather, these officials said they assess the contractor\u2019s  performance in terms of the quality of deliverables when asked about the  types of oversight tasks performed. For example, DHS headquarters  officials responsible for overseeing a service contract for technical  support related to the development of nuclear detection technologies  stated that their oversight largely focuses on tracking the completion of  tasks included in the statement of work as well as available funding.  These officials did not identify any additional actions taken to address the  risk of contractors working in situations that permit or might permit access  to confidential business or other sensitive information\u2014a function closely  associated with inherently governmental functions in need of heightened  management attention. Additionally, acquisition officials from one of the  DHS components in our review stated that they have previously relied on  the contractor to report if they were performing work that was not  specified in the contract. While performance monitoring is crucial to  ensure that the contractor is meeting the terms of the contract, it alone  does not provide DHS visibility into whether work is being performed that  is outside the scope of the contract or inappropriate for contractors.", "Program and contracting officials associated with two of the eight service  contracts in our review identified safeguards they have established to  prevent contractors from performing inherently governmental work. For  example, program and contracting officials associated with a USCIS  contract awarded to assist in the preparation of Freedom of Information  Act requests stated that they have safeguards in place to ensure the  contractor does not approve agency responses to Freedom of Information  Act requests\u2014an inherently governmental function, according to the 2011  OFPP policy letter. Specifically, officials associated with this contract  explained that they use a software program that does not allow a user  without federal employee credentials to approve a request within the  system. This is an example of a safeguard that can be instituted for  similar service contracts when the risk of the contractor performing the  inherently governmental function of approving requests is present.  Additionally, officials associated with CBP\u2019s service contract for  maintaining its unmanned aircraft systems stated that they ensure that  their onsite personnel do not direct contractors to perform unauthorized  tasks by requiring these personnel to report directly to the program office.", "Contracting and program officials\u2019 lack of focus on safeguards to mitigate  risks associated with contract functions in need of heightened  management attention is due, in part, to DHS not identifying\u2014either in  guidance or training that we reviewed\u2014a list of oversight tasks that  program and contracting officials can perform. DHS\u2019s OCPO officials  explained that there are unique aspects of each contract that should drive  oversight needs so they have not established any required safeguards  component program and contracting officials must employ. Despite the  uniqueness of each contract, officials from OPO stated that it would be  helpful to have a list of identified potential oversight tasks or safeguards  for service contracts in need of heightened management attention to  ensure they are managing the risk of the contractor performing work  outside of scope. We found that at least one federal agency has such a  list available. Specifically, the Department of State\u2019s Contracting Officer\u2019s  Representative Handbook provides a list of mitigation strategies  contracting officer\u2019s representative can employ for contracts requiring risk  mitigation\u2014such as reserving final approval authority of any contractor  proposed action for federal employees only. Additional strategies listed  include requiring contractor affiliation be clearly displayed on all  presentation material, and conducting conflict of interest reviews when  contractors are performing services that involve or relate to evaluating  another contractor\u2019s performance. Without identifying what oversight  tasks or safeguards component personnel can institute to prevent  contractors from performing inherently governmental functions or from  affecting the ability of the agency to maintain control of its mission and  operations, DHS is at risk of its personnel not knowing which steps they  should take to prevent that from occurring."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Components Consider Service Contract Requirements When Budgeting but DHS Budget Documents Do Not Provide Visibility into Details", "paragraphs": ["DHS components in our review consider service contract requirements  when identifying their resource needs and formulating their budget  justifications, but DHS headquarters and Congress have limited visibility  into requested and actual service contract requirement costs. DHS uses  the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process to allocate  resources\u2014including those for service contracts\u2014across the department.  DHS\u2019s guidance for this process that we reviewed does not provide  specific instructions for how the components should consider service  contract requirements when budgeting, but program officials we spoke  with said that they generally provide information on specific service  contract costs, among other resource needs, to their budget offices during  the programming phase. Components then include these resource needs  in their budget justifications, which are submitted to DHS headquarters for  review before being submitted to OMB and then Congress.", "Based on our review of component budget justifications, components  communicate service contract requirements in three primary ways, but  none provide complete visibility into service contract requirements.", "Object Classes: Object classes are broad spending categories  identified in OMB guidance. As shown earlier in table 1, there are  eight object classes for other contracted services. According to  component officials, once the resource needs for service contracts are  identified, they are grouped into the object classes that best represent  the requirement by either program or budget officials before  submitting budget justifications to DHS headquarters. However, object  class codes do not provide visibility into just service contract  requirements. For example, budget officials at ICE and USCIS told us  that aligning service requirements across object classes is not always  perfect or precise. According to ICE officials, object class codes may  include other expenses, such as interagency agreements. Further,  USCIS officials noted that some contract requirements can apply to  multiple object classes, so how requirements are communicated by  object class is subjective based on program officials\u2019 judgment.", "Cost Drivers: According to DHS budget officials, cost drivers  identified in budget documentation represent the requirements that  make up the largest costs at the program/project activity level. Service  requirements may be included as a cost driver, but only if the  estimated value of the contract represents a large portion of the  program/project activity\u2019s costs. For example, ICE\u2019s budget guidance  instructs the program offices to identify major requirements that add  up to at least 50 percent of the program/project activity resource  needs as non-pay cost drivers. Based on that guidance, in fiscal year  2020 budget documentation, one of ICE\u2019s service contracts included  in our review\u2014for Office of the Principal Legal Advisor document  management services\u2014is identified as a cost driver. Only one other  contract included in our review\u2014from USCIS\u2014was identified as a  cost driver.", "Capital Investment Exhibit: According to DHS budget officials, the  five contracts with the highest dollar value supporting each  component\u2019s capital investment are identified in the component\u2019s  budget documentation. Service contracts may be included in the  capital investment exhibit if they meet this criteria, but the details  included are vague. For example, for each contract listed, the exhibit  typically includes information such as the contract number and total  value, but does not categorize whether the contract is for a product or  service nor consistently provide a description of the contract itself. For  the contracts in our review, one of the eight\u2014a contract for nuclear  detection technology technical support\u2014was included in the capital  investment exhibit in fiscal year 2020 budget documentation.", "Since component budget offices submit their proposed budget requests  with service contract requirements aligned into object class codes,  program/project activities, and capital investment exhibits, DHS lacks  visibility into the components\u2019 requested service contract requirement  needs. For example, officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer  stated that they do not have visibility into DHS and the components\u2019  specific service contract requirements. Rather, officials said their visibility  is limited to changes in service contract requirements that are justified as  part of requested increases or decreases in components\u2019 funds. While  officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer stated that they can  request additional information from the components on service  requirements if needed, officials could not identify any specific  circumstances that have led to them requesting this information for their  own purposes or in response to congressional interest. See figure 9 for  details on how service contract requirements are communicated to DHS  headquarters in budget documentation.", "Moreover, although DHS obligates over three-quarters of its contract  spending to services, neither the Office of the Chief Financial Officer or  OCPO have full visibility into or track service contract requirement costs.  For example, similar to how information is portrayed in budget  documents, officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer stated  they report obligations to Congress by object class level on a quarterly  basis; therefore, visibility into service contract requirement costs is  limited. Further, OCPO officials stated that they also do not have a  system for tracking service contract obligations reported through FPDS- NG or otherwise.", "In a discussion held during the course of our review, congressional  requesters expressed interest in receiving additional information and  visibility into DHS\u2019s estimated service contract requirements. Members of  Congress have also previously expressed interest in having increased  oversight and visibility into other aspects of DHS\u2019s proposed spending as  well as into the Department of Defense\u2019s estimated service contract  requirements. For example, DHS budget officials told us that the decision  to include the top five highest dollar value contracts in its capital  investment exhibits was driven by congressional interest in this type of  information on service contracts. In addition, in 2009, Congress began  requiring the Department of Defense to identify in its budget submission  the amounts requested for its service contracts for each component,  installation, or activity, excluding services related to research and  development and military construction. For example, the Department of  Defense has two budget exhibits that provide details on estimated service  contract requirements\u2014one that details its advisory and assistance  services, and another that tracks contracted services across prior fiscal  years. In February 2016, we found shortfalls in the Department of  Defense\u2019s reporting of service contract requirements in its budget  documents. We recommended that it modify its approach for reporting  service contracts in its budget justifications to include additional service  requirements. The Department of Defense agreed with this  recommendation and, in February 2016, took steps to fully report on  these service categories in its service contract spending exhibit  accompanying the fiscal year 2017 budget request.", "We have also reported on challenges with congressional visibility into  DHS\u2019s major acquisition programs in budget documents. In April 2018, we  found that DHS budget practices limit Congress\u2019s visibility into costs and  recommended that DHS work with Congress to include information on  operations and support funding requests for major acquisitions in its  annual budget justifications. DHS agreed with this recommendation and  addressed it by adding an operations and support funding information  display for major acquisition programs to its congressional budget  justification for fiscal year 2021.", "Federal internal control standards state that agency\u2019s management  should communicate quality information internally and externally to inform  decisions. Although detailed information on service requirements is  available at the component level, DHS\u2019s budget justifications do not  provide that level of visibility. Visibility into service requirements is  especially critical given that increases in DHS\u2019s service contract  obligations\u2014particularly those in need of heightened management  attention\u2014may pose risks to DHS maintaining control over its mission.  Given these increases, additional visibility into how much of DHS\u2019s  mission is being accomplished through the use of services requiring  heightened management attention could inform DHS\u2019s decision-making  on the tasks it chooses to contract for, and the balance of its federal and  contractor workforce. Without working with Congress to determine the  format and level of detail needed to communicate service contract  requirements in budget information, DHS headquarters and Congress are  at risk of not having the information for sound resource planning and  decision-making related to DHS\u2019s use of service contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Service contracts play a critical role in supporting DHS\u2019s wide range of  missions, but increases in service contract obligations\u2014including  significant increases in obligations for services in need of heightened  management attention\u2014necessitate DHS\u2019s attention as it develops,  reviews, oversees, and budgets for service contract needs. DHS\u2019s recent  effort to perform a headquarters-level review of certain service and  product procurement actions is a positive step in improving the  department\u2019s visibility into how it is acquiring certain services and  products. However, without developing a risk-based approach for  reviewing certain proposed service contract requirements to ensure they  are clearly defined and valid before they are procured and consistently  reviewing eligible procurement actions, DHS cannot ensure it has  established the rigor needed to review its service procurements. Further,  changes in DHS\u2019s processes and a lack of agency-wide guidance for  planning, documenting, and updating federal oversight personnel and  activities for services in need of heightened management attention have  put the department at risk of not effectively addressing whether  contractors are performing inherently governmental functions. These risks  could pose challenges to DHS\u2019s ability to maintain control over its mission  and operations. Ensuring DHS has guidance for planning and updating  the resources needed to oversee these contracts, and identifying the  types of activities that federal personnel should be performing to mitigate  the risks associated with these contracts are critical to DHS\u2019s ability to  address these concerns.", "Finally, despite the availability of information on specific service contract  requirements within component program offices, DHS does not  communicate most of this information in budget documentation provided  to DHS headquarters or Congress, nor is DHS currently required to do so.  Given that DHS\u2019s service contract obligations\u2014including those in need of  heightened management attention\u2014account for more than three quarters  of DHS\u2019s total annual contract obligations, DHS is missing opportunities  to make more informed strategic decisions because it does not have  visibility into its current or future service requirement spending for these  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making six recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland  Security:  The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer to, in coordination with the Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management, develop a risk-based approach for  reviewing service requirements\u2014through the Procurement Strategy  Roadmap or other means\u2014to ensure proposed service requirements are  clearly defined and reviewed before planning how they are to be  procured. (Recommendation 1)", "The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer to document the factors the Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer considers when waiving procurement actions from its  Procurement Strategy Roadmap to ensure it is consistently considering  potential acquisition risks in its planning\u2014including those specific to  services.

(Recommendation 5)", "The Secretary of Homeland Security should direct the DHS Chief  Financial Officer to work with Congress to identify information to include  in its annual congressional budget justifications to provide greater  transparency into requested and actual service requirement costs,  particularly for those services requiring heightened management  attention. (Recommendation 6)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment. In its  comments, summarized below and reproduced in appendix V, DHS  agreed with the third and fifth recommendations and identified steps it  plans to take to address them. DHS disagreed with the first, second,  fourth, and sixth recommendations. DHS also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DHS did not agree with the first recommendation, that OCPO, in  coordination with the Office of Program Accountability and Risk  Management, develop a risk-based approach for reviewing service  requirements through the Procurement Strategy Roadmap, or other  means, to ensure that proposed service requirements are clearly defined  and reviewed before planning how they are to be procured. In its  response, DHS cited Instruction 102-01-001 as codifying how DHS and  its components acquire and sustain services for major acquisitions.  However, as noted in our report, as of November 2019 none of DHS\u2019s  services programs rose to the level of being classified as a major service  acquisition. Therefore, DHS is at risk of overlooking those service  contracts that are not a service acquisition program or not associated with  its major acquisitions.", "DHS also noted the use of existing key processes that enable it to identify  needs and develop contract requirements for services. While we  acknowledge in our report that DHS and selected components have these  processes in place, we found they were not consistently used throughout  the contracts in our review, and none can serve as a replacement for the  kind of risk-based headquarters-level oversight that we believe is  necessary. For example, among its processes, DHS cited the use of  integrated product teams as a way to facilitate comprehensive reviews of  service requirements. We noted in our report, however, that according to  officials only two of the eight contracts in our review used such an  approach.", "Further, DHS stated that other existing efforts meet the primary objectives  of the Service Requirements Review pilot, thus making an additional  headquarters-level review of service requirements unnecessary.  However, all of these efforts were also already in place when the then  Under Secretary of Management directed OCPO and the Office of  Program Accountability and Risk Management to undertake its December  2018 pilot program to provide consistency and rigor to reviewing service  contract requirements. Therefore, we continue to believe that given the  amount DHS obligates in service contracts to support its mission,  establishing a risk-based approach to review service requirements prior to  and in coordination with its consideration of how those requirements are  to be procured will help prevent negative acquisition outcomes and the  potential for wasted resources.", "DHS also did not agree with the second recommendation. In its response,  DHS stated that OCPO\u2019s decision to waive a Procurement Strategy  Roadmap review does not mean that the Chief Procurement Officer did  not consider acquisition risks, and that it is unclear what other acquisition  risks we believe are not being considered. The recommendation to  document the factors considered when waiving the Procurement Strategy  Roadmap is intended to ensure that the department is able to consistently  apply a framework and maintain institutional knowledge\u2014particularly  given the risks and challenges that vacancies in top leadership positions  throughout the department could pose to addressing management  issues. Waiving procurements without documentation of what  acquisition risks are being considered puts the department at risk of  inconsistently making those decisions and not being able to leverage  Procurement Strategy Roadmap lessons learned.", "DHS noted in its response that the decision to waive a procurement  review is based on several considerations, such as the type of service,  information provided to the Chief Procurement Officer by the Head of  Contracting Activity, and historical and current knowledge of the  procurement, among others. However, the department offered no further  insights as to: what types of services may not warrant a Procurement  Strategy Roadmap; what type of information provided by the Head of  Contracting Activity may indicate a review is unnecessary; or how the  Chief Procurement Officer maintains the historical knowledge of  procurements that may have previously experienced challenges and thus  warrant a Procurement Strategy Roadmap. We continue to believe that  taking the step of documenting the factors considered\u2014such as types of  services that may require additional review, or challenges with prior  procurements, some of which may have been awarded years prior\u2014will  help ensure that decisions to waive Procurement Strategy Roadmaps are  made consistently and transparently.", "DHS did not agree with the fourth recommendation, that OCPO should  update the Inherently Governmental and Critical Functions Analysis job  aid to provide guidance for analyzing, documenting, and updating the  federal workforce needed to perform or oversee service contracts  requiring heightened management attention. In its response, DHS stated  that the job aid requires components to certify that they have sufficient  internal capacity to oversee and manage contractor activities and  maintain control of its missions and operations when the requirement is a  closely associated with inherently governmental or critical function.  Further, DHS stated that the job aid requires components to certify that  there are an adequate number of positions filled by federal employees to  manage and monitor contractors if the requirement is a critical function.", "As noted in our report, each component is making its own determination,  in the absence of guidance, as to what factors to consider. In its  response, DHS stated that OCPO will assist components with examples  of analysis by reviewing what some components are doing, and sharing  those examples with others. However, in the absence of guidance about  what DHS expects the components to analyze and document based on  those examples, DHS does not know how or whether the components are  considering the federal workforce available to oversee service contracts  in need of heightened management attention, or what steps, if any, the  components are taking to mitigate risks if there are not enough federal  personnel available to oversee the contracts after award.", "In its response, DHS recognized the need to provide guidance for  updating the job aid, if there is a change in the contract requirement, to  help ensure it has sufficient internal capacity to oversee and manage  contractor activities, maintains control of its missions and operations, and  has the appropriate workforce in place. We consider this to be a positive  step to address part of the recommendation; however, it is unclear what  considerations the components will use to update their analysis without  the presence of guidance for how to analyze the federal workforce  needed prior to the contract being awarded. We maintain that without  guidance, DHS is at risk of inconsistent consideration of federal oversight  for service contracts across its components\u2014an action at odds with its  goals of improving integration, and centralizing and coordinating its many  functions to ensure that its whole is greater than its parts.", "Finally, DHS did not agree with the sixth recommendation, to work with  Congress to identify information to include in congressional budget  justifications to provide greater transparency into requested and actual  service requirement costs, particularly for services requiring heightened  management attention. In its response, DHS stated that it does not  believe including additional information on estimated or actual service  contract requirement costs is appropriate, and stated that contract  information can be found in congressional budget justifications in budget  object class breakouts, cost drivers, and in the Procurement,  Construction, and Improvement Appropriation Capital Investment exhibit.  We acknowledge these same three sources of information in our report,  and note the limitations with each (either over-estimating or under- estimating service contracts) to providing visibility into DHS\u2019s estimated or  actual service contract requirements\u2014both internally to DHS and  externally to Congress. For example, as we note in the report, contracts  identified in the Capital Investment Exhibit are not categorized as being  for a product or service nor does the exhibit consistently provide a  description of what the contract is for. In its response DHS noted  limitations with our analysis comparing contract obligation data from  FPDS-NG with what is reported in DHS\u2019s budget justifications, however,  after discussion with DHS officials during our review, we did not include  that comparison in our report.", "DHS also noted in its response that the congressional budget  justifications are intended to focus on the request, not on the previous or  current year\u2019s contracts. However, the recommendation that DHS work  with Congress is impartial as to what type of service contract information  would be useful for providing greater transparency into DHS\u2019s service  contract requirements. Rather, the recommendation is intended to  address the limited visibility both DHS and Congress have into DHS  service requirements\u2014in particular the significant increases in services  requiring heightened management attention\u2014and provide a means to  report on that information to improve internal and external oversight over  these requirements and to allow for more informed decision-making. The  need for this visibility into service contract requirements is aligned with  prior recommendations GAO has made related to the need to increase  visibility in DHS\u2019s congressional budget justifications for major acquisition  programs\u2019 funding requests; recommendations that DHS has agreed with  and implemented. Given that service contracts accounted for over three  quarters of DHS\u2019s contract obligations from fiscal years 2013 through  2018, we continue to believe that our recommendation to work with  Congress on how to convey that information in congressional budget  requests is valid.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the DHS Chief  Procurement Officer, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border  Protection, the Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and  the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

We  identified obligations for services using the codes associated with  services in the General Services Administration\u2019s Federal Procurement  Data System Product and Service Codes Manual. We analyzed the  FPDS-NG data to identify DHS service obligations compared to  obligations for products, service obligations by DHS component, the types  of services procured, and the proportion of service contracts for functions  in need of heightened management attention\u2014those deemed closely  associated with inherently governmental, critical, and special interest  functions. We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by reviewing  existing information about the FPDS-NG system and the data it collects\u2014 specifically the data dictionary and data validation rules\u2014and performing  electronic testing.

Seventy five of the 100 contracts were for special interest functions, with  the remaining 25 randomly selected. From that sample, we selected eight  contracts\u2014two from each component\u2014that were identified as requiring  heightened management attention. We selected a range of contracts  based on whether the contract contained functions requiring heightened  management attention, the percent of recommended federal oversight,  and whether the requirement was new, among other selection criteria. We  conducted semi-structured interviews with program, contracting, and  budgeting officials from the eight selected component contracts to identify  how the selected service contract requirements were developed,  overseen, and considered when budgeting. Information collected from the  four components and eight contracts cannot be generalized to all  components and contracts.

To determine what processes selected components  have for identifying and developing service requirements, we reviewed  documentation, and interviewed program and contracting officials  associated with our four selected components and eight selected  contracts. To determine how DHS is reviewing service contract  requirements, we reviewed DHS Office of the Chief Procurement Officer  (OCPO) and Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management  guidance and documentation on recent DHS headquarters initiatives\u2014the  Procurement Strategy Roadmap and Service Requirements Review  pilot\u2014and federal internal control standards on risk assessment.
