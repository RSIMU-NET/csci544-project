Standards for Internal Control state that federal agencies should have relevant, reliable, and timely information for decision-making and external- reporting purposes.

These leading practices help ensure reliable cost estimates that are comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. GAO found that FPS's cost estimation model partially aligned with practices for producing comprehensive estimates and minimally aligned with those for producing well-documented and accurate estimates. Furthermore, the model does not align with practices for producing credible cost estimates because, among other things, it does not include a sensitivity analysis, which identifies a range of possible costs based on varying assumptions.

Specifically, FPS conducted the required analyses for only the delegation involving the Social Security Administration and did not conduct these analyses for the other five delegations involving facilities of the Departments of Commerce, Interior, and State; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and the Federal Trade Commission. According to FPS officials, they were not always able to obtain, from the agency requesting a delegation, comparable cost data to complete the cost model.

Moreover, in the conference report accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2012, the conferees raised questions about the  costs and benefits of FPS\u2019s delegations of authority program and directed  FPS to submit a proposed plan for reviewing all delegations of authority.  In response, in November 2012, FPS submitted to Congress an Interim  Delegation Assessment Plan (Interim Plan), which includes FPS\u2019s current  methodology for reviewing all delegations of authority.

For a cost estimating  model to be considered reliable, it needs to substantially or fully meet  each of the following four characteristics: comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible. The extent to which the  characteristics are met is determined by the extent to which the  underlying leading practices for each characteristic are incorporated. For  developing a cost estimate, the Cost Guide identifies 20 leading practices  that include underlying tasks associated with each of the four  characteristics of reliable cost estimates. Although FPS does not directly  implement or oversee implementation of capital projects at federal  facilities, the agency develops cost estimates as part of its delegation of  authority review process (through its cost estimation model) and needs  reliable cost estimates to inform DHS\u2019s decisions about whether to grant,  renew, or rescind a delegation.

Specifically, FPS conducted  the required cost analysis but did not conduct the required capabilities  analysis. FPS\u2019s cost analysis showed that in fiscal year 2013 it would  have cost NRC $6.5 million and FPS about $8 million to provide the  contract guard services at those facilities. According to FPS officials, it  would need an additional $1.5 million more to hire, train, and certify  contract guards. Conducting the required capabilities analysis could have  provided information on FPS\u2019s capabilities versus NRC\u2019s in overseeing a  security guard contract, according to FPS\u2019s Interim Plan. Such an  analysis is to include ensuring that guards have the required training and  certifications, and conducting inspections of guards\u2019 duty stations. During  the review process, NRC officials raised questions about FPS\u2019s ability to  oversee its contract guards, in part, because of our previous reports on  challenges FPS faces with overseeing contract security guards at other  federal facilities. Nonetheless, in 2013, based on FPS\u2019s  recommendation the Secretary of DHS rescinded this delegation, stating  it was in the best interest of the government, but provided no additional  justification. Since then, among other things, FPS has been responsible  for awarding the guard contract and overseeing the guards deployed at  NRC facilities in Rockville and Bethesda, Maryland.", "In addition, FPS did not ensure that there was not a lapse in the  protection of NRC\u2019s facilities as required by its Interim Plan. FPS and  NRC officials told us that, since the contract was awarded in 2013, the  guard contractor has not fully been meeting the terms of the contract. For  example, 41 of the approximately 100 guards (41 percent) deployed to  NRC facilities do not have the required L (equivalent to secret) or Q  (equivalent to top secret) security clearances, as of February 13, 2015,  according to NRC officials. In addition, according to FPS and NRC  officials, the guard contractor had over 3,000 hours of open (unfilled)  posts in NRC\u2019s facilities, in part, due to challenges the contractor faced  with hiring and retaining guards. Based on these open posts, an NRC  official estimated that the agency was due a refund of about $100,000. To  address the open post issue, the guard contractor deployed guard  supervisors to these posts. According to FPS officials, this type of  deployment prevents the supervisors from completing their other  responsibilities including conducting post inspections to ensure that  guards are at their respective posts. Moreover, FPS officials told us that  although the contractor deducted the costs associated with the open  posts, NRC is not getting the level of security services for which it is  paying and this has negatively affected NRC. For example, if there were a  potential threat at any of the open posts, there would not have been a  guard to counteract the threat. In January 2015, after completing the  contractor\u2019s performance assessment report, FPS\u2019s Contracting Officer  decided that although the contractor\u2019s overall performance has been less  than satisfactory, the problem with open posts has not yet risen to the  level of allowing the contract to expire or terminating the contract.  However, FPS\u2019s Contracting Officer is not recommending the contractor  for similar contract guard services in the future.

We analyzed FPS\u2019s efforts to  ensure the reliability of its delegations of authority data against internal  controls specified in federal Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government that provide reasonable assurance that an agency is  operating efficiently and effectively. We also reviewed FPS\u2019s delegations  of authority data as of October 30, 2014 to determine the federal  departments and agencies with delegated authority, the type of  delegation received (e.g., law enforcement or contract guard), the number  of facilities specified in the delegation, and the status of FPS\u2019s review.

The extent to which the  characteristics are met is determined by the extent to which the  underlying leading practices for each characteristic are incorporated. The  Cost Guide identifies 20 leading practices for developing a cost estimate  that include underlying tasks associated with each of the four  characteristics of reliable cost estimates. GAO developed the Cost Guide  to assist government agencies as they develop, manage, and evaluate  the costs of capital projects.", "Although FPS does not directly implement or oversee implementation of  capital projects at federal facilities, the agency develops cost estimates as  part of its delegation of authority review process (through its cost  estimation model) and needs reliable cost estimates to inform DHS\u2019s  decisions about whether to grant, renew, or rescind a delegation. As a  result, most of the leading practices are applicable to the assessment of  FPS\u2019s cost estimation model. However, we found that three leading  practices and one of the underlying tasks associated with the leading  practices were not applicable, in part, because we were assessing a cost  model rather than a cost estimate for an acquisition. Specifically, since we  did not evaluate a cost estimate, we did not assess (1) the consistency of  the technical baseline with the data cost estimate, (2) any mistakes in the  costs estimate, or (3) if the estimating technique was used appropriately  in the cost estimate. In addition, we did not assess earned-value- management reporting as it was not applicable to FPS\u2019s delegation  assessment process. For one leading practice, including all lifecycle  costs, we adjusted the time period to reflect a shorter period that was  sufficient for FPS\u2019s decision-making needs for a delegation of authority.  We also interviewed officials from FPS and the Office of Management  and Budget about FPS\u2019s process for reviewing delegations of authority.", "To determine whether FPS followed its Interim Plan in reviewing select  delegations, we conducted case studies of the six requests for new or  renewed delegations FPS reviewed from June 2012 through May 2014.
