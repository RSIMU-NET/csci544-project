These wells are subject to regulation to protect drinking water sources under EPA's UIC class II program and approved state class II programs. Because much of the population relies on underground sources for drinking water, these wells have raised concerns about the safety of the nation's drinking water.", "GAO was asked to review EPA's oversight of the class II program. This report examines (1) EPA and state roles, responsibilities, and resources for the program, (2) safeguards to protect drinking water, (3) EPA oversight and enforcement of class II programs, and (4) the reliability of program data for reporting. GAO reviewed federal and state laws and regulations. GAO interviewed EPA and state officials and reviewed class II programs from a nongeneralizable sample of eight states selected on the basis of shale oil and gas regions and the highest number of class II wells."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) role in the Underground Injection Control (UIC) class II program is to oversee and enforce fluid injection into wells associated with oil and gas production, known as class II wells. EPA has approved 39 states to manage their own class II programs, and EPA regions are responsible for managing the programs in remaining states. EPA regions and states use a mix of resources to manage class II programs, including EPA grant funding, state funding, and federal and state personnel. EPA's UIC grant funding has remained at about $11 million for at least the past 10 years.", "Class II programs from the eight selected states that GAO reviewed have safeguards, such as construction requirements for injection wells, to protect against contamination of underground sources of drinking water. Programs in two states are managed by EPA and rely on EPA safeguards, while the remaining six programs are state managed and have their own safeguards that EPA deemed effective at preventing such contamination. Overall, EPA and state program officials reported that these safeguards are protective, resulting in few known incidents of contamination. However, the safeguards do not address emerging underground injection risks, such as seismic activity and overly high pressure in geologic formations leading to surface outbreaks of fluids. EPA officials said they manage these risks on a state-by-state basis, and some states have additional safeguards to address them. EPA has tasked its UIC Technical Workgroup with reviewing induced seismicity associated with injection wells and possible safeguards, but it does not plan reviews of other emerging risks, such as high pressure in formations. Without reviews of these risks, class II programs may not have the information necessary to fully protect underground drinking water.", "EPA is not consistently conducting two key oversight and enforcement activities for class II programs. First, EPA does not consistently conduct annual on-site state program evaluations as directed in guidance because, according to some EPA officials, the agency does not have the resources to do so. The agency has not, however, evaluated its guidance, which dates from the 1980s, to determine which activities are essential for effective oversight. Without such an evaluation, EPA does not know what oversight activities are most effective or necessary. Second, to enforce state class II requirements, under current agency regulations, EPA must approve and incorporate state program requirements and any changes to them into federal regulations through a rulemaking. EPA has not incorporated all such requirements and changes into federal regulations and, as a result, may not be able to enforce all state program requirements. Some EPA officials said that incorporating changes into federal regulations through the rulemaking process is burdensome and time-consuming. EPA has not, however, evaluated alternatives for a more efficient process to approve and incorporate state program requirements and changes into regulations. Without incorporating these requirements and changes into federal regulations, EPA cannot enforce them if a state does not take action or requests EPA's assistance to take action.", "EPA collects a large amount of data on each class II program, but the data are not reliable (i.e., complete or comparable) to report at a national level. EPA is working on a national database that will allow it to report UIC results at a national level, but the database will not be fully implemented for at least 2 to 3 years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, EPA review emerging risks related to class II program safeguards and ensure that it can effectively oversee and efficiently enforce class II programs.

These fluids consist largely of saltwater and may contain  pollutants such as chlorides, hydrocarbons, and naturally occurring  radioactive materials. Using injection wells that rely on gravity or  pressure, the fluids are injected deep underground into porous rock  formations, such as sandstone, that are typically below aquifers that can,  or do, supply drinking water. Because a significant percentage of the  population gets its drinking water from underground aquifers, these wells  have raised concerns about the safety of the nation\u2019s drinking water.", "Wells used for injecting fluids associated with the extraction of oil and gas  resources are known as class II injection wells. As of 2012, there were  over 170,000 class II injection wells in the United States, located in states  as diverse as California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas,  and Virginia. To protect underground sources of drinking water from  contamination, class II injection wells are subject to regulation by the  Underground Injection Control (UIC) program overseen by the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking Water  Act (act), which is managed by state regulatory agencies and, in some  cases, EPA. Under the UIC program, EPA and states rely on safeguards  to prevent fluids from leaking into aquifers that can be used as  underground sources of drinking water. These safeguards require well  operators to among other things, meet technical standards for  constructing, operating, testing, and monitoring injection wells.", "The UIC program regulates three types of class II wells associated with  oil and gas production: (1) enhanced recovery wells into which brine,  water, steam, carbon dioxide, or other fluids and gases are injected into  oil- or gas-bearing formations to increase the recovery of residual oil and  gas; (2) disposal wells into which brines and other fluids brought to the  surface during oil and gas production activities are injected to dispose of  them; and (3) storage wells into which liquid petroleum products are  injected, generally as part of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.estimates that approximately 80 percent of class II wells are enhanced  recovery wells.", "States request approval from EPA to manage the UIC programs in their  respective borders, including the class II programs. Under the act, the  EPA Administrator approves state programs for one or more classes of  wells through a rulemaking process, with public notice and comment, and  EPA updates federal regulations to reflect the approved program. Once  EPA has approved a state\u2019s program, the state has primary management  and enforcement responsibility for its UIC program, known as primacy. In  states that do not have approval to manage their programs, EPA regional  offices manage the programs in the state directly. Twenty-five states with  class II wells manage their class II programs and regulate over 95 percent  of the class II wells nationwide.

We interviewed EPA  officials at headquarters and the eight regional offices with states that  have oil and gas activity and class II underground injection control  programs about their management of the program. We also spoke with  officials in six of our eight selected states about the day-to-day  management and operation of their class II programs, and we requested  data on the relative share of the class II program budget contributed by  the states. Similarly, we spoke to the regional office staff responsible for  managing the programs in Kentucky and Pennsylvania about their  management of the class II programs in these states.", "To address our second objective, we identified and reviewed relevant  federal regulations and program guidance that establish minimum federal  safeguards to protect underground sources of drinking water from  contamination by injected fluids.

We also  identified and reviewed state regulations and program guidance regarding  safeguards in the six remaining states in our sample. To complement our  analysis of law, regulations, and guidance, we interviewed officials in EPA  headquarters and eight regional offices responsible for overseeing the  UIC program in the selected states, and interviewed state and appropriate  regional officials about the implementation of these safeguards in the  eight selected states. Our review included a summary and comparison of  the regulations and guidance that establish state and EPA-managed  program safeguards, but we did not analyze the technical sufficiency of  those safeguards.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed EPA regulations and  guidance on approving state programs and revisions, and EPA guidance  that defines effective oversight of class II programs by EPA headquarters  and regional offices.

This increase is due in large part to  development of oil and gas from unconventional formations. For example,  shale oil production increased more than 5-fold, from 39 million to about  217 million barrels from 2007 through 2011, while shale gas production  increased approximately 4-fold, from 1.6 to about 7.2 trillion cubic feet,  over the same period. Oil and gas production, including production from  unconventional oil and gas bearing formations, involves removing  hydrocarbon bearing fluids from geologic formations underground.  Conventional oil and natural gas are found in deep, porous rock or  reservoirs and can flow under natural pressure to the surface after drilling.  In contrast to the free-flowing resources found in conventional formations,  the low permeability of some formations, including shale, means that oil  and gas trapped in the formation cannot move easily from the rock.", "As a result of geologic differences, the methods used to extract  hydrocarbon resources, including the amounts of water used and  wastewater produced during extraction, vary widely. Some oil and gas  can be developed by drilling a well and relying on the natural pressure in  the formation to push the oil or gas to the surface. When an oil or gas  producing reservoir is depleted\u2014that is, no longer producing oil or gas\u2014a  producer can inject fluids, such as saltwater, into the reservoir to increase  the pressure in the formation and move the residual oil and gas toward a  well and the surface for collection, a process known as enhanced  recovery (See fig. 1.).", "Similarly, some hydrocarbons are produced through the use of hydraulic  fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of liquid under  pressure to fracture the rock in geologic formations such as shale to  create fractures and allow hydrocarbons to flow more freely from the  formation into the well for collection. The liquids used in this process  consist primarily of water, but also include chemicals, and sand or other  agents for holding open the fractures (proppants). When a well is no  longer economically viable, a producer may decide to cease production  from it. At some point after production stops, wells may be converted from  production wells to disposal wells, where wastewater can be injected for  disposal. If the well is not used for any of these purposes, it becomes idle  or inactive and will eventually be plugged and abandoned.", "The process of extracting oil and gas creates several waste streams that  must be managed. Key among these waste streams is the water (brine)  produced along with the oil or gas during production. Produced water may  include water that occurs naturally in the formation, water or other liquids  that were injected into the formation to enhance recovery during the  drilling or production process, and flowback water, which consists of the  water, chemicals, and proppants used for hydraulic fracturing (fracturing  fluids). Over 90 percent of the water produced during oil and gas  operations is disposed of underground, either through injection for  disposal or for enhanced recovery. The remaining water may be  discharged to surface water such as streams or lakes, stored in surface  impoundments, reused for agricultural purposes such as irrigation or  livestock, or reused for hydraulic fracturing.", "Differences in geologic formations can affect the pressure and volume of  wastewater injected underground for either disposal or reuse in  enhancement of oil and gas production. Layers of sediment and rock  deposited over time create different underground formations with different  characteristics, depending on the material that was deposited and various  geologic processes. These characteristics include how porous and  permeable a rock is\u2014both characteristics that determine how well a  formation can accept and hold fluids such as wastewater. Generally,  fluids are injected into porous, permeable reservoirs below an upper  confining layer, or geologic formation with low permeability through which  significant quantities of liquids cannot move. The confining layer serves  as a barrier of protection between the reservoir where fluids are being  injected, known as the injection zone, and underground sources of  drinking water (see fig. 1). Ideally, an injection zone is sealed above and  below by continuous, impermeable rock formations and is large enough to  keep injected fluids from reaching pressures great enough to fracture the  confining rock layers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Safe Drinking Water Act and the UIC Program", "paragraphs": ["Much of the nation relies on groundwater as a source of drinking water,  and reflecting this fact, Congress included groundwater protection  provisions in the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended.

Before the act\u2019s passage, there was no overall federal  regulation of injection activities, although some individual states regulated  injection wells.

These minimum  requirements are to prohibit the injection of fluids underground unless  permitted and are to include, among other things, requirements for  monitoring of and reporting on injection wells. In implementing the  program, EPA has defined underground sources of drinking water as an  aquifer, or part of an aquifer, that has not been exempted from regulation  and either supplies a public water system or contains a sufficient quantity  of water to supply a public water system and (1) currently supplies  drinking water for human consumption or (2) which, among other things,  contains fewer than 10,000 milligrams per liter (mg/l or parts per million)  total dissolved solids.the act and used for injection.

Second,  EPA\u2019s regulations of class II wells should provide for varying geological,  hydrological, and historical conditions within and among the states. Third,  EPA\u2019s program must not unnecessarily disrupt existing state UIC  programs.", "The act also included provisions for states to apply for and receive  approval from EPA to manage one or more of the UIC programs in their  state (each class of well is managed as a program).gain EPA approval, a state generally must adopt and implement a  program that meets the minimum requirements established under EPA  regulations and conduct reporting as EPA requires.

Using this alternative, in lieu of adopting EPA\u2019s minimum requirements, a  state can seek approval to manage its own program by demonstrating to  EPA that its program is effective in preventing the contamination of  underground sources of drinking water. Similar to the conventional  approval process, states are required to submit an application to EPA and  enter into a memorandum of agreement with EPA laying out the  components of their program. However, EPA has discretion when making  the determination that the state\u2019s program is effective at protecting  underground sources of drinking water.

In 1988, about a decade after  EPA issued its regulations, the agency initiated a midcourse evaluation of  the class II program to determine whether any changes were needed to  improve the program. EPA evaluated the adequacy of program  regulations and safeguards, including various safeguards such as  mechanical integrity tests, and found that most of the regulations and  corresponding safeguards were adequate to protect underground sources  of drinking water and needed no changes. EPA\u2019s evaluation also  identified some areas of the program that could be improved, such as the  temporary abandonment of injection wells and construction requirements  for injection wells.

Region 6 has a goal of conducting annual on-site  evaluations of all class II programs each year, but regional officials said  they have had to increasingly rely on conference calls and electronic file  review in lieu of site visits to complete the annual evaluations and  associated reports. Similarly, EPA headquarters officials told us that they  do not conduct annual evaluations of EPA-managed programs due to  limited resources. Headquarters officials told us that in lieu of on-site  evaluations they focus on reviewing annual grant reports and hold  ongoing discussions of various policy issues with state officials.", "According to EPA officials, even with the agency\u2019s limited resources, EPA  has not evaluated the guidance and required oversight activities to  identify priority activities that are needed to oversee programs and ensure  their effectiveness. The agency issued guidance on effective oversight of  state and EPA-managed UIC programs in 1983, just after the national  UIC program\u2019s inception when many state class II programs had just  been approved. The guidance contained activities that were needed to  ensure that a new program was being implemented as it was supposed  to, such as reviewing the memorandum of agreement in each state.  However, according to regional officials, some of these activities may not  be needed for programs as they mature. For example, officials in regions  4, 7, and 8 told us that while annual on-site evaluations can strengthen  oversight and improve communication with state program officials in  some cases, they may only be necessary every few years rather than  annually now that UIC programs have matured. In addition, Regions 6, 8  and 10 told us that, due to improvements in technology in electronic well  file sharing, they have been able to conduct some activities remotely,  such as file reviews, that once required an on-site visit. Without  evaluating its guidance, EPA does not know what oversight activities are  most effective and should be priorities\u2014or even necessary\u2014given  current program conditions and funding.

When faced  with a similar backlog in the early 1990s, EPA conducted a review to  identify all state program changes since the UIC program\u2019s inception in  the early 1980s, and then conducted one large rulemaking to incorporate  all of the identified changes into federal regulations. EPA spent 3 years  researching and comparing state regulations to those already  incorporated into federal regulations, and it identified changes to 37 state  programs that needed to be incorporated into federal regulations through  its rulemaking. However, EPA has not undertaken a similar effort to  identify and incorporate changes to state program requirements into  federal regulations since 1991. In 2010, EPA UIC officials assessed the  resources that would be needed to conduct a similar effort, and they  estimated the time and resources necessary to complete those steps. At  that time, according to EPA documents, EPA could not verify that any  state programs were up-to-date in federal regulations, and estimated that  it would require 2 to 3 years, $150,000 in outside contract support, and  dedicated EPA staff to identify and incorporate all state program changes  made since 1991 into federal regulations. Until it conducts a rulemaking  to incorporate the backlog of state program requirements and changes to  state program requirements that have been approved, EPA will not be  able to enforce some state program requirements, hindering the agency\u2019s  enforcement of the program nationally.", "EPA officials told us that incorporating changes into federal regulations,  particularly through the rulemaking process, was burdensome and time- consuming. Several EPA officials told us that reviewing, approving, and  then incorporating changes into federal regulations through rulemaking is  lengthy and resource intensive. As a result, the agency has not  conducted rulemakings to keep pace with the changes that are occurring  in state programs. The requirement that EPA incorporate changes to  state regulations into federal regulations is established through the  agency\u2019s regulations, however, and is not required by the Safe Drinking  Water Act.

As a result, EPA headquarters does not have all  the 7520 forms to summarize and report. We requested, but were unable  to obtain, a full 5 years of 7520 forms for all states. EPA officials told us  that EPA headquarters provided all of the forms available, but that, in  some cases, the forms had not been submitted by the states. The agency  has attempted to compile the data as part of an effort to put the data in a  simple electronic spreadsheet, but it acknowledges that it is missing state  data and would have to get it from the regional offices or individual states.  Second, in our review of the 7520 forms provided to us by EPA, we found  examples of incomplete forms, including forms without state names and  forms with blank fields, with no indication of whether the blanks  represented missing data or a quantity of zero. According to officials at  the regional level, there are no data entry protocols to indicate whether  these blank fields represent zeros or missing data. While EPA regional  officials reported that they were familiar enough with operations in the  states that they knew which blanks were supposed to be zeros and which  were supposed to be blank fields, none reported editing the forms before  transmitting them to headquarters. Without reporting protocols, states  cannot provide complete data and regions cannot review the data and  ensure that it is sufficiently complete. Such incomplete data, when  aggregated and compared with other state data, could lead EPA, as well  as those to whom the agency reports, to draw incorrect conclusions on  the status of state programs and the national program.", "In addition to being incomplete, the data that EPA collects through its  activity reporting forms is not comparable among states because of  inconsistencies in the way that state agencies responsible for class II  wells interpret the instructions on the forms. We found two key variables  that states in our sample were interpreting inconsistently: (1) significant  noncompliance and (2) alleged contamination of aquifers. As shown in  table 4, states found different levels of significant noncompliance\u2014those  violations that, in general, pose a threat to underground sources of  drinking water. For example, from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year  2012, most states\u2019 instances of significant noncompliance represented  less than 1 percent of their total well inventory. However, instances of  significant noncompliance that occurred in Texas during this same period  range from 2 to 11 percent of the state\u2019s total class II well inventory.", "The amount of significant noncompliance reported by states can vary in  part because state and EPA regional officials interpret the definition of  significant noncompliance differently. Through discussions with officials in  the eight states we reviewed, we discovered that at least two states use a  different method than others to identify and record significant  noncompliance violations. EPA guidance for determining significant  noncompliance is outlined on the 7520 form, as well as through select  guidance documents, and allows state discretion for determining which  violations should be counted as significant noncompliance. Most states  generally reported adhering to the instructions on the 7520 forms, but  states\u2019 interpretation of the directions varies. For example, Texas officials  reported that they consider all delinquent mechanical integrity violations  as significant noncompliance, and Ohio officials said that all mechanical  integrity failures are considered to be significant noncompliance  regardless of their resolution. However, the guidance for reporting  significant noncompliance notes that mechanical integrity violations  should be counted as significant noncompliance when the loss of integrity  causes the movement of fluid outside the authorized zone, if such  movement may have the potential for endangering underground drinking  water. Officials in Texas told us that they consider all significant  noncompliance a potential threat to groundwater, but they did not indicate  whether they consider proximity of underground drinking water when they  determine which mechanical integrity loss violations are recorded as  significant noncompliance. Ohio officials told us that significant  noncompliance violations are determined based on the state\u2019s definition  of significant noncompliance, even if the violation does not endanger  groundwater.", "Additionally, states vary in how they interpret a second key piece of  data\u2014the instances of alleged contamination of underground sources of  drinking water. The instructions included on EPA\u2019s 7520 form note that  the respondent should enter the number of times a well cited for  noncompliance has allegedly contaminated an underground source of  drinking water. Several state agencies with whom we spoke initially had  difficulty describing how they populated this field. Officials from three of  the state programs with whom we spoke told us that, as they interpreted  this question, they would only report instances of alleged contamination if  they were confirmed as cases of contamination due to a class II well.  However, officials representing the remaining five states said that they  would report instances of alleged contamination without needing to  confirm whether actual contamination had occurred from a class II well.  Officials in California, Colorado, North Dakota, and Oklahoma indicated  that they would investigate situations of potential underground drinking  water contamination, and if evidence showed a reasonable suspicion or  likelihood that contamination had occurred, it would be reported on the  form 7520 as a case of alleged contamination. Officials from EPA Region  3, who manage the program for Pennsylvania, told us any suspected  contamination of an underground source of drinking water would be  reported as an instance of alleged contamination on the 7520.", "EPA officials acknowledge that there may be inconsistencies in how data  on these forms are reported, yet the data submitted on the 7520 forms is  not subjected to any formalized review to ensure completeness or  consistency. EPA regional officials said that they review the data for  completeness, however, they do not have a protocol to ensure data  quality or that states are reporting the data the same way in the first  place. Without protocols to ensure the consistency and completeness of  the data that states report, EPA regions cannot ensure the quality of the  data that are being reported to headquarters and EPA may not be able to  aggregate and report complete and comparable data.", "EPA has also found inconsistencies in states\u2019 data that are aggregated  and reported from the national UIC database, including class II data. The  agency found these inconsistencies by comparing data from the simple  7520 database it created to data in the national UIC database. For  example, on the basis of this data check, officials told us that they  planned to refine definitions for data fields that may be yielding  inconsistent results to make them more comparable across states, and  they have had some initial training sessions with regions to educate them  on the correct interpretation of definitions. These efforts should improve  the information that is ultimately submitted in the national UIC database,  according to EPA officials. These efforts could also help make the data  reported on the 7520 forms more consistent and comparable; however,  the agency does not plan to use the database to aggregate and report  UIC program data because it plans to phase out the 7520 reports when it  brings the national database online. In the meantime, however, EPA will  not be able to report on the national program if it cannot aggregate the  data with reasonable assurances of its completeness and consistency.  Given increased public attention on the oil and gas industry, reporting on  the national program is helpful for Congress, the public, and other groups  to understand the program. EPA officials indicated that they are open to  using the simple 7520 database for reporting if their efforts to improve the  data do not distract from their efforts to improve the national UIC  database."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For over 30 years, EPA and states have managed regulatory programs  with safeguards that are designed to prevent contamination of  underground sources of drinking water from the injection of fluids  associated with oil and gas production. As domestic oil and gas  production and the demand for underground injection wells continue to  increase, EPA faces additional challenges maintaining sufficient oversight  and enforcement of these different programs and requirements in a  budget-constrained environment. States have been partners with EPA in  managing their programs, yet face similar budgetary constraints. To meet  its responsibilities to oversee and enforce class II program requirements,  it is important that EPA ensures that state programs have information on  risks to underground sources of drinking water posed by underground  injection, that its oversight and enforcement are focused and efficient, and  that it obtains sufficient information to monitor and report on the program  nationally. We have identified several challenges that EPA faces to meet  these responsibilities:", "As the class II program has developed, new risks have emerged,  including overpressurization of geologic formations and potential  contamination of underground sources of drinking water by diesel  fuels. Without information on emerging risks on a national scale, such  as through a UIC Technical Workgroup review, state class II programs  may not have the information necessary to address these risks and  ensure that their programs are designed to be effective at protecting  underground sources of drinking water.", "EPA regions and headquarters are not consistently carrying out  annual on-site evaluations of state class II programs\u2014an activity that  EPA guidance, issued in 1983 when many state programs had just  been approved\u2014identified as key to ensuring effective oversight of  state programs. Limited resources have prevented EPA from  conducting on-site evaluations annually. Yet, on-site evaluations may  only be necessary every few years now that UIC programs have  matured, and with improvements in technology, some activities that  once required an on-site visit, such as file reviews, can be done  remotely in some cases. Given that EPA has not conducted an overall  review of the class II program since the early 1990s, the agency has  not considered what activities should be priorities to ensure effective  oversight of the program as it currently stands, and what resources  are necessary to carry out those activities. Until EPA evaluates its  guidance to determine what activities are essential for conducting  effective oversight of a mature class II program, and revises its  guidance as needed to reflect those activities, it cannot ensure that its  oversight is effective.", "Enforcement of state and federal class II program regulations is a key  EPA responsibility under the act. Yet, EPA has not taken steps to  ensure that it has appropriate enforcement authority for all state  program requirements. As a result, EPA cannot enforce some state  program requirements. EPA\u2019s difficulty taking legal action against a  violator in Illinois illustrates the importance of EPA incorporating state  program requirements into federal regulations, as currently required  by EPA regulations. Since the agency\u2019s 1991 rulemaking to  incorporate changes to state program requirements into federal  regulations, EPA has accumulated another backlog of state program  requirements that need to be incorporated. Until EPA begins  incorporating these changes, the backlog of state program changes it  must review, approve, and incorporate into federal regulations will  continue to increase. EPA officials are correct in their assessment that  the process created by EPA regulations and guidance to review,  approve, and separately incorporate changes in state program  requirements through a rulemaking is burdensome and resource  intensive. While agency officials recognize that other programs, such  as the Public Water System Supervision program, have more efficient  processes for reviewing and approving state requirements, EPA has  not evaluated whether it could remove the requirement for a separate  rulemaking to incorporate state program changes, or somehow modify  its approval process to ensure that changes to state program  requirements are incorporated into federal regulations at the same  time changes are reviewed and approved. Until EPA evaluates  whether this requirement can be revised or eliminated to make the  review, approval, and incorporation of state program changes more  efficient, the process for incorporating future state program changes  will remain burdensome and time-consuming.", "Congress, the public, and national groups all have great interest in the  nation\u2019s oil and gas resources and their development, including how  water and wastewater associated with those resources are managed.  The best source of information that EPA has is the simple 7520  database, and while it has taken steps to use that database to correct  information in developing and testing its national UIC database, it has  not taken steps to use the 7520 database for reporting. Yet, because  the 7520 data are not complete or consistent, they are not sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting at a national level. The same  steps that the agency is taking to correct its data for the national UIC  database\u2014using consistent definitions of terms in collecting program  data and having a protocol to check data quality\u2014would help correct  its 7520 data and would make that data available, perhaps earlier, to  allow the agency to report on the program nationally. With some  additional effort, EPA could make the 7520 database useful for  reporting until the national UIC database is ready for reporting. Unless  EPA takes these steps, it will be several years before EPA can  provide updated information at a national level to Congress, the  public, and others on the UIC program, preventing them from  understanding the program and the protection being provided to  underground sources of drinking water at an important juncture in the  development of oil and gas in the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that EPA\u2019s oversight of the class II program is effective at  protecting drinking water sources from the underground injection of large  amounts of wastewater that will be produced with increasing domestic oil  and gas production, we recommend that the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency take the following four actions:", "Task the UIC Technical Working Group with reviewing emerging risks,  and related program safeguards, including overpressurization of  formations and information on use of diesel fuels in hydraulic  fracturing.", "Evaluate and revise, as needed, UIC program guidance on effective  oversight to identify essential activities that EPA headquarters and  regions need to conduct to effectively oversee state and EPA- managed programs.", "To ensure that EPA maintains enforcement authority of state program  conduct a rulemaking to incorporate state program requirements,  and changes to state program requirements, into federal  regulations, and at the same time, evaluate and consider alternative processes to  more efficiently incorporate future changes to state program  requirements into federal regulations without a rulemaking.", "To support nationwide reporting goals until the national UIC database  improve the 7520 data for reporting purposes, as well as to help  with quality assurance for the national UIC database, by  developing and implementing a protocol for states and regions to  enter data consistently and for regions to check 7520 data for  consistency and completeness to ensure that data collected from  state and EPA-managed class II programs are complete and  comparable for purposes of reporting at a national level, and  in the interim, develop a method to use the 7520 database to  report UIC data, including data on class II wells, until the national  UIC database is fully populated with state data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to EPA for review and comment.

EPA agreed with three recommendations,  and agreed with the findings of another recommendation but did not  agree with the recommended action. EPA also provided technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate. In addition, we provided  appropriate sections of the draft report to the six states whose programs  we reviewed. State officials from California, Colorado, North Dakota,  Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "In response to our recommendation that EPA task the UIC Technical  Workgroup with reviewing emerging risks and related program  safeguards, EPA agreed that to ensure effective oversight of the class II  program the agency must  identify emerging risks and provide state and  EPA-managed class II programs with the information they need to  address those risks. EPA stated that it will provide information on  overpressurization to state and EPA-managed programs in the UIC  Technical Workgroup\u2019s planned report on induced seismicity; and that its  February 2014 guidance on class II program permitting for hydraulic  fracturing with diesel fuels provides recommendations to EPA permit  writers, including best practices identified by states and industry. We  recognize EPA\u2019s efforts to provide additional information to state and  EPA-managed programs on induced seismicity, overpressurization, and  permitting hydraulic fracturing operations that use diesel fuels, but these  efforts do not completely address the issues we identified. As a part of  these efforts, it is important that the UIC Technical Workgroup provide  information to states and EPA-managed programs on the other risks  posed to underground sources of drinking water by overpressurization of  formations, such as potential contamination by surface breakout of  injected fluids as occurred in Oklahoma in recent years. In addition, since  not all states legally require disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluid  composition through the FracFocus database, including states with large  numbers of wells such as California, it is critical that the UIC Technical  Workgroup provide guidance on the information that all states must  collect to successfully identify and permit hydraulic fracturing operations  using diesel fuels.", "In response to our recommendation that EPA evaluate and revise, as  needed, UIC program guidance to identify essential activities needed to  effectively oversee state and EPA-managed programs, EPA stated that it  generally agreed with our finding and the recommendation. The agency  stated it will begin an internal dialogue among the UIC program managers  at the June 2014 UIC National Managers Meeting and continue this  dialogue over the next year to evaluate the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s  oversight activities, and will document the results of this process and any  recommendations for further action by July 2015. EPA further stated that  if any change in expectations or practice is warranted, the agency will  develop an advisory document that supplements its 1983 guidance on  effective oversight by July 2016.", "In response to our two-part recommendation that EPA conduct a  rulemaking to incorporate state program requirements and changes to  state program requirements into federal regulations, and that EPA  evaluate and consider alternative processes to efficiently review, approve,  and incorporate future changes to state program requirements into  federal regulations without a rulemaking, EPA agreed with GAO\u2019s findings  but it did not agree to take the recommended actions. In response to the  first part of the recommendation, EPA stated that the agency cannot  conduct a rulemaking to approve and codify all state program revisions  without going through considerable effort to determine whether each of  the changes meets the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA  also stated that conducting a single rulemaking of this scale to  incorporate all outstanding state program changes would be impractical  because EPA, in conjunction with all state programs, would have to  simultaneously review all state class II programs approved through both  the conventional and alternative processes laid out in the Safe Drinking  Water Act. EPA stated that given that the process would take many years  to complete, this approach would still not ensure that all program changes  are up to date in federal regulations, as other states could make changes  to their programs during this time. In lieu of a single rulemaking EPA said  it was conducting an ongoing process of individual rulemakings to  approve and codify state program revisions in a collaborative manner with  states, EPA regions, and EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance  Assurance. However, as stated in the report, according to an analysis  conducted in 2010, EPA estimated that it would take 2 to 3 years,  dedicated EPA personnel, and $150,000 in outside contractor support to  identify, approve, and incorporate all state program changes made since  1991 into federal regulations. By EPA's own estimate, the targeted state- by-state approach will take much longer than a single rulemaking and will  face greater challenges of states continuing to make changes in the  interim, leaving EPA without the ability to enforce the program, if needed.  EPA provided no evidence in its comment letter that the effort it is now  contemplating would be any less costly or any more efficient than the  approach it assessed in 2010. For this reason, we believe that our  recommendation is still necessary for EPA to carry out its responsibilities  for the class II program.", "In response to the second part of this recommendation, that EPA  consider alternative processes to review and approve state program  revisions and to incorporate state programs into federal regulations  without rulemaking, EPA stated that (1) the Safe Drinking Water Act  specifically requires that state UIC program revisions made in response to  changes in EPA UIC regulations be approved by rule, and (2) the agency  would need to revise its regulations to be able to approve state program  changes without a rulemaking. We were not suggesting that EPA violate  the Safe Drinking Water Act and have made changes to the  recommendation language to avoid any such confusion. The focus of our  recommendation is on the requirement appearing in EPA's regulation, but  not in the Safe Drinking Water Act, that effectively prohibits EPA  enforcement of state UIC regulations unless the latter are codified in the  federal regulations. EPA stated that there are strong policy and  programmatic reasons to maintain this requirement. Specifically,  according to EPA, without codification it would not be possible to find a  complete set of EPA approved rules for a state in one place, making it  difficult for the regulated community, EPA, and the Department of Justice  to determine what state program requirements are applicable and  enforceable under the Safe Drinking Water Act. If EPA believes the  codification process is important, it should devote the resources  necessary to implementing it, or, if those resources are not forthcoming, it  should consider alternative methods of maintaining federal enforceability  within existing resource constraints that are likely to reduce the current  backlog. In its letter, EPA states that it will continue coordination among  its offices to make the program review and rulemaking process more  efficient. However, it provided no detail as to what actions may produce  such efficiencies, when they might take effect, or why they have not  already been implemented. For these reasons, we continue to believe  that EPA should explore alternative methods for ensuring the  enforceability of state UIC regulations that do not rely on the rulemaking  process.", "In response to our recommendation that EPA develop and implement a  protocol for states and regions to ensure that 7520 data are complete and  comparable for purposes of reporting at the national level and that EPA  develop a method to use the 7520 database to report UIC data until the  national UIC database is fully populated with state data, EPA agreed with  our finding and recommendation. Specifically, EPA agreed that there is  room for improvement in the completeness and consistency of data  submitted by the states and regions through the 7520 forms, and that the  7520 database should be completed so that it can be used as a tool to  better understand national UIC activities.

Under the regulation, however, state revisions deemed  nonsubstantial can be approved by letter, rather than by rule, and it  appears possible that these nonsubstantial changes could include  changes made in response to an EPA requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Codifying State Program Changes in Federal Regulations", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the program regulations for review and approval of state  programs, EPA determined in 1983 that another part was required in  regulations (1) to contain EPA\u2019s requirements in states where EPA would  manage the program and have primary enforcement authority and (2) to  codify EPA\u2019s approval of state UIC programs. On this basis, EPA  promulgated part 147 in 1984. The general provisions state that part  147 \u201csets forth the applicable Underground Injection Control (UIC)  programs\u201d in each state, and that \u201cegulatory provisions incorporated by  reference (in the case of approved state programs) or promulgated by  EPA (in the case of EPA-administered programs), and all permit  conditions or permit denials issued pursuant to such regulations, are  enforceable by the Administrator\u201d under the act. Thus, EPA established  in its regulation an obligation not found in the act: that state programs  must be codified into the part 147 regulations to be enforceable by EPA.", "Available documents, such as the original Federal Register preambles for  this part, do not explain why EPA added this obligation.

The guidance applies to all state programs  approved under both sections 1422 and 1425.", "The guidance, Guidance for Review and Approval of State Underground  Injection Control (UIC) Programs and Revisions to Approved State  Programs, distinguishes between substantial and nonsubstantial changes  to state programs and includes examples of substantial changes.  Substantial changes, including changes to a state\u2019s authority, transfer  from an approved state agency to another, and changes which would  make the program less stringent than applicable requirement, are to be  approved by the EPA Administrator. Nonsubstantial changes may be  approved by a Regional Administrator in a letter to a state\u2019s Governor.", "The guidance also indicates that states will apply for EPA to review and  approve their program changes and also sets out a process for EPA to  review and approve the program changes in 90 days. The process  involves a rulemaking procedure different from the process needed to  codify the state program or program changes into section 147.", "Once a state program or program change is approved, EPA\u2019s regulations  indicate that it should be codified into section 147 to allow EPA to enforce  the state program, if needed. However, the guidance is silent on the steps  EPA headquarters and regions need to take to incorporate approved  programs or program changes into section 147.", "Many states had approved programs for one or more well classes by  1984, and EPA\u2019s initial promulgation of part 147 in that year codified most  of them. EPA typically conducted two discrete steps to approve and  codify the programs: (1) approval by rule of a state program and (2) later  codification of the approved program into part 147. Over time, additional  states obtained EPA approval for their programs. For example, Montana\u2019s  class II program was approved by rule in 1996. In addition, some states  made changes to their programs. According to EPA headquarters  officials, there have been few substantial changes to state class II  programs, and EPA has not changed any requirements for class II  programs that would trigger state revisions.", "EPA has not, however, codified some state programs. It last conducted  an exercise to update its part 147 regulations in 1991, updating the  references to state regulations. Even so, the revisions did not codify all  of the programs approved to date. For example, West Virginia and  Arkansas both had class II programs approved by EPA in 1983 and 1984,  respectively, but these programs were neither included in the original part  147 nor the 1991 revisions. EPA officials could not explain why these  state programs were not codified, noting that these events predated their  tenure at the agency. EPA officials are aware that part 147 is out of date  with respect to state program revisions, as well as these two state  programs missing in their entirety. According to officials, resources have  not been provided to conduct the necessary research and rulemaking.  Thus, by the terms of section 147.1 in conjunction with the act, EPA is  unable to enforce those state program requirements that are not  contained in part 147."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this report are to examine: (1) EPA and state roles,  responsibilities, and resources in management the class II program; (2)  safeguards select states have in place to ensure the protection of  underground drinking water; (3) EPA\u2019s regulation and oversight of class II  programs; and (4) the reliability of data to report on the class II program  nationwide. To address all objectives, we reviewed the Safe Drinking  Water Act and EPA\u2019s regulations and guidance on the Underground  Injection Control (UIC) program, including class II wells. We also spoke  with officials from EPA headquarters and regional offices about all  aspects of the class II program. Because this report also examines states\u2019  roles in the program, we chose a sample of eight states on which to focus  our analysis: California, Colorado, Kentucky, North Dakota, Ohio,  Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These states represent a  nonjudgmental sample, selected on the basis of the location of current  shale oil and gas plays across the country, the number of class II wells in  each state, and whether the class II program was managed by the state  or EPA regions. To identify current shale oil and gas plays across the  country, we used Energy Information Administration regions that are  organized around national shale oil and shale gas resources. These  regions represent diverse geography and geologic formations, as well as  different oil and gas and wastewater operations. We selected at least one  state in each of the six regions identified by the Energy Information  Administration. We also selected states that had higher numbers of class  II wells to ensure our sample represented significant class II activity. And  finally, we selected states that had both state and EPA-managed  programs. We spoke with state and EPA officials from programs in each  of the eight states, and we visited four of these states in person. During  these visits, we discussed program management and data collection and  reporting with state officials, and we reviewed a sample of state  inspection and violation files.", "To determine the roles and responsibilities of state class II programs, we  reviewed EPA regulations and guidance for the program. We also spoke  with officials from six of our eight selected states about their management  and reporting on the program, as well as EPA\u2019s oversight of the program.", "To understand the roles and responsibilities of EPA for EPA-managed  programs, we spoke with EPA headquarters and regional officials. To  evaluate funding for state and EPA-managed programs, we requested  class II program budget data for fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012  from the six states and two EPA regional offices that manage the class II  programs in the states we reviewed. We discussed budget data with state  officials to assess its reliability, and we determined that it was reliable for  our purpose of summarizing state program budgets. We also obtained  EPA UIC grant data for federal fiscal years 2008 through fiscal year 2012,  including grants provided to all UIC programs, and class II programs  specifically. We interviewed EPA officials about the data, and assessed  the data for any outliers or missing data, and determined that they were  reliable for the purpose of reporting on class II program funding. To  evaluate the resources that state programs have to administer the  program, we gathered state-reported budget data on the amount of  funding for the class II program supplied by the state, and compared it to  annual grant allocations from EPA to states. This enabled us to develop a  percentage of total class II funding that came from each state\u2019s grant  compared to the funding that came from the state budget. To show the  trend in funding over the last several years, we converted the EPA grant  data into real fiscal year 2013 dollars. To assess staffing resources for  both state and EPA-managed programs in the eight states we selected,  we interviewed state and EPA regional officials about their staffing levels  from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012.", "To analyze and compare the safeguards that EPA and selected states  have in place to ensure the protection of underground drinking water, we  reviewed the basic safeguards outlined in federal regulations, state  regulations, guidance, and related program documents in each of our  eight selected states. To better understand the basis and purpose for  regulations addressing safeguards, we reviewed a key EPA document,  the Statement of Basis and Purpose: Underground Injection Control  Regulations, and spoke with EPA officials. Based on EPA\u2019s Statement of  Basis and Purpose, we identified seven program safeguards required for  EPA-managed programs. To compare the safeguards in each state and  EPA-managed program in eight selected states, we developed a table for  each safeguard that categorized and compared the safeguards used by  the programs in each of the eight states. We identified state program  safeguards in state regulations, program guidance, and other documents.  Our review included a summary and comparison of the regulations and  guidance that establish state and EPA-managed program safeguards, but  we did not analyze the technical sufficiency of those safeguards.  Additionally, we gathered data from the states on inspections and alleged  contamination of underground sources of drinking water. We discussed  these data with state officials to assess their reliability for reporting, and in  some instances, used limited EPA data to corroborate the state-reported  data. We determined that these data were reliable to report for our  purposes of describing state program safeguards. To identify any  potential gaps in the safeguards in place, we obtained and analyzed EPA  reviews such as the Mid-Course Review and an EPA contracted report by  the technical and strategic consulting group, Cadmus. We also spoke  with EPA and state officials about potential weaknesses in the  safeguards, the effectiveness of the safeguards, and any issues that may  affect the protectiveness of the safeguards.", "To examine EPA\u2019s regulation and oversight of the class II program, we  focused on the regulation and oversight of programs in our eight selected  states: six state programs and two EPA-managed programs. To  understand EPA\u2019s regulation of the programs in the eight states, we  reviewed EPA\u2019s regulations for state programs. A key aspect of these  regulations is the need to incorporate state regulations and revisions to  these state regulations into federal regulations; this allows EPA to enforce  state programs, when appropriate. To assess the extent to which EPA  had accomplished the incorporation of state regulations into federal  regulations, we identified situations in which the states we reviewed had  updated or changed regulations and discussed the status of EPA\u2019s  approval and incorporation of these changes. We also reviewed EPA\u2019s  guidance and processes for requesting and approving aquifer  exemptions, and we requested documentation of exemptions from EPA  regions and headquarters. To understand EPA\u2019s oversight responsibilities  and evaluate the extent to which they are being carried out, we reviewed  EPA guidance outlining effective oversight of state programs. We spoke  with EPA headquarters and regional officials regarding how they  completed the actions outlined in the guidance. We also obtained and  reviewed the annual reports that EPA regions are to write for state  programs, Memoranda of Agreements between EPA and each state  program, and relevant grant reports from states.", "Finally, in order to examine the reliability of the data that EPA has on  class II programs, we interviewed EPA headquarters\u2019 officials about their  various data collection methods and reviewed related documentation and  guidance, as available. We identified three methods that EPA  headquarters uses to collect data on the UIC program, including the class  II program, and discussed the data collected by each method with EPA  officials. We determined that one source of data contained the information  we needed\u2014the state activity reporting forms (7520 forms) that each  state completes twice per year. We requested these forms from EPA for  fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012 and obtained all the forms that  EPA said it had. The forms were in paper format, which we saved and  transferred into an electronic database to analyze. To assess the  reliability of the data for our reporting purposes, we took steps to evaluate  the completeness and comparability of the data. To evaluate the  completeness of the data, we performed basic checks of the data  supplied by EPA to identify missing data. We found numerous missing  data that resulted from incomplete or missing forms and mislabeled  forms. We interviewed headquarters and regional EPA officials about this  data, and they said that they had provided all the forms available to them.  We also performed basic data checks on the consistency of the data  provided by discussing state data with officials in the states we visited.  We interviewed state officials about how they completed the 7520 forms  and what data they used to complete the forms, and we discussed their  understanding of the instructions on the 7520 form. From our evaluation  of the completeness and consistency of the data, we determined that the  7520 data were not sufficiently complete or consistent, and we decided  not to report the data, with two exceptions: we reported the number of  instances alleged contamination reported by each of the eight states we  reviewed because these data were solely descriptive, and we reported  data on significant violations reported by the eight states to show the  inconsistency in state reporting. In addition to discussing the 7520 data,  we spoke with state and regional officials about the national UIC  database and its development. We also reviewed documentation related  to the national UIC database in development, including its data dictionary  and business rules to example the progress and status of the database.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to June 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, intermediate casing can  be necessary to protect other underground resources such as coal beds  or gas storage zones. The deepest layer of casing, known as the long- string or production casing, isolates injected fluids into designated  formations. EPA also requires that each layer of casing be surrounded by  cement and suggests that specific equipment called tubing and packer be  used. Tubing is typically steel or plastic pipe inserted inside the  production casing, which isolates the casing from the fluid injected into  the well. Tubing set on a packer allows well operators to directly inject  fluids into formations and prevents corrosion by not allowing injected  fluids to contact the casing wall. A packer is a mechanical device that sits  below the tubing and locks into the casing wall, sealing the space  between the tubing and casing, called the annulus, from the injection  zone.
