USICH, VA, and HUD have jointly established  criteria and benchmarks to guide communities that are taking action  toward being certified as having ended veteran homelessness. USICH  stated that an end to homelessness does not mean that no one will ever  experience a housing crisis again, but that every community will have a  systematic response in place to prevent homelessness whenever  possible and ensure that homelessness is a rare, brief, and non-recurring  experience. VA, HUD, and USICH coordinate their efforts towards this  goal through a working group, Solving Veterans Homelessness as One,  which was established in 2012.", "We identified 16 federal programs that target services specifically to  veterans who are homeless or are at risk of becoming homeless. As  shown in table 1, the programs provide permanent and transitional  housing, health care, employment assistance, and supportive services,  such as assistance with rent, utilities, and moving costs. Twelve of the  programs are administered solely by VA, two are jointly administered by  HUD and VA, and two are administered by DOL. VA\u2019s and HUD\u2019s  homelessness programs follow the principles of \u201cHousing First,\u201d which is  intended to provide housing without any preconditions and barriers to  entry such as sobriety, treatment, or service participation requirements.", "The largest of these programs were HUD-VASH, GPD, and SSVF.

Housing vouchers are  administered to homeless veterans by PHAs, which are HUD-funded  city, county, and state agencies.", "VAMCs, service providers, and PHAs may coordinate through  Continuums of Care (CoC), which are composed of stakeholders in a  geographical area that, among other things, coordinate to provide  homeless services, apply for grants, set local priorities, and collect  homelessness data for all homeless populations. Each year, HUD  awards CoC program funding competitively to nonprofit organizations,  states, and other local recipients. The CoC is responsible for its operation  and developing and implementing its plan and strategies to prevent and  end homelessness. Additionally, the CoC must choose an entity to  operate the local information system used to collect client-level data and  data on the provision of housing and services to homeless individuals and  families and those at risk of homelessness (referred to as the Homeless  Management Information System). The CoC also designates an entity  that prepares and submits the CoC program application for HUD funding  (referred to as the collaborative applicant).", "HUD requires each CoC to establish and operate a centralized or  coordinated assessment system (referred to as Coordinated Entry).

For example:", "Substance use and mental illness. Substance use disorders and  mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  and depression, are among the most complex issues many homeless  veterans face, according to USICH. In 2018, USICH reported that 28  percent of homeless veterans that receive VA-provided health care  have been diagnosed with depression. Thirteen percent have been  diagnosed with PTSD. Further, 19 percent struggle with alcohol abuse  and 20 percent with drug abuse. VAMC staff and service providers  told us that addressing the complex nature of these conditions is often  a challenge for them. For example, one SSVF provider told us that it  is challenging to find housing for veterans with mental health or  substance use disorders; further, HVCES staff at one VAMC told us  that employment programs for the general population may not be  suitable for clients with these disorders. HUD-VASH staff at one  VAMC told us that there are not enough mental health providers in the  VA system. Overall, staff from three VAMCs from the GPD and  HVCES programs, five GPD service providers, and three SSVF  service providers cited challenges related to substance use and  mental illness.", "Aging homeless veterans. In 2018, USICH reported that the number  of homeless veterans who were 62 and older increased by 54.3  percent between 2009 and 2016. VA officials told us that this trend  is expected to continue and that this population has increased, in part,  because the services that VA offers are not targeted to aging  veterans. According to VA officials, there is a similar aging trend in the  general veteran population. HUD-VASH staff at three VAMCs,  HVCES staff at one VAMC, and GPD staff at two VAMCs told us that  aging veterans require a higher level of care than what existing  programs may be able to fully address. Some of these veterans may  suffer from ambulatory and cognitive issues and have difficulties living  alone but cannot afford an assisted living arrangement.", "HUD-VASH staff at one VAMC we visited told us the VAMC was able to  hire five occupational therapists to assist aging clients with their  specialized needs. Further, VA officials told us that HUD-VASH is  collaborating with VA\u2019s Geriatrics and Extended Care programs office to  explore how aging homeless veterans can be served through other  programs, such as the Medical Foster Home and Community Residential  Care programs. This collaboration would allow VA to provide funding for  services while the HUD-VASH voucher would pay for housing costs. VA  officials also told us that they are working to market HUD-VASH to  developers and funders to increase the development of project-based  HUD-VASH housing. This would give the program a dedicated housing  stock and better serve subpopulations of veterans, such as veterans who  are elderly or suffer from mental illness.", "Resistance to program participation. According to HCHV staff at  two VAMCs, HVCES staff at three VAMCs, two PHAs that administer  the HUD-VASH voucher program, and five service providers (two  GPD, two HVRP, and one SSVF), a key challenge in addressing the  needs of homeless veterans is their resistance to participating in a  program, particularly if it places restrictions or requirements on them.  This issue makes it challenging for outreach and treatment teams to  deliver services.", "In addition to the challenges cited above, veterans must meet certain  eligibility requirements to participate in homeless assistance programs  which if not met can present challenges to VAMC staff and service  providers when providing veterans with services. For example, veterans  must meet certain criminal history requirements to be eligible for HUD- VASH. HVCES staff from one VAMC, DCHV staff from two VAMCs,  HUD-VASH staff from another VAMC, and three service providers (one  GPD and two SSVF) also told us that it is challenging to find housing and  employment for homeless veterans with legal or criminal problems and  landlords may be resistant to working with them.", "One PHA that works with HUD-VASH and one SSVF service provider told  us that a veteran\u2019s ineligibility for VA health care services also presents a  challenge to them. This is because a number of VA homeless programs  require a veteran to be eligible for VA health care benefits as a condition  to enrollment. Generally, veterans are eligible to receive VA health care  benefits if they served in the active military, naval, or air service and were  discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Therefore,  according to VA officials, veterans with dishonorable discharges cannot  access VA homeless assistance programs and veterans with other-than- honorable discharges may have limited access to them.", "In addition to meeting the discharge status requirement, a person must  also meet the definition of \u201cveteran\u201d to be eligible for VA health services.  However, the definition of \u201cveteran\u201d depends on factors including length of  service and if the individual served on active duty or was part of the  National Guard or the Reserves. Therefore, even if an individual has the  appropriate discharge status to be eligible, they may not meet other  eligibility requirements for VA health benefits. One service provider told  us that they have to work on alternative solutions to help veterans that do  not meet eligibility requirements.", "In 2017, VA in partnership with HUD implemented a flexibility within the  HUD-VASH program\u2014the HUD-VASH Continuum\u2014which according to  VA officials, will permit PHAs to make up to 15 percent of their total HUD- VASH allocation available to veterans who are ineligible for VA health  care services, with some exceptions. According to VA officials, this  expands the availability of permanent supportive housing to service  members who are not eligible for VA health care. In addition, the House  and Senate are considering bills to expand HUD-VASH eligibility. DOL  has also implemented statutory changes to HVRP eligibility requirements  to provide veterans with better access to job training programs. The  program\u2019s eligibility requirements have been broadened to include  veterans participating in the HUD-VASH, Tribal HUD-VASH, and SSVF  programs, and other veterans that were not previously eligible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Broader Challenges, Such as Limited VA Staffing and Affordable Housing, Affected Assistance, According to VA and Service Providers", "paragraphs": ["VAMC staff and services providers cited broader challenges\u2014not specific  to veterans or the assistance programs themselves\u2014as impacting their  ability to provide assistance to homeless veterans. Those challenges  include VA staffing issues and external factors, such as the lack of  affordable housing and limited transportation options.", "VA staffing shortages. VA officials, HVCES staff at three VAMCs,  and HUD-VASH and DCHV staff at two VAMCs told us they faced  difficulties with recruitment and retention, which have led to persistent  understaffing. For example, staff at four VAMCs for the HUD-VASH,  DCHV, and HVCES programs told us that the hiring and onboarding  process can often take a long time, and by the time an offer is  finalized, qualified applicants have moved on to other jobs. DCHV  staff at two VAMCs and HUD-VASH staff at three VAMCs cited  understaffed human resources offices and a taxing approval process  as contributing factors. HUD-VASH staff from one VAMC told us that it  is difficult to fill some positions because the outreach work requires  extensive travel within large geographic areas. Further, they told us  that in high-cost areas, the VA\u2019s local pay scale is not high enough to  attract new recruits for case manager positions. HUD-VASH staff at  one VAMC indicated that they have not been fully staffed for several  years.", "Limited staffing may limit the number of veterans who can be served,  according to VA officials. For example, DCHV program staff at one  VAMC told us that they had to close 83 beds because there is not  enough staff to keep them operational. One PHA working with the  HUD-VASH program told us that VA\u2019s staffing challenges create a  bottleneck of services to clients while staff at one VAMC working with  SSVF told us that high turnover of program staff is disruptive for  clients. Overall, staffing shortages were cited as a challenge by VAMC  staff for several programs: HUD-VASH, DCHV, HCHV, GPD, and  HVCES.", "VAMC staff we interviewed have taken some steps to limit the impact  of staffing issues. For example, at one VAMC, staff from the HCHV  and GPD programs have conducted cross-training so they can back  each other up when staffing shortages occur. Two other VAMCs have  brought in staff from other locations to help with the workload or have  developed an action plan to address employee burnout.", "Our past work has highlighted VA\u2019s staffing challenges, including  recruiting and retaining clinical staff. For example, we previously  reported that difficulties in recruiting and retaining skilled health care  providers and human resource staff at VAMCs make it difficult to meet  the health care needs of more than 9 million veterans. We have also  previously reported that, in addition to high attrition and increased  workload, human capital shortfalls can lead to burnout among the staff  whose job it is to implement these programs.", "Housing cost and availability. Limited and high cost housing  exacerbate the other challenges VAMC staff and service providers  identified. For example, HUD-VASH staff at one VAMC told us that  even with subsidies, it is difficult for veterans to obtain housing  because HUD-VASH vouchers may not be sufficient to cover rent.  HUD-VASH staff from one VAMC and one PHA we interviewed told  us that because housing costs are rising, and housing in metro areas  remains limited, expensive, and competitive, veterans have fewer  housing options available to them. Limited housing was cited as a  challenge by VAMC staff and service providers for HUD-VASH and  SSVF programs in all types of locations\u2014urban, suburban, and rural  areas.", "Finding and recruiting landlords is a significant challenge in getting  veterans housed, according to HUD officials, HCHV staff at one VAMC,  HUD-VASH staff from two VAMCs, two PHAs, and five SSVF service  providers. According to HUD-VASH staff from one VAMC and SSVF staff  from another VAMC, the demand for housing exceeds supply and  landlords have few incentives to accept homeless veterans. HUD-VASH  staff from one VAMC, one PHA, and one SSVF service provider also told  us that some landlords perceive veterans to be risky because some have  criminal records or substance use disorders, and may be reticent to work  with them out of fear of incurring damages to their property.", "Some service providers have taken steps to create incentives for  landlords to participate in VA\u2019s programs. For example, HUD-VASH staff  at one VAMC told us that local providers may partner to cover moving  fees for veterans and encourage landlords to accept veterans\u2019 housing  vouchers. One PHA has put together landlord forums and is working to  build relationships with landlords in their communities. Another PHA has  held housing tours and fairs to bring landlords and clients together.", "VA has also implemented program changes to help address the lack of  affordable housing. For example, the new Shallow Subsidies initiative that  became effective in September 2019, allows SSVF service providers to  provide very low-income veteran families a rental subsidy for a two-year  period without requiring recertification. The two-year period ensures no  reduction in subsidy even if a recipient\u2019s income situation improves within  that time frame and the family is no longer considered very low income.  This provides a strong incentive for employment gains because the  assistance is not dependent on income during this two-year period.", "Launched in 2018, VA\u2019s Rapid Resolution initiative is another solution that  is designed to prevent or resolve homelessness by providing immediate  assistance when a veteran enters an emergency shelter system\u2014such as  by offering landlord mediation and conflict resolution, or connecting the  veterans to support networks in other places. According to VA officials,  Rapid Resolution is being implemented through VA\u2019s SSVF program, in  coordination with HUD and USICH.", "Limited resources (other than staffing). HUD-VASH staff at one  VAMC told us they are short on equipment like laptops, office  supplies, and office space. Additionally, HUD-VASH staff at another  VAMC told us they do not have access to government cars for work- related travel. One HVRP service provider told us that case managers  do not have enough vehicles to travel long distances or to remote  locations to meet clients. To make up for shortages in resources, one  SSVF service provider told us that it develops partnerships with local  programs to meet the needs of the client. HUD-VASH staff at one  VAMC indicated that they have communicated issues of insufficient  resources to their leadership, but the issues have not been addressed  to date. Resource limitations were cited as a challenge by HUD-VASH  staff from two VAMCs, GPD staff from three VAMCs, DCHV staff at  two VAMCs, HCHV staff at two VAMCs, and four service providers  (two GPD and two HVRP).", "Transportation limitations. According to VAMC staff and service  providers, the lack of transportation for veterans is a significant  challenge for some programs. For example, according to DCHV and  HVCES staff at one VAMC, HUD-VASH staff at another VAMC, and  one GPD and two HVRP service providers, some veterans may not  have vehicles or may live in areas with limited public transportation  systems. This makes it difficult for the veterans to access resources,  go to job interviews, or secure transportation for jobs. Some service  providers told us they make alternative arrangements for their clients  to help address these issues. For example, one HVRP service  provider told us they might drive veterans to interviews or arrange for  public transportation. DCHV staff at one VAMC and HVCES staff at  another VAMC told us that they work with community partners to  provide alternatives like shuttle services and bus passes.", "Additional challenges related to specific programs we reviewed are  discussed in appendix II."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Homeless Assistance Programs for Veterans Overlap in Services, but Address Different Needs Overlap Exists Among Some Program Services for Homeless Veterans", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the services provided, eligibility requirements, and  population served by the 16 programs that exclusively target homeless  veterans to identify duplication and overlap.

However, we also found these programs differed in meaningful ways, for  example in terms of the different types of homeless veterans served or  specialized services or focus. As we have previously reported,  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication exists across the government,  which can present benefits and challenges. Duplication occurs when  two or more programs provide the same services to the same  beneficiaries.

Six programs conduct outreach: HCHV, HVRP,  SSVF, CRRCs, VJO, and HCRV.", "Referrals are the most common way for homeless veterans to find  out about program services available to them. Referral services  include conducting an assessment of the clients\u2019 needs, connecting  them to the appropriate programs, and following up with the clients as  well as documenting all referral activities. Six programs provide  referral services: HVRP, SSVF, CRRCs, NCCHV, HCRV, and Stand  Down.", "Employment services include help with creating job opportunities for  veterans, job searches, interviewing, and other employment  assistance.

Three programs offer rental  subsidies: HUD-VASH, Tribal HUD-VASH, and SSVF.", "Although we identified overlap in these services across 15 of the 16  programs, the programs differ in meaningful ways. Specifically, some of  these programs serve specific subpopulations of veterans and some  provide a specialized service that other programs do not offer. For  example, of the 11 programs that offer case management services, one  program provides medical care (H-PACT), while others provide services  in different areas such as transitional housing (GPD), housing subsidies  (HUD-VASH), supportive services (SSVF), preparing veterans for  employment (HVRP) and outreach (HCHV). Other programs that offer  case management services serve unique subpopulations of homeless  veterans such as those with mental health or substance use issues  (CWT-TR and DCHV), American Indians and Alaskan Natives living in or  near reservations or other Indian areas (Tribal HUD-VASH), or justice-  involved veterans in local jails (VJO) and state and federal prisons  (HCRV). According to a VA directive, more than one case manager may  be involved in care planning and service delivery for veterans with  complex needs. In addition, staff at the six VAMC locations we visited  told us that clients may be co-enrolled in more than one program and can  receive case management services from each of those programs. Figure  3 illustrates how case management may overlap across programs, but  each program provides distinct services to the veteran.", "Similarly, of the three programs that provide employment services,  HVCES focuses on establishing partnerships with employers to develop  job opportunities for veterans and connect them with community services,  while HVRP helps the veteran prepare to pursue and gain meaningful  employment. The CWT-TR program, on the other hand, focuses on  veterans with more complex issues such as substance use, mental health  issues, and challenges in obtaining or sustaining employment that may  accompany these conditions. Similar meaningful distinctions in  subpopulations of beneficiaries and services exist across the programs  that provide other types of services to homeless veterans that overlap\u2014 supportive services, outreach, referrals, and rental subsidies.

For example, according to VA officials, overlap  may result in operational costs if the overlapping services are not  coordinated well. Table 2 describes some of the potential benefits and  challenges of overlap in services for homeless veterans, as identified by  agency officials, VAMC staff, and others we interviewed. Effective  collaboration among agencies and service providers can help address  some of these potential challenges and may help avoid the potential  inefficiency that overlapping services may create.", "VAMC staff and service providers told us that they have taken steps to  limit duplication where appropriate.

We also interviewed officials from the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), Department of Labor (DOL), and the U.S.  Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). Additionally, we  conducted semi-structured interviews with staff from local VA medical  centers (VAMCs) and service providers implementing the selected  programs we reviewed; public housing agencies (PHAs) that administer  HUD-VASH vouchers; and Continuum of Care (CoC) entities across  different locations. Specifically, we interviewed staff from six VAMCs  (staff for the HUD-VASH, GPD, SSVF, HCHV, HVCES, and DCHV  programs); six CoC entities; six PHAs; and 23 service providers (eight  GPD providers, seven SSVF providers, two HVRP providers, two  providers that were HVRP, SSVF, and GPD grantees, two providers that  were HVRP and GPD grantees, and two providers that were HVRP and  SSVF grantees). The results of these interviews are not generalizable.  The locations where we conducted these interviews were: Atlanta,  Georgia; Kansas City, Missouri; Long Island, New York; Los Angeles,  California; Helena, Bozeman, Fort Harrison, and Box Elder, Montana; and  Seattle, Washington. We judgmentally selected this sample of sites based  on several factors. To select those locations, we started with the 67  communities that were designated as Priority 1 communities by VA in  2015. We then judgmentally selected six of those communities based on  the following factors: (1) to reflect a mix of communities with high  concentrations of homeless veterans and communities certified as having  ended veteran homelessness; (2) to reflect geographic diversity (a mix of  urban, suburban, and rural locations); (3) proximity of CoCs and VAMCs  (to ensure we could interview both local VAMC staff and service  providers); and (4) the presence of our selected programs (to cover as  many programs as possible).", "To identify challenges agencies and service providers reported  experiencing in implementing selected programs, we interviewed agency  officials, VAMCs, service providers, and PHAs. Specifically, we first asked  them a general question about what challenges they face. We then  analyzed their responses to develop a list of challenges. A second analyst  then verified the steps taken to develop the list of challenges. We also  reviewed agency reports, program documentation, and available  information on trends on homeless veterans and the general homeless  population.", "To determine the extent of duplication or overlap across programs, we  reviewed agency guidance, program descriptions, and other  documentation to obtain information on program services and  beneficiaries for the 16 veteran homelessness programs we identified,  using the process we described above. We then applied GAO guidance  on duplication and overlap by comparing the programs using the following  definitions: duplication occurs when two or more programs provide the  same services to the same beneficiaries; overlap occurs when two or  more programs offer similar services to similar beneficiaries. To identify  potential benefits and challenges of overlap, we reviewed past GAO  reports, and conducted interviews, as outlined above.", "To assess how federal agencies collaborate to address veteran  homelessness, we first identified two collaborative mechanisms\u2014the  Solving Veterans  Homeless as One (SVHO) working group and VA\u2019s  integration into Coordinated Entry\u2014by reviewing agency reports,  guidance, and other documentation and interviewing agency officials.  We then assessed the collaborative efforts against leading interagency  collaboration practices identified in prior GAO work. Specifically, we  assessed the extent to which the SVHO working group and VA integration  into Coordinated Entry used each leading practice using three categories.  \u201cFully follows\u201d indicates that actions related to a practice reflected most or  all of the issues to consider related to the practice; \u201cpartially follows\u201d  indicates that actions related to a practice reflect some, but not all, the  issues to consider related to the practice; and \u201cdoes not follow\u201d indicates  that there have been no actions taken related to the issues to consider for  the practice. One analyst reviewed the reports, guidance, and other  agency documentation related to the collaborative efforts and made the  initial assessment. A second analyst then reviewed this information to make their own determination about the assessment and reach  consensus with the first analyst.", "To determine what is known about the performance of the selected  programs we reviewed, we analyzed national performance data for fiscal  years 2015 to 2019 from VA and DOL. To assess the reliability of those  data, we reviewed the data for obvious errors or inaccuracies by  comparing the data to publicly available data from VA\u2019s and DOL\u2019s annual  performance reports (to the extent the data were published). We also  interviewed VA and DOL officials with knowledge of the systems and  methods used to produce these data. We determined that the data we  included in the report were sufficiently reliable for purposes of describing  program performance for the selected programs we reviewed.", "To assess if the performance measures the agencies used are effective  in monitoring progress, we reviewed VA\u2019s and DOL\u2019s performance  measurement guidance. We then compared the measures against  selected leading practices we identified in past GAO work. Specifically,  our prior work identified ten key attributes for successful performance  measures. Measures that include these attributes are effective in  monitoring progress and determining how well programs are achieving  their goals. We selected six attributes relevant to our analysis. We  excluded the remaining four attributes because they are used to assess  agency-wide performance and therefore were not applicable to our  program-specific analysis. We assessed the performance measures as  \u201cfully reflects\u201d if all the performance measures for the selected programs  reflected most or all of the definition of the relevant key attribute; \u201cpartially  reflects\u201d if the measures reflected some, but not all, of the definition of the  relevant key attribute; and \u201cdoes not reflect\u201d if the measures did not reflect  the definition of the relevant key attribute.

Each  model targets a different population of homeless veterans or focuses on  different areas of service.", "Some VA medical centers (VAMCs), service providers, and public  housing agencies (PHAs) we interviewed told us the homelessness  programs for veterans we reviewed are working well. Others identified  additional challenges that were specific to individual selected programs  we reviewed, in particular the GPD program that underwent recent  changes. For example, with respect to GPD\u2019s new models, four service  providers and staff from three VAMCs told us that the housing models  and program guidelines are too restrictive and complex, which hinder the  delivery of services. Staff from another VAMC told us that the new  housing models are based on best practices but the implementation is  challenging. For example, one of these models, Bridge Housing,  generally limits the length of stay to 90 days which GPD staff from one  VAMC and one provider told us is not enough time to meet the needs of  some clients. However, VA officials said that veterans are not asked to  leave Bridge Housing after 90 days if the housing plan has not been  executed by this time. According to VA officials, GPD grantees can  provide transitional housing and services to family members of a veteran,  however, the program can only pay per diem for veterans, not their  families. In addition, two GPD service providers told us that the bed  reimbursement rate is inadequate to cover the cost of providing services  to veterans, and GPD staff at one VAMC told us that the existing funding  does not cover the full cost of the program. Despite these cited  challenges, our review of national performance data shows that VA is  generally meeting the performance targets for these six models. Finally,  GPD staff at one VAMC told us that there is a shortage of shelters and  beds in some areas, and as a result, they cannot accommodate all the  homeless veterans that are referred to them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Allison Abrams (Assistant  Director), Erika Navarro (Analyst in Charge), Kimberly Bohnet, Emily  Bond, Evelyn Calderon, Lilia Chaidez, Jill Lacey, and Jessica Sandler  made key contributions to this report.
