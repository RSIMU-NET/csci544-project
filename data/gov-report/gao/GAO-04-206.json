DISA does not acquire commercial bandwidth directly from satellite service providers. Instead, it procures bandwidth through several competitively selected vendors, which, in turn, compete work among individual service providers. GAO found that the process for acquiring commercial satellite bandwidth is fair to DOD's vendors and their subcontractors, which are the ultimate commercial satellite bandwidth service providers. However, some major DOD users of commercial satellite bandwidth services are dissatisfied with DISA's process. They view the process as being too lengthy, particularly for time-critical military operations, and they believe that the cost is too high. They also indicated that the contracts resulting from the process are often too inflexible. As a result, some users are bypassing the DISA process, either by formally obtaining a waiver or by procuring services without a waiver. In fiscal year 2002, nearly 20 percent of DOD's reported spending on satellite bandwidth services occurred outside the process, and one DOD official stated that the true percentage is probably much higher. By allowing users to bypass the DISA waiver process, DOD is hampering its ability to ensure that its communications networks are interoperable and to minimize redundancies. Further, DOD does not know exactly how much it is spending on commercial satellite bandwidth services, nor does it know much about its service providers or whether customer needs are really being satisfied. Without this knowledge, DOD cannot take steps to leverage its buying power, even though it is the largest customer for commercial satellite bandwidth. Moreover, neither DOD nor DISA is making a concerted effort to collect forecasts of bandwidth needs from users and ensure those needs can be met by the commercial sector. These are also important steps toward optimizing DOD's spending. If DISA is to remain as DOD's primary agent to acquire satellite bandwidth, then it must implement a more strategic management approach--one that ensures that services can be acquired in a fair, timely, and cost-effective way that meets users' needs. Doing so will be a considerable challenge, however, given the current environment and potential resistance within DISA and from its users. Commitment is needed from senior leaders within DISA and DOD to overcome challenges associated with implementing a strategic approach."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on a vast network of ground and  space-based systems to meet its telecommunications needs\u2014both for  military and business operations.

Currently,  DOD-owned and -operated satellites cannot satisfy all of DOD\u2019s  telecommunication requirements, and both DOD and other sources project  sizeable shortfalls in bandwidth capacity needed by the year 2010.

DISA does not acquire commercial bandwidth directly from  satellite service providers. Instead it procures bandwidth through several  competitively selected vendors, which in turn compete work among  individual bandwidth service providers.", "There are two primary contract structures through which DISA procures  bandwidth through these vendors. The first is known as the Managed  Transponder Contract (MTC). It was competitively awarded in 1995 to  one vendor, and served as the primary acquisition vehicle for several  years. The second is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ)  multiple-award contract structure known as the Defense Information  Systems Network Satellite Transmission Services-Global (DSTS-G)  contracts. They were awarded competitively in February 2001, after users  found the MTC contract to be inflexible, too costly, and limited in terms of  the breadth of services it could provide. Awards were made to three small  business vendors that acquire bandwidth for DISA from the ultimate  service providers. Recently, DISA has been relying more on this second  contract structure. The agency placed 48 orders for bandwidth under the  DSTS-G contracts through June 2003 versus only 5 new orders under the  MTC contract from March 2000 through June 2003.", "DISA\u2019s vendors obtain satellite services from a commercial satellite  industry market segment that has been growing at a high rate. The  commercial satellite industry is a global industry that includes many  foreign-owned businesses as well as partnerships between U.S. and  foreign corporations. Table 1 lists major global and regional satellite  bandwidth providers. While there are 10 companies listed, only 6 of them  have provided needed bandwidth through the DISA acquisition process  during recent years.", "The acquisition process that DISA uses to determine user requirements  and acquire bandwidth is similar to the process it uses to acquire other  telecommunications services for its customers. Generally, the process  begins with users identifying a need and contacting DISA to fulfill that  need. Technical experts within DISA assist users in engineering a potential  solution. Other offices within DISA decide how the service should be  procured and prepare a request for the vendors to propose solutions. Once  DISA has determined which contract structure to use and has asked for  proposed solutions, an evaluation team within DISA reviews the proposals  and awards a task order or delivery order under the winning vendor\u2019s  contract. Figure 1 and table 2 further detail this process.", "If circumstances dictate, users can request a waiver through DOD\u2019s  Global Information Grid (GIG) Waiver Panel to use an alternative  network and alternative acquisition process instead of the DISA process.  A business case must be made for the requested waiver and there must  be plans outlined to migrate the outlying network back under the  telecommunications infrastructure and to bring the resulting contract  under the control of DITCO.

Only five orders have been placed under the MTC  contract, which by its nature is not as competitive as the DSTS-G contract,  since it was designed to obtain service through one vendor.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented by DOD and  DISA, requires DITCO to provide a fair opportunity to the three DSTS-G  vendors at the prime contract level. Generally, this entails    writing broad, needs-based requirements able to be satisfied by multiple  vendors rather than only one;    providing notice and opportunity to be considered to each of the vendors;    giving notice of the evaluation criteria to be used to select a winning    evaluating proposals, conducting discussions, and awarding delivery  orders or task orders in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated.", "We analyzed 48 task orders that were awarded under the DSTS-G contract  from its inception in February 2001 through June 2003 to determine  whether these criteria were generally followed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DSTS-G Vendors Had Fair Opportunity to Win Task Orders", "paragraphs": ["We found that the acquisition process employed by DISA and DITCO  generally met FAR criteria, as supplemented, and was fair to competing  vendors under the DSTS-G contracts.

While a few valid user situations demanded a  repeat solution or narrowed the range of possible solutions, they did not  unduly impair the vendors\u2019 fair opportunity to compete.", "Of the 48 task orders for bandwidth, 41 were competed among the  three vendors; six were renewals of previously competed task orders;  and only one was sole-source, awarded without vendor competition.

Evaluation of the proposals,  discussions, and the award of task orders complied with the stated  evaluation and selection criteria.", "DISA used the following two selection frameworks to evaluate proposals:    DISA awarded 18 of the 41 competitive task orders worth $54,255,114  under a source selection process called \u201cbest value,\u201d using a cost/technical  trade-off process. Under this approach, the selection official trades off  cost and non-cost factors, identified in the inquiry, in determining award  decisions. In some cases, greater weight may be placed on a contractor\u2019s  technical approach resulting in the selection of what may not be the  lowest priced proposal.", "DISA awarded the remaining 23 competitive task orders worth $78,645,239  under the \u201clowest price technically acceptable\u201d framework. Under this  approach, the technical solution proposals are all evaluated by DISA\u2019s  Commercial Satellite Communications Branch and its supporting  contractor and placed in either a \u201ctechnically sufficient\u201d category or \u201cnot  technically sufficient\u201d category. The winner is that proposal in the  \u201ctechnically sufficient\u201d category with the lowest total evaluated cost.", "While both evaluation methods are common under FAR procurements,  best value with tradeoffs is more suitable where the risk of potential  substandard performance does not leave room for errors or service  degradation. Either method of evaluation requires a high level of technical  expertise to effectively evaluate proposed solutions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DSTS-G Subcontractors Have Also Had Ample and Fair Chances to Team with Vendors", "paragraphs": ["At the subcontract level where the FAR criteria regarding fair opportunity  generally do not apply to the business arrangements among commercial  companies, we also found that commercial satellite service providers have  had ample and fair chances to team with the three DSTS-G vendors to  create solutions and to compete for and win subcontracts. All three  vendors stated that they are motivated by competition to find technically  sufficient and low-cost solutions to DOD\u2019s needs and to involve all feasible  service providers in doing so. Further, the vendors are also required by a  FAR clause in their DISA contracts to select their subcontractors on a  competitive basis. To determine which service providers are potentially  capable of fulfilling a given DISA requirement, the vendors told us they  consider many factors, such as  location of satellites,  \u201clook angle\u201d at the desired location,    power,    bandwidth,    age and condition of satellites,    available capacity on satellites, and    other factors, such as meeting schedule, acceptance of government terms  and conditions, business relationships, and prices.", "Our analysis showed that six different service providers have won  subcontracts from one or more of the DSTS-G vendors. Each vendor has  won task orders using at least four of the six providers, although more  than 70 percent of the wins have been with just two providers. The  distribution of task order awards to vendors and the service providers  with which they teamed for each of the 48 task orders is illustrated in  table 4.", "Another indicator of participation among service providers and access to  the DSTS-G vendors is the opportunity to propose a solution for a DISA  requirement. We determined that there were 211 bandwidth solutions  proposed to DISA for the 48 task orders, or approximately 4.4 per task  order. Removing the seven instances where there was only one proposed  solution (because they were renewals of previously competed  requirements or sole-source), the average number of proposed solutions  per competitive task order was 4.9, with a range from 2 to 15. Moreover,  there were several additional potential teaming proposals considered by at  least one of the vendors, but not ultimately submitted to DISA. Table 5  illustrates the teaming arrangements in the 211 proposed solutions.", "We noted that the top two service providers in terms of proposals  submitted, labeled B and C in table 5, had more than 70 percent of the total  proposals submitted. According to the vendors, this was because those  two providers had large numbers of satellites located in the areas of  interest to DOD over the past 2 years, were willing to offer multiple  solutions, and had low prices for bandwidth. Some service providers did  not always see DOD as a preferred customer, did not always have  available capacity in the required areas, or declined to propose because  they knew they did not have the best coverage or prices. All six of the  service providers that won subcontracts had very similar percentages of  winning proposals, all between 21 and 28 percent.", "Despite the involvement of a number of competitors at the subcontractor  level in the DISA acquisition process, we found several occasions where  DISA directed and justified the use of a specific service provider. This  occurred in 15 of the 41 competitive DSTS-G task orders. In all 15 of those  cases, however, the acquisition team had adequate justifications in files to  explain the need for directing that subcontract. Specifically, in 11 of the  justifications, users or DISA technical staff determined that only one  particular satellite could adequately satisfy certain technical parameters  contained in the requirement. In three cases, customers explained that any  deviation from the existing satellite provider could cause an interruption  of service and could potentially cause loss of life. In the remaining case,  both justifications applied. These requirements were submitted by  responsible officials in the combatant commands or military services and  concurred in by the DISA provisioners, the DISA Commercial Satellite  Communications Branch engineers, and the DITCO contracting officer.

From March 2000 to June 2003, DISA awarded only five  new delivery orders for bandwidth under the MTC contract. All were  awarded directly to the incumbent contractor that had previously won a  competition among four companies in 1995 to manage this contract for  up to 10 years. These five new orders totaled $17.8 million. There was also  limited competition at the subcontract level. Three orders were awarded  directly to service providers without competition.

Our analysis showed  that on average from submittal of a request for service to the award of a  task order under the DSTS-G contract took 79 days\u2014more than a month  longer than the average of 42 to 45 days advertised by DISA. Moreover, as  table 6 shows, only 18 of the 48 task orders we reviewed were awarded in  less than a month. In addition, only 29 were awarded within the DISA  advertised time frame of 45 days.", "Further, users told us they have to spend additional time before a Request  for Service is submitted to DISA to seek out and determine all of the  technical information required in that document, and there is also  additional time between the task order award and the subcontract award  to the winning service provider and for the set up or preparation before  the start of the service. For example, under the DSTS-G contracts, the  vendors have up to 30 days to provide required service in normal  circumstances, or 5 days in emergencies. According to DISA, when users  are not familiar with RFS development or satellite services, DISA spends  substantial amounts of time educating users on requirement development,  the acquisition process, and available satellite services. Timelines can also  be extended for other reasons, according to DISA, including instances  where customer equipment is not on hand when the service is available.  Therefore, the actual time to fully satisfy a customer\u2019s request from  realization of the need to initiation of the service is even longer than the  mean 79-day paperwork flow time.", "By contrast, users told us that the time to receive bandwidth services  outside the DISA process was considerably shorter. In one U. S. Army  example, the user was able to acquire satellite bandwidth needed to  operate a multimedia communications system during Operation  Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan within a few weeks. In another  example, a U.S. Navy office was able to acquire service to support its  commercial wideband satellite program in less than a month after  receiving the GIG waiver approval. It was critical that the Navy acquire  this service quickly as it was notified that one of its leased satellites would  fail within 30 days.", "Users also reported that estimated prices they received under the DISA  process were sometimes significantly higher than those that would be  paid directly to a commercial company for the same or similar services.  For example, the Army was able to acquire satellite services for the  communications system supporting Operation Enduring Freedom for  about $34,700 a month. DISA had quoted a price estimate earlier at  $139,000 a month. When the Army later found it needed to install another  ground terminal for this system, it acquired services for about $240,000,  whereas DISA\u2019s initial price estimate was $579,000. In another example, in  acquiring service to support its commercial wideband satellite program, a  U.S. Navy office found that the monthly price for the service it could  acquire outside the DISA process ranged from $30,000 to $90,000 a month  less than the initial DISA estimate. Over the 5 years projected for the task  order, the savings on bandwidth was nearly $4.6 million. These projected  savings, while not always calculated on a strict \u201capples-to-apples\u201d basis,  were nevertheless deemed significant enough that the GIG Waiver Panel  used them when deciding to grant waivers to these organizations to buy  outside the DISA process.", "The current pricing structure of the DISA acquisition process can result in  users being charged from 9 to 12 percent more than the bandwidth cost  from the service provider. Part of this added cost is due to profit and  overhead charges that DISA vendors add on to bandwidth cost. This can  total between 1 and 4 percent of the price of the service and is kept low  because of the competition among vendors to win each task order.", "Another part of the added costs is attributable to surcharges that DISA  adds to prices in order to recoup their costs for tasks they perform in  acquiring the service. The surcharges\u20146 percent of the total price from  the vendor for DISA\u2019s Commercial Satellite Communications Branch\u2019s  efforts and another 2 percent for DITCO\u2019s efforts\u2014are a normal practice  for DISA and other DOD activities that operate under the Defense Working  Capital Fund, which is designed to ensure that defense activities that carry  out business operations for others can recover their costs\u2014neither  making a profit nor incurring a loss in the course of their work. If  users acquired the service themselves, they may well incur similar  administrative costs, but those costs would not be as visible to them as  when receiving an itemized bill from DISA for services. However, they  would not normally have to pay extra for an intermediary agent when  procuring services directly from industry.", "Some portion of the user-reported projected savings may be attributable  to high initial estimates provided by DISA based on outdated pricing  proposals of vendors\u2019 contract line item prices. While DISA stated that  users were advised that the actual prices might be significantly lower,  users still had to commit their budget in the amount of the original  estimate. Use of this high initial estimate has been a long-standing flaw in  the DISA acquisition process that DISA has only recently taken steps to  correct. However, DISA\u2019s solution to this problem\u2014asking the vendors to  produce more detailed and more realistic original price estimates\u2014will  likely result in more days added to an already lengthy process.", "Another reason for the difference between DISA\u2019s estimates and industry  quotes may be that DISA\u2019s estimates are based on features in its contracts  with vendors that may call for a different level of services or equipment  than required. For example, in one U.S. Army case, the bandwidth  acquired to operate its communications network was less than the  minimum bandwidth capacity that satellite providers were required to  provide under the DSTS-G contract.", "In addition, users told us that the DISA process results in contract terms  that are often too inflexible. Some of the features that are common in  commercial contracts for satellite services are not in the contracts  awarded through the DISA process. For example, DISA\u2019s contracts for  commercial bandwidth, according to the three DSTS-G vendors, do not  contain the common commercial clause, \u201cPortability of Services,\u201d or  anything comparable. This clause would typically allow a user to transfer  the remaining time from one satellite, in an area no longer requiring  coverage, to another satellite, where service is now required, at no  additional cost. Industry representatives cited this clause as an example of  flexibility that commercial customers have sought, as a best practice, but  DOD has not.", "Further, DOD users often do not have the ability to change or cancel  requirements, if necessary, without continuing to pay for the original  ones. For example, while DISA\u2019s contracts with vendors contain the  \u201cTermination for Convenience\u201d clause, which should allow the  government to terminate service that is no longer needed and to stop  incurring costs for the unused portion, vendors\u2019 contracts with service  providers do not have this clause. In fact, the contracts that vendors have  with the service providers reflect an industry practice that holds the  vendors responsible for the remainder of the noncancelable lease,  regardless of whether the government terminates the vendors\u2019 contract.  Therefore, any remaining lease costs would be paid to the service provider  by the vendor and then submitted as part of the vendor\u2019s termination  settlement proposal to DOD, which would then bear some or all of these  costs as agreed to in the negotiated termination settlement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Users Are Bypassing the DISA Process to Get Timely, More Flexible, and Less Costly Services", "paragraphs": ["Some users are bypassing the DISA acquisition process to acquire  commercial bandwidth through alternative processes, either by formally  requesting a waiver from the DISA process or by improperly procuring  services without a waiver.

In the remaining six instances,  however, users had independently procured bandwidth without  processing waivers, inconsistent with DOD policy.", "We were initially given access to information on the four procurement  actions with approved waivers and on three of the actions that had  occurred without waivers. These latter three procurements had been  brought to the attention of the Chairman of the GIG Waiver Panel, who  then made the offending organizations process \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d waivers.  While we were interviewing user organization representatives on these, we  uncovered three additional procurement actions that should have had  waivers processed, but had not. We turned this information over to the  Chairman of the GIG Waiver Panel, who will determine whether \u201cafter-the- fact\u201d waivers are also to be processed for these cases.

One knowledgeable DISA official estimated that, if all the services  and DOD entities had accurately reported their fixed satellite service  bandwidth usage costs for fiscal year 2002, the total would likely have  been $200 million higher than the amount actually reported, nearly  doubling the reported amount of $221.7 million.

They also came to  realize that they lacked the tools needed to make sure that the services  they purchased met their business needs at the best overall value.", "To turn this situation around, these companies reengineered their  approaches to buying services. This began with taking a hard look at  how much they were spending on services and from whom. By arming  themselves with this knowledge, the companies could identify  opportunities to leverage their buying power, reduce costs, and better  manage their suppliers. The companies also instituted a series of  structural, process, and role changes aimed at moving away from a  fragmented acquisition process to a more efficient and effective  enterprisewide process. For example, the companies we studied often  established or expanded the role of corporate procurement organizations  to help business managers acquire key services and made extensive use of  crossfunctional teams to help the companies better identify service needs,  select providers, and manage contractor performance. These companies  also developed information systems to enable them to track their spending  and better match their needs with potential providers.

There are options based on common commercial  practices that are available to DOD for doing so, such as requesting most  favored customer status with providers or maximizing business volume  discounts. Table 7 discusses several of these options and their possible  application to DOD\u2019s current practices in more detail.", "While these options would position DISA to achieve cost savings, they  require DISA to be able to project its future requirements and to be more  proactive in dealing with its vendors. This is not being done. Instead,  bandwidth is usually purchased on the \u201cspot market\u201d on an as-needed  basis\u2014when it is most expensive compared to longer duration leases.  With few exceptions, individual small requirements are not aggregated by  DISA to take advantage of DOD\u2019s potential leverage in acquiring  bandwidth in larger and less expensive quantities. According to DISA,  users often decline opportunities to aggregate their requirements with  other users. Two providers we interviewed indicated that they would be  willing to develop creative solutions for consolidated requirements but  would need to know in advance about future requirements to do so  effectively.", "Several DOD and industry officials told us that DOD could benefit if  bandwidth were acquired through a program office with central funding  authority for that bandwidth. In this situation, it would be necessary for  users to submit their plans and forecasts of requirements to the central  program office. Currently, users have their own bandwidth funding and  generally do not forward forecasts of requirements to DISA. If all user  requirements were submitted to this single program office, it would then  be able to aggregate bandwidth requirements in order to leverage buying  power. In addition, some of these officials indicated that such a program  office could allow increased visibility and control over DOD-wide  bandwidth acquisitions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Adopting a Strategic Approach Will Be Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Longer-term changes to the DISA process that are necessary to implement  more strategic management processes\u2014including establishing better  visibility over spending, revamping business processes, strengthening  technical expertise within the agency, and securing a commitment from  senior leadership\u2014will be challenging to implement. DOD is aware of  these challenges and has begun to study its processes.", "We found that leading organizations that applied a strategic approach to  their purchases of services often spent months piecing together data from  various financial and management information systems and examining  individual orders just to get a rough idea of what they were spending  on services. The companies found it was necessary to develop new  information systems that could provide them with reliable spending data  in a timely fashion. The task of gaining accurate visibility over spending  will be equally, if not more, difficult for DOD given the lack of information  systems available to provide spending data and the magnitude and breadth  of spending involved with commercial satellite bandwidth services.", "Companies we studied also found that in establishing new procurement  processes, they needed to overcome resistance from individual business  units reluctant to share decision-making responsibility and to involve staff  that traditionally did not communicate with each other. While DISA will  likely face similar resistance within the agency, we believe it will also need  to overcome resistance from users that manage their own operations and  maintenance funds and have long been dissatisfied with the DISA process.  Another challenge for DISA is obtaining the expertise needed to review  complex technically sophisticated solutions proposed by vendors.  Industry representatives and some vendors believe that DISA currently  lacks the appropriate level of expertise.", "Lastly, the companies we studied found that they needed to have sustained  commitment from their senior leadership; to clearly communicate the  rationale, goals, and expected results from reengineering efforts; and to  measure whether the changes were having their intended effects. We  believe similar commitment will need to be secured not only from DISA  leadership, but also from leaders within DOD and the user communities.", "DOD has recognized many of these challenges and is in the process of  awarding a contract for a study to determine if it should change its  approach to identifying, acquiring, and managing commercial satellite  services.

But it does  not have a firm idea on how much bandwidth it will require in the short or  long term or whether the private sector can even continue to support its  requirements. Moreover, though it has become the largest consumer of  satellite bandwidth, it still buys its bandwidth on an as-needed basis,  thereby missing significant opportunities to leverage its buying power and  to achieve considerable savings as a result. Moreover, by allowing users to  bypass the DISA waiver process, DOD is hampering its ability to ensure  that its communications networks are interoperable and to minimize  redundancies. If DISA is to remain as DOD\u2019s primary agent to acquire  satellite bandwidth, then it must implement a more strategic management  approach\u2014not only one that continues to ensure that acquisitions are  processed fairly, but also one that ensures services can be acquired in a  timely and cost-effective way that meets users\u2019 needs. Doing so will be a  considerable challenge, however, given the current environment and  potential resistance within DISA and from its users.

Specifically, this framework should include  provisions for  inventorying current and potential users of commercial bandwidth  to determine their existing and long-term requirements;   identifying and exploiting opportunities to consolidate the bandwidth  requirements of combatant commanders, the military services, and  defense agencies;    adopting, when appropriate, commonly used commercial practices, such  as conducting spend analyses and negotiating pricing discounts based on  overall DOD volume, to strengthen DOD\u2019s position in acquiring bandwidth;  and  improving the current funding structure by considering new funding  approaches, such as centralized funding of commercial bandwidth, and  seeking legislative authority for multiyear procurements.", "To ensure the successful implementation of this strategic management  framework and to better leverage DOD\u2019s buying power and increase  user satisfaction, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information  Integration to    develop performance metrics to assess user satisfaction with the  timeliness, flexibility, quality, and cost in acquiring commercial satellite  services;    strengthen DOD\u2019s capacity to provide accurate and complete analyses of  commercial bandwidth requirements, spending, and the capabilities of  commercial satellite providers by enhancing core internal technical  expertise and information systems; and    assess, and implement as needed, changes to the key elements of the  existing acquisition process\u2014including requirements generation, solution  development and evaluation, and contract vehicles\u2014to facilitate a more  strategic approach to bandwidth acquisition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD, in commenting on a draft of this report, generally concurred  with our findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

For those orders not awarded competitively, we reviewed task order files  to obtain sole-source or directed subcontractor justifications. We obtained  details on all GIG waiver requests for fixed satellite service commercial  bandwidth procurements processed since enactment of ORBIT. To  determine the elapsed calendar days required to award the 48 DSTS-G task  orders, we reviewed task order files to extract pertinent dates.
