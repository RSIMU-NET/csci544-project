The terminology used for agency guidance varied and agency components issued varying amounts of guidance, ranging from about 10 to over 100 guidance documents each year. The key criterion used when deciding whether to issue a regulation or guidance was whether it needed to be binding; in such cases agencies proceeded with regulation. Officials reported that they routinely consulted with legal counsel when making these choices. Departments typically identified few of their guidance documents as \u201csignificant,\u201d generally defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as guidance with a broad and substantial impact on regulated entities.", "All four departments identified standard practices to follow when developing guidance. They addressed OMB's requirements for significant guidance to varying degrees and could strengthen internal controls for issuing guidance. Education and USDA had written departmental procedures for approval of significant guidance as required by OMB. DOL's procedures were not available to staff and required updating. HHS had no written procedures. Ensuring these procedures are available could better ensure that components consistently follow OMB's requirements. In the absence of specific government standards for non-significant guidance\u2014the majority of issued guidance\u2014the application of internal control standards is particularly important. The 25 components GAO reviewed addressed some control standards more regularly than others. For example, few components had written procedures to ensure consistent application of guidance processes. All components could describe standard review practices and most used tools to document management approval of draft guidance. Of the 25 components, 15 cited examples in which they conferred with external nonfederal stakeholders while developing guidance and nearly half did not regularly evaluate whether issued guidance remained current and effective.", "Components used different strategies to disseminate guidance and all relied primarily on posting the guidance on their websites. As such, components should follow applicable requirements for federal websites. One of these requirements\u2014easy access to current and relevant guidance\u2014could also facilitate opportunities for affected parties and stakeholders to provide feedback on those documents. USDA, DOL, and Education posted their significant guidance on a departmental website as directed by OMB; HHS did not. Components used several strategies\u2014including organizing guidance by audience or topic and highlighting new or outdated guidance\u2014to facilitate access. However, GAO identified factors that hindered online access, including long lists of guidance and documents dispersed among multiple web pages. All components GAO studied collected web metrics and many used them to evaluate online guidance dissemination. However, many of these components did not use metrics to improve how they disseminated guidance through their websites. Beyond their websites, components found other ways to disseminate and obtain feedback on issued guidance, including focus groups, surveys, and direct feedback from the public at conferences, webinars, and from monitoring visits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that HHS and DOL ensure consistent application of OMB requirements for significant guidance.

An agency may use any of these documents to provide  more explanation on how the agency plans to interpret a regulation.  Defining guidance can also be difficult. To illustrate that difficulty, several  of the components in our scope told us that they do not consider many of  the communication documents they issue to the public to be guidance.", "5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a), 553(b), 553(d).

Agencies sometimes  include disclaimers in their guidance to note that the documents have no  legally binding effect on regulated parties or the agencies. Even though  not legally binding, guidance documents can have a significant effect on  regulated entities and the public, both because of agencies\u2019 reliance on  large volumes of guidance documents and the fact that the guidance can  prompt changes in the behavior of regulated parties and the general  public. Due to the potential for these effects, agencies\u2019 use of guidance  has been the subject of scrutiny from policymakers and the public.  Despite the general distinctions between regulations and guidance  documents, legal scholars and federal courts have at times noted that it is  not always easy to determine whether an agency action should be issued  as a regulation subject to the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements or  is guidance or a policy statement, and therefore exempt from these  requirements.", "Among the reasons agency guidance may be legally challenged are  procedural concerns that the agency inappropriately used guidance rather  than the rulemaking process or concerns that the agency has issued  guidance that goes beyond its authority.

Guidance can have coercive effects or can lead parties to alter their conduct. For  example, under a statute or regulation that would allow a range of actions to be  eligible for a permit or other desired agency action, a guidance document might  specify fast track treatment for a particular narrow form of behavior, but subject other  behavior to a burdensome application process with an uncertain likelihood of success.  Even if not legally binding, such guidance could affect behavior in a way that might  lead to an economically significant impact. Similarly, an agency might make a  pronouncement about the conditions under which it believes a particular substance or  product is unsafe. While not legally binding, such a statement could reasonably be  anticipated to lead to changes in behavior by the private sector or governmental  authorities such that it would lead to a significant economic effect.", "For example, the following guidance documents issued by our audited agencies were  considered significant:  In response to questions from state officials, DOL\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration issued guidance in 2005 clarifying that distance learning can be  considered approvable classroom training under the Trade Adjustment Assistance  program.", "In response to requests for technical assistance, Education\u2019s Office for Civil  Rights determined that elementary and secondary schools and postsecondary  institutions could benefit from additional guidance concerning Title IX obligations  to address sexual violence.

OIRA staff concurred that agencies  understood what types of direction to regulated entities must go through  the regulatory process.", "In a few cases, components used guidance to alert affected entities about  immediate statutory requirements or to anticipate upcoming requirements  to be promulgated through the rulemaking process. While this may  provide timely information about new or upcoming requirements, it also  may cause confusion as details are revised during the rulemaking  process. FNS officials told us that when a new statute becomes effective  immediately and there is little ambiguity in how the statute can be  interpreted, they use a \u201cstaging process.\u201d In this process, they issue  informational guidance so their partners are aware of and consistently  understand new requirements before the more time-consuming  rulemaking process can be completed. In 2014, we reported that five FNS  memorandums related to new statutory requirements for the content of  school lunches were distributed prior to the issuance of the final rule on  the changes to the content and nutrition standards for school lunches, in  part because of statutory timeframes. As FNS implemented the finalized  regulation, it also issued guidance containing new flexibilities or  substantive changes to previously issued guidance.

Even within  components, types of guidance may need to be treated differently or may  warrant differing levels of review. A level of standardization of the process  that may be appropriate for one component or type of guidance may be  inappropriate for another.

Although no  component can insulate itself completely from risks, it can manage risk by  involving management in decisions to initiate guidance, prioritizing among  proposed guidance, and determining the appropriate level of review prior  to issuance. According to internal control standards, agencies should use  techniques and processes to identify and manage risk. Agencies face  multiple risks when going through the guidance production process. Risks  include legal challenges that issued guidance is asserting binding  requirements without having gone through the rulemaking process, or  that a guidance document goes beyond the agency\u2019s statutory authority.  In addition, if leadership is not included in discussions related to initiation  of guidance, agencies risk expending resources developing guidance that  is unnecessary or inadvisable.", "At a few components, officials told us that leadership (such as component  heads and department-level management) decided whether to initiate  certain guidance and guidance did not originate from program staff for  these components. Employee Benefits Security Administration office  directors presented guidance proposals considering legal, policy, and  programmatic factors to their Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Assistant  Secretaries for approval to start developing guidance. In most other  cases, ideas for additional guidance originated from program staff and  field offices or from leadership, depending on the nature of the guidance.  Education officials told us that component program staff and leadership  work together to identify issues to address in guidance. USDA Food and  Nutrition Service officials told us they may decide to initiate guidance  based on both input from regional offices and directives from senior  leadership. In a recent example, the Under Secretary for Food,  Consumer, and Nutrition Services initiated guidance to remind state  agencies of existing requirements prohibiting the online sale of benefits  for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and  Children.", "Officials at several components indicated that they prioritized the  development of certain guidance documents over others to ensure that  guidance expediently responded, for example, to constituents with  pressing needs to comply with current regulations and that staff resources  were allocated in alignment with these priorities. Education officials told  us they prioritized among possible guidance documents based upon  conversations about staffing resources as well as the needs of their  constituents. For example, Education\u2019s Office of Management officials  told us they used an ongoing list to prioritize certain guidance documents,  considering factors including (1) whether the guidance document  explained new statutory requirements, (2) whether it responded to  questions from their constituents, (3) the importance of the guidance to  other Education programs, or (4) whether the proposed guidance  addressed issues identified through technical assistance or calls to their  compliance hotline. HHS Administration for Children and Families\u2019 (ACF)  Office of Child Care officials explained that they prioritized guidance in  areas that (1) had the largest positive impacts; (2) needed clarification to  address questions from grantees, stakeholders, and others; and (3) were  most relevant to the program\u2019s rules or requirements.", "At most components, officials told us that they determine the appropriate  level of review and final clearance of proposed guidance, and in many  cases guidance was reviewed at a higher level if the document was  anticipated to affect other offices or had a particular subject or scope.  Risk was one factor agency officials considered when determining the  anticipated appropriate level of review and final clearance of proposed  guidance. At the Employee Benefits Security Administration, for example,  the need for department-level clearance depended on various factors.  These included likely congressional interest, potential effects on areas  regulated by other DOL components, expected media coverage, and  whether the guidance was likely to be seen as controversial by  constituent groups. Two other factors that a few agencies reported  considering in determining whether the guidance warranted a higher level  of review were whether it was related to a major priority or would be  \u201cimpactful.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Components Did Not Have Written Procedures for the Production of Non- significant Guidance", "paragraphs": ["Most components did not have written procedures for guidance initiation,  development, and review.

In these  cases, officials told us that the guidance process was well understood by  program staff or followed typical management hierarchies. For example,  HHS\u2019s Administration for Community Living, DOL\u2019s Office of Labor- Management Standards and Education\u2019s Office of Special Education and  Rehabilitative Services officials told us program staff have a good  understanding of the processes involved in developing and obtaining  approval of guidance. Control activities may help components assure that  management officials approve of the content of the guidance and concur  on the document\u2019s relative priority. Control activities outlined in written  procedures can provide a central approach to guidance initiation,  development, and review.", "A total of 6 of the 25 components had written procedures for the entire  guidance production process, and several of these components  highlighted benefits of these procedures for their guidance processes.  These components included ACF\u2019s Office of Head Start and five  components at DOL: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA), the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Employment and  Training Administration, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance  Programs, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Education\u2019s Office of  Innovation and Improvement and Office of Elementary and Secondary  Education and Labor\u2019s Veterans\u2019 Employment and Training Service had  written procedures only for the review and clearance phase. The Mine  Safety and Health Administration\u2019s written procedures contain information  that they describe as essential to the effective and consistent  administration of the component\u2019s programs and activities. As shown in  figure 3, OSHA\u2019s written procedures are designed to ensure that the  program director manages the process for a specific policy document by  considering feedback and obtaining appropriate concurrence to ensure  that guidance incorporates all comments and has been cleared by  appropriate officials. The Deputy Assistant Secretary resolves any  disagreements about substance, potential policy implications, or assigned  priority of the document. Documented procedures are not just an internal  controls issue; agencies benefit from them. OSHA\u2019s procedures were  meant to ensure effective management of the issuance of guidance  documents.", "Internal control standards do not prescribe either centralization or  decentralization for managing guidance processes, and the departments  we reviewed had varied approaches. One department, Education, had  centralized processes for guidance development, review, and  dissemination, while the other three departments were decentralized. At  Education, an Office of the General Counsel official told us she was  involved in decisions about whether guidance is considered significant  and Education\u2019s Office of the Executive Secretariat managed the  document clearance and approval processes for all guidance. This office  also maintained frequently asked questions to explain the process to  components. In contrast, officials told us that DOL gave its components  the flexibility to develop individual procedures for developing and issuing  non-significant guidance. In addition, HHS departmental officials told us  they played a secondary review and approval role and that each HHS  component approached the development and issuance of guidance  documents differently. USDA officials told us that its guidance process  was also decentralized, as guidance was typically initiated, developed,  and approved at the program level, while significant guidance was shared  with the department for review.", "Although a few components had written procedures for guidance  initiation, development, and review, officials from all components could  describe standard review practices to provide management the  opportunity to comment and ensure that its comments were addressed by  program staff. For example, the Administration for Community Living had  its officials circulate draft guidance for internal review and typically  required three to four officials to sign off on the draft, including center  directors and its Executive Secretariat. At Education\u2019s Office of Innovation  and Improvement, program staff shared draft guidance with senior  leadership, who in turn provided feedback.

To ensure that management  concurrence was recorded, most components we reviewed used  communication tools, such as electronic or hard-copy routing slips, to  document approval for guidance clearance or to communicate with  management and other offices about proposed or upcoming  guidance. In particular, officials at 20 components used a routing slip  to document management concurrence. For example, the Mine Safety  and Health Administration used two forms to track the clearance of  guidance documents. Education\u2019s Office of Management used a  routing slip to document internal component approvals and convened  a working group to resolve comments and edits on the guidance  documents. The two components within ACF used a \u201cpolicy calendar,\u201d  a tool for communicating with management about the guidance  documents being drafted and their projected issuance dates. ACF\u2019s  policy calendar listed the name and status of guidance, whether it was  a presidential or secretarial priority, whether the affected program was  mandatory or discretionary, and the proposed date of issuance to alert  appropriate ACF officials of upcoming guidance and to facilitate  appropriate review.", "Interagency communications. Most component officials told us that  they conferred with other affected components or federal departments  to ensure consistency of their guidance during the development of  guidance. Officials at Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights told us they  sometimes reached out to other federal agencies and interested  stakeholders to have \u201clistening sessions\u201d on new guidance  documents, such as a 2013 pamphlet on academic success for  pregnant and parenting students. DOL\u2019s Office of Disability and  Employment Policy officials told us they often worked with multiple  departments that addressed disability issues and contributed to the  fact sheets or other guidance documents issued by these  departments.", "External stakeholders. Officials told us that feedback from external  nonfederal stakeholders often served as the impetus for the initiation  of guidance, and 15 of the 25 selected components cited examples in  which they conferred with external nonfederal stakeholders during the  guidance development process. At OSHA, external stakeholders were  not involved in developing directives or policy issuances, but assisted  with developing educational, non-policy guidance, such as hazard  alerts. Food and Nutrition Service officials told us that state and local  agency staff, industry representatives, advocacy organizations, and  the general public were involved in the development of their guidance,  generally through a comment period. For example, during the  development of a policy memorandum on vendor management, the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and  Children solicited comments from regional offices and all state  agencies through a 45-day comment period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Almost Half of the Components Regularly Evaluated Whether Issued Guidance was Effective and Up-to-Date", "paragraphs": ["Although some components did not have a formalized process to assess  the effectiveness of their guidance, many of these components told us  they have updated or revised certain guidance documents.

Without a regular review of issued guidance, components can miss the  opportunity to improve their guidance. DOL\u2019s Office of Labor- Management Standards officials told us they had not evaluated the  relative success of old guidance and did not often revise guidance. ACF\u2019s  Office of Child Care regularly tracked and updated guidance on grantee  reporting requirements. However, officials said there was little need to  track or update other guidance, as it had been 18 years since its  authorizing statute was changed.

For  example, in November 2011, DOL\u2019s Office of Federal Contract  Compliance Programs officials initiated a 2-year project to review their  directives system to ensure that they only posted up-to-date guidance. As  a result of the project, in 2012 and 2013 officials identified necessary  updates to guidance, clarified superseded guidance, and rescinded  guidance where appropriate. Officials told us that these actions reduced  the original number of directives by 85 percent. Officials also told us that  they did this to ensure that their guidance was more accurate and correct,  and the actions resulted in officials posting only relevant and current  guidance information on the component\u2019s website. Officials told us they  now routinely monitor their directives about once a year and review other  guidance documents each time they issue new regulations or change a  policy to decide if they need to revise them. The Employment and  Training Administration used a checklist to review a list of active guidance  documents and identified whether to continue, cancel, or rescind the  guidance.

For  example, USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service officials told us that they  posted operational guidance on upcoming or proposed regulations to their  PartnerWeb, an intranet site that is only accessible by state agencies.  One component, DOL\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, e-mailed guidance to  state agencies and posted it on an intranet site for state agencies that is  not publicly accessible. Components also relied on other government  websites to distribute guidance.

Components also designed specialized  websites to disseminate guidance on specialized topics. For example,  DOL\u2019s Office of Disability Employment Policy posted information about  disability programs on disability.gov and Education\u2019s Federal Student Aid  used a separate websites to serve different audiences.", "Almost all components used e-mail as another key dissemination method.  Components also used listservs (which manage e-mails to and from a list  of subscribers), e-mail delivery service (such as GovDelivery) or  newsletters. Officials told us they compiled listservs of individuals  interested in specific issues. They also explained that these lists were  developed in a number of ways, including by program offices that add  interested parties or directly from members of the public who sign up to  be on these lists through component websites. These listservs could be  very large. For example, DOL\u2019s Employee Benefits Security  Administration list has 336,000 subscribers.

Some  held press conferences or issued press releases, while others distributed  and discussed guidance during conferences, webinars, or conference  calls. Components also reported using social media, such as Facebook,  Twitter, or blogs. A few components told us that they posted guidance in  the Federal Register. Lastly, component officials said that external  partners\u2014such as states, advocacy groups, and trade associations\u2014 sometimes distributed guidance for them at their request.", "Officials used different strategies to reach certain groups and noted that it  was more resource intensive to distribute guidance to a wider audience.  For example, officials from HHS\u2019s Administration for Community Living  explained that because their subgrantees are defined in statute, they  were able to effectively target their guidance to that group. Similarly,  Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights officials had readily available e-mail  lists for the purpose of sending guidance to all public school  superintendents or college presidents. DOL Employee Benefits Security  Administration officials noted that disseminating guidance to financial  institutions was fairly easy because that audience was receptive to  receiving information through their website and generally vocal when they  were unable to find the information they were seeking. On the other hand,  OSHA officials told us they use social media to communicate with hard- to-reach populations, such as non-English speakers and  temporary/contract workers who were more likely to be working in  dangerous jobs, and used hard-copy guidance during disaster recovery  efforts or to reach those who did not have access to the Internet. Officials  noted that states and stakeholder groups were helpful in reaching wide  audiences, especially when disseminating guidance to large groups  nationwide, such as parents or students and all employers or employees.

Further, components did not always  leverage the web and customer satisfaction metrics they collected to  evaluate their guidance and its dissemination. By more consistently  analyzing the metrics they have already collected, components could  better ensure that their online guidance is easy to access, accurate, and  relevant. Ensuring effective mechanisms for affected parties and other  stakeholders to submit feedback on guidance documents is also crucial.
