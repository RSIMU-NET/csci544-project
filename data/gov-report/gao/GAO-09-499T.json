The failure of the institutions to appropriately identify, measure, and manage their risks has raised questions not only about corporate governance but also about the adequacy of regulatory oversight of risk management systems. GAO's objectives were to review (1) how regulators oversee risk management at these institutions, (2) the extent to which regulators identified shortcomings in risk management at certain institutions prior to the summer of 2007, and (3) how some aspects of the regulatory system may have contributed to or hindered the oversight of risk management. GAO built upon its existing body of work, evaluated the examination guidance used by examiners at U.S. banking and securities regulators, and reviewed examination reports and work papers from 2006-2008 for a selected sample of large institutions, and horizontal exams that included additional institutions. In January 2009, GAO designated the need to modernize the financial regulatory system as a high risk area needing congressional attention. Regulatory oversight of risk management at large, financial institutions, particularly at the holding company level, should be considered part of that effort."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The banking and securities regulators use a variety of tools to identify areas of risk and assess how large, complex financial institutions manage their risks. The banking regulators--Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)--and securities regulators--Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)--use somewhat different approaches to oversee risk management practices. Banking examiners are assigned to continuously monitor a single institution, where they engage in targeted and horizontal examinations and assess risks and the quality of institutions' risk management systems. SEC and FINRA identify areas of high risk by aggregating information from examiners and officials on areas of concern across broker-dealers and by monitoring institutions. SEC and FINRA conduct discrete targeted and horizontal examinations. The banking regulators focused on safety and soundness, while SEC and FINRA tended to focus on compliance with securities rules and laws. All regulators have specific tools for effecting change when they identify weaknesses in risk management at institutions they oversee. In the examination materials GAO reviewed for a limited number of institutions, GAO found that regulators had identified numerous weaknesses in the institutions' risk management systems before the financial crisis began. For example, regulators identified inadequate oversight of institutions' risks by senior management. However, the regulators said that they did not take forceful actions to address these weaknesses, such as changing their assessments, until the crisis occurred because the institutions had strong financial positions and senior management had presented the regulators with plans for change. Regulators also identified weaknesses in models used to measure and manage risk but may not have taken action to resolve these weaknesses. Finally, regulators identified numerous stress testing weaknesses at several large institutions, but GAO's limited review did not identify any instances in which weaknesses prompted regulators to take aggressive steps to push institutions to better understand and manage risks. Some aspects of the regulatory system may have hindered regulators' oversight of risk management. First, no regulator systematically looks across institutions to identify factors that could affect the overall financial system. While regulators periodically conducted horizontal examinations on stress testing, credit risk practices, and risk management for securitized mortgage products, they did not consistently use the results to identify potential systemic risks. Second, primary bank and functional regulators' oversee risk management at the level of the legal entity within a holding company while large entities manage risk on an enterprisewide basis or by business lines that cut across legal entities. As a result, these regulators may have only a limited view of institutions' risk management or their responsibilities and activities may overlap with those of holding company regulators."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on regulators\u2019  oversight of risk management at large, complex, financial institutions. As  you know, financial regulators have a role in assessing the risk  management systems at the financial institutions they supervise. This  oversight is a responsibility of both federal regulatory agencies, including  the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Office of Thrift Supervision  (OTS), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and of self - regulatory organizations, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory  Authority (FINRA). Several significant analyses of the current financial  crisis, which has threatened the stability of the financial system and led to  the insolvency of some large U.S. financial institutions, have identified  inadequate risk management at large financial institutions as one of the  causes of the crisis. Major institutions across the financial sector\u2014 Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, and Wachovia\u2014have failed or been  rescued at the last moment by mergers and acquisitions, and the factors  that led to these failures such as poor underwriting standards for  mortgages and a lack of understanding of the risks posed by some  structured products, as well as the failures themselves, have led to  instability of the financial system in the United States. The failures of these  institutions to appropriately identify, measure, and manage their risks  have raised serious questions about the adequacy of the regulators\u2019  oversight of risk management. Moreover, these failures raise a number of  questions about what lessons can be learned from the current crisis that  should be considered as Congress and the Administration begin to rethink  the current financial regulatory system.", "My statement today focuses on our review of regulators\u2019 oversight of risk  management systems at a limited number of large, complex financial  institutions (initiated at the request of Chairman Reed) as well as our past  work on the federal regulatory system. Specifically, I will discuss (1) how  regulators oversee risk management at large financial institutions, (2) the  extent to which regulators identified shortcomings in risk management at  selected institutions prior to the beginning of the financial crisis in the  summer of 2007, and (3) how some aspects of the regulatory system may  have contributed to or hindered the oversight of risk management.", "To prepare for this testimony, we built upon our existing body of work on  regulatory oversight of risk management. We evaluated the examination  guidance used by examiners at the Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, and SEC.  We also conducted a literature review to identify good risk management  practices. We identified and used as criteria The Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission\u2019s (COSO) Enterprisewide  Risk Management\u2014Integrated Framework and several analyses of risk  management as they relate to the current financial crisis including the  Institute of International Finance\u2019s (IIF) Final Report of the IIF  Committee on Market Best Practices: Principles of Conduct and Best  Practice Recommendations and the Senior Supervisor Group\u2019s  Observations on Risk Management Practices During Recent Turbulent  Times. Finally, for the the period 2006-2008, we reviewed the authorities  under which the regulators exercise oversight of risk management,  examination reports, and workpapers supporting these reports for a small  number of large financial institutions that we selected. The results cannot  be projected to the universe of large complex institutions but rather  provide examples of risk management oversight at the selected  institutions. In this regard, I note that the statutory authority providing for  GAO audits of the federal bank regulators generally prohibits GAO from  disclosing regulatory nonpublic information identifying an open bank.  Therefore, we will not disclose the banking institutions included in our  study or detailed information obtained from the examinations or  interviews with the examination staff.", "We conducted this work from December 2008 to March 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

These risk  management systems are critical to responding to rapid and unanticipated  changes in financial markets. Risk management depends, in part, on an  effective corporate governance system that addresses risk across the  institution and also within specific areas of risk, including credit, market,  liquidity, operational, and legal risk. The board of directors, senior  management (and its designated risk-monitoring unit), the audit  committee, internal auditors, and external auditors, and others have  important roles to play in an effectively operating risk-management  system. The different roles that each of these groups play represent critical  checks and balances in the overall risk-management system.", "Since 1991, the Congress has passed several laws that emphasize the  importance of internal controls including risk management at financial  institutions and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the  Treadway Commission (COSO) has issued guidance that management of  financial institutions could use to assess and evaluate its internal controls  and enterprisewide risk management.", "Following the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) strengthened  corporate governance in large U.S. banks and thrifts. FDICIA required  management to annually assess its system of internal control over  financial reporting and the external auditors to attest to management\u2019s  assertions. The corporate governance model established under FDICIA  emphasized strong internal control systems, proactive boards of directors,  and independent, knowledgeable audit committees.", "During 1992, and with a subsequent revision in 1994 COSO issued its  Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework. The COSO Framework set out  criteria for establishing key elements of corporate governance, especially  the \u201ctone at the top.\u201d The framework also set forth the five components of  an effective system of internal control: control environment, risk  assessment, control activities, information and communication, and  monitoring.", "With the failures of Enron and WorldCom, Congress passed the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) which required managements of public  companies to assess their systems of internal control with external auditor  attestations, though the implementation for smaller public companies has  been gradual and is not yet complete. Under section 404 of SOX, the SEC  required that management identify what framework it used to assess the  system of internal control over financial reporting. Though it did not  mandate any particular framework, the SEC recognized that the COSO  Framework satisfied the SEC\u2019s own criteria and allowed its use as an  evaluation framework.", "In 2004, COSO issued Enterprise Risk Management \u2013 Integrated  Framework (ERM Framework), though it is not a binding framework for  any particular entity or industry. The ERM Framework, which  encompasses the previous internal control framework, establishes best  practices and expands the criteria and tools that management can use to  assess whether it has an effective risk management system. The  framework encourages the board of directors and senior management, in  their corporate governance roles, to set the risk appetite of the entity,  which is the amount of risk the entity is willing to accept in its overall  strategy. Management further sets risk objectives to achieve the entity\u2019s  goals and sets risk tolerances to ensure that the risk appetite is not  exceeded.", "Regulators also have a role in assessing risk management at financial  institutions. In particular, oversight of risk management at large financial  institutions is divided among a number of regulatory agencies. The Federal  Reserve oversees risk management at bank holding companies and state  member banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System; OTS  oversees thrift holding companies and thrifts; SEC and FINRA oversee risk  management at SEC-registered U.S. broker-dealers; and OCC oversees risk  management at national banks.", "The Federal Reserve and OTS have long had authority to supervise holding  companies. The Federal Reserve\u2019s authority is set forth primarily in the  Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which contains the supervisory  framework for holding companies that control commercial banks. OTS\u2019s  supervisory authority over thrift holding companies is set forth in the  Home Owners Loan Act. In the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA),  Congress expanded the range of permissible holding company activities  and affiliations and also set forth restrictions and guidance on how those  companies should be supervised. However, Congress did not clearly  express the aims of holding company supervision. GLBA authorizes the  Federal Reserve and OTS to examine the holding company and each  subsidiary in order to: (a) inform the regulator of \u201cthe nature of the  operations and financial condition\u201d of the holding company and its  subsidiaries; and (b) inform the regulator of the financial and operational  risks within the holding company system that may threaten the safety and  soundness of the holding company\u2019s bank subsidiaries and the systems for  monitoring and controlling such risks; and (c) monitor compliance with  applicable federal laws. On the other hand, GLBA specifies that the focus  and scope of examinations of holding companies and any of their  subsidiaries shall \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d be limited to the holding  company and \u201cany subsidiary that could have a materially adverse effect  on the safety and soundness of a depository institution subsidiary\u201d due to  the size, condition or activities of the nonbank subsidiary or the nature or  size of transactions between that subsidiary and the banking subsidiary. In  our work over the years, we have encountered a range of perspectives on  the focus of holding company examinations, some of which emphasize the  health of the depository institution as the primary examination focus and  some of which look more expansively to the holding company enterprise  under certain conditions.", "In addition to the provisions generally applicable to holding company  supervision, GLBA also limits the circumstances under which both holding  company regulators and depository institution regulators may examine  functionally regulated subsidiaries of bank holding companies, such as  broker-dealers. Gramm-Leach-Bliley permits holding company regulators  to examine functionally regulated subsidiaries only under certain  conditions, such as where the regulator has reasonable cause to believe  that the subsidiary is engaged in activities that pose a material risk to an  affiliated bank or that an examination is necessary to obtain information  on financial and operational risks within the holding company system that  may threaten an affiliated bank\u2019s safety and soundness. The examination  authority of depository institution regulators permits the examination of  bank affiliates to disclose fully an affiliate\u2019s relations with the bank and the  effect of those relations on the bank. However, with respect to  functionally regulated affiliates of depository institutions, Gramm-Leach-  Bliley imposes the same restraint on the use of examination authority that  applies to OTS and the Federal Reserve with respect to holding  companies. That is, Gramm-Leach-Bliley instructs that bank and holding  company supervisors generally are to limit the focus of their examinations  of functionally regulated affiliates and, to the extent possible, are to reply  on the work of primary bank and functional regulators that supervise  holding company subsidiaries. An example of this situation would be  where a holding company has a national bank or thrift subsidiary and a  broker-dealer subsidiary. Under GLBA, the holding company regulator is  to rely \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d on the work of primary bank and  functional regulators for information on the respective entities. Also under  GLBA, bank supervisors are similarly limited with respect to affiliates of  the institutions they supervise.", "SEC\u2019s authority to examine U.S. broker-dealers is set forth in the  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Under the 1934 act, SEC\u2019s  examination authority over broker-dealers does not permit SEC to require  examination reports on affiliated depository institutions, and if SEC seeks  non-routine information about a broker-dealer affiliate that is subject to  examination by a bank regulator, SEC must notify and generally must  consult with the regulator regarding the information sought. Oversight of  U.S. broker-dealers is performed by SEC\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets  (Trading and Markets) and Office of Compliance, Inspections, and  Examinations (OCIE). In addition, SEC delegates some of its authority to  oversee U.S. broker-dealers to FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that  was established in 2007 through the consolidation of NASD and the  member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the New  York Stock Exchange.", "Under the alternative net capital rule for broker-dealers, from 2005-2008,  SEC conducted a voluntary consolidated-supervised entity program under  which five investment bank holding companies voluntarily consented to  having SEC oversee them on a consolidated basis.

To  conduct on-site continuous supervision, banking regulators often station  examiners at specific institutions. This practice allows examiners to  continuously analyze information provided by the financial institution,  such as board meeting minutes, institution risk reports/management  information system reports, and for holding company supervisors  supervisory reports provided to other regulators, among other things. This  type of supervision allows for timely adjustments to the supervisory  strategy of the examiners as conditions change within the institution. Bank  examiners do not conduct a single annual full-scope examination of the  institution. Rather, they conduct ongoing examinations that target specific  areas at the institutions (target examinations) and annually issue an  overall rating on the quality of risk management.", "Each regulator had a process to assess risk management systems. While  each included certain core components, such as developing a supervisory  plan and monitoring, the approach used and level of detail varied.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s guidance consisted of a detailed risk assessment  program that included an analytic framework for developing a risk  management rating for holding companies. Unlike most bank regulatory  examination guidance, this guidance is not yet publicly available.  According to Federal Reserve officials, the primary purpose of the  framework is to help ensure a consistent regulatory approach for  assessing inherent risk and risk management practices of large financial  institutions (the holding company) and make informed supervisory  assessments. The Federal Reserve program for large complex banking  organizations is based on a \u201ccontinuous supervision\u201d model that assigns a  dedicated team to each institution. Those teams are responsible for  completing risk assessments, supervisory plans, and annual assessments.  The risk assessment includes an evaluation of inherent risk (credit,  market, operational, liquidity, and legal and compliance) and related risk  management and internal controls. The risk assessment is often the  starting point for the supervisory plan as well as a supporting document  for the annual assessment.", "The annual assessment requires the dedicated team to evaluate and rate  the firm\u2019s risk management, its financial condition, and the potential  impact of its non-depository operations on the depository institution. To  apply the risk or \u201cR\u201d rating, the examiner must consider (1) board of  director and senior management oversight; (2) policies, procedures, and  limits; (3) risk monitoring and management information system; and (4)  internal controls for each of the risk areas. The examiners then provide an  overall \u201cR\u201d rating for the institution.", "OCC\u2019s onsite examiners assess the risks and risk management functions at  large national banks using a detailed approach that is similar to that used  by the Federal Reserve\u2019s examiners. The core assessment is OCC\u2019s  primary assessment tool at the institutional level. According to OCC\u2019s  guidance, its examiners are required to assess the quality, quantity, and  overall direction of risks in nine categories (strategic, reputation, credit,  interest rate, liquidity, price, foreign currency translation, transaction, and  compliance). To determine the quality of risk management, OCC  examiners assess policies, processes, personnel, and control systems in  each category. This risk assessment is included in the examination report  that is sent to the bank\u2019s board of directors. OCC also provides a rating  based on the bank\u2019s capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity,  and sensitivity to market risk (the CAMELS rating), all of which can be  impacted by the quality of a risk management system. OCC\u2019s supervisory  strategy or plan for targeted examinations is developed from this Risk  Assessment System. Examiners can change a bank\u2019s ratings at any time if  the bank\u2019s conditions warrant that change. Targeted examinations are a  key component of OCC\u2019s oversight. Based on the materials we reviewed  covering the last 2 years, OCC conducted 23 targeted examinations in 2007  and 45 in 2008 at a large national bank. These examinations focused on  specific areas of risk management, such as governance, credit, and  compliance.", "Recently revised OTS guidance requires its examiners to review large and  complex holding companies to determine whether they have a  comprehensive system to measure, monitor, and manage risk  concentrations, determine the major risk-taking entities within the overall  institution, and evaluate the control mechanisms in place to establish and  monitor risk limits. OTS\u2019s recently revised guidance on assessing risk  management includes a risk management rating framework that is similar  to the Federal Reserve\u2019s. It includes the same risk management rating  subcomponents\u2014governance/board and senior management oversight;  policies, procedures, and limits; risk monitoring and management  information systems, and internal controls\u2014and criteria that the Federal  Reserve applies to bank holding companies. However, OTS considers  additional risk areas, such as concentration or systemic risk. Starting in  2007, OTS used a risk matrix to document the level of 13 inherent risks by  business unit. The matrix also includes an assessment of each unit\u2019s risk  mitigation or risk management activities, including internal controls, risk  monitoring systems, policies/procedures/limits, and governance. OTS  began using the risk matrix to develop its supervisory plan. Based on our  review of examination materials, OTS conducted targeted examinations on  risk management in such areas as consumer lending and mortgage-backed  securities.", "In the last few years, the banking regulators have also conducted  examinations that covered several large complex financial institutions on  specific issues such as risk management (horizontal examinations).  According to the Federal Reserve, horizontal examinations focus on a  single area or issue and are designed to (1) identify the range of practices  in use in the industry, (2) evaluate the safety and soundness of specific  activities across business lines or across systemically important  institutions, (3) provide better insight into the Federal Reserve\u2019s  understanding of how a firm\u2019s operations compare with a range of industry  practices, and (4) consider revisions to the formulation of supervisory  policy. During the period of our review, the Federal Reserve completed  several horizontal examinations on large, complex banking organizations,  including stress testing and collateral management. According to Federal  Reserve officials, examiners generally provide institutions with feedback  that tells them generally how they are doing relative to their peers, and if  any serious weaknesses were identified, these would be conveyed as well.  With the Federal Reserve, OCC conducted a horizontal examination on  advanced credit risk practices and OTS conducted a review across  institutions for nontraditional mortgages and used the findings to issue  supplemental guidance. According to an OCC official, the regulator uses  the findings in horizontal reviews as a supervisory tool and to require  corrective actions, as well as a means to discover information on bank  practices to issue supplemental guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securities Regulators\u2019 Approaches to Assessing Risk Management Revolve around Regularly Scheduled Targeted Examinations", "paragraphs": ["SEC and FINRA generally assess risk management systems of large  broker-dealers using discrete, but risk-focused examinations. The focus of  SEC and FINRA oversight is on compliance with their rules and the  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Although SEC and FINRA are in  continuous contact with large, complex institutions, neither SEC nor  FINRA staff conduct continuous onsite monitoring of broker-dealers that  involves an assessment of risks. FINRA\u2019s coordinator program is  continuous supervision, albeit not on site. According to SEC and FINRA,  however, they receive financial and risk area information on a regular  basis from the largest firms and those of financial concern through the  OCIE compliance monitoring program, the FINRA capital alert program,  and regular meetings with the firms. To identify risks, they aggregate  information from their officials and staff throughout the year to identify  areas that may require special attention across all broker-dealers. SEC and  FINRA conduct regularly scheduled target examinations that focus on the  risk areas identified in their risk assessment and on compliance with  relevant capital rules and customer protection rules. SEC\u2019s internal  controls risk management examinations, which started in 1995, cover the  top 15 wholesale and top 15 retail broker-dealers as well as a number of  mid-sized broker-dealers with a large number of customer accounts. At the  largest institutions, SEC conducts examinations every three years, while  FINRA conducts annual examinations of all broker-dealers.

During the  CSE program, Trading and Markets staff concentrated their efforts on  market and liquidity risks because the alternative net capital rule focused  on these risks and on operational risk because of the need to protect  investors. According to OCIE, their examiners focused on market, credit,  operational, legal and compliance risks, as well as senior management,  internal audit and new products. Because only five investment banks were  subject to consolidated supervision by SEC, SEC staff believed it did not  need to develop an overall supervisory strategy or written plans for  individual institutions it supervised; however, OCIE drafted detailed scope  memorandums for their target examinations. While no institutions are  subject to consolidated supervision by SEC at this time, a number of  broker-dealers are subject to the alternative net capital rule.", "SEC and FINRA conduct horizontal or \u201csweep\u201d examinations and, for  example, have completed one for subprime mortgages.

Bank regulators generally issue  findings or cite weaknesses in supervisory letters or an annual  examination report addressed to senior management of the financial  institution. However, regulators also meet with institution management to  address identified risk management weaknesses. Examples include:    After a target examination, the Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS each prepare  supervisory letters or reports of examination identifying weaknesses that  financial institutions are expected to address in a timely manner. In  addition to issues or findings, the Federal Reserve and OCC supervisory  letters provided a specific timeframe for the institution to send a written  response to the bank regulator articulating how the institution planned to  address the findings. In these instances, for the files we reviewed, the  institutions complied with the timeframes noted in the supervisory letter.  These letters may be addressed to the board of directors or the CEO or as  we found, the senior managers responsible for the program. For example,  a Federal Reserve Bank addressed a recent targeted examination on a  holding company\u2019s internal audit function to the chief auditor of the  holding company. Similarly, OCC addressed an examination of advanced  risk management processes to a bank\u2019s chief credit officer. OTS also  addressed some reports of target examinations to senior managers  responsible for specific programs.", "In their supervisory letters, OCC sometimes identifies \u201cMatters Requiring  Attention,\u201d which instruct the bank to explain how it will address the  matter in a timely manner. In its supervisory guidance, matters requiring  attention include practices that deviate from sound governance, internal  control and risk management principles that may adversely impact the  bank\u2019s earning or capital, risk profile, or reputation if not addressed.  According to its guidance, OCC tracks matters requiring attention until  they are resolved and maintains a record when these matters are resolved  and closed out. OCC also includes recommendations to national banks in  their supervisory letters. In addition, OCC will insert recommendations in  their letters which are suggestions relating to how a bank can operate a  specific program or business line more effectively.", "After the beginning of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve issued  revised examination guidance in July 2008 that established three types of  findings: matters requiring immediate attention, matters requiring  attention, and observations. Previously, each of the individual Federal  Reserve Banks had its own approach to defining findings. Matters  requiring attention and observations are similar to related practices  followed by OCC. For matters requiring immediate attention, the matter is  considered more urgent. According to their guidance, matters requiring  immediate attention encompass the highest priority concerns and include  matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the organization\u2019s  safety and soundness or that represent significant instances of  noncompliance with laws and regulations.", "OTS examiners may list recommendations in the report, findings, and  conclusions, but in the materials we reviewed examiners did not report  these in a standard way. While members of the Board of Directors are  required to sign the report of annual examination indicating that they have  read the report, they are not required to submit a written response. The  OTS Handbook Section 060 Examination Administration provides  guidance on the use of \u201cmatters requiring board attention\u201d or other lesser  supervisory corrective actions that should be addressed in the  examination correspondence. According to OTS, matters requiring board  attention and corrective actions are also tracked in its regulatory action  system for follow up.", "For 2008, we reviewed one regulator\u2019s tracking report of matters requiring  attention at one institution and found that only a small number of the 64  matters requiring attention relating to risk management and internal  controls had been closed out or considered addressed by the end of  January 2009. The examiners explained that some matters, such as  institutions making adjustments to their technology framework can be  time consuming. Another regulator told us that it does not track when  institutions have implemented remedial actions.", "Because the banking regulators are generally on site and continuously  monitoring large, complex institutions, examiners told us that a significant  part of their efforts to improve risk management systems were undertaken  through regularly scheduled meetings with senior management. According  to Federal Reserve and OCC officials, these meetings allow opportunities  for examiners to followup with management concerning actions that they  expect the financial institutions to implement. A Federal Reserve examiner  explained that several meetings were held with officials at a holding  company concerning an internal control matter in order to help ensure  that the institution was addressing the issue. For its complex and  international organizations program, OTS directs its examiners to use  regular meetings with senior management and periodic meetings with  boards of directors and any relevant committees to effect change. OTS  guidance indicates that examiners\u2019 regular meetings with senior  management are designed to communicate and address any changes in  risk profile and corrective actions. OTS also views annual meetings with  the Board of Directors as a forum for discussing significant findings and  management\u2019s approach for addressing them.", "In addition to these tools, bank regulators\u2019 approval authorities related to  mergers and acquisitions could be used to persuade institutions to address  risk management weaknesses. For example, the Federal Reserve, OCC,  and OTS are required to consider risk management when they approve  bank or thrift acquisitions or mergers and could use identified weaknesses  in this area to deny approvals. In addition, bank regulators have to  approve the acquisition of bank charters and must assess management\u2019s  ability to manage the bank or thrift charter being acquired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC\u2019s Oversight Tools Are Aimed at Addressing Violations", "paragraphs": ["If SEC\u2019s OCIE or FINRA examiners discover a violation of SEC or FINRA  rules, the institution is required to resolve the deficiency in a timely  manner.

However, weaknesses in  internal controls can rise to such a level as to violate other FINRA rules,  such as supervision rules. Deficiencies and weaknesses are followed up on  in subsequent examinations. OCIE\u2019s compliance audits require institutions  to correct deficiencies and address weaknesses.

For example,  before the crisis one regulator found significant weaknesses in an  institution\u2019s enterprisewide risk management system stemming from a  lack of oversight by senior management. In 2006, the regulator notified the  institution\u2019s board of directors that the 2005 examination had concluded  that the board and senior management had failed to adequately oversee  financial reporting, risk appetite, and internal audit functions. The  regulator made several recommendations to the board to address these  weaknesses. We found that the regulator continued to find some of the  same weaknesses in subsequent examination reports, yet examiners did  not take forceful action to require the institution to address these  shortcomings until the liquidity crisis occurred and the severity of the risk  management weaknesses became apparent. When asked about the  regulator\u2019s assessment of the holding company in general and risk  management in particular given the identified weaknesses, examiners told  us that they had concluded that the institution\u2019s conditions were adequate,  in part, because it was deemed to have sufficient capital and the ability to  raise more. Moreover, the examiners said that senior management had  presented them with plans to address the risk management weaknesses.", "In another example, other regulators found weaknesses related to an  institution\u2019s oversight of risk management before the crisis. One regulator  issued a letter to the institution\u2019s senior management in 2005 requiring that  the institution respond, within a specified time period, to weaknesses  uncovered in an examination. The weaknesses included the following:    The lack of an enterprisewide framework for overseeing risk, as  specified in the COSO framework. The institution assessed risks (such  as market or credit risks) on an individual operating unit basis, and was  not able to effectively assess risks institutionwide.", "A lack of common definitions of risk types and of corporate policy for  approving new products, which could ensure that management had  reviewed and understood any potential risks.", "An institutional tendency to give earnings and profitability growth  precedence over risk management.", "In addition, the regulator recommended that senior management  restructure the institution\u2019s risk management system to develop corporate  standards for assessing risk. However, the regulator\u2019s assessment of the  institution\u2019s risk management remained satisfactory during this period  because senior management reported that they planned to address these  weaknesses and, according to examiners, appeared to be doing so.  Moreover, the examiners believed that senior management could address  these weaknesses in the prevailing business environment of strong  earnings and adequate liquidity. After earnings and liquidity declined  during the financial crisis that began in 2007, the examiners changed their  assessment, citing many of the same shortcomings in risk management  that they had identified in 2005.", "At one institution, a regulator noted in a 2005 examination report that  management had addressed previously identified issues for one type of  risk and that the institution had taken steps to improve various processes,  such as clarifying the roles and responsibilities of risk assessment staff,  and shortening internal audit cycles of high-risk entities in this area. Later  in 2007, the regulator identified additional weaknesses related to credit  and market risk management. Regulatory officials told us that weaknesses  in oversight of credit and market risk management were not of the same  magnitude prior to the crisis as they were in late 2007 and 2008. Moreover,  examiners told us that it was difficult to identify all of the potential  weaknesses in risk management oversight until the system was stressed by  the financial crisis.", "Some regulators told us that they had relied on management  representation of risk, especially in emerging areas. For example, one  regulator\u2019s targeted review risk relied heavily on management\u2019s  representations about the risk related to subprime mortgages\u2014 representations that had been based on the lack of historical losses and  the geographic diversification of the complex product issuers. However,  once the credit markets started tightening in late 2007, the examiners  reported that they were less comfortable with management\u2019s  representations about the level of risk related to certain complex  investments. Examiners said that, in hindsight, the risks posed by parts of  an institution do not necessarily correspond with their size on the balance  sheet and that relatively small parts of the institution had taken on risks  that the regulator had not fully understood. Another regulator conducted a  horizontal examination of securitized mortgage products in 2006 but relied  on information provided by the institutions. While the report noted that  these products were experiencing rapid growth and that underwriting  standards were important, it focused on the major risks identified by the  firms and their actions to manage those risks as well as on how  institutions were calculating their capital requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Identified Weaknesses in Models Used to Calculate Risk but May Not Have Acted on These Findings", "paragraphs": ["Regulators also identified weaknesses in the oversight and testing of risk  models that financial institutions used, including those used to calculate  the amount of capital needed to protect against their risk exposures and  determine the valuation of complex products. Regulators require  institutions to test their models so that the institutions have a better sense  of where their weaknesses lie, and OCC developed guidance in 2000  related to model validation that other regulators consider to be the  standard. OCC\u2019s guidance states that institutions should validate their  models to increase reliability and improve their understanding of the  models\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. The guidance calls for independent  reviews by staff who have not helped to develop the models, instituting  controls to ensure that the models are validated before they are used,  ongoing testing, and audit oversight. The process of model validation  should look not only at the accuracy of the data being entered into the  model, but also at the model\u2019s assumptions, such as loan default rates.", "Institutions use capital models as tools to inform their management  activities, including measuring risk-adjusted performance, setting prices  and limits on loans and other products, and allocating capital among  various business lines and risks. Certain large banking organizations have  used models since the mid-1990s to calculate regulatory capital for market  risk, and the rules issued by U.S. regulators for Basel II require that banks  use models to estimate capital for credit and operational risks. The SEC\u2019s  consolidated supervised entity program allowed broker-dealers that were  part of consolidated supervised entities to compute capital requirements  using models to estimate market and credit risk. In addition, institutions  use models to estimate the value of complex instruments such as  collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).", "Regulators identified several weaknesses related to financial institutions\u2019  oversight and use of risk models:    One regulator found several weaknesses involving the use of models that  had not been properly tested to measure credit risks, an important input  into institutions\u2019 determinations of capital needed, but did not aggressively  take steps to ensure that the firm corrected these weaknesses. In a 2006  letter addressed to the head of the institution\u2019s risk management division,  the examiners reported deficiencies in models used to estimate credit risk,  including lack of testing, a lack of review of the assumptions used in the  models, and concerns about the independence of staff testing the models.  The regulator issued a letter requiring management to address these  weaknesses, but continued to allow the institution to use the models and  did not change its overall assessment. Although the institution showed  improvement in its processes, over time, in late 2007, examiners found that  some of the weaknesses persisted. In late 2008, examiners closed the  matter in a letter to management but continued to note concerns about  internal controls associated with risk management.", "A horizontal review of credit risk models by the Federal Reserve and OCC  in 2008 found a similar lack of controls surrounding model validation  practices for assessing credit risks, leading to questions about the ability  of large, complex institutions to understand and manage these risks and  provide adequate capital to cushion against potential losses. For example,  the review found that some institutions lacked requirements for model  testing, clearly defined roles and responsibilities for testing, adequate  detail for the scope or frequency of validation, and a specific process for  correcting problems identified during validation.", "Before the crisis, another regulator found that an institution\u2019s model  control group did not keep a complete inventory of its models and did not  have an audit trail for models prior to 2000. The examiners said that they  did not find these issues to be significant concerns. However, they were  subsequently criticized for not aggressively requiring another institution to  take action on weaknesses they had identified that were related to risk  models, including lack of timely review, understaffing, lack of  independence of risk managers, and an inability or unwillingness to update  models to reflect the changing environment.", "Other regulators noted concerns about pricing models for illiquid  instruments, but made these findings only as the crisis was unfolding. For  example, in a 2007 horizontal review of 10 broker-dealers\u2019 exposure to  subprime mortgage-related products, SEC and FINRA examiners found  weaknesses in pricing assumptions in valuation models for complex  financial products. They found that several of these firms relied on  outdated pricing information or traders\u2019 valuations for complex financial  transactions, such as CDOs. In some cases, firms could not demonstrate  that they had assessed the reasonableness of prices for CDOs. Another  regulator noted in a 2007 targeted examination that although management  had stated that the risk of loss exposure from highly rated CDOs was  remote, the downturn in the subprime mortgage market could mean that  they would not perform as well as similarly rated instruments performed  historically."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Regulators Found That None of the Institutions We Reviewed Had Tested for the Effects of a Severe Economic Downturn Scenario", "paragraphs": ["Because of the inherent limitations of modeling, such as the accuracy of  model assumptions, financial institutions also use stress tests to determine  how much capital and liquidity might be needed to absorb losses in the  event of a large shock to the system or a significant underestimation of the  probability of large losses. According to the Basel Committee on Banking  Supervision, institutions should test not only for events that could lower  their profitability, but also for rare but extreme scenarios that could  threaten their solvency. In its January 2009 report, the Basel Committee  emphasized the importance of stress testing, noting that it could (1) alert  senior management to adverse unexpected losses, (2) provide forward- looking assessments of risk, (3) support enterprisewide communication  about the firm\u2019s risk tolerance, (4) support capital and liquidity planning  procedures, and (5) facilitate the development of risk mitigation or  contingency plans across a range of stressed conditions. Moreover, the  report noted that stress testing was particularly important after long  periods of relative economic and financial calm when companies might  become complacent and begin underpricing risk.", "We found that regulators had identified numerous weaknesses in stress  testing at large institutions before the financial crisis. However, our limited  review did not identify any instances in which an institution\u2019s lack of  worst-case scenario testing prompted regulators to push forcefully for  institutional actions to better understand and manage risks. A 2006  Federal Reserve horizontal review of stress testing practices at several  large, complex banking institutions revealed that none of the institutions  had an integrated stress testing program that incorporated all major  financial risks enterprisewide, nor did they test for scenarios that would  render them insolvent.. The review found that institutions were stress  testing the impact of adverse events on individual products and business  lines rather than on the institution as a whole. By testing the response of  only part of the institution\u2019s portfolio to a stress such as declining home  prices, the institution could not see the effect of such a risk on other parts  of its portfolio that could also be affected. The review was particularly  critical of institutions\u2019 inability to quantify the extent to which credit  exposure to counterparties might increase in the event of a stressed  market risk movement. It stated that institutions relied on \u201cintuition\u201d to  determine their vulnerability to this type of risk. It also found that  institutions\u2019 senior managers were confident in their current practices and  questioned the need for additional stress testing, particularly for worst- case scenarios that they thought were implausible..", "The 2006 review included some recommendations for examiners to  address with individual institutions, and Federal Reserve officials told us  that they met with institutions\u2019 chief risk officers to discuss the  seriousness of the findings just before the crisis began. However, officials  told us that the purpose of the review was primarily to facilitate the  regulator\u2019s understanding of the full range of stress testing practices, as  there was neither a well-developed set of best practices nor supervisory  guidance in this area at the time. The regulatory officials also told us that  these findings were used to inform guidance issued by the President\u2019s  Working Group on assessing exposure from private pools of capital,  including hedge funds. However, this guidance focuses on testing the  exposure to counterparty risks, such as from hedge funds, and not on  testing the impact of solvency-threatening, worst-case scenarios. In  hindsight, officials told us that the current crisis had gone beyond what  they had contemplated for a worst-case scenario, and they said that they  would probably have faced significant resistance had they tried to require  the institutions to do stress tests for scenarios such as downgrades in  counterparties\u2019 credit ratings because such scenarios appeared unlikely.", "Other regulators raised concerns about stress testing at individual  institutions, but we did not find evidence that they had effectively changed  the firms\u2019 stress testing practices. In the materials we reviewed, one  regulator recommended that the institution include worst-case scenarios  in its testing. In a 2005 examination report, examiners noted a concern  about the level of senior management oversight of risk tolerances. This  concern primarily stemmed from lack of documentation, stress testing,  and communication of firm risk tolerances and the extent to which these  were reflected in stress tests. While the firm later took steps to document  formal risk tolerances and communicate this throughout the firm, the  recommendation related to stress testing remained open through 2008.", "Another regulator required institutions to show that they conducted stress  tests of the institution\u2019s ability to have enough funding and liquidity in  response to certain events, including a credit downgrade or the inability to  obtain unsecured, short-term financing. In addition, institutions were  required to document that they had contingency plans to respond to these  events. The regulator said that it specifically required institutions to  conduct stress tests such as those based on historical events including the  collapse of Long-Term Capital Management or the stock market decline of  1987.

First, no regulator has a clear  responsibility to look across institutions to identify risks to overall  financial stability. As a result, both banking and securities regulators  continue to assess risk management primarily at an individual institutional  level. Even when regulators perform horizontal examinations across  institutions, they generally do not use the results to identify potential  systemic risks. Although for some period, the Federal Reserve analyzed  financial stability issues for systemically important institutions it  supervises, it did not assess the risks on an integrated basis or identify  many of the issues that just a few months later led to the near failure of  some of these institutions and to severe instability in the overall financial  system. Second, although financial institutions manage risks on an  enterprisewide basis or by business lines that cut across legal entities,  primary bank and functional regulators may oversee risk management at  the level of a legal entity within a holding company. As a result, their view  of risk management is limited or their activities overlap or duplicate those  of other regulators including the holding company regulator."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulators Were Not Looking Across Groups of Institutions to Effectively Identify Risks to Overall Financial Stability", "paragraphs": ["In previous work, we have noted that no single regulator or group of  regulators systematically assesses risks to the financial stability of the  United States by assessing activities across institutions and industry  sectors. In our current analysis of risk management oversight of large,  complex institutions, we found that, for the period of the review (2006- 2008), the regulators had not used effectively a systematic process that  assessed threats that large financial institutions posed to the financial  system or that market events posed to those institutions.", "While the regulators periodically conducted horizontal examinations in  areas such as stress testing, credit risk practices, and risk management for  securitized mortgage products, these efforts did not focus on the stability  of the financial system, nor were they used as a way to assess future  threats to that system. The reports summarizing the results of these  horizontal examinations show that the purpose of these reviews was  primarily to understand the range of industry practices or to compare  institutions rather than to determine whether several institutions were  engaged in similar practices that might have a destabilizing effect on  certain markets and leave the institutions vulnerable to those and other  market changes, and that these conditions ultimately could affect the  stability of the financial system.", "Beginning in 2005 until the summer of 2007, the Federal Reserve made  efforts to implement a systematic review of financial stability issues for  certain large financial institutions it oversees and issued internal reports  called Large Financial Institutions\u2019 Perspectives on Risk. With the  advent of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007, the report was  suspended; however, at a later time the Federal Reserve began to issue  risk committee reports that addressed risks across more institutions.  While we commend the Federal Reserve for making an effort to look  systematically across a group of institutions to evaluate risks to the  broader financial system, the Perspectives of Risk report for the second  half of 2006 issued in April 2007 illustrates some of the shortcomings in the  process. The report reviewed risk areas including credit, market,  operational, and legal and compliance risk but did not provide an  integrated risk analysis that looked across these risk areas\u2014a  shortcoming of risk management systems identified in reviews of the  current crisis. In addition, with hindsight, we can see that the report did  not identify effectively the severity and importance of a number of factors.

The examiner noted that although in hindsight  it was possible to see some risks that the regulators had not addressed, it  was difficult to see the impact of issues they had worked to resolve.", "When asked for examples of how the Federal Reserve had used  supervisory information in conjunction with its role to maintain financial  stability, a Federal Reserve official provided two examples that he  believed illustrated how the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory role had  influenced financial stability before the current financial crisis. First, the  official said that the Federal Reserve had used supervisory information to  improve the resilience of the private sector clearing and settlement  infrastructure after the attacks on the World Trade Center on September  11, 2001. Second, it had worked through the supervisory system to  strengthen the infrastructure for processing certain over-the-counter  derivative transactions. Federal Reserve officials noted that financial  stability is not the sole focus of safety and soundness supervision and that  several mechanisms exist in which regulation plays a significant role with  other areas of the Federal Reserve in assessing and monitoring financial  stability. Federal Reserve regulators indicated that other Federal Reserve  functions often consulted with them and that they provided information to  these functions and contributed to financial stability discussions, working  groups, and decisions both prior to and during the current crisis.", "In October 2008, the Federal Reserve issued new guidance for  consolidated supervision suggesting that in the future the agency would be  more mindful of the impact of market developments on the safety and  soundness of bank holding companies. The new guidance says, for  instance, that the enhanced approach to consolidated supervision  emphasizes several elements that should further the objectives of fostering  financial stability and deterring or managing financial crises and help  make the financial system more resilient. The guidance says that two areas  of primary focus would be:    activities in which the financial institutions play a significant role in  critical or key financial markets that have the potential to transmit a  collective adverse impact across multiple firms and financial markets,  including the related risk management and internal controls for these  activities, and   areas of emerging interest that could have consequences for financial  markets, including, for example, the operational infrastructure that  underpins the credit derivatives market and counterparty credit risk  management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Primary Bank and Functional Regulators May Limit Their Oversight of Risk Management to Specific Legal Entities Such As Depository Institutions or Broker- Dealers", "paragraphs": ["Some regulators have noted that the current practice of assessing risk  management at the level of a depository institution or broker-dealer did  not reflect the way most large, complex institutions manage their risks.  Regulators noted that financial institutions manage some risks  enterprisewide or by business lines that cross legal entity boundaries. The  scope of regulators\u2019 supervisory authorities does not clearly reflect this  reality, however. As set forth in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, various  regulators can have separate responsibilities for individual components of  a large, complex financial institution. In addition, GLBA generally restricts  the focus of holding company examinations to the holding company and  any subsidiary that could have a materially adverse effect on the safety  and soundness of an affiliated bank. OCC examiners told us that it was  difficult for them to assess a bank\u2019s market risk management because OCC  focused on the national bank\u2019s activities, while the financial institution  was managing risk across the bank and the broker-dealer. The examiners  said that in some cases the same traders booked wholesale trades in the  bank and in the broker-dealer and that the same risk governance process  applied to both. Thus, both the primary bank regulator and the functional  regulator were duplicating each other\u2019s supervisory activities. In addition,  if initial transactions were booked in one entity, and transactions designed  to mitigate the risks in that transaction were booked in another legal  entity, neither regulator could fully understand the risks involved. While  effective communication among the functional and primary bank  regulators could address this limitation, securities regulators told us that  they shared information with the Federal Reserve but generally did not  share information with OCC.", "OCC examination materials show that examiners sometimes assessed  risks and risk management by looking at the entire enterprise. In addition,  OCC examiners often met with holding company executives. In previous  work, we noted the likelihood that OCC\u2019s responsibilities and activities as  the national bank regulator overlap with the responsibilities and activities  of the Federal Reserve in its role as the holding company regulator. We  found in this review that this overlap continued to exist; however, we also  continued to observe that OCC and the Federal Reserve share information  and coordinate activities to minimize the burden to the institution.", "Securities regulators face similar challenges in assessing risk management  at broker-dealers. In a number of past reports, we have highlighted the  challenges associated with SEC\u2019s lack of authority over certain broker- dealer affiliates and holding companies. FINRA officials also cited two  examples of limitations on their efforts to oversee risk management within  broker-dealers. First, they noted that FINRA\u2019s regulatory authority  extended only to U.S. broker-dealers and that related transactions  generally are booked in other legal entities. FINRA noted that the riskiest  transactions were usually booked in legal entities located offshore. FINRA  also noted that often inventory positions booked in the U.S. broker-dealer  might hedge the risk in another affiliated legal entities. From time to time,  FINRA has requested that the U.S. broker-dealer move the hedge into the  broker-dealer to reduce the amount of the losses and protect the capital  base of the broker-dealer. An SEC official noted that to take advantage of  certain capital treatment the transaction and the hedge would both need to  be booked in the broker-dealer. Second, FINRA officials noted that their  view was limited because market risk policy is set at the holding company  level.", "In closing, I would like to reiterate a number of central themes that have  appeared often in our recent work. While an institution\u2019s management,  directors, and auditors all have key roles to play in effective corporate  governance, regulators\u2014as outside assessors of the overall adequacy of  the system of risk management\u2014also have an important role in assessing  risk management. The current financial crisis has revealed that many  institutions had not adequately identified, measured, and managed all core  components of sound risk management. We also found that for the limited  number of large, complex institutions we reviewed, the regulators failed to  identify the magnitude of these weaknesses and that when weaknesses  were identified, they generally did not take forceful action to prompt these  institutions to address them. As we have witnessed, the failure of a risk  management system at a single large financial institution can have  implications for the entire financial system.", "Second, while our recent work is based on a limited number of  institutions, examples from the oversight of these institutions highlight the  significant challenges regulators face in assessing risk management  systems at large, complex institutions. While the painful lessons learned  during the past year should bolster market discipline and regulatory  authority in the short term, history has shown that as the memories of this  crisis begin to fade, the hard lessons we have learned are destined to be  repeated unless regulators are vigilant in good times as well as bad.", "Responsible regulation requires that regulators critically assess their  regulatory approaches, especially during good times, to ensure that they  are aware of potential regulatory blind spots. This means constantly  reevaluating regulatory and supervisory approaches and understanding  inherent biases and regulatory assumptions. For example, the regulators  have begun to issue new and revised guidance that reflects the lessons  learned from the current crisis. However, the guidance we have seen tends  to focus on the issues specific to this crisis rather than on broader lessons  learned about the need for more forward-looking assessments and on the  reasons that regulation failed.", "Finally, I would like to briefly discuss how our current regulatory  framework has potentially contributed to some of the regulatory failures  associated with risk management oversight. The current institution-centric  approach has resulted in regulators all too often focusing on the risks of  individual institutions. This has resulted and in regulators looking at how  institutions were managing individual risks, but missing the implications  of the collective strategy that  was premised on the institution\u2019s having  little liquidity risk and adequate capital. Whether the failures of some  institutions ultimately came about because of a failure to manage a  particular risk, such as liquidity or credit risks, these institutions often  lacked some of the basic components of good risk management\u2014for  example, having the board of directors and senior management set the  tone for proper risk management practices across the enterprise. The  regulators were not able to connect the dots, in some cases because of the  fragmented regulatory structure. While regulators promoted the benefits  of enterprisewide risk management, we found that they failed to ensure  that all of the large, complex financial institutions in our review had risk  management systems commensurate with their size and complexity so  that these institutions and their regulators could better understand and  address related risk exposures.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
